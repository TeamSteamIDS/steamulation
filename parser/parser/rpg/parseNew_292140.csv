												After complaints of FFXIII's too linear gameplay, FFXIII-2 seems to be the answer to everyone's cries. In the beginning, you still get some of the ""run to the yellow pointer"" moments, but you can also take on various side-quests from NPCs to either find something or kill a monster. And once the game gets going, depending on what gates you open, you can have your choice of next destination. And you can take a break on minigame quizzes, chocobo racing, or slot machines if you feel inclined to do so.The one complaint I personally have is compared to FFXIII's story (personally I loved it), FFXIII-2 falls a bit short. The time travel trope makes it feel a bit clich√©, and I found Noel to be quite boring in terms of personality and back story. Personal opinion, but even if the story isn't your thing, the game is a lot of fun.In combat, the ATB gauge and paradigm shifts are back so that will feel familiar. But with only two protagonists, the third slot is filled by monsters you tame. With all the tameable monsters out there, you can really customize your party to your needs, and you have to level your monsters up as well. I was a bit annoyed that neither Serah or Noel learned Faith/Bravery/Haste as Synergists so you have to rely completely on monsters to buff you on that front.As for the PC port, the keyboard can be a little awkward with the more complicated constellation puzzles, when the camera gets a little wonky, but it's still possible, if not, frustrating. I've also had the game just close on me once or twice (guessing my laptop was overworked when playing this game for an extended amount of time). Other than that, I have no issues. (Note the DLC doesn't unlock until you beat the story once.)Basically, the game is a load of fun even if the story fell short of expectations. The story isn't bad per se, but it wasn't great either. That said, the gameplay makes up for it. Still working on those final fragments.			"

												TL:DR at the bottom (paragraph).Alright, first things first, the thing everyone wants to know about. Is the port good? Does it provide graphics options like they promised? Well, people got ahead of themselves. They promised they'd patch FFXIII and release FFXIII-2 with resolutions options a couple of other things. Well, they did. We got resolution options, we got shadow resolution, we got AA, and we got jap audio at only half the size of the original. However, what remains is the multithreading issues and underperformance due to the game not making use of all the PC's power. Well, if I sit back with a gamepad the 30fps (since constant 60 fps is probably impossible for most PC builds) becomes tolerable, I suppose, it's still a pain. Graphically, it's an improvement over the first, but that comes with its own problems due to the optimization. Can't imagine playing without a controller, because the fps ain't as bad when looking from a greater distance (assuming you sit back further with a gamepad like me).Let's start with a comparison with FFXIII. You play as Serah, Lightning's sister who you never thought you'd want to play as, and probably still don't after going through this game. Yeah, the characters aren't any better this time around. At least it's less linear, yay! The best comparison for the jump from FFXIII to FFXIII-2 is to the jump between FFX and FFX-2. In FFX, they never gave you the airship to travel around until the last act of the game. In FFX-2 they give it to you right away so you can explore. Here it's much the same. Once you unlock a time period and its corresponding location, you can travel there anytime you like and those locations won't bog you down in a tight corridor nearly as much. Course it still has its fair share of linear paths, it's a FF game after all. Combat is a slightly  more polished, the animations feel for fluent and everything is a tad more responsive. Since Noel and Serah are the main 2 characters you'll ever control, the game allows you to train monsters you've obtained throughout battles to act as the third member of your party. It's actually better than you think since you're always on the lookout for better monsters that have good stats and also have good synergy with Noel and Serah in the respected Paradigms you've created. Last note for this section, the camera seems to control better. I had an issue where it would constantly drag to the left or right depending on the location and direction of movement, but that seems to have been resolved.-----The game's side content consists of replaying areas and travelling to other timelines and areas to collect items or skills required to complete quests from other areas. Basically a fancy way of making you do slightly-more-interesting-than-the-average-fetch-quest type of quest. Sometimes, you'll have to reset entire timezones by ""closing the gate"" resetting all progress you've made (although quests and items collected will be kept). This is largely to repeat ""Live Triggers."" LT is essentially cutscenes where you'll be given prompts to ask or answer questions with 4 different choices. Each one gives you new dialogue and answering them all nets you a reward at the end of each mission depending on how many you answered and how you answered them. Hardly a deciding factor in convincing you to replay missions over and over however, they are required to collect fragments and for certain paradox endings. Fragments are basically the collectables, but also unlock more content and ahem, endings. Fragments are scattered everywhere and WILL require you to repeat areas and do quests to obtain all of them (160 in total). Wow this really sounds like FFX-2 right now, but IMO it's better. It feels like less of a chore and a grind because well, it's more interesting, Not the story though, the story just there, no magic happening here. Snow is still the same meathead, Hope is Hope but older and somehow less interesting (impossible, you might say). Noel is better than Tidus, oh wait, every male MC is better than Tidus, hehe not biased at all. Speaking of which, the game has 9 endings. The 8 other variations aside from the original require you to have done certain things throughout the game as well as having the Paradox Scope I believed it was called to change timelines or whatever. Each other ending is really just extra. But again, the gamer OCD all JRPGs tug on comes into play here. The ending of the DLC, Requiem of the Goddess, apparently contains the true ending, which really just sets up FFXIII-3/Lightning Returns with an extra scene. Speaking of which, there's DLC in here. Though it's mainly just outfits and the actual ""story"" ones are just really shorts battles and stuff. -------SO! Do you want to buy this game. Well, do you like FFXIII? Well, this one has improved gameplay and is less linear. It's also less of a grind, still is, but there's more lore to be uncovered and mini-stories to hear unlike the bland side content of the first game. Do the Live Triggers make this into a Dragon Age/Mass Effect game with lots of multiple outcomes and character relationship? Absoutely not.  Is everything so compelling you'll want to 100% the game? Maybe, maybe not, depends on your connection with the game and where it stands in your mind. Is all that DLC definitely something that adds more value? No, not really. Is this a bad game.......no, I would say it isn't. It is a competent game that learns from the mistakes of the first, keeps a bunch of other stuff the same, and doesn't do a lot of stuff worse. I'm not ashamed to say I enjoyed it, and I'll definitely recognize it as a game allowed to bear the FF name. It's far from terrible, just open up a little to it. If you're a gamer who believes FFVII and FFVIII are the greatest and the rest are terrible then this is not for you. If you enjoyed FFXIII then this is for you. If you're like me and have played multiple FF games and have understood this game isn't the ""cream of the FF crop "" but want to play a AAA JRPG (because wow, there aren't many on Steam), check it out. It's worth its price if you just let go of all that hate, and just play. You'll get mad, you might facepalm or SMH at some of the scenes, you might laugh because something is so stupid, but you'll hopefully have some good ol' fun. I Like This Game. It's A Good Time.			"

Expansive & engrossing // Recommended for those who pine for a return to a more traditional JRPG feel+ Cinematic action sequences+ Much more open-ended play style; not nearly as linear as its predecessor+ Jumping between different locations throughout different time periods offers a refreshing amount of environmental variety+ Plenty of optional boss monsters & side quests to keep the player invested+ Much more replayable than Final Fantasy XIII+ Dialogue trees help the plot to feel a bit more interactive+ Battle system is almost a carbon copy of XIII's; therefore, it is absolutely outstanding+ Monster taming adds refreshing novelty to battle encounters, & is very well-implemented+ Environments are gorgeous and meticulously design, as always+ The game boasts excellent voice acting (occasionaly campy dialogue notwithstanding, but that's hardly the fault of the voice actors)+ Boasts a generally competent story, if a bit convoluted; well-written, but feels slightly divorced from the narrative of the original- Display options are somewhat limited, particularly for users who choose not to play in full-screen mode- Active Time Events (ATE) are used to a moderately heavy degree, & felt both unnecessary and gimmicky; overall an unwelcome addition- Not notably well-optimized; occasional framerate dropsLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												UPDATE 6/11/16: http://lenwolfgamer.tumblr.com/post/145754797907/final-fantasy-xiii-2 I do Tumblr reviews now, here's a more in-depth look at this one.!!!-THIS IS IMPORTANT-!!!If you buy this game, DISABLE STEAM CLOUD SAVES FOR IT! This game and the Steam Cloud don't get along, and it causes the game to occasionally crash when it tries to save. Here's the catch, the game autosaves frequently. This makes crashes more of an annoyance than anything, but also a lot more frequent.If you download this game, make sure to disable Steam Cloud Saves before you play it otherwise it'll constantly‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•up unless you do some deep down work in your game files and move your save file... or start over completely from scratch. Trust me, its worth doing, especially since some of the crashes will take Steam down with it.EDIT: I changed the save settings and played the game for a solid three hours. As of now I have not had any crashes at all. Trust me on this one guys, the save file thing will fix most of the technical issues here.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now then, as for the game itself. In my opinion, this game takes everything that FFXIII did wrong and fixes them. No more scrounging for bits to upgrade your weapons slower than molasses, no more endless tunnel for the first half of the game, the Crystal Talent Tree dealie is a lot easier to use and a lot more fun.Immediate Changes:Gil and Weapons: Weapon upgrades are a thing of the past. You still collect bits, but the bits are used to make entirely new weapons at the shop rather than simply rubbing them all over your current ones. They're also a lot easier to come by. Also, all enemies drop Gil again as they should have done in FFXIII.Open Endedness: In extremely stark contrast to FFXIII's endless corridor first half that got so many gamers up in arms, this time you play Serah and this boy from 700 years in the future named Noel as you go all throughout time and space to unravel the mystery of time paradoxes that are plauging Grand Pulse. You unlock new time periods and locations quickly throughout the game and it feels much more immersive than before.Crystalized Monsters: So... its just Serah and Noel for your party members, but how the hell does that work? Simple. Serah can crystalize and command monsters to fight for her. Remember those bits you'd gather off monsters? You use them to level up the guys you capture! Each monster is locked into a specific role (Cait Sith is always medic for example) but you can have three ready to fight alongside you at a time. In addition, each monster has their own Feral Link attack where you can use a special limit-break-esque trick with them in the middle of a fight.Costumes: Serah and Noel both start out with four costumes; their default outfits and three extra ones, and they unlock more as the game goes on (I assume, I'm not super-far yet). Still, makes it more interesting to look at thats for sure. Your little moogle companion, Mog, also gains about two dozen right from the get go. Want a little demon moogle? How about a cat? Perhaps a living sentient moogle plushie? Why not Zoidberg (give it time, it'll get modded in and you know it)?Outside of that, here's the basic rundown.PROS:- Game feels much more immersive and streamlined than before, also much more engaging right from the start (I went ahead and downloaded the song 'Etro's Champion' off iTunes after hearing it in the opening bits too, so the soundtrack is solid).- If you skipped FFXIII or never finished it then you can watch a 'Beginner's Guide' that tells the highlights of the FFXIII story and what happened through it. It's split up into chapters too so you can skip the bits you already saw if you like.- No more scraping together Gil for weapon upgrades. All the monsters drop money now and the weapons are sold pre-made, though you can save up bits and buy custom weapons with special effects (and reduced pricetags since you supplied the parts).- The Crystal Tree (Crystalium, Crystalum, Crystalvalium, whatever) is a lot easier to use now and takes a lot less grinding to get the most out of it.CONS:- BEWARE CRASHES! Like I said above, disable Steam Cloud Saves for this title. Trust me on this one, its not worth it. The game can and will crash AND burn and take Steam down with it nine times out of ten.- Graphics issues may be an issue for some. Personally I'm fine, no issues with framerate or anything, but I know that was a major issue with FFXIII. This game is gorgeous, but it'll make your graphics card sweat it's little electronic balls off.Potential Cons:- Combat system is more or less the same as FFXIII. If you didn't like it in that game, you won't like it here. Not an issue for me, but I know some people complained about the way combat worked in the last game.- Read the Beginner's Guide if you didn't play FFXIII. The game picks up three years after the ending of the last one, so if you didn't play it or didn't finish it (I don't blame you, I liked it but even I'll admit it dragged like hell for a while) then you'll be lost unless you do that.Overall:I honestly feel like this is the kind of game that FFXIII should have been. It takes what that game did right and improves on it, while fixing most if not all of the problems from it. If you have the money, give it a whirl. Even if you skipped FFXIII entirely it's worth trying.			"

												Omfg this game. Pros:Killer soundtrack, only OST I ever listen to outside of the game.Likeable characters (imo, so don't hold me too it).Storyline.Refined Battle system that works a little better than the first game.The option to save ANYWHERE in the game is a huge improvement from the first.Cons:You need a good PC for decent framerates in boss battles or they're gonna be a pain.Story can be hard to get into if you haven't played the first game. But there is a beginner's primer in the main menu so you can get up to speed.Port isn't the best out there. Still decent thoughLove this game. Still playing it. So happy it was on sale too for winter sale~			"

Final Fantasy XIII-2 fixes almost all of the issues fans had with XIII while also adding its own new flavour to the game.Final Fantasy XIII-2 is practically free of the issues that people generally have with XIII, meaning that if you didn't like the original game, there just might be a chance that XIII-2 could still be for you. The game is not linear, the combat system is (slightly) improved, and the game introduces multiple new systems and features, such as Paradigm Pack, traveling through different time periods, multiple unlockable endings, and throwing Moogles around to your heart's content. Traditional world map system is replaced with Historia Crux, a series of connected time gates you can use to access different areas and visit them in different time periods. While the game does re-use multiple areas, most of them feel relatively fresh thanks to visiting them in different time periods. Completionists might also be glad to hear that it is possible to close and reopen these time gates, which allows you to redo any part of the game again after finishing it, meaning that there's no missable content. I found the whole time travel thing a fairly solid system, kind of similar to what Chrono Trigger had.Paradigm battle system is still around, but this time they have introduced some new mechanics, such as Paradigm Pack, which is a system that allows you to capture different monsters you encounter and use them as your third party member. It's kind of like Pokemon, and there's even a fragment that rewards you for catching them all. It is a nice addition to the game as it's adds an extra layer of customization to your party. One other improvement the combat system received was an ability to change your party leader during fights, which I very much welcomed. The difficulty of the game though, compared to FFXIII, was bit low for my taste, but this is partly redeemed by the Coliseum DLC (included with the PC version).The story continues from where Final Fantasy XIII left, except that there's a twist, Lightning is gone. I won't spoil any plot detail,s but I'll give you a brief and vague synopsis of the beginning. If you don't care, feel free to skip this paragraph. The game starts when this guy called Noel (who is from the future) arrives to New Bodhum, meets Serah (Lightning's sister from the original game), and together they set to search Lightning through these time gates, which nobody really knows how they appeared in the first place. (Of course, all this gets explained later and my synopsis is terrible anyway). Of course, this is a Final Fantasy game, and naturally later down the road you find yourself trying to save the world from the villain, who, I must add, is one of the best villains Final Fantasy games have ever had. The story did feel very vague and not particularly interesting in my opinion during the first four chapters (which there is six), but it improves once you reach the fifth chapter.Characterwise Serah and Noel are both decent enough main characters. I didn't find neither of them particularly interesting, but they did the job. At least Serah is, in my opinion, much better main character than Lighting was, whom I simply found incredibly dull. However, one character that really stands out is Caius Ballad, the main villain of the game. Once the story develops, it becomes evident that he actually has a very clear and understandable motive for what he is doing, and for a villain, he actually ends up being really likeable. I didn't personally like the soundtrack of the game very much, but stuff like this is very very subjective, and it seems that there is a great deal of people who really do enjoy it, so your opinion might vary. I'll just say that the game uses lots of vocal tracks, some of which I found actually pretty good, but they just didn't work as background music of a video game very well, in my opinion. Japanese ending song, Yakusoku no Basho, is really good though, and so probably is the English one as it's the same song with different arrangement and singer. One more thing I'd like to point out about the audio side of things is that I didn't really like the sound balance. The sound effects were too loud and background music bit too quiet for my preferences. This of course would not be a problem if the game had audio options, but sadly it doesn't.Unlike FFXIII, XIII-2 has tons of side quests and content you can do, most of which is quite good (damn it all those Oerba puzzles and Academia quizzes...). The PC version also comes with all the DLC (aside from few costumes). Coliseum DLC has series of very difficult battles against few classic Final Fantasy bosses (there's even Ultros!), which offers you a nice end game challenge after you have beaten the base game. Lightning's DLC is kind of a prologue to the sequel Lightning Returns, and then there's Sazh's DLC, which I sadly found to be a waste of time.Okay, a summary: Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a solid entry to Final Fantasy series. It has some flaws, but overall it's a good game. However, it's definitely not the best Final Fantasy out there, nor is it a good introduction to the series. If you are looking to get into Final Fantasy games and happened to see this in Steam, I'd recommend to start with, say, Final Fantasy IX, VII, or even V or VI first. Still, it's a good game, and I do recommend it if you like JRPGs in general and do want to give newer Final Fantasies a bash. The story is also relatively standalone, so you can play it even if you haven't played Final Fantasy XIII and don't feel like playing that first.One more thing. I said nothing about the PC port because at this point probably everyone knows that it's, well, not very good, and there's tons of other reviews that do that already. If you do happen to for some obscure reason care what I have to say about it, you can check my Final Fantasy XIII review, where I rambled about it somewhat extensively. It's not the same game of course, but the port is almost identical, except that it somehow runs still bit worse than XIII did.			"

												We all know that the hugely popular Final Fantasy RPG series has had more than its fair share of games, but rarely do we witness direct sequels. As one of those rare games, Final Fantasy XIII-2 takes place directly after the events of Final Fantasy XIII; Lightning vanishes without a trace and only Serah can remember seeing Lightning, while the others believe she is dead.Trapped in Valhalla, a world where time does not flow, Lightning finds herself under attack by a mysterious warrior named Caius. Knowing the future is in danger, Lightning calls on Noel to find Serah and deliver a message that she must save the future. As the story progresses, Serah and Noel work together to travel through time to restore a broken timeline and determine Caius‚Äôs true intentions.Much like every other Final Fantasy game, the storyline is vital to your enjoyment. Similar to Final Fantasy XIII, the sequel suffers from a problem with pacing: in the beginning, many players might get lost in the confusion of time travel and easily lose sight of what's actually occurring in the story. Fear not: this confusion is short-lived.Once the game progresses further, it becomes clear that although the story is shorter than XIII ‚Äî story completion clocks in at around 20 hours ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt rushed. 100% completion can take around 30-40 hours. Details and events begin to piece together revealing more about Serah and Noel‚Äôs world and various other characters. While it might take a while to warm up to most players, the story is incredibly well written with the slight caveat that the ending might not be what most expect. To avoid spoilers, it‚Äôs difficult to explain why this is the case; however, it should be known that there is advancement via DLC and another sequel, which we should see on Steam in the coming months.Throughout the game, you‚Äôll only control Serah or Noel in terms of playable characters unlike the six different playable characters in its predecessor. To make up for this shortcoming, you now have the ability to tame the various monsters you battle throughout your adventure and have them fight alongside you. Up to three can be assigned to your party, but only one can be active in battle at a time.Different monsters have different roles and will level up differently. Even more advanced is the incredibly complicated infusion system where you can imbue the passive abilities and skills of one monster into another. These features make for a rich and compelling reason to not only fight monsters along the way but also add a higher level of strategy to battle. Oh, and you can also dress up your monsters with a plethora of different styles of decorations such as hats or tattoos. Of course.When it comes to leveling up Serah and Noel, the newly designed crystarium system is less straightforward than the previous title but offers a higher degree of control over your character's final stats. Instead of each role containing its own cluster of nodes, there's one giant cluster in which you can choose whichever role you want to level up at any time ‚Äî as long as you have enough crystarium points, that is, which you earn from completing quests and killing monsters.In the cluster, there are three types of nodes: small, large and ability. The large nodes will give stat bonuses depending on which role you happen to level up on that node. For example, if you choose to level up your Ravenger (magic attacks) ability on a large node, you might obtain a +6 magic boost whereas if you chose Commando (physical attacks) you might obtain +6 strength instead. Since the amount of large nodes is limited, carefully planning out each character can have huge benefits compared to just randomly choosing which to improve. Once one cycle of the cluster repeats, you have the option to select a bonus, new skill role, bonus accessory points or an additional ATB gauge; the gauge then resets, allowing you to fill it once again.While this all sounds complicated, there isn‚Äôt as big a penalty as it might sound for the player who doesn‚Äôt feel like planning out all his or her levels. It will reduce the player‚Äôs potential, but still allow them to do any task in the game that an optimised character can do, albeit with a higher degree of difficulty. All this complexity doesn‚Äôt come without penalty: unlike its predecessor, weapons and accessories cannot be upgraded, a shame as XIII's upgrade system was fairly unique and interesting.Not in the mood to slay C‚Äôeith? Take your chances betting on or racing your own Chocobo. Race results got you down? Relax and put a few coins in the slot machine and try for the jackpot. One of the huge differences between XIII and XIII-2 is the degree of freedom: whereas XIII's progression was pretty limited to where the story took you, here the journey is much more open. If a particular area gets dull or too difficult, it's possible to return to the Historia Crux and select a different time period to explore. The further you get in each area the more fragments and artifacts you‚Äôll collect; artifacts are used to unlock new areas or progress the story in some situations. The collection of mini games and side puzzles offer nice changes in the dark story even though they can be difficult at times.For those new to the series, it‚Äôs strongly recommended that you play the first title before diving into XIII-2 as the game expects players to already be familiar with the battle system and storyline.The soundtrack features more vocal tracks than just about any other Final Fantasy game to date and offers some remarkable tracks throughout the story. From massive orchestral tracks to death metal, the variation in style should give everyone something to like. Some of the songs accompany the story so well that to take them out would in fact diminish a lot of the emotion portrayed in the event.Square-Enix did a much better job with the port of this game then they did with XIII. All of the bells and whistles you'd expect as far as graphics options are concerned are there in the game's launcher. This is something they went back and added to XIII recently. Overall, Final Fantasy XIII-2 offers a lot of gameplay and a great addition to the XIII plot. XIII-2 is probably the best game in the trilogy. Even though the graphics weren‚Äôt revolutionary like XIII‚Äôs and the slight pacing issue still remains, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is very good. Anyone who played and enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII owes it to themselves to pick this up and continue the story of Serah and Lightning.Highly Recommended "

												So I am going to review the actual game instead of the graphics... The world feels much less linear this time around, and there are NPCs you can talk to and get quests from. It certainly adds to the atmosphere and makes the game much more enjoyable. Exploring is also fun. The combat was also improved and while you only have 2 main characters at all times, you can tame enemy monsters and use them as a third party member. If you liked the first game, you will most likely this one even more. If you did not like the first game, it improves on many negatives of the first one, but it keeps the same concept, so the decision is up to you.			"

Update 12/22/2014:Square released a patch today which actually removed some DLC from the game. The performance remains unchanged.Original review:Buyer beware.The resolution selection does nothing but change the window size while the game is still rendered in 1280x720, making everything blurry unless you have a monitor running natively at 720p (which few modern computer users do). The framerate jumps wildly from 60 to well under 15 almost arbitrarily.The problem lies in the fact that both FFXIII and FFXIII-2 for PC are NOT multi-threaded applications when virtually 99% of software written today is. This is an artifact from when Square ported these two games over from the Playstation 3, which had an extremely complicated and poorly designed CPU architecture. To minimize writing code (perhaps due to time constraints or inexperience, or both), Square decided to throw the entire game on a single thread.Regardless, specs don't matter in this case. You could try running this game on a 486 or Cray Supercomputer and you would probably achieve the same results. Kidding aside, this port is VERY poorly optimized.			"

												I have this game on xbox and decided to get it on PC to replay and relive this game. It was definately worth getting.It really is an exceptional game, and the pc experience makes it better too. The controls arent as difficult for the keyboard as I thought they would be. Square Enix delivered on that one. The cutscenes run smoothly and the graphics are amazing, and the soundtrack is just simply beautiful.The story line is great and the sidemissions are well thought out and make you think a lot, and it makes you want to keep playing for hoursI really love the whole final fantasy series and the characters in this game were really good and had good backstories - Especially Noel, Caius and Yeul.I definately reccomend this game for anyone who loves an RPG with amazing characters, plot and graphics, not to mention an outstanding soundtrack to go along with it ^__^			"

												I'm convinced this game is a work of satire. The plot is so contrived you stop halfway and realize that Square is just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing with you.Here's an example: there's a machine in the past that kills its creator and creates a future filled with robots. What caused it to kill its creators? Itself in the future corrupted the machine in the past to kill its creators. Why? Because if it didn't force the machine to kill its creators in the past it wouldn't exist in the future as the sole controller of the world. The Machine came from a future that didn't exist so that it could continue existing and create that future. Someone wrote that and thought it wasn't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing stupid and self-contradictory. The game deals with time-travel and 'paradoxes', and god damn does it‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on the time-travel concept with so much confusion it can only be considered a work of satire. There's also something about a girl who has a title passed down the ages, only that each girl who gets the title looks exactly the same as the previous one. Hey, at least it explains why the protagonists at the end of FFXIII didn't turn to crystal after completing their focus. But holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•does it fill the explenation (which is quite simple) with a ton of confusion.Dumbass plot aside, the game is a huge step up from FFXIII. Sure, it obviously didn't have the same budget as FFXIII, which becomes REALLY obvious when you 'unlock' the same map over 4 times with minor alterations (dark, daytime,‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•filter,‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•filter but with red orbs around the map). Assets from the previous game are also reused, like Oerba village and a ton of music from the previous game. But even though this is essentially FFXIII 1.5 it still winds up being miles better and more enjoyable. Two reasons for that:1.) Exploration. The Historia Crux is basically a glorified menu where you select what location to go to. When you go to a location, you'll have two tasks: find artefacts and fragments in the map and talk to people to take up tasks to receive artefacts and fragments. Each map has either 1 gate or more which are unlocked with artefacts, while fragments give you documents to read (if you dont care about the game world then tough‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Unlocking a gate unlocks another location to travel to in the Historia Crux. Here's the good thing, though: the artefact required to unlock that gate might not even be in that map. It might be in a different map which is unlocked in the story or through a gate in a different map. For example. a woman wants to find her glasses, but its dark in the gameworld due to an eclipse so you won't be able to get them. You WILL be able to get her glasses when you unlock the alternate version of that map where an eclipse ISN'T occuring. Get her glasses there, then go back to where there's an eclipse and give her her glasses. In the Historia Crux you'll see how many fragments are in each map and how many gates there are. So you'll be skipping from map to map to map collecting artefacts and fragments and going back to previous maps to fulfil requests. Dude wants some sort of PC equipment? You get it in some tech facility in a different map. If it sounds like you'll have to keep up and make note of everything, don't. The best thing to do, really, is to take up requests when you can and just collect all fragments in a map, which come in boxes. Hell, I collected all fragments I could before finishing up chapter 5, and then proceeded to finish it and already had the fragments needed to proceed, which I didn't know I would need. If the idea of exploring maps for items and jumping from area to area is appealing, you'll love this.2.) CustomizationYour third party member is a monster, the same ones you fight in battle. After battle there's a chance you'll ''collect'' one of the monsters you killed. Once collected,  you level him up in the crystarium just as you would level up. It gets a little difficult levelling up monsters at later levels since the materials needed are scarcer, but not all monsters reach their peak that late. Some do so much earlier, and you can sacrifice them to pass on skills to other monsters. The customization and levelling in your third partner presents a level up system that is more in-depth than even the main cast. and that's about it. It's not hard to be a better game than FFXIII, and this game isn't outstanding since it really plays more like a side-game. Like a handheld title in a series that frequently appears on consoles. It's not the typical Final Fantasy experience in that its production values aren't as high. Like I said, this is like FFXIII 1.5. But that's not a bad thing. The game manages to be an enjoyable modern day FF title and an all-around good waste of time. They should've fixed up the ridiculous plot and put the money they put into FFXIII into this one.			"

 Graphics	Few games have managed to capture my eye as well as Final Fantasy 13-2 did. Everything in this world looks gorgeous. I often found myself just standing still and looking at the scenery in each area. The effects are also fantastic and that is especially obvious during combat. Music As a standard for the series, the soundtrack is fantastic.  Masashi Hamauzu, Naoshi Mizuta, and Mitsuto Suzuki have managed to blend orchestral music with techno and dubstep and while that may seem like a  recipe for disaster, it's actually glorious. Every track is unique and memorable and the tone of each track perfectly fits the mood of the area or scene it is played at. Story The story of the game is mostly hit or miss. Some people like it while others think it's needlessly complex. I for one consider this one of the best stories the series has ever had. I never found myself wondering what's going on. Everything, from world events to character motivations, was clear to me from the moment they were revealed. The main objective of the characters, the world mythos and the antagonist's plan are clear.It basically revolves around Serah, the younger sister of the previous game's protagonist, and Noel, a time traveller who arrives at Serah's time to warn her of a dire future.The game picks up 3 years after the events of the previous game. In the prologue we see Lightning fighting a mysterious enemy named Caius, in a realm called Valhalla, to protect the godess Etro, the one who was revealed in the previous game that liberated the l'cie from their cursed brands. Lightning sees Noel emerging from a time gate and asks of him to seek out her sister Serah and gives him a mission which will be revealed later. She assigns a moogle that can turn into a bow, named Mog, to give to Serah, then opens another game for him and proceeds to engage Caius in combat once again, allowing Noel to escape. Later we see a meteor falling in the village of New Bodhum, one of the many human settlements built around the pillar of the crystalised Cocoon, where Serah resides along with the NORA gang, also from the previous game. Soon after, monsters attack and Noel appears just in time to help Serah, giving her the bow to protect herself.After the fight, he reveals to Serah and the NORA members that Lightning told him of weird distortions in time, called Paradoxes, taking place and that these distortions would soon lead to the destruction of the world. He said that Lightning needs Serah to solve these paradoxes in order for her to protect the godess in Valhalla, without specifying how one leads to the other. Noel then reveals that the meteor is a time gate through which the duo, accompanied now by Mog, can travel through time using the Historia Crux, the crossroads of time. In their journey they will learn about Lightning's true mission, the motivation of this mysterious Caius and his connection to Noel and the godess Etro and the reason time is distorted. Along the way they'll meet previous characters like Snow, Hope, Fang and Vanille and new characters, all with their own missions and objectives.There's also a time travelling character, named Chocolina, who is the main vendor of weapons, items and materials in the game. She's basically a merchant who doubles as comic relief.This is a very well written story overall and I enjoyed every second of it. Gameplay The gameplay is downright flawless this time around.‚Ä¢For the combat, the game uses and expands upon the previous game's battle system, the paradigm system.The paradigm system utilizes the ATB aspect of previous titles in the series but allows you to use multiple commands. ‚Ä¢Each character has access to every role and it's up to the player to switch between roles during battle. The player controls only one character during battle, the leader, but you can swap leaders mid-fight, enabling some interesting strategies. There's also an auto-battle command which will automatically select which abilities the character you control will use, depending on their role and the situation they're in. New to this system is the option to choose whether you want your characters to focus on a single target or utilize multi-target spells when using the auto-battle command, allowing for more freedom and customisation. As a result, the battles are faster but strategy is essential to defeat the tougher enemies in the game.There are 6 roles available for combat. Commando (DPS), Ravager (Mage), Synergist (Buff), Saboteur (Debuff), Medic (Healer) and Sentinel (Tank)‚Ä¢The character progression utilizes the Crystarium system of FF 13 but expands upon it. Each crystarium stage consists of a linear set of nodes, some small and some large. The player chooses which role to level up by using Crystarium Points (CP) and the available node in the Crystarium stage. Small nodes will offer general stat boosts but large nodes will offer large boosts according to the role you chose to upgrade. For example, using a large node to level up the commando role will give a large Attack power boost etc. This allows for a lot of customisation but caution is obligatory since you can essentially lock a character out of certain stat boosts depending on how you use the large nodes, leaving them under-developed as a result.‚Ä¢There are 2 playable characters and 3 slots for recruitable monsters. The monsters start off weaker than the characters but you can upgrade them using monster materials which work like CP works for the main characters. Later on you will learn about monster infusion and hidden monster abilities, which will allow you to infuse monsters with other monsters, giving them their abilities and allowing you to create the ultimate monster. This is by far the best feature in the game because it allow total freedom in how you want to develop your monsters and the results are always satisfying.‚Ä¢New to the series is the accessory capacity. Serah and Noel can equip accessories to boost their stats and gain resistances to certain elements or debuffs. However, unlike the previous game, accessories now take up an amount of ""space"" on a character. This means that if, for example, an item takes up 60 points of capacity but Serah only has 20 available, she can't equip it. The capacity of each character starts of low but can increase as you level up using CP and completing crystarium stages. It caps at 100. In order to use all 4 equipment slots, you will need to customise the items you have  in the shop to make them smaller but weaker or just use them as is and carry less. Sometimes it's preferred to use 4 smaller items than 2 or 3 bigger ones but this depends on the player. Content The main story isn't the focus of the game. You'll find yourself spending more time doing side-quests this time around. Each location has available side-quests for you to complete in order to gain CP, items or fragments which are basically the most important collectible in the game and can be used to unlock special abilities later in the game. Certain areas consist entirely of side-quests and can be unlocked using Wild Artefacts (used to open optional time gates) and have their own side-plot. There's also various mini puzzles to complete and a casino area in which you can use slot machines, assign tamed chocobos in races for items and money, unlock special abilities using Fragments and later on play Poker and a fun game called chrono bind.In addition to that, there's a ton of optional bosses and after the final boss, you will be able to replay missions and fight tougher versions of old bosses to unlock alternative ""paradox"" endings.You might also find monster infusion fun depending on how much you enjoy customisation and item farming. Grinding isn't required but it's recommended. Overall this game is a unique, mastefuly designed experience and I definitely recommend it to everyone. 10/10  "

												I love this game, despite what others say I love all three parts of 13 - however, I was highly disappointed with the pc version of this game. The specs on my computer far exceed the recommended and yet the performance is worse than poor and the low fps (especially on boss battles that can last a while) is nothing if not frustrating. Having bought this nearly a month after the Steam release and bearing in mind all the comments on the poor performance of the game, it is very disappointing that there has been no fix for this yet.In short, it doesn't matter if you have the pc, it still won't run smoothly. Please fix this soon! I would recommend this game to anyone AFTER a fix has been released.			"

												*NOT A FULL REVIEW - ONLY COVERING GRAPHICS OPTIONS*For those that have played or know about the FF13 port, rest assured. This game ( along with a patch that came out with FF13 ) has graphics options.The following are the graphics options in the game:Resolution - You can set this to your native res. If you're running Nvidia's DSR or AMD's VSR, you can select a higher res if you have that enabled. I have AMD's VSR enabled and am able to choose 1800p ( 3200x1800 )Shadow resolution - This setting goes from 512x512 to 8192x8192 ( !! )Anti-aliasing (MSAA) - This setting goes from x2 to x16Sound Settings - Japanese or EnglishThat's all the graphics options. It's not much, but it's a vast improvement over the initial release of FF13.Now, on to FPS - Unfortunately, it looks like the HUD is still causing the FPS to drop to 30 like in FF13, meaning battles still drop from 60 to 30. I'm hoping they will fix this, but for now I just play through it like I did with FF13.			"

												Replace Bill and Ted with a magical girl and a Kingdom Hearts reject, then task them with fixing the future. George Carlin is dead, so he's played by a Moogle. Spoilers: they screw it up so bad and it's hilarious to play through.This game is basically what happens when you task a team who aren't convinced RPGs need to be a super-serious endeavor with making a time-travel themed game. There are tiny bookends of ""serious story"" because it's still a sequel to FFXIII, but this is a game where one character's fiancee has turned himself into a living weapon so he could jump in a wormhole to fight a massive tomato to a standstill for ??? years before you show up. IT AIN'T WAR & PEACE.Mechanics-wise, it's improved damn near every facet of XIII, the battles feel more snappy and the strategy is tight, monster-breeding* is a neat way to handle the third character slot, and in sort of a drastic inverse of XIII, you're basically entirely freeform in how you approach the timeline in this game SAVE FOR ONE TERRIBLE, LINEAR CHAPTER. But that's like... one out of six. It'll be okay.I cannot recommend this enough. It's fun to play and I laughed at some of the utterly ludicrous ways they take the time travel conceit, especially in terms of sidequests, or the bonus chapters which were DLC on the console and come free here (involving Snow, Sazh, and Lightning, respectively). Buy this game and then just TRY to argue that it's not a parody by the time you're through. This is Chrono Trigger on LSD.* Technically you do not ""breed"" monsters so much as you ""feed the ones you can't stand to your favorites to make them strong"".			"

One of the worst PC port jobs EVER, in any time paradox, of an acceptable Final Fantasy game that absolutely has its moments, in between various problems.Pros:  The same excellent ATB (Active Time Battle) system from the previous game, this time fully featured right from the start of the game instead of slowly fleshing it out over the course of 15 hours like in the first XIII.  In battles, instead of a third party member you instead use tamed monsters that can level up and be infused with powers from other monsters.  Very pokemon, must catch them all.  Or just get a chocobo and use it exclusively, like me <3  Complete freedom in when and how to progress the main story, and what times and places to visit.  Almost overwhelming nonlinearity if you're used to XIII.  Seeing how paradoxes affect the history, then resolving them and seeing how that changes the timeline and sometimes creating new paradoxes feels pretty cool.  At times, pretty dark stuff in the story.  Feels were had, no spoilers.  Passable english voice acting.  Hey, you all know how rare it is for it not be dog awful, let me put this as a positive! :)  Good amount of 'work' for completionists.  Hunt all the things, tame them, map the places, unlock all the fragments.  Definitely enough to keep you busy for a while, and then there's more challenging encounters to try as well.  Phenomenal art and sound direction.  This is a gorgeous looking game despite being 6 years old already. Some of the music might not hit home depending on personal tastes but there was also some really captivating tracks.Cons:  The WORST port job I've ever seen.  This game makes Batman: Arkham Knight look like a decent port.  If you try playing this game with the specs listed as recommended on the store page expect frequent dips to 15 fps or lower.  Game runs on a single CPU core, while barely working your GPU.  The only way you're going to see acceptable framerates on this game is with a very high clock speed CPU (4.5ghz or higher at least).  I see frequent dips below 30 on my i7 core quad @3.4ghz with hyperthreading disabled and slight overclocking.  Doesn't matter if I play at 720p or 4k resolution.  No volume sliders, at all. Really?  Overall weak game story that didn't grab me at all or really go anywhere, once the starting plotline was established.  Complete lack of character development, lots of mystery solving through time.  Aggravating ending, without spoiling anything, that follows into DLC stuff afterwards in a way that makes NO sense at all.  There's a lot of great music in this game including many revisits from the first XIII, but also a number of really whack and completely misplaced tracks, going from slow jpop ballads to black metal choboco songs at the drop of a beat.  Its jarring, at times.  Its easy to get 'lost'.  In my 60 hour ish playthrough I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say I spent at least 5 hours running around aimlessly wondering what to do.  Side quests are often extremely vague in how to solve them, and even the main quests can be difficult to follow at times.  While tamed monsters are fun to use in battles I still prefer how they did it in the first game.  It does get stale having Serah and Noel fixed as two of three party members at all times.  Tamed monsters have a 'feral link' charged ability that replaces Eidolons from the first game, but they are typically very underwhelming and mainly used to finish off untamed enemies to increase the chance of catching them.  Lots of abilities are also unexplicably gone from the first game as learnable skills for Serah and Noel.  All fights are randomly spawning encounters instead of enemies wandering around in the game world.  Enemies teleport right into your near proximity, giving you a chance to strike first for a haste buff and bonus stagger, but just as often combat starts instantly because the monster spawned literally in your face as you were walking somewhere, giving you zero chance to react.  In some areas the encounter chances are absurdly high, rarely letting you take more than 5 steps between fights.Pro and Con:  The Steam version includes some DLC without extra cost, which is nice.  What is not so nice is that there is a good chunk of DLC on the console versions that is not available in the PC version at all.  I HATE when publishers do this.  Some of the missing DLC fills in some plot holes in the story, as well.Despite the long list of issues I have with this game, I've still had an overall good time playing it.  I really liked XIII, and XIII-2 gave me some of the continuation I've been craving.  If you were a fan of XIII (Hey, we exist! Don't judge!), you are probably going to get some value out of this game as well.I really like the dynamic and fluid style of battle in the XIII games and I enjoyed returning to it, a good while after I initially played XIII on my PS3.  It is strangely satisfying to watch your characters and monsters get gradually stronger over the course of the game, as well as hunting monsters to tame and figuring out what to do with them.Bad port, not a bad game.  I do cautiously recommend, but perhaps get it for your console instead of Steam if at all possible.  If you do play it on PC, I strongly recommend using your GPU drivers or 3rd party app to cap your framerate to 30 to avoid the wild fluctuations, it does suck but at least you won't get sick.  I also recommend playing with a controller, if you have one.  And if you haven't played XIII yet, definitely start there before you pick this one up.Also important: If you don't turn off Steam Cloud Saving for this game you can expect extreme load times and having the game crash to desktop.In closing I want to have it pointed out that a lot of the negative reviews on Steam for this game seems to be because of crash issues, which I'm sure could have resolved in the majority of the cases if they disabled the abovementioned cloud sync.  I'm NOT making excuses for the horrid port quality here, but the game should at least run without crashing for most players.			"

												This game isn't a masterpiece.. But it is still fantastic. More open, good story, unique soundtrack, and amazing gameplay make this game great. A huge improvement on XIII and the whole feel of the game is much more loose and open while still having a good story. I don't understand all the people who give this game crap. I understand you want final fantasy to be like it used to be but you can't just let that cloud your minds from seeing when square has put out yet another great game. You won't find this game as one of the final fantasy classics, but this game is still very good and shows squares determination to make the game that the fans want to play.Battle SystemThe battle system of FF XIII-2 returns in a familiar yet more improved in some ways, resulting in my new favorite battle system of the entire series. Fights requires a mix of strategy, timing and a style that makes combat not only fast flowing but oozing with stylish flair giving each victory a satisfying feeling. You're never left feeling like you're grinding away in every battle. Quickly shifting to defensive paradigms when a boss is about to use a devastating attack or debuffing paradigms where you're setting up for the long haul. In fact, there are quite a number of improvements made to the system since the last game that make battles much more enjoyable:‚Ä¢ No longer will the game end when the party leader dies.‚Ä¢ Paradigm Shift animations are much more brief and in most cases, omitted.‚Ä¢ Paradigms can be tuned to focus on single or multiple targets.‚Ä¢ Six classes are available.‚Ä¢ Summons don't transform into vehicles.‚Ä¢ Shroud items (like Aegisol) have been removed.‚Ä¢ TP is gone.8.5/10 Should I buy this game? YES.			"

												=Story 7.5/10=One of the weaker points of the game was the story. Everyone can agree on this and I'm no exception to that. The whole ‚Äúlet's save Lightning‚Äù angle felt forced from the start. I would have taken a game where we play as Lightning the whole way thr- Oh, right, that's what Lightning Returns is about. Anyway, a lot of plot points and major story elements felt forced or like they didn't belong. This didn't hold it back all the time, but it could have done far better.=Art 9/10=On the PC, this game is absolutely stunning. When you throw all the settings up to max and optimise your graphics settings, you end up with a game that is so beautiful you sometimes forget you're playing a game. Admittedly a lot of people have complained about FPS issues, but I felt that the way it was solved in FFXIII (Editing general graphics settings through my Nvidia Control Panel) solved the issue for me before it even became one. The game played in 60 fps steadily throughout the entire playthrough. If you're having problems, Google around and try to fix it before complaining. It's worth it.=Sound 10/10=Music and Final Fantasy are synonymous terms for me. Whenever I play any of the FF games, the soundtrack is the first thing I listen out for. What sort of instruments are we leaning towards? What sort of feel does this game want to give me? Every boss fight is unique, every average fight is energetic and every area has a theme that suits it perfectly. I've listened to the FFXIII-2 soundtrack more than enough times as I do other things to know how much I love it.=Characters 7/10=Admittedly the weakest point of this entire game is its character lineup. Why Serah? Why Noel? Why do I care about them? A lot of the twists towards the end felt both forced and pointless. The Goddess Etro wasn't even introduced in FFXIII and now I'm supposed to believe she's a big thing that's a big part of everyone's lives? No one else seems to know who she is, so it feels a little stupid. Whatever, it's no big deal. I would have rather focused on Hope and thrown a boomerang around, to be completely honest.=Gameplay 9/10=I don't like the way prior FF games handled combat. Sue me. FFVII was absolutely trash with the Materia system. FFVIII's Draw system was only marginally better. FFXIII's system made it so that some characters were only viable because they had skills others didn't. FFXIII-2's Crystarium does the same thing as FFXIII, but makes good on a few faults from its predecessor. Haste and Slow aren't casual abilities to throw around now, which were absolutely broken prior. Your bonuses from stacking multiple Roles into a Paradigm is better, meaning that swapping to 3 SEN's is now a really smart move whenever you see a charge up attack. This game involves more thinking than most people care to admit. For that, I salute you, FFXIII-2. For the record, playing with Keyboard and Mouse is so easy that it's criminal.=Overall 8.5/10=FFXIII-2 is worth the $20. By far. I got 50 hours out of this and I played the hell out of it originally, so I was already on top of where everything was and what I needed to do. A newcomer could easily spend an extra 30 hours and not feel like it's forcing you to grind or do anything you don't really want to. Even if you played the game prior, it offers a new experience to what you might be used to. Definite recommendation from me.			"

												As someone who loves the final fantasy series with a passion, but doesn't have the xbox to play 13, or it's sequels. I was so excited to play this, but the fps is horrid, and the audio is dubbed over horribly. I would be able to look past this if the game actually worked, but I was able to play up to about the 4th time slot, and then whenever I try to travel to the next time, the loading screen never stops. I literally left it loading overnight while I slept and woke up to the loading screen.Don't waste your money on this please. It's a sad excuse for a PC development.			"

												I wish I could come here and praise the actual game, the one whose plotline really isn't as complex as the other reviewers claim it is, provided you pay attention anyway. Yet here I am, loving the gameplay, looking forward to seeing what's coming up in the plot, pursuing every achievement just as I did in XIII, and able to say nothing but how ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• of a port job this is. The graphics are no higher-end than its predecessor, yet I get half the framerate. The overlay doesn't show up for a good while after the button's pressed, some times for up to several minutes. On windowed mode, the window will continuously lock itself into being active even when you alt-tab away, leaving the program you switched to on top it but holding your cursor down on the exact center of your monitor, with your inputs affecting both simultaneously. Look forward to either fiddling with the game's menus until it switches back, or trying to close it on Task Manager without being able to use your mouse.On fullscreen, the game can refuse to close altogether, not acknowledging a press of the escape key (which is supposed to open the menu to close it,) not acknowledging alt-tab or shift-tab, and not allowing you to open Task Manager, thus forcing you to either power off your device or crash the game by unplugging your display.The N7 armor and Assassin's Robe DLC couldn't be licensed to be carried over. Annoying, but excusable. The weapon and accessory DLCs were also not ported over. Not as excusable. Look forward to having to mod this content back in to the game yourself. Though at least it can be done.Congratulations, Square, on taking a perfectly good game and porting it so poorly that it works the way I need it to about half the time. You brought the PC a game that actually makes the PCMR look bad, because with the job you did, it is undeniable that this game is better played on a console.			"

												After faithfully enduring some of the performance and gameplay hiccups in the Final Fantasy 13 port, I expected Final Fantasy 13-2 to have most of these issues resolved.  This is not the case, in fact Square Enix has taken one step forward but two steps back in the performance department with this PC port.First of all, my computer exceeds the recommended specs in every aspect, therefore hardware should not be an issue.  This being said, frame rates are NOT stable and fluctuate between 25 and 60 fps, despite Square Enix promising ""60 fps gaming.""  Rain is rendered poorly in this game and appears white and pixelated.   The good news is that graphics settings are now adjustable in the game launcher.  The available settings are Screen Settings, Resolution, Sound Settings, Shadow resolution, and Anti-aliasing.  The bad news is that lowering these settings does absolutely nothing to alleviate performance issues.  I've tried adjusting settings via the game launcher and my graphics card driver, to no avail.   No matter how low I set my graphics settings, my frame rate is unstable or is locked at 30 fps in many areas.Overall Final Fantasy 13-2, while a solid console game, is still not up to par as a PC port.  I thought Square Enix would have their act together by now since they have had experience porting several other Final Fantasy titles to PC.  The shoddy performance is just too hard to ignore, especially since Square Enix promised ""60 fps gaming"" but actually 30 fps is a lot closer to reality.  Square Enix should have taken more time to port this game and check for performance issues; I would rather have played a polished game at a later date than a shoddy one at an earlier date.  Until Square Enix fixes these glaring performances problems, I cannot recommend this game.*Update* So I have looked into the ""missing"" DLC issue and apparently the DLCs are included in the game, but for some reason they do not unlock until the game is beaten, which was not the case with the console version.  I apologize for the confusion in my previous review.			"

												The good:A great JRPG. It's much better than XIII and has much more -gameplay- elements than it did. It's non linear, has puzzles, lots of minigames, and tons of side quests. There are tons of monsters to recruit into your party, and it can get a bit addictive. Some are infusion fodder, and some are great on their own. The trick is knowing which is which.The story is much more interesting than XIII as well. The main characters have much more depth and I find myself caring way more about Caius and Noel's stories than anything that was in XIII. Caius is the best kind of villain - one who thinks what he's doing is right.Now for the bad:The only problem I had with the game is that it's too easy to gimp your characters if you don't know what you're doing. The game doesn't tell you anything about the leveling mechanic. Doing it right makes a huge difference, but basically you want Noel to have all of his strength bonuses on the big nodes and all of Serah's magic bonuses on her big nodes.The port is decent. The only real problem I had was framerate dips, which can be annoying but isn't really a big deal.			"

(Really?)-Main characters are boring-Feels like point of the game is to set Lightning Returns' storyVerdict: A better game than FFXIII. Falls flat on story telling and makes up for it by giving us a better battle system than FFXIII. But overall, feels more like a set-up for Lightning Returns' story than a standalone game.7/10			"

												TO ANYONE WITH CRASH PROBLEMS ABOUT EVERY 15-20 MIN; TURN OFF STEAM CLOUD FOR THE GAME! It makes it crash for some reason!Now, with that out of the way, let's review the game!It's a good game, and I really like the gameplay. However, it performs poorly, even with a GTX 1070. I guess I can just tweak some settings in my Nvidia drivers, but I haven't bothered to do so yet.I'll recommend this game, simply because I personally liked it. The graphics are nice, I love the music (even though the background music should have been toned down a bit, especially during cutscenes), and the gameplay is simple and clean. I've always had a thing for advanced levling systems, so I really like the crystarium system! (Though I much more prefer the sphere grid from FFX)Overall a great game, though maybe confusing if you haven't played the first in this trilogy (some find it confusing even after playing the first game, so you got to have a clear head playing this,as you're jumping through different timelines during the game)Costumes are also very nice *nods at Serah's bikini*			"

Its actually fun to grind and chase big bosses. The game isnt as linear compared to FF13. Much more exploring and finding things out on your own.

												Well sadly this is a complete clusterf*ck of a port. One of the worst performing games i've played on PC. Right off the bat when you first start playing,  the game will (EDIT: you might get lucky and not have it crash on you) crash when you reach the first cutscene, the solution to this is to turn off the automatic steam saves. i still had a few crashes sometimes after doing that but it was playable.Also they messed the rain up on this release (it's too big, and looks ugly) there is a mod to make it smaller and look like it did on the console release though. Also the frame rate is horrendous, it would routinely drop to the mid teens for me during fights, there are mods and things that help improve the frame rate, but if you use them then when you reach a cutscene the audio will be out of sync...so weigh it, you either lose framerate or audio sync.If the PC is your only choice to play the game then it is playable once you disable the steam saves and tinker with frame rate mods, but if you have a PS3 or Xbox 360 then get it on that.As for the game itself, i thought it was pretty good, i did like the time travel aspect, but then i'm a sucker for time travel stuff. It can get annoying though if you are trying to get these side mission fragment pieces, you will have to travel to 2 or sometimes 4 different time zones of the same area to complete the mission, that's tedious. I gave up even trying to collect all the fragments (there's 160 in total, i have like 80 of em) eventually and just grinded away in fights until i was strong enough to finish the main game.A couple of things they improved over FFXIII are that the areas you explore are bigger, so they listened to the criticism, and also you can see the enemies before you fight them and also run away from them if you want, so you are not forced to fight them most of the time, unless they are faster than you and jump you.The actual meat of the game, the fighting they improved and made it faster and more streamlined from what i remember from FFXIII but there's only 2 chracters you play as in this, Serah and Noel. There are monsters that you can capture through battle and level up and infuse and combine with other monsters to create hybrid mega pokemon things that fight beside you in battle. I didn't do any of that, i had this one little light bulb looking guy who had an lightning ability with a green flower on his head who i maxed out, but i didn't combine him, i managed to finish the game by only using him on my team but he kept dying and i had to constantly resurrect the lil muppet. It's possible to complete the game without infusing them, but maybe learn from my mistake and look up some guides to find out which ones to infuse with each other and what not.The story itself is not very good, i didn't like how literally 2 seconds after the screen fades to black at the end of FFXIII they say time got all f*cked up and distorted and Lightning disappeared and Serah is the only one who remembers she existed. Not even a day passed!, that was stupid.Also kinda spoilers mebbe but not that much, the game can't really stand on it's own, if you haven't played FFXIII you will have no clue what is going on, i did play it and i still had no idea, i had a slight idea but not a fully formed one. There's actually text at the end of this that says ""To be continued"" FFXIII had a definitive conclusion, but i guess they decided to make this and Lightning Returns together, and the third one is in some ways even more out there than this one. Don't play this if you haven't played FFXIII and don't play it if you don't plan on playing Lightining returns either.Once you do finish the main story, more areas open up and also a coliseum where you can fight and recruit opponents like Lightning and Snow. I think some or all of this stuff is DLC from the consoles which is nice, but i dunno if i can be bothered messing with that stuff.TL;DR gme plyble aftr fkn wid it, stry nt gud as FFXIII (also learn to read c*nt lol)			"

												If you like playing games where you can explore a beautifully crafted world with a proper story behind it, then you will enjoy FF XIII-2. You feel like you are really getting to know Serah and Noel throughout the game's main story. There's plenty of supplementary action, chatacter-building and lore to learn in the side quests as well.Whilst you couldn't really class it as a sandbox environment, there's still a bit of room for exploration and as mentioned, lots to do aside from the main story. While it may be a sequel to FF XIII, it is not necessary to have played that game first as FF XIII-2 stands fine on its own. You are suitably filled in on the events in the previous game.The music is very wide ranging in its style but there are some truly spellbinding moments where you can clearly tell a lot of thought has gone into the creative process and the team behind the game have worked together to create instances where you are seemingly locked into a moment in time; a fitting counterpoint to all the travelling through the Historia Crux that you do during the game.The gameplay itself isn't particularly exciting in my opinion. It can get quite repetitive but there's lots of room for variety in your approach to battles with the various paradigm packs and monsters, but I get the impression that for the creators of FF XIII-2, the gameplay itself is arguably one of the lesser important elements.After spending 50+ hours on the game, I have come to the conclusion that FF XIII-2, at its core, isn't about grinding monsters and attaining level 99 in everything. You can by all means grind away, and many players will end up doing this if they are struggling with a particular boss battle so that they can advance in the game and find out the next chapter of the story and enrich their view of the world(s) that FF XIII-2 takes place in. Because that's what this game is about. Telling a story and building world full of rich detail and history for this story to take place in.Caveat: the port is a bit buggy such that you will almost definitely have to actively take action to change some settings on your PC to ensure you can reliably run the game without any major issues.

												Wow.... I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews here since my game run smoothly with no crash so far (I write this with 69 hours on the clock and I finish alomst everything in the game) Maybe they have already patched things up?Anyway, As for the game itself, it may depend on your personal preference. Some may say this is not a good ""2nd"" game of the series. But I personally think the story extended smartly and it is actually interesting. I like the development and game mechanic that they don't change too much but it is not completely the same as FFXIII, so game play still seems fresh, but familiar. You can look up some game play demo on Youtube and you will see why.The port control is as the same as FFXIII in the sense that you don't really need gamepad to play and keyboard + mouse control are implement perfectly (at least for me). Never once I though ""oh I wish I have gamepad"" and never once I feel awkward while using keyboard+mouse to play. (very easy to get used to)About game crashes..... I dunno I have never had this issue. But seems like a lot of people have it. So I would say it might be up to your computer.=== conclusion ===If you like FFXIII, you won't regret grabbing this game. But I would suggest playing around just until you are sure you have no crash issue within refundable time (EDIT: According to the comment, I think it is 2 hours game play OR 2 weeks of purchase. In any case, please look it up anyway in case they have change policy after I write this review) since it seems most of the negative reviews are about game port compatibility and not the game itself.

												TL;DR - If you want to play Lightning Returns and want to know about the story beforehand, I recommend skipping this broken game and reading a summary instead.I have three big qualms about this game. One involving the PC port, the other two involving the gameplay and its story.Firstly about the PC port: It is HORRIBLY BAD optimized. And I'm saying this after they had plenty of time patching the game but it seems this is as good as they're gonna make it. The game runs on a very, very weird dynamic fps capping system that generally limits your framerate very low so it doesn't spike, sometimes far lower than what you consider okay to look at. The community has found a way to remove this framerate limiter, greatly increasing the potential fps you will have. However, this will cause audio and animation during cutscenes to go out of sync if the framerate drops below 60, making most of them ridiculously stupid if they happen in a performance intense area.Secondly, the gameplay. I've never been fond of XIII's Active Time Battle system, which frankly hasn't changed very much in this game, making this already a minus. What's more is that most of the time it feels like you're fighting unnecessary encounters partly unrelated to the situation. The whole time-travelling system is also very confusing and annoying to do, gating you from progressing by having to go back and finding wild artifacts or other keys in order to progress through the main story. I suppose this was an attempt to go away from XIII's linear world but it's not better at all, making it more annoying if anything.And lastly, the story. If you enjoyed the story of FFXIII then you probably won't feel at home here. Apart from starting off somewhere near the ending of XIII and sharing its characters, it's like a fan-made alternative universe. While I understand that time travelling is playing a major role in this, it feels very disconnected from XIII. The character relations aren't reflective of XIII either, seperating it even more from being a sequel to XIII.On top of all that, Lightning Returns almost nullifies everything that happened in XIII-2 and just starts off from an almost completely unrelated universe. The only thing the 3 XIII games have in common are characters and modifications of its ATB system.			"

												All my friends told me that FF13-2 a  was a fantastic game vs its predassor.  Mind you, like last time, I do not own a PS3 so this is my first time expereincing this game.  I will say this game was ten times better than its original.  Not as long in terms of linear play (although the game is still linear but not as linear).  Unlike the last game,you'll play as Lightnings HOT sister Serah and a new person into the mix:  Noel who comes from a ruined future.The basic theme of this game is time travelling.  I don't care much for time travel themes because they generally get confusing of where to go next (Majora's Mask / Epherial Phantasia), but the time travelling here is not confusing and it's very straight forward for the most part.  As for storyline elements keyed into the game, one might argue or have issues with it (because of time travelling and all the paradoxes that can happen but that's another disucssion).This is the first FF I think I've played were the only party members are Serah and Noel.  However, your third party member is that you tame and capture monsters.  So they took a page from the  Dragon Warrior series (nice!).  Overall done well in terms of leveling up, but it would have been nice w/o looking at a guide to guess what materials did what or looking at a shop.  Just show me the requirement like most games do, would have been nice.  Leveling up is similar but more simpfiled which is nice, although it would be nice to look far ahead like in the last 13 game to see what I'm about to learn so I can level accordingly.The combat system is back like last time, a bit more polished up but it's still a button masher here and there.  Which overall doesn't bother me.  Still as fast pace as ever with paragrham shifts.Overall....Pros:  *Fantastic story!  It kept me captivated til the very end and kept me asking questions.*Fun QTE's and interactive novel like storyline presentation (novel part was a bit repeative but nothing bad).*Fantastic music, better than the last game.*More mini games and challenges and extra content upon finishing.*Unlike the last time, there are graphical settings.  Though people still complained about stablitiy, the only issue I had if there was no 360 controller plugged in, the game would stutter.  Why this happens is beyond me but should be something to be looked into especailly for those who don't have a controller.*Loved the ""previously on 13-2"" while the game loaded, very TV show like!*NO DOOM (thank GOD)Cons:*Stuttering w/o a gamepad plugged in (again may only happen on certain systems but still a con)*Felt wierd having only two key storyline characters.*Like last time, character movement would just 'stop' which became annoying for areas you needed to jump in.*Certain araes had a high encounter rate*Sometimes collecting fragments/wild artifacts to progress the game was a pain.*Finishing the game because I enjoyed it so much was sad to let it go.  Yeah story was that goodWhile I've heard 13-3 is crap, I still plan to play it because how the story was in 13-2.Overall I recommend this game, though you may want to play 13 just to see how crappy it was, but 13-2 certainly makes up for it.No DOOM was casted while writing this review.

												/soapbox onI know it gets some bad press from the Meat Grinder; but listen here; This game is far and above the game that drove me away from the series in the first place (also happens to, at this late hour, restore my faith in Final Fantasy). Yes, the story is a bit simple; and the combat system largely hasn't changed. But look - Did Final Fantasy 13 Ever have anything to do with Time Travel? Did it even begin to address the problem that up until 13 they had been adding content to the series left and right that had little or no value in gaming terms? Absolutely not. 13 Was a sad story of how a little boy and a few girls got beat up by a monster and crystalized, turned into some kind of magical alien in the interrim. It was even worse than 12's handling of the world map; even worse than the fact that FF11 was completely and stupidly MMO-Mode only. Let's face it 13 was BAD. XIII-2 gives it a second shot, and hey they still didn't get it all right but they atleast listened to their fans. What else can you ask for in a developer than a good player/dev conversation? Most Devs prior to Final Fantasy XIII-2 will tell you straight that they don't give a damn about anyone but themselves. This has largely changed by the time of the port because of things like Early Access Titles on Steam, and the community taking a sincere interest in making a better game out of a good game. OK So /soapbox offIt's a good game. But it's just my opinion, same as that jerk who wrote the 2014 corporate review thinks it's a bad game. The Only difference between him and I are taste, and tact, and maybe a considerable viewing populace.""The Best game is the one that never stops."" ~Ultimate Game Manual Page 203 Section A paragraph 13			"

Some New Times Ahead You repeat the same action, expecting something different, something new, something fresh. And after repeated tries what you finally create or destroy is something entirely different but remarkably similar at the same time. A creation of something new, from ages past, a relic to be used once more. FFXIII-2 epitomizes such qualities in a manner that takes what their predecessor had previously done and made some in my eyes welcoming changes.It should also be noted, since the game is different from the first, some things remain the same. And since the game draws heavily from time-traveling expect lots of questions and eyebrow raising as well.No more will players be restricted to one path throughout the game like the previous. Areas are more fleshed out with quests! Involving a lot of back tracking in order to complete them in order to earn CP (Crystogen Points) which is used to upgrade your characters in the Crystarium. Players who played the previous installment will remember this as their go to way to leveling up their character. Usually by battling to accrue CP (or exp) or doing side quests to earn more CP and unlock Fragments. And oh boy, Fragments and artifacts; you will hear this in the story a lot being heard. Basically in it‚Äôs most basic form, their a plot device that you need to progress through the story. Using the items above one can traverse through time in different eras called AF(After the Fall), from 5-700, don‚Äôt be alarmed though the game doesn‚Äôt make it like after 5,6, 7, 8, etc. You will only visit relative and important eras spanning different areas to explore. An interesting twist with Time-travel is the addition of paradoxes and alternate timelines which the game heavily abuses to see different areas dramatically change in setting and thus irrevocably change. The power to reverse such paradoxes is up to you mainly. But, I found the different eras in different places pleasing and a welcome change. Exploration has been revamped coinciding with side quests so expect a lot of backtracking to either farm for CP, materials, and even a chance of taming a creature. Whereas before you can only go forward in the story for the first game, here you can keep going back and restart eras to replay the events prior to see it all again.Hell, there‚Äôs even a casino area and chocobo racing which i felt was rigged against me. Or I just suck badly...A new mechanic reminiscent of capturing Pok√©mon, or Digimon; upon battles you have a chance to tame the creature you are facing these creatures range from smallest to large creatures you primarily face in the FFXIII universe. Of course each creature you tame can also be infused and made stronger using another creature to boost their capabilities if their compatible enhancing their role, adding new abilities or even adding resistances. They can also be leveled up using items compatible for them different from CP using items like potent chip, potent slivers, etc. These items can be bought from shops or earned as drops from battles to enhance your creature quickly eliminating the need to grind them. Each item is different, and can be used to upgrade their hp only, their magic only, or both. Some creatures are unique and can be tamed enabling strong party members while others you can‚Äôt tame like bosses for instance or some creatures like C‚Äôeith.The battle system remains the same with paradigms and roles Commando, Ravager, Sentinel, Medic, Saboteur, and Synergist. However, with the new creature mechanic you can expect a lot of new experimentation to create your own team that suits you. Coupled with the creature taming it provides a diverse and fun way to hunt for new companions to suit your battles and become stronger. Fan of the old will immediately be familiar with the same battle mechanic with the same o‚Äôl ATB rate, but this time you can unlock your roles via Crystarium and unlock more ATB charges and boost your roles upon completing a round in the Crystarium. It pleasant needing no introduction to the battle system with several new additions to the system with taming. Jump Here and There Story-wise with Time-travel usually gives me headaches to understand the convoluted sense of the story, but in this game they don‚Äôt make it overtly complicated raising the right questions that will sooner or later be understood in the progressing story. What really changes the story up are the dialogue options during events only four choices to depend on what you will say. And these events will pop up again and again to inform the player of important events. I‚Äôm guessing it all lodges back into paradox endings you can achieve. Quick time events are included with this sequel in order to gauge player choice. Usually within a cinematic event you are prompted with QTE to progress through the story. Completing them rewards items, while not completing them makes you restart the whole progress. And while it can be annoying to wait for the button prompts the events were short and not so much that it was intrusive and bothersome. Some QTE are unique in providing a choice of a certain different path to take than a usual previous route.You play as Serah, the sister to Lightning from the previous game in a race against time really to solve paradoxes, with the adorable Mog which you can torture by throwing to various places to pick up items, and reveal hidden items in the world. But, wait there‚Äôs more! A future guy also travelled back in time to help you because you need a partner. His name is Noel. And you in essence share the leader role with him. Meaning you can switch from running around the world as Noel or Serah or face battles as Noel or Serah! While it sucks I can‚Äôt change them to be just creature parties I found the cast to be likable and sympathetic to their cause to save time and reach Lightning in Valhalla. In true Final Fantasy fashion you can even customize your creatures and outfit Serah and Noel in different attire (Moogle too!) and guess what even your creatures can have certain adornments on them you find in the game or buy. Music and battle themes some may remember some old sound tracks which fit the times you are exploring providing a soothing comfort and others new provide the tension to keep your body tense reading to spring into action. To compare FFXIII-2 versus its predecessor is like comparing a baby to a child. The changes in the game make it very diverse from exploration and taming, battling and side-quests and dialogue options and more. It takes the criticisms of the first installment and in my opinion improves it to make it better for the player to enjoy. While it may seem drastic to add many new mechanics and along with a new protagonist represents a bold risk that ultimately paid off.  Can the Future really be uncertain? Or can it be shaped by our own hands?Total Times Beaten: 1Score: 9.6/10(Score is based off how much I enjoyed the game)Date reviewed: 7-8-16Date posted: 7-8-16Date Edited: 7-11-16*Typos in 4rd Paragraph & 5thIMPORTANT NOTE: I finished FFXIII-2 on my Ps3, I got through a certain point in my PC copy where my computer would just be downright unplayable in battles making my FPS fluctuate below 20 to below 30.

												Better in some ways than Final Fantasy XIII. Sadly. the story makes little sense and was just written to set up a third game. Despite that, the villain is much better than XIII and makes a lot more sense. The monster catching is cool, and the battle system as a whole is a lot more rapid and leaner than the original. It's a good game, a decent JRPG on steam, but I';m not srure if peoplePeople are asking.... I bet this twice (80+ hours on PS3). My advice tho? Get all three games on Steam in a Sale. and play them in order. Not just for the story, but to see how Square Enix was trying to change with the times. Well worth it.			"

												Extremely poorly optimized port.My specs are:i7 3770kAsus GTX 670 DC2  (Overclocked)16GB 1600 MHZ Corsair Vengeance Ram256 GB Samsung 830 SSDThe game absolutely chugs along, even on relatively low settings at a resolution of 1920x1080I've not checked the exact framerate though it's unbearably poor.I picked it up in a sale and didn't try the game till recently so have no chance of a refund.If I could though I would be giving the game back for the return of my cash. I can't play the game like this.My PC blazes through Shadow Of Mordor on max settings (haven't tried the ultra textures as I only have a 1080p monitor). It should have no trouble with a PS3 game with added AA and improved resolution.There's no excuse for this square enix.(I've tried a number of fixes posted in the forums though none made an improvement)I'd heard this the gameplay was an improvement on the first Final Fantasy 13 (which wouldn't be difficult) though it seems I'll never know.Square has an incredible back catalogue.This game doesn't give me hope of ever seeing decent ports of any of those games.

												The game works much better than final fantasy XIIIThey included options to changeScreen size, shadow resolution, and the ability to play the game fullscreen or windowed mode.The game runs fine at 60 fps at times and takes a few dip at certain places down to 45 fps but it isn't too bad.You can also choose between english and japanese. The game still suffers a bit of optimization problems but the game itself is a better improvement over XIII by a bit. Pros and cons skip to bottom. Story(Spoiler free)Just a heads up as this game opens up with lightning but the protaganist this time is Serah who is trying to rescue her sister Lightning with the help of Noel. You'll meet many guest characters  and familiar faces from XIII. You do not need to play 13 to play this since it comes with a guide that tells you the events that has transpired. Gameplay  Most of the gameplay stays the same from XIII such as killing your enemies, rating, the combat system is fairly the same with paradigm,except for a few new introductions of systems to initiate attack on  enemies such as the mog time, multiple choice qte interactions  and the crystarium facelift. The game does however offers revisit of different areas, there are towns this time and mini games to play and also some end game content bosses that will brutally rip you apart.  The game comes with two modes for battle, Easy and Normal. Pick normal unless you're very bad. VERY VERY BAD. Don't pick easy for Serah.My specs areGtx 680 Overclock edition - Upgrading to a 980 soon.64 gig of ramCPU Intel Core i7-3960X Extreme Edition Pros + Resolution setting+ Window mode setting+ Shadow settings+ Language options - Finally I can get rid of my Japanese and English copies on the console(NOTE: They added these options to final fantasy 13 Just recently, it didn't have them before)+ The art  and music+The story is much more intense+ The interactive responses and qte are a bit decent+They added a bit more to the game in terms of content and exploration and places that can be revisited. + Comes with majority of dlcs, except some that cannot be on the pc because of legal reasonsCons- The camera sometimes goes ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• at certain locations.- The way enemies use to roam the map is now gone, they appear now due to the mog time system, that immersion- performance varies for people, some of my friends says its poorly unoptimized, other says it runs amazingly well at 60 fps.- Fluctuating framerates falls in performance+- I've already played this game before twice, this is my third time owning it. Its much better than XIII so check it out. Overall its gotten better but isn't the best, I can't give them a thumbs down for this one for trying however I hope they really look into the performance problems that fluctuates the boards for players.Be wary of this purchase because I am hearing that many people with high end pc having hitches. Wait for a price drop if you are worried about the situation or listen in more for patches and update.			"

												Writing this review after 6 hours into re-playing on the PC version.Storyline and gameplay-wise it is a great improvement compared to the first one.They somewhat fixed the ""linearity"" which was a problem in FFXIII. The game is a bit more open-world but still pretty straight forward in terms of traveling, etc. It is definitely, however, not a straight lined map with no town/NPC interactions. They also did a really good job (in my opinion) with the storyline that is still a bit confusing but not as bad as the first one. Keep in mind that the store page is somewhat misleading as they only show you screenshots of Lightning but the main character in this game is Serah and the new character Noel.Graphics and performance-wise it is a bit disappointing but I don't believe it is detrimental to the gameplay. I have an i7-2600k GTX 770 OC and 8 GB of RAM and I frequently have frame drops to below 30. I believe people with a much higher-end PC experience the same problem if not worse. The game still requires patching and optimization so if you are looking for a drastic change in performance compared to the first one I don't recommend you buy it just yet. They allow you to change the game resolution and shadow resolution. I don't really have much knowledge whether the in-game resolution is set to native 1080p but to me it just looks like a stretched out 720p when I set it to 1080p (I could be wrong). Overall I still think it's a good change compared to the console version but can definitely be improved some more.tl;dr If you don't care too much about performance issue (it's not great but not detrimental to the gameplay) and are looking forward to improved gameplay (open-world, more NPC interactions,etc) and a good storyline I definitely recommend buying it. However if sudden frame drops and stretched out resolution bothers you I recommend you wait for the devs to fix it before buying this game.			"

												Despite the best efforts of Lightning and her crew, the world is once again in danger. Now it's up to Serah, mysterious traveler Noel, and moogling Mog to make things right. Despite putting 50+ hours into FFXIII-2, I'm about as equipped to discuss the plot as somebody who has never even heard of the game....or Final Fantasy. I guess this title could be compared to previous Square games like Chrono Trigger & Chrono Cross. The player must pass through various times and dimensions, alleviating paradoxes, fighting monsters, and getting pushed around by some jerk named Caius. There are dark moments (like Chrono), but it sticks to 3-4 characters, instead of attempting to juggle 300 (like Cross). I guess that's part of what got me through this game. When the story doesn't make a lot of sense, at least you can watch the friendship between Noel & Serah grow, and realize that they're getting by despite the heaps of BS being tossed their way.The battle-system is straight outta FFXIII, but with numerous changes. The most obvious is that the third party member is always a monster. Pocket Monster fans are going to find dozens of creatures to recruit throughout their journey. Monsters are strengthened via materials, and can be infused with others to gain additional skills. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed that monsters adhere to the FFXIII system. For example, I recruited a Giant Cactaur, but he's not going around using 100,000 needles on everything. He's a synergist so he sticks entirely to buffs.  I know I know, the paradigms are essential to winning in FFXIII, but I just...oh well. On the bright side, monsters tend to have unique skills that make them more effective in a given situation than Serah & Noel. On the whole, FFXIII-2 is a fair bit easier than its predecessor. This is mostly due to the fact that you're actually not limited in how much you can grind. Since this game is non-linear, you could go to various optional areas and amass a ton of levels, making the story-battles trivial. Aside from a handful of post-game & DLC fights, you'll have to limit yourself if you want a challenge.Speaking of levels, the Crystarium got a convoluted revamp. You cash in points for stat bonuses: +3 to magic, +20 to HP, etc. Over time you unlock and level all six roles, but your level 99 stats can vary. There's a ""perfect"" guide floating around to help you figure this mess out. While I ended up using guides to have a chance at 100%ing this game, I merely stuck to leveling what I thought would make sense. For Serah, I leveled Ravager on the large nodes to boost her magic, and with Noel, commando. I probably goofed somewhere and cost myself a good 30+ points in an essential stat, but I've done most everything in the game, so it isn't that much of an issue.In order to get all 160 fragments, you're going to be doing a lot of exploring, grinding, puzzles, and stupid pet tricks. Mog is capable of finding hidden items, and can also be thrown to reach faraway objects (which you might need a guide to find). The puzzles are almost entirely mini-games. As anyone who has played FFXIII-2 will tell you, the clock puzzles SUCK. Most of them aren't that difficult and can be brute-forced. But there are a few that all but require a website for calculating solutions. Either take advantage of the tools the internet has made available to you, or watch in horror as the pacing dies a painful death, your choice. The grind isn't quite as bad as FFXIII, but expect to spend a lot of time in the Archylte Steppe fighting the same monsters for potent orbs, essences, & crystals. After completing the game, all of the major DLC is unlocked. In the Coliseum, players will engage in battle with numerous fan-favorites, and a few characters from FFXIII. I find it amusing that one of the opponents should have been in a boss-fight in FFXIII, but it never happened because reasons. I won't spoil it, but if you played FFXIII, then you already know who I'm talking about. You'll want to fight these battles not just because they're quite good, but also because you can recruit everyone you defeat. The next DLC adventure is a solo battle between Lightning and Caius. Lightning has a specific set of roles, and is expected to switch between them constantly. For example, she can use the knight role to become impervious to damage, and it's necessary to avoid getting one-shotted by a handful of Caius's attacks. Since this DLC doesn't require Serah & Noel, you can do it immediately after completing the game to gain a powerful ally. Sazh's DLC adventure takes place in a Casino. He's trapped in limbo, and his son is nowhere to be found, only by gambling can they hope to be re-united. While the concept sounds sufficiently dark, this isn't exactly Gambling Apocalypse Sazh. The goal is to acquire 30 fortune medals, which can be done in less than 30 minutes by playing Texas Hold'em. The casino is also available in the main-game, though all N&S can do is play slots and race their chocobos. Once I got the items I required, I never went back. I'll admit, I enjoyed my time with this game more than FFXIII. Noel, Serah, and Caius are some of the better JRPG heroes and villains I've seen. Trying to make sense of everything is headache-inducing, but the revamped crystarium and monster-raising provided excellent distractions. The combat itself also recieved some slight improvements, like paradigm  shifting being noticeably faster. The various areas/times/dimensions being more than a narrow corridor definitely helped, though the quests tend to be of the fetching variety. The port still could have been a lot better though. I'm not nearly as frustrated about it now as was when I started the PC version, but Square-enix isn't getting a passing grade for this one. FFXIII and its sequel deserve better ports, but I expect Lightning Returns to be at about the same quality as the previous two PC entries; superior to the console versions, and not much else.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a nice sequence to Final Fantasy XIII. I personally remember when this Game first came out on Xbox 360 & PS3 and after playing the first FFXIII I bought this one as the Crystal Edition. Now almost 3 years later it finally came to PC.First of all let me say that this Game does have horrible fps drops and sometimes in some areas you will experience 30fps instead of 60fps.Performance wise the first FFXIII Game was alot better on PC then this one. But let me tell you that the Third and Final Part of this series runs even smoother then the first part!In this Game unlike the first Game you can only play 2 Characters which are Serah Farron and new Character that hasn't been in the previous Game.The Fightning System has also changed a little, not just in layout but also as to how it works. Once again you have Paradigmas but this time you will be able to tame Monsters / Enemies and let them fight by your side! Each of the Monsters come with their own Role that you can level up with Monster Material.The Leveling for the Characters is such the Same as before. Once again you have the Crystarium and the CP (Crystarium Points), with the only difference that the Crystarium looks a bit different and it seems to take longer with more points then before to level up your characters.Unlike the First Game you can now explore a bit more Freely and can get up to 8 alternative Endings. With 1 of course being the main ending. Once you've unlocked all 8 differend Endings you will get a Secret Ending as well.What makes this Game on PC better then on Console? The Fact that we got almost all DLC for free (besides 2 Costumes or so but you can mod them if you really want to)The Free DlC's include some Story DLC's and also some Costumes. So once you finished the Main Game there is actually alot more to do to catch the full Story!Although this Game has its Problems, once you get passed them it is a beautiful sequence to the First Game in the Series and up to this day one of my favourite ones. Since it took me 58 Hours to complete the Main Story (without any DLC done) I do recommend this Game to anybody that loves a good jrpg and a Story Rich game for its full Price.I also do recommend this Game to any Final Fantasy Fan! Especially the ones that enjoyed Final Fantasy VII as it is in the Same Universe as such.  "

												I wish I had heeded the other reviews saying this was a shoddy port, because it most certainly is.  Some cutscenes and intense sections will run 60fps even on my potato of a rig, but get into a world map with a lot of people around or an intense fight and the framerate drops harder than a fat chocobo post flight.The game itself is very interesting, just a shame one can't say the same for this port.

After many complaints about linearity of the previous title, FF XIII-2 offers more variability of where do you want to go and how you want to proceed. Which is both good and bad, depends on how you look at it. However, to give a quick conclusion, the game is very well worth the money spent.The biggest issue I've had this time isn't the linearity of the game, but the PC port. I consider my computer as very good, yet I've had few problems. The most annoying one would be the lack of 7.1 surround sound support, and I didn't find a way to at least make it work with my Razer headset. Video stutter in cutscenes is still there and there are few locations where I've had lower FPS than I'm ok with.The story yet again feels as an interactive anime world, truly well written and astoundingly presented. It felt a bit shattered at first, but that's the part of ""don't lead the way for the players too much"". Plus, if you are fan of time travelling and consequences of changing things in the past/future, you may love this one.Character progress is more ""free"" aswell. And I don't think you can actually develop your characters so badly you won't be able to finish the game. If you don't grind a lot, it will be hard, though. I've spent a lot of time in final battles that were also close to death, it wasn't just about not enough damage.The battle system was slightly improved. Ok, it's nearly the same, BUT. There is one big BUT for me - the pre-emptive strike finally does not start an hour-long animation of hitting every little enemy, instead, it's like one quick Blitz attack and that's it!I was missing characters, though. From the start to the end, you'll be forced to play with Noel and Serah (yeah, and the Mog) + some monster Serah is able to capture. And also cinematics. There really is only the opening and ending, everything else are just regular cutscenes, I think.But well, I don't think this game was as good as the first one (story-wise), because it didn't have that much touching moments, but it's still Final Fantasy. And a very good game.I definitely recommend this, Kupo!			"

												i was sceptical about ff xiii and it's admittedly a little wonky story at first, but grew to like most of the cast and their development. (especially hope turning from annoying little brat into a somewhat responsible young man, even vanille had a very deep character behind her annoying airheaded appearance)this game seems to try to do it right but fails on multiple points:- the story feels like bad fan fiction.. they exaggerated with the melodrama to a point where it is unbearable to listen to the dialogue. also they kinda dump noel on you without any character development and didn't bother to make him likable in the least, he just seems like a mix of tidus and sora from kingdom hearts, and i didn't like either of them..- the music... i want uematsu back! some tracks are kinda ok tough, but most of it feels like generic j-pop- the time travelling scenario and different dimensions were done much better in other games (radiant historia, chrono trigger/cross) - it's way too easy; in the previous installation you had to strategize a little bit, think about the paradigms you'd use and change them sometimes when a boss just wrecks you.. in this game i mostly mash auto battle and sometimes change to healing when i get low- the monster collecting is plain dumb.BUT, if you like, melodrama, j-pop, obnoxiously cute moogles and easy gameplay then this is the right game for you! :-)			"

												As a spinoff, it's not everyone's Final Fantasy. But it does attempt to rectify some of the problems that XIII had.First, the story, which is a weakness. I do not believe XIII-2 or Lightning Returns should have been attached to XIII. Each of them convolute the story so much, adding and changing the mythos in unnecessary ways. Personal beef aside, XIII-2 takes place... uh, anytime and everytime after XIII. That's right, you'll be traveling through time. It continues after XIII and retcons the happy ending. Series heroine Lightning has disappeared, and as her younger sister Serah, the only one who seems to remember her, you need to team up with Noel, the last survivor of humanity in the far-off future, to find the source of a timeline disturbance and fix it.The combat is similar to XIII, which is a more dynamic version of the ATB system from many other FF games. The difference here is that you always play as the same two characters, plus your choice of captured monster. In this game, you can recruit enemy monsters, each with a specific combat role (medic, physical attacker, magic attacker, etc.), as opposed to Serah and Noel who can change roles. You can change combat roles for your party on the fly during battle to react to the situation.Exploration is limited, each area is self-contained and you travel between each area/time via a menu. Some locations are used more than once, and you can explore them in different times to reach new areas and quests. Also unlike FFXIII, you can get sidequests from the beginning of the game. Completings quests will get you fragments, the chief indicator of progress. There are 160 fragments to collect. On the surface, I like the concept of fragments, reminiscent of Sonic Adventure's emblems. Most are single challenges. You'll have about half of them or maybe less if you're just gunning for the end (if memory serves). There is a meaty postgame, but it does get slow and annoying at times (but not as slow as FFXIII) and the fragment that has you logging battles with every single monster will be annoying, but perfectly passable with a guide. The Paradox Ending concept is also annoying too. Oh, and the quizzes in Academia. You would probably not know how to get all of them without a guide. Also unlike FFXIII, levels are not just single tunnels, but Academia (all time periods, really) is an unneccessary overcompensation. It's huge and confusing.Ah, almost forgot! The port. Both XIII and Lightning Returns are better that XIII-2. Nearly everyone has encountered slowdown with this game. It is simply not optimized well. That said, it never became unplayable for me, and I mean ACTUALLY unplayable instead of 'OMG it's 59 FPS instead of 60 FPS' like some people who use that term. This does dip below 30 FPS at points where I could run XIII at a pretty smooth 60 throughout. I can deal with that, but some people can't. It does not excuse Square Enix from doing that to us. The game's $20, though, so yeah.In summary, the game is worth the price. You'll have to deal with lag and a story that simply didn't need to happen, but you have a fun battle system and more exploration than FFXIII in return.			"

												Compatibility:Worked well with no lag for my Windows 7 desktop with a Radeon HD6900. No problems with my Windows 7 laptop with a GeForce GTX860M. Steam cloud sync works perfectly and I am able to play the game on both rigs perfectly, except for that one time when my internet was down and the cloud sync did not work (duh). You can play it offline and it will sync once you have internet again.Having a playstation controller is highly recommended to enjoy the game!! Don't listen to keyboard players who complain about a game made for a PS controller.Battle System: This is the best part of the game! As someone who has played FF6 - 9, the battle system of FFXIII-2 was extremely refreshing and challenging. Throughout the battles, you will need to switch between modes in order to damage, mitigate damage, debuff and buff your party, failing which you will just die. And die again. And again. Fortunately, when you die you will be given the option to respawn at the same point prior to the battle or retry the battle, which saves alot of time. Also, if you think you're gonna lose the battle, simply press start and retry to have another shot at it.You get a chance to tame monsters after you have defeated them. Catch em, level them and infuse their abilities to other monsters to create your own unique monster!If you're looking for a game that you could simply press O and you could cruise through battles with ease, this is not for you. Go play dota 2 or something.Levelling System: You earn crystarium points after battles or side quests and can use it to level up your party's crystarium, gaining new abilities etc. Level up wisely in order to maximise your stat gains!Story: The storyline feels kind of lame and slow at the start, but believe me when I say the character story developers did a fantastic job of making me have dem feels for both the protagonist and the villain. BTW, there are multiple hidden endings for the game if you can defeat / unlock them, or you could just youtube it if you're lazy.Sidequests:CHOCOBO RACING AND A CASINO! You also get all the additional digital downloadable content Square Enix launched after you complete the game!Music / Soundtrack:After playing the game, I purchased the OST from ebay. The music made for this game is phenomenal. Lolz were had when I rode the red chocobo for the first time.Overall:Just play it, you will like it. Unless you dont like chocobos or behemoths fighting for you, then fine, you win.			"

												I admit I found it a little hard to get into this game after it's epic intro battle. It opens up into a horrible camera view/controls and what I crazy and unfitting music. Once I got settled into it though, I really liked it. The story contributes to the events of the first game in mind blowing ways. If you were confused by the first game, this one will make more sense of it.The visuals and soundtracks are amazing. I found myself lingering in a lot of areas just to see more of the scenery and listen to the music.When I found the plot involved time and inter dimensional travel, I was a little worried but I think it was pulled off pretty well.Fair warning though, some parts of this game that are part of the main story are very difficult, but they are rewarding enough to make up for it.

												There are a lot of bad reviews, but this is not one of them.I can see that this port needs some tweaking, but a quick Google search solves all of these problems and I haven't experienced any further and I've played for more than 70 hoursThe game itself:If you didn't like FF XIII, well, I didn't as well, but I REALLY liked this one. The two main characters are not as annoying and ""kitschy""as the FF XIII cast and the gameplay is also not that straight forward. It keeps a similar game and fight mechanic but adds a lot of depth with companion mechanic and some Pokemon-esque flair of catching and training your follower. Collecting fragments is rarely tidious and the alternate endings are also quite interesting to watch. Some fights are demanding, yet not unfair. Especially the included DLCs represent a rather large step in difficulty and need proper strategy and setup.The music is AMAZING. One of the very few games where I bought the OST.Personally, I do not think that this game,like FF XII and Lightning returns as well, should carry the name of ""Final Fantasy"" in their name, since the style differs too much from the classic games. It is not a good Final Fantasy but still a good to very good game. Don't be fooled yb the huge amount of negative reviews from people who are seemingly unable to google the tweaks for this game "

												tldr: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME, DON'T SUPPORT A COMPANY THAT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT IT'S FANS!!Love the game, but can Square Enix please just optimize it so it doesn't have constant frame drops? I realise making a profit is important and not spending unnecessary time on an already released title is a good idea, but this is rediculous. I'll recommend the game once this is fixed.I have contacted the Square Enix support email address and all I get are copy paste replys about how I must turn off other programs that are running like my firewall and antivirus... In my messages I asked legitimate questions and explained how it is definitely something wrong with the game and not my pc, but all I get are some copy pastas? You've got to be kidding... From a company that I used to respect and admire greatly, they've just turned into money hungry f*ckbois.			"

												I had a really hard time getting this game to work. I have a top end rig and went through reinstalling sound drivers (mentioned in many forum posts for the issue I was experiencing), verifying cache, and reinstalling the game in general. The reason for this is due to receiving a black screen after the square enix logo appears.Through an unknown combination of the aforementioned, I was able to some how get the game working. At this point, I'm just glad that it's working. I wouldn't recommend anyone going through the frustrating experience of getting this game to work like I did.			"

												This is probably the most MIXED REVIEW I have ever given on Steam.  Overall, I do recommend buying this game ""IF"" you bought and loved playing FF13, for the story and graphics if nothing else.  HOWEVER --- and this is where I go off on a complete rant about this game.  This sequel takes a complete turn to how you will play the game, and in my opinion, takes you far far away from the original.  ***BUYER BEWARE, you may spend as much time online researching this game than you do actually playing it.  Because, it is not very intuitive and does lack significantly the continuity of this game overall.  It's hard to follow; ALL of the various paths you are suppose to follow, when and where to find the fragments/ items you need to continue moving forward, once you figure out where you are suppose to go, so very much more.  You are left saying much of the time ""exactly WHAT is my objective now?!""  You cannot and will not finish this game without having external help [period].  Don't let anyone tell you differently, because they are lying and/ or braggarts, and you will get plenty of these examples in the brag-thoughs on Youtube and other various places like I have.  I mean, I do not mind doing ""some"" research online about the games I am playing.  But, I do not like having to keep pausing my game just to finding out that once again I cannot do what I must do, for that road too is yet another dead end.  there are the endless puzzles/ rifts to solve that will rack your brain, and/ or the minimal amount of keys to unlock gates (wild fragments) to continue further, and/ or they are completely hidden like an easter egg hunt, constantly.  This game is complete chaos as far as trying to figure out what/ where to do/ go next!!!... But, YEAH!, people that hated FF13 seem to just love FF13-2, and visa versa, people that love FF13 seem to hate this game.  At least this is my concensus?!... Oh, and the pro's to this game; excellent character development, storyline, graphics, diverse gameplay, multi-purpose gaming (separate gaming abilities; stragegy, action, adventure, etc.), and I've been told it has great replaying qualities to continue your character developement and alternative realities.  So after the end, you can reshape different endings.  While I'll be happy just to get to one type of ending.  LOL ;)			"

												While FF XIII-2 was a fun game back on the PS3, I seriously advice against anyone buying this game. It seems SE hasn't done much to optimize this game for pc, and after releasing they simply forgot about it. The vast majority of people playing this game are experiencing FPS drops and CTDs. You'd think there'd be a patch or at least a notice from SE addressing the issue, but nothing. For me this means I have a constant stutter and completely random CTDs every 5-15 minutes rendering the game absolutely unplayable. If you want to play this game, play it on ps3. The pc port simply isn't worth it in its current state.			"

												I picked this game up after finishing FF XIII, because the story was addicting and my wife and myself got really attached to the characters. I was slightly disappointed to see that Serah was really the only character from the previous game that you got to interact with on a regular basis. I got over that pretty quickly, however. The story for this game is fantastic, on par with the previous game.. if not maybe just a bit better. The combat system is the same as the previous game, so if you liked it in FFXIII this game is just a rehash of that system. There is a difference in party makeup though. Instead of a 3-character party makeup you have the same two characters the entire game (Serah and Noel) but have the ability to capture, train, level, and use field monsters as your third party member. At first this seemed lame, but shortly after there became a collector aspect of it that i really enjoyed. Having a party of nothing but multicolored chocobos was really fun. You may also see complaints about the game not running well; as long as you arent expecting 60 FPS on max settings while trying to play this on a laptop you borrowed from work.. you'll be fine. The game ran at 59.97 FPS @1080p and all settings to their maximum (and also extended settings via the Nvidia cpl) consistently on my gaming machine, which is a couple of years old at this point. If you enjoyed FFXIII, go ahead and grab this one too. You will love the evolution of the story. There is also DLC that i won't spoil, but you really want to play it after beating the game. Trust me, and trust the tiny chocobo living in my hair.			"

												Warning. This is a personal review. Everyone has their own opinions and Mine are just shown throughout this review.If you did not play the first game do not worry you are not missing out too much.HOWEVER This game is much more open compared to the significantly linear FF13. I believe that is one reason why people hated the first game.This game will use various tactics to keep you from progressing at a later point in the game which really will annoy anyone who plays this game. The puzzle challenges for example are by far the most annoying additions to this game.COULD BE LIKE ANY OTHER FF GAME WITH A BOSS BUT NO. PUZZLE CHALLENGES ARE ALL THE RAGE.Seriously, that crap made me stop playing. And sure I could go and watch someone do them, but I'd rather do it myself, especially seeing as my network connection isnt that great especially with video content.ANYWAY other than the annoyancesFor the good things so far-RESOLUTIONS: CAN CHANGE TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN 720p-A lot of elements from the first game reappear, giving you some idea just how the first game went.-A LOT of crap people hated in the first game is fixed (Like, if the leader dies, it used to be game over, yeah no, thats gone now)-If you have played Tales of Symphonia 2 THIS GAME FEELS SLIGHTLY LIKE ITWell in battle that is. You will only have two playable characters, and other characters like Snow joining in, but not in the party as they are not of the same timeline.-You will also be able to collect monsters to help in battle which is cool.Oh they also troll you a bit by making the game look like an older FF tittle, (like with an actual level system) But its not.-You get all DLC from the ps3 version included too!TL:DR the game is vastly more simplified than the original, My guess is the creators saw how annoying the first game was and aimed to change it up somewhat.The bad-THERE IS NO LINUX PORT. STEAM TROLLS YOU.-Character selection and world/timeline selection can be a pain to deal with at first and for some reason to me if feels like I'm playing kingdom hearts in a way due to Noels looks, however like all games you play for hours, you will get used to it.-The AI has a mind of its own, screwing up story lines, in more than one way.--Becareful how you talk to people, the camera may be in an odd position-Grinding does help lots here, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GAME TROLLS YOU TO TAKE ON BOSSES WAY HIGHER LEVEL INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE MISSON TO MAKE IT EASIER.-Graphics options are available although limited. SE seemed to have borrowed the settings changer that was created for the first game, however I will say one thing.. >>There is no option to change the texture quality, so you WILL NEED A HIGH END PC FOR THIS GAME<<-Even though its a PS3 Port, the game has a significant performance hit even on low settings. So if you played the first game, thinking you can play the second one easily, think again.-The AUTOSAVE FEATURE WILL KILL YOU: By being stressed out, as for some reason steam needs to be not only online and active, but if steam gets disconnected, the game will LOCK UP DURING AUTOSAVE MOMENTS. Just keep that in mind if you have a faulty internet connection or you are playing during times where steam goes down for repairs.-----------------------------------------------------Over all I have nothing really bad to say about this port. This game  does however raise the question on if i shall buy the third installment of FF13 as even though the first game was mainly linear, I preferred it over this one currently. There is alot Square could do to make this game better and a lot of things that i hope do not transition to FF15 when it does arrive, assuming it comes out for PC. anywho gameplay wise It is much better to play over the original, and even though there could be a few more fixes here and there. I'm sure with the right system you would be able to play this game maxed out, however currently this game is as demanding as something like witcher 2 So keep that in mind when trying to play this game.Also for you tech heads out there, this game is multi(meaning 2) threaded.High clocked strong CPU cores are recommended. (so FX minumum, Intel core i7 or something above 4ghz)GPU Wise: RADEON HD 7870/7790 and above / NVidia GTX 750 TI and above (for 1080p gameplay)Ram isn't really an issue, so minimum being 3gb, lol.

												FFXIII-2 is really a great game at its core. Much more open-world than its predecessor, the game should bring hours of exploration and enjoyment, but only if you can look through the cons of a truly terrible port.Running at GTX980 in dual-SLI + i7 6700K@4.5GHz, the game won't run at 60fps more than 70% of the time. A 30fps limit seems to appear randomly. All cutscenes are pre-rendered, hence the enormous size of the game (30GB).Amazing game, terrible port.			"

												The port of FF 13 was more than adequate. I am not sure what happened with FF 13-2. The graphics seem downgraded compared to 13 and I'm pretty sure the game doesnt actually render in higher than 720p. I play on a 1440p monitor and the game is SUPER blurry and low res. I also have a GTX 1080 and the game struggles to stay above 30 fps and has constant drops and fluctuations. I'm a sucker for Final Fantasy games so I was able to look past this and get into the game. The story is kind of all over the place due to the time travel aspect and definitely more of a non-linear game. I was getting drawn into it but about 10 hrs in and now my game crashes 4/5 times that I try and save the game. I've lost tons of progress and it's super frustrating having to save every 5 minutes fearing that the game will crash. Then, if the game does crash you have to take the time to restart it and replay those lost minutes. I really hope that Square Enix can release a patch to address all this.			"

If you spent $4,000 on your PC, maybe you can get this thing to run at 30 fps. The rest of us suckers are stuck looking at a 720p game running at 20 fps or lowerAnd I also can't seem to change the resolution, so anything that's not windowed 720p looks like upscaled 720p.

												Given the mixed reception the Final Fantasy 13 series seems to be getting about its ports, I thought I'd throw my opinion in on this aswell.As a game, Final Fantasy 13-2 is somewhat of an improvement on its predecessor in terms of gameplay and in my own opinion fun. It gives you a lot more freedom in terms of what you want to do during the course of the game and although you will eventually have to follow the main story to progress to later stages of the game, you could easily go ahead and just burn another 3 or 4 hours here and there just exploring and gaining more CP for your characters, materials for your monsters and finding those pesky Artefacts.On the topic of levelling, yes it is a little annoying because the game doesn't fully go over the system and if you are not careful you can indeed make your character weaker because of it. Although it does pretty much imply the way they should be setup with Noel being Strength and Serah being Magic, it doesn't explicitly state it nor does it tell you that you can easily waste CP and Role levels on nodes that give little to no actual benefit which is a slight issue but not one that should make anybody overlook the game, it's trial and error.The third party member in the team will consist of a Monster character, which you find various items to level up unlike the usual CP used for the main PCs. The ability to gain, level and infuse said monsters to make a third player who could be a huge asset to any party you make is a huge plus to it. With that, you can take up to 3 Monsters into a battle as part of a Paradigm Pack, which lets you add them to your current Paradigm setups then change the roles freely to (hopefully) change the tide of battle upon change. Also Paradigm Shifting is a bit quicker, which I personally found a little bonus.The story itself could be confusing, especially if you haven't played the original and it can also get a bit crazy to follow too if you do things in an odd order or seek out Artefacts all the time. It's solid, but it isn't the best and possibly one of the very few things I can pick on within the game.Overall it is a solid game, not amazing by Final fantasy standards but it is worth a go if you played Final Fantasy 13 or really any version of the Final Fantasy series in the past, or if you are like me and just love playing RPGs.

												It was a fun game but there are considerable performance issues with the port. I had to lock the frame rate to 30 to get it to run nicely and I would still experience slow downs during some heavy cutscenes and battles.I liked the freedom compared to XIII but I feel like the story was a bit convoluted. It didn't really have a purpose until near the end, where I thought the story really shined. Overall I liked XIII story a lot better.Game play was great, quicker battles than XIII and the monster in your party was a cool feature to play around with. I miss the different characters from the original, though there are a couple cameo's, it just makes the game feel thinner to me.7/10			"

												Final Fantasy 13-2, despite the maligned reputation of the 13 trilogy in general, is actually a pretty decent JRPG. It also has an amazing soundtrack, as does the entire series. Seriously, this music is great, and really helps sell the game, even when the story is a convoluted mess.That being said, this PC is port is broken. Heed the other warnings here and make a hard pass if you're considering this title. The old console version is fine, and still looks great for being past-gen. Hopefully the series will be re-packaged and given a proper HD release. Until then, just consider this another victim of lazy, careless porting.			"

												There seems to be a lot of hate around this game. For me, after having played all three of the XIII,XIII-2 and LR, I must say this one is my favourite.Pros:- Open world(no more linear parts, you can backtrack and run around all you want)- No time limit(this is my main and big problem about LR)- Customizable 3rd party member(through a monster catching system)- Serah(+Laura Bailey as CV, what more do you want?)- Graphics(:O)Cons:- Story can be somewhat insconsistent at times(though still quite enjoyable)- 2 out of 3 party members are irreplaceable for the whole game- You can battle by pushing just one single button through the automatic system, making it kinda boring if you keep doing it.I had originally bought this on my PS3, wasted hours and hours, and now I've got it on Steam as well. I don't regret a single damned penny given.Give it a try, at less than 20‚Ç¨ it's a really good deal, given that we get so many DLCs for free as well! "

												Pretty good port overall, has a fair amount of options along with running very smoothly. I've only had one crash in over 20 hours of play. If you liked FF13 you'll liked this one more. I feel  it has done everything better so far, plus no more twenty hour tutorial. They've also added monster catching and training into the mix which I find quite enjoyable. Finding the right rare spawn and building the team you want and giving them the right abilities and traits is more fun than it sounds. I'm running three different colored Chocobo's. The game does however drag in some parts, (looking at you academia levels) but overall for the $15 I spent I'm having more fun than I expected.			"

												In comparison to FF13, we are given a ton more free roam this time. The images on missions typically tell you where to go and for the story you just need to pay attention except about mid-game, you have to go through wild artefact portals till you find the right one which if you are unlucky, will be the very last one and make you go find more wild artefacts first. Another massive change is instead of having a large party, you play as either Serah or Noel and also have 1 animal companion which has its own rule, can be upgraded etc. Most encounters in the game can be turned into an assistant character for your 3rd slot.The story concept focuses on time travel and rifts so it can get very confusing but also a change to the typical Final Fantasy. The theme is what I would call despair, so it is more sad oriented rather than a happy fantasy and this concept is used throughout the whole story. You have the option to revert all progress in that map which is useful so you can never really mess up and only need to do a single play through + revert time to accomplish everything. The battle system is the same as FF13, just a more polished UI and for the most part, the game is easier and requires less grinding and there are less gaps in stats between you and the enemy. There are not many choices for equipment this time as the weapons you get are very linear and you just buy these from the store. The other equipabbles are accessories which each have a consumption value and you have a maximum value that you can fill up with accessories. There is no upgrading this time, so if any aspect of this game is linear, it would be the items you get.The music is what is truely amazing throughout the whole game and what really makes it enjoyable. There is an easy option so if you want to experience the soundtrack and just play the story, that would be a possibility.The puzzles... well the clock one can be really annoying and gets very tedious, there is a site on Google that you can put in the values and get the solution if these gets frustrating or tedious. The platform and connect the dots are more enjoyable.There are 2 technical issues encountered, one is the regular fps drops which is mostly during free-roam, so it doesn't ruin anything. Cutscenes and battles never were affected for me. The other issue is rather annoying and that is this strange super load static buzz when opening the game. A trip to google will give you the info on setting a certain file to admin which eliminated the noise.Overall it was fun for a playthrough, the music was the highlight of it all, the combat entertaining, story decent enough. Playing as Serah in her swimsuit was fun too. Noel can go away though, he reminds me of Sora from Kingdom Hearts with the voice of Tidus from FF10. Caius was cool.Personal experience score: 9/10Story: 8/10 - Can be confusing because it is based on time travelling between rifts, but it was something different and better than FF13. A lot more despair in this one though which is why it intrigues me.Sound: 10/10 - The soundtrack shines pretty quickly with some epic and intense music that rivals FF14 primal fights,Graphics: 8/10 - Great improvement from FF13 PS3 version. However it has fps quite a few fps drops while free roaming.Controls: 9/10 - Pretty much what you know from FF13, switching between roles for those large attacks can be annoying when you have to move fast and scroll through the list.Game Length: 10/10 - 40 hours of content about if you do a large portion of the adventuring and collecting. A bit more if you want to get max gear and do the super bosses in the coliseum.			"

												Originally held off getting this game for the PS3 after finding out there was only 2 playable characters, and again you could only control 1 character at any one time; however I'm glad i picked this game up eventually on the PC, the gameplay is great, imo a lot better than FFXIII. Would definitely recommend playing with a controller (Although that may be due to me being so used to playing Final Fantasy games on a console, playing them with a keyboard feels very awkward).  "

												I own this for my PS3 and decided to get it on PC. 100% trophies then, going to get 100% achievements now. Anyways, to review the fact that it is a port, it's not bad. It's crashed twice within a couple of hours (near the beginning of the second chapter), and has gotten slightly choppy in a few cutscenes (maybe 15-20fps). I have the game on full settings, which would be 1080p, 16xAA, and 8K shadowing. The main components of my system are...AMD FX 8370 Eight-Core 4.0GHzXFX Nvidia Geforce GTX 970 4GB16 GB 1600MHz RAMWindows 10 64-BitSo, seeing as how I can make almost ultra settings in the new Doom, it should've fully worked for a game several years old. It does, it's fully playable, it's just that the odd massive effect(s) can get in the performance's way. I'm setting compatibilty to Windows 7, so I'll update if it has a lack of crashing. I heard Windows 10 started it. EDIT: Still crashes. Not every few minutes or anything, but I think it may have something to do with autosaves.IMPORTANT EDIT: While inconvienent, there is a way to stop the game's crashing. Just disable it's cloud saving within it's properties in Steam. Never crashed again. How to fix the frames? Don't get cocky with your computer. I know, the game should be high-end friendly, but it isn't. Lower the shadow resolution (4K works decent for me). 8K can actually be a bit too crisp with shadows, so like PC Gamer mentioned, use 2K - 4K. As much as some complain about the graphics altogether, deal with it. Games are supposed to be fun, not just pretty. That's why I hate mentioning graphic quality when it's not necessary.The other problem with it's porting would be the interface/messages. Myself, and I'm sure many others, use the 360 controller. It works great. Feels just like the console. The problem is, the game doesn't care. It has a controller layout screen in the title's settings, but every in-game message will tell you commands for the keyboard. You'll have to realize that the in game controller showing setting will need to be changed, as well as the title (at least, that's the only way it worked for me). The keyboard controls look like crap too, so I fully recommend controller.Were I not to talk about it being a port, I'd give it a 9/10. Some days, I may change my mind and say 8/10, but it's still really good. It fixes the main-character-game-over problem from the first game, and adds a monster using ability. The random-enconter fashion it uses is cool to experience for people wanting somewhat old-game type random encounters (not exactly the same). The part about it I love the most is the reality/time travel. It's really neat to go to some of the same places in the future/past or after a different event happens that would change the future.Negatives? Well, you still have to understand a little bit about FFXIII. Like the Fal-Cie, the Cocoon, and so on. They're not too important, but it's just good to know some of these things in order to understand a few conversations. My reason for this being a negative is that I never came to understand everything in the first game, so recognizing it now, especially after a couple of years away from it, is hard. The other negative? Well, it has a sequel. A crappy one. I really want to explain my reason as to why I mention this, but that would involve telling a bit about the story, and I don't want to put out spoilers.Anyways, great game, recommend to any RPG player without a picky, Square-hating, closed-in mind. I know a few. They're terrible to talk to about FF games.Oh, and you have to press ESC to exit. No menu selection. Just thought I'd add that.			"

												Did Final Fantasy XIII need a sequel? Probably not.But it does not change the fact that I found it enjoyable altogether despite a few questionable selection of music and story direction.Sure it will not appeal to everyone but hey, if you enjoyed FFXIII, might as well give XIII-2 a try.That aside, the pc port did drop a lot (for me) at 20fps during battle and jumping from 30-60fps on field.Played using the dlc patch (1.2 used, now at 2.0 and above) found in the forums.8/10P.S. I played through FFI (nes,psp), FFII(nes, psp), FFIII(DS), FFIV(DS), FFV(SNES), FFVII(PS1), FFVIII(PS1) , FFIX(PS1), FFXIII(360,PS3).			"

												While I would recommend it for it's great story and combat. (I've been dragged in to it really hard)I can't recommend it for it's... *ahem* bugs.What it seems to me is literally a complete port with the only addition of the ""steam sychronization"" and keyboard buttons.Since anything like steam overlays or your screensaver (Yes, I hard to restart the opening sequence because of my screen saver) can break/frezze the game.It's a great game that I fantastically enjoy. I can't recommend it for it's bugs.The ways to solve this is for a long screensaver and no overlay. (Not even steam's)			"

												I never write reviews on here, and it was actually almost a year ago that I played through this (or possibly longer). I just want to make sure that people know that this game is actually really awesome. In my opinion, it's the best in the XIII trilogy.I was really close to getting all of the achievements in this game, but there are a couple that would have required some serious time investment to acquire.A lot of people play RPGs because of the storyline, etcetera, but I pick up these games because I love the character progression. I love seeing numbers pop up as I damage enemies, and I enjoy being able to measure my progress in terms of gear, skills, and levels. This game has a nice, steady progression, where you are gaining skill points after every battle.If you are sitting on the fence with this one, I urge you to give it a proper playthrough. I think you'll enjoy it as well.			"

												I'm running an i5-2400 paired with an rx 470 4gb model. Actual gameplay runs at a consistent 30 fps, pre-rendered cutscenes are at a consistent 30 fps (obviously), and ingame cutscenes run at a consistent 60 fps for me. I have msaa set to 2x, res at 1080p, shadow mapping at 2000 (somewhere along those lines), and in fullscreen mode. The combat is semi-realtime as in there's no pauses ina  fight but you still do all your actions via a menu you navigate whilst you have no control over movement. Soundtrack is also stellar thus far and I'd recommend a pickup just for that. Pales in comparison with the port of the sequel though, Lighting Returns, which actually runs at a constistent 60 fps at all times in dynamic mode, and I've no idea why Square couldn't have done what they did to Lighting Returns to FF13-2 and FF13, which I don't own FF13 but I hear has the exact same problems framerate wise since they were released in conjunction on Steam. This type of port is usually grounds for me to not recommend the game, but this runs miles ahead better than the ps3 and xbox 360 versions do, which can usually drop around single digit framerates in certain areas. If you really need to play the FF13 games, it is ultimately better to play them on Steam even if they are half-baked ports, since they are completely raw on console.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII-2: The horrible port.But well, there are ways to work around if you have certain specs. XIII-2 works absolutely fine on my laptop, which is a G551JM that runs on a GTX 860M. Hence, if you're owning an i7 with a graphic card of like a GTX 860M or something of that sort, it should run at a frame rate of at least 30 fps. If the game runs well, then it's miles ahead of the console version, that's for sure. Having options such as 1080p and FXAA etc certainly helps deliver a way more graphically pleasing product than on the weak PS3. Just make sure to have a virtual controller running or a physical controller plugged in with options such as Triple Buffering enabled, and all should be fine. Overall, for me, very enjoyable buy.

												I purchase this game because i wanted to play Final Fantasy XIII and its two sequels. In general, it is a great game, but it had for me a lot of crashes. I know this was only for PS3 at the beginning, so i can't complain much with the bad port. In fact, I'm thankful that this game could be played on PC. Below i will put the pros and cons.Pros:- Good graphics- Great story- A wide variaty of monsters to tame- Some choices to answer in some conversations (That doesn't have Final Fantasy XIII)Cons:- It's a bad port. It crashed a lot for me.- Most of the choices in conversations doesn't affect the game.- In order to fully complete this game, you have to beat the final boss. (Well maybe it's not   bad but i always want to beat the game when i completed everything from the game)In conclusion, it is a great game, but it has its issues. If you are a fan of FF, i recommend to buy it.			"

												DON'T BUY THIS GAME.I must say that this game is a scam! It is barely playable/unstable on a GTX1070 or any other over powered PC. It will continually skip from 60 fps to sub 20 fps with no amount of tweaking making it any better. It is an embarrassment to Square that this game has their name attached, and if they were able to feel any shame for releasing broken unplayable games on Steam they should IMMEDIATELY pull this game from the store.     If you are considering buying this game, DON'T.     If you feel that your PC is very powerful and it should be able run this game, DON'T.     If this game is on special and you feel like: ""What do I have to loose?"", DON'T! That this game is still listed in the store with Square knowing what a broken unplayable mess it is shows nothing but contempt and utter disrespect for their customer. The fact that they are unwilling to hire a single programmer to optimize the game as a courteous ""I'm sorry"" to every person that purchased this mess, however, are still willing to keep it listed in the store to steal money from any new gullible persons demonstrates the malicious greediness behind the publishers.This game is the equivalent of you purchasing an apple from me and biting into it only to find out it is full of worms and completely rotten. You then try to complain to me about it only to have me ignore you completely. You then notice that there is a big crowd of persons angrily trying to tell me the same thing. Ignoring everyone I continue to sell the exact same rotten apples to anyone that is gullible enough to take them. A few years later and I'm still here selling the same rotten apples. This stuff should be illegal. This review is accurate as of 3/5/17.** UPDATE **One thing I forgot to mention is that the vast majority of the positive reviews for this game are for the game on console. On console I DO find the game to be fun and would definitely recommend that anyone that gets a chance should check it out. However my review for the PC port still stands and this game has an extremely disproportionate amount of ""recommends"" because of the console version.Think of it this way: I scammed you by selling you rotten apples but you still give me a thumbs up in your review because in general you really like apples even though mine are trash and I knowingly stole from you. 3/26/17			"

												Finished the main story line. Now to play some more! With tons of included DLC and post-game content there's an insane amount of extra hours worth of gameplay after you kill the big baddy. The storyline while awesome does feel built around the time gate mechanic instead of the other way around.What I mean by that is that the story comes in chunks rather than in previous FF's that tell their story from A to Z as you play. It's a bit tough to explain but on the plus side, it's always exciting to see another storypart revealed.Visually it's great, as expected. The audio is bloody fantastic, with great music and even the US voiceovers (of the 2 protagonists especially) are very, VERY well done. Combat is expanded upon compared to FFXIII, with an extensive catch-'m-all monster (and infusion) system, and a blast to behold.The Crystarium, one tip, don't just level it! Get a FAQ and check how to proper level it because it's not like in FFXIII. You can actually become either very powerful or gimp yourself hard if you just level your roles without second thought.I'm on a Radeon 4870HD card and 1650x1080 (my max res) was playable but smoother in 1400x900, which is the resolution I've ended up using.I still need to upgrade to a modern card someday so I can't confirm or deny any performance issues with this game.Mind you, I finished FFXIII before the release of the gfx options/FFXIII-2 on 1650x1080 without too much graphical stress. Both games work fine on my old videocard and i7 PC.All in all, a great entry and I can't wait for the FFXIII: LR to complete the trilogy.			"

												A continuation of the same discordant, incoherent design process that left the first installment in the series unable to fulfill its potential and what prompted them to have to rename Versus 13 as Final Fantasy 15 in what was one of the most embarrassing presentations in video game history.The trick to making a good sequel, is to make the story far enough apart from the original to convey a sense of continuity and progression to the player, whilst making it not too far apart so as to leave the player feeling like they're in fact playing a game that isn't a sequel at all. Final Fantasy 13-2 fails in the latter sense, by gutting the original story at the point of its conclusion and relegating all existing playable characters to little more than inconsequential cameo roles, thus destroying any sense of connection players of the first game in the series might have established with either the story, or the characters in it.The new playable characters are weak, uncharismatic and instantly forgettable, this is made all the worse by the fact that there are only two playable characters in the game, so there are no strong party characters around to carry them. You can of course add Gremlin Type A or otherwise any one of a number of the million types of anonymous creatures roaming around on Pulse to your battle team, but as cool a concept as that is, it doesn't make up for the lack of playable characters here. They said Moogles would be back in 13-2, but given the fact that half the population of Pulse is unaware they're even real and most of them thinks your one; most creatively named ""Mog"" by the story producers, is a stuffed toy that runs on batteries, one has to wonder just how ""back"" they are.The leveling in this game is atrocious, it really is, to the extent that you have to buy the guide to make any meaningful sense of it, perhaps that was deliberate, I don't know, but planning character progression in any meaningful sense in the this game is barely possible. The all new re-designed crystarium, pretty much leaves you leveling up blind as what the future might hold in store, it is much less clearly presented than the crystarium of the previous game and will leave you either hitting up Google to work out what the hell you're supposed to do with it, or just repeatedly spamming the blasted thing until you run out of CP.The graphics are average even when measured by those of the era in which the game was released. In this PC version, frame drops are constant, performance is poor and there's little to nothing you can do about it, there may have been one or two times where my GPU has managed to dump a full second's worth of frame's onto my screen without half of them going missing down the Historia Crux, but if there were I didn't notice them. I'm using a Skylake i5 build with a GTX1070, I lose as many frames gaming at 4k as I do at 1080p, which doesn't make sense, but then time travel can be a tricky thing.The sound track, is the worst RPG video game sound track I have ever heard. Although the music is very creative and I am eclectic enough to have thrash metal, easy listening and techno on the same play list, in a fantasy adventure video game it is entirely inappropriate, nonsensical, stupidity. The music in this game, provides absolutely no sense of immersion and is in no way, at any point complimentary to ANYTHING you are ever doing, anywhere in space or time... EVER. It is beyond merely pondering the question ""what were they thinking?"", a paradox, more serious a threat to the space time continuum I feel, than any you are likely to encounter in this game's story. Add to that the fact that you can't adjust the music's volume, or turn it off and you just end up wanting to tear off your eyelids and scrunch them up into ear plugs. On the bright side, I have found a new jingle to use as my wake up alarm in the battle analysis theme.Many lamented the publisher's decision to bring battle transitions back in the first game of the series, considering them to be a gameplay flow violating necessity of yesteryear's technology, but they've gone one further in this game and from the ark of nostalgia have resurrected random encounters also. The environments you walk around in this game are utterly devoid of all animate life, until suddenly you find yourself; out of nowhere, accosted by the Cei'th, the Flan and the Fuggly and it happens, every god damn 30 seconds. Getting from point A to B, without being incessantly interrupted by this game putting unavoidable, completely unforeseeable obstacles in front of you makes the task of circumnavigating this game's world an irritating, rage inducing, nightmare. Random Encounters were best left down the Historia Crux, along with Battle Transitions, leave nostalgia to the emulators, or that SNES we've all had stuck up in the attic for the last 30 years, there they were necessary, here and now, they're just a pain in the eyeball. I have ""twitches"", this game's insistence that I must stop what I'm doing and do something else I don't want to do, whenever it wants me to, unconditionally, thrice minutely, has given me a tick.Although this game is more balanced than the first in the series, it still suffers from putting unbeatable enemies in your way whenever it feels like it, all you can do in this instance, is run around areas you've already explored, fighting fights you've already won, against enemies you've already beaten, leveling up, over and over. Fortunately, you're never short of enemies, just spend 30 seconds walking in a straight line, through an abandoned tunnel or sun kissed meadow and as if my magic, they'll find you, again and again and again and again and again, until you literally want to die, as painfully as possible, so in the last seconds of your existence, you can be reminded again of what it felt like to have the will to live. You could of course drop the difficulty level to easy, but then I just end up getting infuriated by the developer's apparent lack of interest in creating sensibly leveled enemies. The game even suggests that you can you can drop the battle difficulty to easy to overcome tough opponents, when I read that, I saw ""couldn't be bothered to spend time building coherently leveled areas"".Will I continue playing? Absolutely, because I want to see just how thoroughly awful this game can get, oh and I'm training to be a monk, so I want to subject myself to as much abject torture and irritation as possible, to enhance my sense of patience and make me realize just how much more complete my life would be without video games. Not only that, but I'm looking forward to playing Final Fantasy 13 - Lightning Returns and want to make sure the bar is really, really low, so I wont be disappointed 3 times in a row.EDIT - Now over 60 hours in and losing the will to live. The game encourages you to find collectables throughout, which requires you to revisit levels you've already beaten the rotten corpse of to death 10 times over and explore, but it never leaves you alone for long enough to do so. As written earlier, this game constantly interupts you, it can't leave you alone for 30 seconds, it's one of the rudest, most intrusive video games I have played in the modern era, it just bombards you over and over with repetivie, monotonous battles you can win with one finger and and A button. I can only imagine that nobody involved in creating this game ever actually took the time to sit down and play it and that because of that, didn't grow to develop any appreciation for how annoying it is. That profressional game designers, made some of the design decicions that plague this game like an insurmountable infestation of unparalleled buggery, is beyond all reasonable comprehension, I can only imagine it must be some kind of time paradox, that gave them all brain rot a few milliseconds after they started.

												PRO - Easy to play for those who beat or played part 1 - The achievements are obtainable if you put the effort in  - Music was cool for most areas of the game  - I didn't have many crashes from the game as some may have experienced - I will recommend this game to those who have played part 1 to see the storyline(even though it is not great) CON - Storyline is not that great  - They use the same enemies for all areas, they just changed their color and made small changes to some. This is because they color code what class they are which makes sense, but they should have put more effort in making them look different. I got really bored of seeing the same enemies over and over and over and over and over again........  - The game has 2 difficulties(Normal or Easy). Normal is too easy.  - I felt like they made this game all about sidequests instead of concentrating on the main storyline.  - The fact that you could not play with any of the original charcters from part 1 sucks.  OTHER - Not sure if this is a good or bad thing, but changing the way you level up your characters from part 1. If you JUST want to beat the game then no problem, but for boss quests etc.. you have to be a little careful because some some classes give you more atk, magic, and just hp. So eitherway it's up to the player. "

												I enjoyed this game when it was released on Xbox 360. The only reason I do not recommend this version of Final Fantasy XIII-2 is simply because this is a terrible port. I've gone through dozens of reddit and Steam community threads on disabling steam cloud saves among other crash/freeze remedies (which is a tad ridicuous that a customer has to go through all that leg work). Sadly, the game is completely unplayable as it crashes and freezes frequently. I've spent 5 hours today troubleshooting different solutions and I'm throwing in the towel.I encourage you to pass on this version of the game until SE provides better PC support. "

												I purchase this game because i wanted to play Final Fantasy XIII and its two sequels. In general, it is a great game, but it had for me a lot of crashes. I know this was only for PS3 at the beginning, so i can't complain much with the bad port. In fact, I'm thankful that this game could be played on PC. Below i will put the pros and cons.Pros:- Good graphics- Great story- A wide variaty of monsters to tame- Some choices to answer in some conversations (That doesn't have Final Fantasy XIII)Cons:- It's a bad port. It crashed a lot for me.- Most of the choices in conversations doesn't affect the game.- In order to fully complete this game, you have to beat the final boss. (Well maybe it's not   bad but i always want to beat the game when i completed everything from the game)In conclusion, it is a great game, but it has its issues. If you are a fan of FF, i recommend to buy it.			"

												This port is terrible. I mean really, really horrible. A game with graphics like these should run at a silky smooth 60 fps at all times on my rig. As is, most overworlds run at 35 fps, and battles can really chug at 20 (some bosses are even sub 20.)That having been said, the game is phenomenal. It's a unique final fantasy, and also quite different from XIII. It retains most of the positive elements of XIII (such as an excellent battle system) while avoiding the linearity that XIII was panned for. In addition to being much more linear, the story is far easier to follow. This speaks volumes about the over complication of XIII, that its sequel about time travel is easier to follow. However, with the added freedom of exploration, it's lost some of the focus that XIII had. Also, I don't like the soundtrack as much. Too much J-pop for me. Buy this game on steam if you don't have a PS3 or X360. Either way, buy this game. It's a lot of fun. But Square, we NEED a performance patch!			"

												I surprised myself by playing this, as I hated XIII with a passion.  The only thing I was interested in was Lightning.  I read that this game fixed a lot of the problems of the first so I gave it a bash not expecting much.This is leagues ahead of the first game.  It's back to more traditional Final Fantasy elements - proper exploration, side quests, interactive story, secrets and MOG!  I was thoroughly entertained by this game and I loved the little surprises it has!  The after-game coliseum, I can tell you, is a REAL treat for old timers of the series (very old timers, think pre-playstation).  There's Chocobo racing in a Gold Saucer tribute location along with other mini games.  Especially loved the poker!  I really appreciated the addition of Mog.  He brought humour to the rather heavy storyline.  And when the Government gives him tissue instead of Gil?  Priceless. He was just yet another nod to the fans.I was really impressed by the voice acting - especially of Noel.  Music is great too.I enjoyed Hope's character development in this one.  He annoyed me quite a bit in the first game although I warmed to him as he matured toward the end of the game.  In this installment he has fully matured, both physically and mentally and it's lovely to see how he has turned out.  He was definitely my favourite in this.The downside is perhaps the story.  Although time travel gives this game the tools to be free for the player, it has made the XIII universe more complicated than necessary.  It often leaves more questions than answers and many things simply don't make sense.  It is better than the first game, but then it surpasses that in almost everyway.  The ending is also an epic troll - be prepared to play Lightning Returns for even a chance of satisfaction.All in all, I would recommend this game, especially if you got through the first - this is your pay off.

This game sure took me a while to play and i had to fight for it, but thanks to all the community guide and discussions, it all went and worked well. I am glad i suffered enough to play this game, the fan service was well put, i even tried to slow motion it about 5 times just to get a good wank at it. So yeah, pretty good. And to those who say this wasnt great or anything, well if you look at the charts, XIII sold more than your favorites, like ff 7 or whatever. #roasted. so yeah, buy it if youre willing to fight for it			"

												It's a good game, but not a good Final Fantasy game! (you know what I mean)There is a lot of people complaining about FF XIII trilogy. I know they are suck in Final Fantasy term, but if you take them outside that fantasy universe, you will find these games are much enjoyable. Especially for the last 2 parts.Story: Even I went throught the part 1, the story of this sequel somehow confused me. Their link is very weak. The idea to split the full story into small one is great, but the way they did is not satisfying. However, I give them a compliment for bringing back a true villain character (in part 1, all the evil characters are boring).  I like Noel, a new character. I wish he were with Serah instead of that stupid Snow but you know SE, they have issue in making a couple.  The ending is great and surprising, somehow painful. Gameplay: There are 2 things make this game shining. You can hunt, tame monsters and then make them your allies.Unlike the first part, now you can control only 2 characters: Noel and Sarah and one slot for whatever you put it.  Each monster has its own power and type: Commando, Ravager, Sentinel, etc. (sound familiar?). Some rare (and powerfull too)  monsters appear in specific location at specific time and conditions. It's time to make a collection and I am sure that everyone loves to have Chocobos in their list! Time is a bi*** in this game and you have to f*** that bi*** As I mentioned above, the game story is splitted into small fractions and you have to travel through (or back) flow of time to gather all of them. You have to find some special items or finish plot part to unlock other time points. You could be confused at first, but you will get familiar soon!  I advise you have a piece of paper and a pen to note down anything on your journey, or else you will get stuck and wander around in this messy time river.  There are some mini puzzles that I found boring and annoying (clock, crystal link) but it's my personal opinion. Combat is more satisfying in this game as it is faster, smoother (when you switch paradigms) than its predecessor. And if you finish the main game, you can experience a thrilling, hilarious and exciting Battle Arena in DLCs. There's a bunch of familiar fighters in Square Enix Universe.Music and sound: The sound effects are okay. For real, I am not a guy into this aspect unless the sound is too bad to recognize. I don't like the new style of music in this triology and this part 2 too. Most of the songs is too modern (rap and rock in Final Fantsy game??) Howerver, there are 2 songs I love the most: Noel's and Yeul's themes. So sad yet so addictive, like their stories.  If you hate FF XIII triology because of the part 1, think again and give this XIII-2 a chance! It deserves that! "

Also play 13 first/ Hallway Simulator.This game should have been a free DLC for 13, instead. Because it is just a cash grab for Square Enix and cheaply made, but not rushed. The visuals are spectacular, but it's just your everyday walking on the beach simulator. My rating for this is a 6.8/10.Recommended for only hardcore Final Fantasy Fans.			"

												A technical DESASTER!Yes maybe the game is alright, maybe better than the first....i wouldn't know. 1 Hour in with the patched version and i have given up. Delete and forget. When the steam version came out it was infamously awful. After several mods and patches one might assume it is alright and running fine now? NO! The FPS is all over the place, can't reach it's target FPS at anypoint (aside from in and outside of battle using 2 different FPS targets). The ""fps hack"" helped but the game is still slowing down, the music is cracking for a second just to jump back. Same with animations. One should remind himself, that this is not Witcher 3, not The Division. It's a PS3 game that looks alright but at no point shows why it's currently killing my i5 and my Geforce 970 GTX.On the message board you read ""don't give a bad review...the game is good...or it's alright...well it doesn't suck...atleast not to that degree"". But really it deserves every flack it gets. It's a technical failur for a game that might actually be fine (what i played was quite alright), but iam not going to keep my voice in just for the off chance i might‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•SE off and make them can any plan for a PC release of FF15 (which seems to be a common thought around here).Save your money, get Zero HD if you NEED JRPG, that one atleast runs well and is quite an interesting game.

												There's a lot to be said about the Final Fantasy XIII series of games and a lot to debate about. Some love it. Some hate it. If you dig your RPGs to be a little more action-oriented and faster paced, XIII-2 will be right up your alley (after you play through XIII first as this is a direct continuation of that story line.)For a game from 2012 built for hardware from 2006 it's a pretty game. Sadly, concerning the graphics/performance of this title is my big, and only, gripe: the PC version is not well optimized and has some pretty wacky stuff going on.You'll notice that the features of the game specify that the title sports a 60fps framerate and that's technically true, but misleading in how one would expect. First of all, you're going to need a decently beefy rig to play this game smoothly at 30fps due to the pitiful optimation for PC. Second of all, yes, you might hit 60 fps here or there, but the internal engine applies restrictive frame limiters at multiple points so don't expect that frame rate to stick.Any cutscene shot that focuses on Noel runs nice and smooth at 60. Shift to Serah or any other character? Hard drop to 30. Running around the map at a nice 60 before it loads a new area and you've got another drop. Battle start? Drop to 30 until the victory animation, then snap back to 60. My system is not being taxed, mind you, it's just how the game operates, which is disappointing. XIII did not have this problem on my end (save for some cutscenes that were hard-limited to 30 fps here and there).The soundtrack is amazing - wide variety of styles and genres. There's plenty of tracks that hit the right emotional beats to go with the story and lots of great blood-pumping battle tunes to get you into the fight, ready to take on the world.The story is great, not entirely needed as a follow up to XIII as it feels pretty shoe-horned in to make some more money, but it's serviceable and enjoyable. It's nice to play as the damsel in distress from the first game and Noel is a good companion and a welcome addition to the cast.Fun RPG, great experience, and while far from being the PC port it could have been, it is the superior version to the console editions.

												This game was quite a disappointment for me. It took me two attempts to finish it: one on PS3 but I got bored and stopped playing, and the other on PC, the latter of which I was successful in completing after a fair amount of forcing myself to keep going. Despite really liking FFXIII while still recognizing it has weaknesses (for me, it was plot holes and post-game stuff), I could not enjoy FFXIII during the great majority of my time playing it.Where to begin? This is a port, so let's talk about that first. It runs -terribly- compared to FFXIII. FFXIII ran like butter for me, while FFXIII-2 was choppy and near-unplayable on the same PC until I installed a user-made 30 FPS capping app from the Steam discussion page. After that, it was a little choppy still, with character lip synching off by a few seconds, but it was definitely playable. The controls and everything else about the port were just dandy for me.Do not play this if you haven't completed FFXIII or at least watched all the cutscenes from FFXIII, as it would be very confusing otherwise. Speaking of confusing, villain's plan isn't described well enough to make total sense, nor is much of the storyline, with plot threads such as Mog's origin and why people from a survival-focused era when less than 10 humans are left on the planet would wear stylish, ornate, colorful clothing in a barren wasteland, fighting for their lives, wanting to survive. It would be like if Rick and friends on The Walking Dead were decked out in bling, bright blue parachute pants, etc., while being pursued by zombies. The female lead in the game magically gets new clothing and there is no explanation as to why. The female lead should've just had a new outfit naturally, since she's living in a full-on civilization, and the male lead could get the magical clothing to replace his rags, but instead the writers chose to lack all logic with this decision. Now, many humans can suddenly use magic, whereas before, it was only l'Cie that could do it. I actually liked that plot point in FFXIII, so I would have preferred that only l'Cie and ex-l'Cie can use it, because only one human in the entire game would need a writing modification to explain why that character can use magic. Only ONE. Changing the rules of the lore is just weird and unnecessary. One major character from FFXIII becomes a l'Cie in FFXIII-2, but you never see it happen, it doesn't seem to have any importance in the storyline, and you never hear any resolution to it or see that character in the ending despite that character being one of the most important characters in the universe for one of the heroes.Also, the ending of the game can be pretty aggravating/upsetting/disappointing. I didn't upset me anywhere near as badly as Mass Effect 3's ending, but it's gotta be in my top 10 most disappointing endings if I bothered to make such a list. I didn't believe another reviewer who claimed that the ending would‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•me off, and I regret it. That reviewer was absolutely right. I honestly recommend that you just watch all the cinematics and cutscenes, which you can watch spliced together on Youtube. It would've saved me 50-something hours, at least.This game has a battle system which is almost completely identical to FFXIII's. The only biggest differences are that battles are random with the player being able to slash the opponent to start with haste and part of the enemy's stagger bar filled. Oh, and you use the male and female lead, and a monster as your third party member. You can use almost any monster in the game, but each can only do one role in the paradigm system, and you have to feed items to the monsters to level them up, which ends up being a time-suck if you want to make a really good monster. Much of the time, my human characters were lords of war when I was in a fight, while my monsters were just sucking badly. This game was also much, much easier than FFXIII for me as well, and I'm pretty awful at this kind of game. The final boss was annoying, but other than that, I didn't even have to try on most of the bosses, and I just set my team to all Commandos for every non-boss fight, winning within 20 seconds or less after about 55% or so completing of the game's story. This game might just have the worst experience scaling of any FF game I've ever played, because half-way through, fights were giving me 400-440 XP and those encounters were nearly twice as frequent to pop up as the rest of the game's random battles, which gave more like 225 XP per fight.The music was very similar to that of FFXIII, with a few reused songs here and there, and a few songs that I really disliked which probably would be classified as metal, which isn't really my thing. I liked the voice acting as well, except for the villain, who came off a bit too melodramatic for my taste.There is a casino, which sounded cool, but the interesting-sounding activities are locked off as DLC (it's including but you can't use the DLC until you finish the game's entire main storyline), and everything else either requires a lot of time (Chocobo Racing which most players say is garbage compared to FFVII's), or is all about randomness, which is the slot machines. To get items I wanted from the casino slots without wasting my life away, I had to clamp down Tab on my keyboard for hours and walk away while it autoplayed, reloading my game if I didn't make money. The casino in this game just wasn't fun for me.Last but not least, this game does have a post-game. That's not really my bag, but I did try to collect all of the Fragments (hidden objects in the game), and got 122 of 160 of them. I called it quits when I got about 85% through the story and a quest-giver basically tells your ""Lulz. The writers could've written this in somehow within your first hour of playing so you could prepare and not have such a daunting task, but screw you! I need you to fight every type of monster in the entire game including weird fights that you do for choosing incorrect dialog options during the storyline, etc., and you will likely have to consult an online guide and spent countless hours to get my Fragment,"" but I'm paraphrasing his lines from memory. Seriously, what a jackass move. And is it worth it? Getting all of the Fragments? At least half of my time at my computer with this game was spent getting Fragments, and all they do is give you some data files you could just look up online, help you get the secret ending (just watch it on Youtube after you finish the game) which makes a lot less sense than the original and still has the bad things happen that might anger you, and boosts the stats of the two lead characters. That stat boost, though? I had 122 Fragments, which gave me 40 higher attack attribute scores than I would have if I'd used the next best weapons which were on sale at the normal stores for CHEAP. My attack attribute was over 1100, so losing 40 points just wouldn't have mattered except when going for post-game optional bosses.In summary, the game has a pretty good soundtrack, a competent battle system with a third ""party member"" that disappoints unless you're willing to put in a lot of time, a so-so story with an anger-inducing ending, a crappy casino, hellish amounts of busy work to find all the Fragments, and a secret ending that's a complete let-down even though I didn't do all the work to get it. I cannot recommend this game, but I would say that the 7 hours it would take you to watch all the cutscenes and moviews from it in Youtube would be worth your time if you believe me and other reviewers that the ending really does deliver a low blow, and you were a big enough fan of FFXIII that you care to see what happens next (though Fal'Cie and l'Cie are rarely brought up and most FFXIII characters have very little screen time).

												Note that I have never played XIII/XIII2 on console. I have only played FFX on console, FFXIII on PCGameplay: Very similar to FFXIII, improved in a few ways, but feels identical. Overall very fun game play for turn-based.Controls: I would really like to have more configurations and customization opitions for my controls, but other than that it's fine. They also fixed the esc key which is awesome.Resolution/Graphics: Very nice, I have been having no lag related issues, very clean. One problem I do have is the ability not to re-size windowed mode because it is fixed.Sound: Very nice soundtrack and Japanese or english language for me is perfect.Characters: I am actually very upset that you are not able to play Lightning. The picture of the game is Lightning, the trailer is all Lightning, and the first 5minutes is Lightning. HOWEVER YOU DO NOT GET TO PLAY LIGHTNING OTHER THAN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES. It really sucks that you only have 2 character opitions in this game. I really wished that they would advertise the game as more to what the game entails. Advertise Noel and Serah, Lightning isn't even playable, why advertise her for everything and make people think she is one of the main characters again. I seriously can't stress how much that is bugging me from enjoying the game more.Story: Great so far! Really like how they are giving you more say in how the story goes, however I would really perfer a completely linear storyline (that's just me) for this type of series.OVERALL: Buy it if you liked FFXIII or any of the previous FF. This is a great game and buy, however I see no reason that you would buy it on PC if you own a PS/Xbox because you can have superior controls and identical everything else (unless there is a huge price difference). And again... really wish I could play Lightning... I guess I have to wait till Lightning Returns :(.			"

												I've played almost  20 hours and tried so many methods to fix the FPS issue, nothing seems to work. I've installed this game on a brand new laptop that surpasses minimum requirements and I still run this game at 10-20 FPS. Considering FFXIII had (arguably) better graphics, I'm surprised this game doesn't run  half as smooth. However.. I love Lightning and this trilogy, so I'm willing to see past this issue. The game so far is nice, I personally have no issue with the ""convoluted"" time traveling aspect and anything related to Lightning is a plus in my book. This game really isn't as bad as people portray it to be, if you enjoyed the first game and want closure/continuation on Lightning's story: get this game.  "

												If you played FFXIII, which you should, and you were expecting the continuation of the ""story"" I am sad to say you will not get that. The story in this was even more headache inducing than the previous game. The battle system remained the same with the addition of catching monsters and adding them to your party to fight along side you. This could have been great. However, the low chance of you getting the monster you want to spawn, and join your party is a bit vexing but that is not all. If you want your monster to actually be worth a damn, you need to catch other monsters to fuse with it and level that SoB before it can be fused. Meaning, farming, heaps of farming will be had. If you're intending to use the cute monsters, they are worthless in battle. I tried, I eventually had to retire Cait Sith as he was just not gonna cut it. Sad. I'm on the fence about recommending this game or not. If you fancy yourself hours of grinding and some Pokemon battles, this is your game. Ignore the story though, it hurts to think about. Just look at the graphics, the scenery is lovely. This game gets a 6/10 from me. Probably should stop at FFXIII and not touch the sequels for sanity reasons. xD			"

												This game only just gets a thumbs up. it's a buggy mess.When comparing it to the first FF13 game I enjoyed the open areas and side quests more (it's still a JRPG and as such extremely linear but it was nice to take a break from the main  story every now and then), but that was about it.

												Before I started playing this game, I read all about the negative reviews, about how the battle system was terrible, that the storyline was not very well thought out, so on and so forth. This was my first ever Final Fantasy game, and I was thinking that it may have been a bad idea to buy this. Before I say anything else, I must say that this game is a love it or hate it kinda thing.So when I first started the game, I was rather confused by what the controls were, and how the game worked. Of course, it was my fault as I did not bother reading the instructions or tutorial that the game offered or provided. Nevertheless, after about an hour of playing (during which I was pretty much still in the first area that you start in), I got the hang of it. The battle mechanics and the various paradigms that you could switch to were more clear to me now.From that point on, it was smooth sailing, up until I first enccountered the main antagonist. I was hopelessly stuck at that portion, then I realised that this, being a RPG game, meant that grinding would be necessary. And grind I did. and FYI, it worked (eventually).A good point about this game is that even after you have defeated the final boss and completed the main storyline, which iin my case took about 40 hours, there are still things and people out there that will giive you a good thrashing. Even certain monsters that you may have defeated before countless times may take you down if you get a bit too complacent.Overall, I would rate the experience a 8.5/10, and greatly recommend it to others. Now, I'm just waiting for the next sequel to come out on Steam, at which point I'd likely pay the full price without waiting for a sale on Steam.			"

												The sucky:- Game runs like‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• constantly stutters, 60fps will be a struggle to keep.- Villain is lame- ""Random"" encounters are a downgrade from XIII- Lacks polish that XIII had- Lack of party characters (monsters are a bit meh)- Crystarium still sucks, but is slightly better than before- Only a couple of pre-rendered cinematics- Chocolina- No summons :(- Combat is mostly the same, but lacking eidolons, and other abilities, so it feels like there's less to do in a fight. Not many challenging main story fights until the end.The good:- Lots of side-content to persue- Time travelling and throwbacks to the first gameYes I hate on lots of things, but I enjoyed it overall. If you managed to enjoy XIII despite its flaws, there will be more enjoyment to find in XIII-2.			"

												I really like the previous game and don't care what people say about it. I love it for its story and characters, but not the gameplay.Final Fantasy XIII-2 got improved in almost everything! It's not linear anymore, the battle system is slightly better and you can also catch some monsters and make them fight for you.Music is phenomenal again, but that's probably nothing surprising. FF series always had great music.The only thing that is not so good in this one is, sadly, story. It is even more confusing than before, but I still found it pretty enjoyable. Even though there're not so many characters, but the main villain is awesome. Also the Japanese dubbing is fabulous, by the way.The port is bad as always, and the game has problems to run even on 30 FPS. I did not mind that much. I didn't even try any performance mods.I enjoyed playing XIII-2 more than its predecessor. Maybe because it was a bit shorter... I don't know. Everyone who had  complains about XIII should give this game a shot.I'm looking forward to Lightning Returns.			"

												I'll start this review with the obvious, that I am sure most reading will have seen time and time again. Yes. The graphical capabilities of this game on the PC are untrue. It runs slower than 60fps, sometimes dropping quite low in more intense battles / larger view battles. This is nota fault of anyone's PC, but how the game was programmed with the PS3 in mind, a poor architecture. It does not make use of the full capabilities of GPUs or Multi-core CPUs, therefore it will run similarly on older computers as it might on a state of the art. The software is the limit, not the hardware.That said, I do have an older PC. I played in a 720P window at that resolution using the smallest shadow-map, and 2x MPAA. It ran alright for the most part. As I said, it had it's slow moments, but was hardly unplayable as some might have suggested. I do play modern games at post 60fps, but do not find low FPS to be a kill all. I could probably have upped the shadow and AA and still been fine. No crashes, no critical flaws to the game in that regard. I could have been lucky, but that was my experience.Now then, on to the game review itself. Would I recommend this game? Yes.The story I find rather touching, if a little too sappy at times. I don't find it really killed the story of the first, but rather fleshes it out. The combat remains quite close to Final Fantasy 13, which is a plus, albiet there are times when I felt it was overly easy comparatively(explained later). The 'time-traveling' and 'gate-closing' mechanics give you chances to go back and redo areas to complete them differently where available. Unlike Final Fantasy 10-2, you do not need to replay the game through from the start multiple times to see everything. You will need to replay sections, but so far nothing I have seen too much repeating. The world is definitely more 'open' than it was in the first game. There is more to explore than narrow hallways. Still very closed in spaces comapred to /world maps/ in the older games, but better.Now for the things I did not care for. ""Ease"" of Battles:Battling in 13 seemed a bit more tactical than it is in 13-2. I attribute this to the libra spell which you could cast at will in the first game. In this game, there are librascopes you can find or buy for exorbitant prices about mid-game, but no actual simple libra-spell to get data on monsters initially. This means the game can't be too harsh for not paying complete attention to the monsters while you fight them. Without foreknowledge of the enemies, you just have to constantly hit them until information is revealed, often through multiple encounters. If you don't avoid fighting a long way through the game, most your 'random' battles until the very end will revolve around three commandos just nuking everything with blitz and ruinga. Auto-battle will be used overall, as very rarely do you need to worry about selecting proper skills.Not to say that there are no times it's better to manually control, especially if less than ideally leveled, but mostly that revolved around me applying proper debuffs to certain enemies. In that regard though, I felt a lot of the battles could just be brute-forced compared to 13, with only a few that it really mattered to focus on it all. Many times, if you didn't care about time too much, having a strong sentinal member(not too hard to get early on, and upgrade later) could really ease it.Speaking of character classes... The '3rd wheel' as it were of your 3rd party member. Rather than a single character with multiple classes, you capture and raise various monsters for the roles. Each monster only has a single role, and you can only have 'equipped' 3 monsters at a time to fill various roles. For the most part, this isn't a big deal... Raising them isn't too specifric unless you need uber monsters to help the uber enemies situation. Even then, I don't see the value in perfectly upgraded partners.And speaking up upgrades... The crysterium is very lack luster to me compared to the first game. I liked how you could choose which class to level in what order in the first game, but each character would ultimately max out at a certain stat level when all was finished. In the first game, you had a max level for a given area, which forced more strategy on the player as they could no brute force it as much. This game? Regular battles are basically infinite CP batteries. You will be maxed well before the end of the game, unless you really rush. How you level though, is is a single crysterium for all classes on each character. Depending which class you level though at different points in the crysterium(including even/odd levels on some classes) gives different bonus stats. In short, there is an ideal way of leveling each character, while others could leave you with somewhat less than great stats, depending which all you leveled. Nothing game-breaking, but if you are a perfectionist, prepare to study and research ideal leveling order.Lastly, a few of the 'fragments' in the game are a real time-sink and pain to get. Grinding certain enemies to get a lot of gil to just dump. At one point, taping a button on the controller down on the slot machines just to make sure I win a certain amount over a few hourts while I browsed the web. Battling every enemy at least once, including rare enemies and some that have a 50% chance of not spawning at all on a run through an area before you have to reset the area and try again. Making sure to explore every last detail of every map for 100% completion. Just... tedium work, really.That aside, I do not regret this purchase. It fixes some of the problems I had with FF13, but introduces different naggings. Despite my naggins though, I felt compelled to play it through and enjoyed the ride. A few points that were dull busy work, but overall a fun game. Just be prepared to look to the next game if you want any sort of conclusion, because this one literally pulls a Halo 2 with a ""To Be Continued...""			"

Plus, like 10-2, you can capture monsters and use to them too assist you combat, which isn't bad.  Features unique weapon & armor upgrades like part 1 of 10.  Just like any other Final Fantasy game, the story itself remains bizarre.  I just wish this game had more playable characters then just the 2 featured characters.  I only recommend this game to the die hard Final Fantasy fans...7.5 outta 10			"

												They definitely added a lot more since the first game! More exploration, side quests, not to mention the pokemon capture bit which really caught me off guard!! Seriously, you can fight with a chocobo. Why would you not want that?? Soundtrack wise the game is just as great as before! But I kinda feel like they went down a little in graphics, which wasn't too bad but not as amazing as the first. The characters developed a hell of a lot, and I'm not just talking about Hope  but damn he turned out fine as an adult! . They introduced a few new characters that added a lot more depth to the story, and the villian was by far way better than Barty (He's got a deep british accent and an epic theme!)The framerate was TERRIBLE at the beginning though! And I mean unplayable! BUT there's an easy fix for it that makes it run perfectly, so luckily that wasn't a real problem. Phew!Also, they added QTEs which unfortunately I didn't even realise were descisions and just clicked them at random... oops. They also apparantly influence the end... oops x2.Anyway, just buy it!

												Now this is the game that Final Fantasy XIII should have been, and this is coming from someone who actually liked the first game!XIII-2 feels like the product of Square addressing all the feedback from the first title. The plot is bonkers, but I found it enjoyably reminiscent of the older Final Fantasy titles. Don't forget that earlier games in the series had wise-crackin' octopi, evil warlord death trees, boats that fly you to the Moon, and yes, even time travel.My one caveat is that I did have to tweak some settings to get the game running smoothly, but honestly that's kind of the norm for PC gaming, isn't it? Once I got it just right, my game ran without any problems.For both players who enjoyed and disliked the first XIII title, I'd recommend giving this one a try. I'd give it two thumbs up, kupo!			"

												Having not played many of the older Final Fanttasy titles I feel biased to say theese are some of the best games I've played because I enjoyed them for what they offered in terms of gameplay and story, the port is not optimised at all so beware on buying this even if you have a decent computer.

												Positive:+Better Storyline/Ending than FF13+No more weapon upgrade system from FF13+Better Crystarium System, easier to max, and no cap like FF13 +Easy travel, many optional areasNegative:-This game will crash, sometimes freeze Steam bootstrapper-Puzzles, espically Hands of TimeMixed:+-Only two characters to play + monsters as third+-Early game difficulties, btu very easy end game+-Unlinear story+-Same Battle SystemOverall, I personally believe this game is far better than FF13 the original. Noel and Serah are better characters since there is really no character development that matters in FF13 the first. Soundtrack is good, battle system remains the same, Crystarium System is better. Great ending.			"

												All of your complaints with Final Fantasy XIII are pretty much gone here; Lightning has been replaced by her infinitely more interesting, emotional, and attractive sister. Serah. All the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•characters from XIII are trapped in some form of a crystal. Leona Lewis is no longer bleeding love on this game. And the hallways have been abolished in favor of slightly-less linear areas with NPC's and multiple paths. Combat is mostly the same, but the difficulty has been increased and requires a bit more effort and strategizing than auto-fighting in XIII did.Solid experience. Don't let XIII cloud your judgement. Pun not intended.And pretend that Lightning doesn't Return after this game. Pun intended.			"

												7.5/10I do not understand all the bad reviews about this game. While I do think that Final Fantasy XIII was better, this one is not a bad sequel. The story was interesting, and the game was in depth. I do think some things took it down in my eyes severly, however I did not run into many performance or graphical issues. All the negative reviews here based on performance made me hesitate to buy this game for years. After finishing the game I do not get the gripes.Pros:- Interesting story and continuation of the first FFXIII- Music was beautiful, though about half of it was taken from the original FFXIII.- Art was beautiful, though many of the monsters and their are also seemed taken straight from FFXIII- Monster taming was interesting, but to me that was a mixed bag.- Being able to visit other places and other times was also interesting.Cons:- Reusing some of the Music and Graphics seemed excessive. Most of the monsters were common in Final Fantasy XIII. This however did not apply to the world graphics for the most part.- There are MINOR performance issues I had the game crash once, but it was no big deal for me. At some points the game had minor stuttering.- There are a lot of puzzles in the game, some of them (the clock ones) are so hard you have to look up online for help literally. I am not against puzzles in games but those were rediculous.- The story seems in some ways to contrast with the original FFXIII and some things that happen are left unexplained (like how Dajh and Zhaz are alive 500 years after the first game's events.)- You only have 2 characters in the game and one monster at a time (three in a party but only one out at a time.) It is not as bad as it sounds but it makes the game feel more generic.- Most of the characters from the original are not in the game other than short cameos.- The game does have some minor graphical issues, the rain in the game looks a little funny.- The fragments you have to find are often very hard to find without assistance. Many fragments are not necessary to beat the game, but some of the hard to find ones are.- Synergy abilites feel like they have little worth, as they do not last long and the bosses are fairly easy to beat. I beat the game on the last bosses and they were rediculously easy. (I think I only had to start a boss battle over like 2 times, the puzzles and finding fragments were harder than the bosses.)With so many cons it may seem like I really hated the game but it was a decent game... Some of them are minor... I loved the Music even though some of it was remixes of the original. The original was one of my favorite Final Fantasy games. The one that I am sure will never be beat is Final Fantasy VII.			"

												Warning. Unless your PC is super powerful, I would give this a miss.Edit: This game is considerably improved by a high single core clock speed. If your CPU is clocked at 3.5Ghz or more, you may get reasonable performance out of this game. This game does not take advantage of multcore CPUs. Square Enix: I am really disaappointed by the performance of this port. I played the predecessor to this title, XIII, on 360 and thought to myself: ""to see those awesome gfx at a higher resolution and better framerate would be fantastic"". Such a beautiful game. I was wrong. This runs badly. Considerably worse than a 360. I.e. setting the resolution and graphical fidelity down to 360 levels yields a worse performing game in terms of overall framerate and stability.  On my hardware,  the framerate bounces around 12 - 35 FPS (for reference, it also delivered a solid 60fps on the ""For Honor"" Beta on ultra)I have tried tweaking with Nvidia Explorer and Gedosato, tried to release the framecap in the exe file, but have not got a performance level I am happy with. I am tolerant of bad ports (example, deadly premonition is one of my favourite games on PC!), and I've found most bad ports do yield reasonable performance if you try hard enough, but this one seems impervious. I'm sure there is a good game here (I kinda enjoyed the polarising first instalment).....but I am seriously wondering if I want to persist to find out for sure. Square Enix - please take a look at patching this. There are FF fans on PC that are afraid to go near the franchise on their preferred platform because of ports like this.			"

After beating the game I was left with burning questions only XIII-3 can answer, which is great because it's getting a PC port soon.			"

The gameplay is improved over FF13, which was already pretty good if you ask me, and there's still a ton of content to keep you busy for many hours.The only problem is the framerate. If you thought it was all over the place in FF13, just you wait until you start playing this one. It's absolutely brutal. Not enough to hit the ""No"" button, but it's still quite an annoyance.Overall, good game with plenty of content.			"

First I was a bit sad, that there are only two characters (in FF games I really like to change the partymembers frequently), but storywise it was understandable, and by the end of the game I got really attached to them. After FFXIII, this game is a huge step forward and I can't wait for Lightning Returns!			"

 The Game: I would personally recommend Final Fantasy XIII-2. The game itself is much better than XIII,  the game is no longer stupidly linear and is actually fun to run around the different areas/time zones, as opposed to running down a corridor. The monster system is pretty cool, having the ability to choose monsters to be part of your party, and leveling them along with the main characters. The shop is actually not bad now, and is something you might use often. They also smartened up with the battle system, so now when the leader dies, you don't lose the battle, which was the dumbest thing ever. There is a lot more things to the game than just this, but these are some of the things I really liked in the 13 hours I've played at this point.The Port: The PC version of this game is... in need of work. Granted XIII-2 Launched with graphics options, which is awesome, the game fells like it stutters a lot more, and has more frame drops than XIII did. My computer is very high end, and should not have any troubles with any game like this, but for whatever reason, it does. If they can fix it somehow, and make it so computers good enough get a constant 60FPS, it would make this game just that much better.Overall, I would rate the game a 8.5 I'd say at this point, and the port a 5. It is a fun game, so I can put up with the sometimes bad performance. "

												Overall, pretty good storyline if you really enjoy what the storyplot is about and understands it. However, there's consistent frame rate drops in game, either when in open world, or when in battle mode. Me having a high-end pc, the frame drop rate sometimes can turn the table of your whole battle results, but nonetheless, with proper handling, its not a problem. There is also cutscenes in the game and it does not havefps drop. If fps dropping consistently is not much of a problem to you(Such as like good at handling minor-slightly major fps drops) and you're here just for the storyplot, then get this game, its recommended. But however, you might wish to get FFXIII first to understand the story a little more(Although FFXIII-2 itself also provides summaries of what happened in FFXIII in the premier.) I personally myself enjoyed this game, its fun, and really, a real time-battle strategy with little to no emphasize on turn-based strategy game. Basically, to sum up everything,Graphics: 7.5/10  (This is piled alongside with the fps drop however, it does not really deter the gameplay much. But if i were to place the fps drop aside, it would be 9/10)Storyline: 8/10  (Not really bad, but sometimes, even i get kinda confused due to the time-travelling paradoxes lol)Gameplay: 8/10  (This is piled alongside with the fps drop, however, it does creates minor delay which can lead to you not being able to strike first or to just lose a fight because of that slight 0.5s delay or so, and like i said, with proper handling, this is not mmuch of a problem. But if i were to place the fps drop aside, it would be 9.5/10) (This gameplay includes the battle systems, navigating in open world environment, talking to different NPCs, being able to choose your replies to certain question or in circumstances to mould your own story and so on)I'm already close to finishing the game, so i thought to give a review for those that planned to buy which yes, if you dont have a ps3 for this game(like me), you wouldn't mind much of the minor(to me) fps drops and what you want (for which what i believed) is the storyline and gameplay xD  "

												Too lazy to write a full review of the game.So i'll just get into the Pros & Cons :PROS : - More freedom than the prequel- Non-limited leveling via Cystarium- More experimenting via monster paradigm- Just like FF XIII, the battle system is a +++ pointCONS : - Lagging pretty bad. Seriously. Can we have the update for anti-aliasing and rendering setting?- No option to change voice to english. (And i think some of the subtitles needs to be changed to the proper context?)Conclusion : I loved FF series, and i don't have PS 3, so this game still gets me excited anyway. So looking forward for more update to fix some issues (esp graphic) from Square Enix.			"

												This would be my third time playing Final Fantasy XIII-2.  I enjoy this game a lot more compared to others.  It's quite similar to XIII in same battle system.  There's no more linear path in this game.  You're more than welcome to explore and go to a different stage where there are monsters way out of your league.  I hope you can enjoy this game just as much as I do though :).  It also depends on how much you enjoy the characters in this game.  But honestly, if you're looking to find a reoccuring Final Fantasy theme.  This game probably isn't for you.  It's no where like Final Fantasy 7.  Up to you though, if you like games with a lot of story content.  I'd recommend this one :).			"

												If you have played Final Fantasy XIII the first part and enjoyed it then you will like the sequel too (at least I do). For those who didn't play the first one, there is a Summary of every chapter of the first game although I highly recommend you to play XIII first.Regarding gameplay it is quite similar to the first one: The Battle System has with the ability to tame monsters a greater variety in comparisone to before. Also the leveling system allows a more individual set up.The gameplay got less linear, there's a ton of optional stuff to do, you can play minigames etc. You even get the DLCs for free (you shouldn't miss Requiem of the Goddess: Lightning's story when you've played through the game)Soundtrack and music (including new tracks and some of the first part) are as always fantastic.The story mainly introduces new characters, so the events and characters of the first game are mainly issued as backgroundinformation. This time around the story really might be a little confusing at the beginning but as soon as you get into it it's ok and for myself I enjoyed it.*MINOR SPOILER*Although XIII-2 pretty much scrambles up the ending of the first game and the ending of the sequel itself leaves you wanting more because of that damn open and baiting ending, I found the story really interesting (10/10 thumbs up if u cri ;o evrytiem at the end of XIII-2).*END OF MINOR SPOILER*For this price and the amount of content this is a must buy!Don't listen to all those hardcore retro hipster fanboys of the old Final Fantasies, the Final Fantasy XIII series is really worth playing and as good as its predecessors.->BUY DIS GAME!

												Short review but here it goes (don't expect a lot of detail out of this)Pros: -A lot less linear than FF13-Combat is more or less the same with some tweaks-Japanese and English voices, swap between them in the launcher before starting up the game (subtitles are only for the English script though so some of the sentences are way off when using Jap voices)-Characters are tolerableCons:-Lightning (although to be fair she's far less annoying than in FF13)-Snow-Only 2 party members throughout the entire game and a large selection of monsters that you can tame through battle as your 3rd party member-Even though this game is less linear than FF13 it still feels like a mishmash of sidequests and the story feels very disjointed-Performance is awful, one minute you'll be at 60fps and the second you step into town your FPS will drop to 30 and not budge. I doubt it's my PC and it seems to be an issue with the game's coding for consoles or something.In all I do recommend the game but seriously the performance is terrible and it was getting on my nerves throughout the entire playthrough. If you were one of the people that had major issues with FF13 (the game in general not just the PC port) then DO NOT GET THIS GAME as this is pretty similar (duh) and any rabid FF fans will tear this game apart.

												Compared to the other FF games -- This game is annoying beyond belief.  I couldn't recommend this game unless you just flat out loved FF13.  Then, afterwards you would have to continue on with the story.  If you're a newbie to the FF realm I'd avoid this one and instead of the older ones if you're a hater of bad graphics I'd move to FF10 if they ever release it on PC.  If you're not -- then I suppose FF7 or FF8 would be a good place to start.This game has a complicated, yet simple story at the same exact time.  If you choose to follow it through to its conclusion you'll understand.The annoying thing is its non-battle (yet considered battle) system that they employed in this game.  I don't want to have to look at my keyboard while I'm doing a cgi sequence.  I WANT to watch the cgi sequence.  That's what Square is known for is cgi sequences.  Although it starts off slow the plot eventually ends up being good.  Not the best FF story of all time, but it's far better than most video game devs give their RPG stories.I know the story is going to have a conclusion once FF 13 Lighting Returns is released, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I know as a first timer to the FF series to get them involved in it due to the story line.Graphics - 7/10Plot 7/10Battle System - 7/10Voices - 8/10Price Value - 8/10Time travel system - 3/10Music - 7/10Length (compared to other video games now days) 9/10Overall - 7/10			"

												After playing with FFXIII, I was a bit skeptic, that the sequel will be any better, but gosh. IT. WAS. AWESOME! Much better story, sidequests, amazing soundtrack, time travelling. First I was a bit sad, that there are only two characters (in FF games I really like to change the partymembers frequently), but storywise it was understandable, and by the end of the game I got really attached to them. After FFXIII, this game is a huge step forward and I can't wait for Lightning Returns!			"

												Not as good as XIII but worth to play and to put on your FF collections. Really dont like the soundtrack at all, some maps has really good soundtrack some just terrible/annoying overpower female singing in background (Whoever approved to put those OSDs on should be absolute fired). Yeah, its okay to hear it for like 5mins, but it keeps on and on when you are exploring the map and quests ---> gets real annoying. Thanks god, they still keep the ""Blinded by light"" OSD ^^ in this game. More chocobo riding which is awesome, you dont have to walk like crazy in F13. The time portal kinda new and need time to get used to, not a complain but i get used to the good old Fantasy's Airship.			"

												Great story and alot of fun to play.The story takes a new direction from FFXIII and heads in a new direction while keeping with the premise of changing your fate.  The characters are likable, with appearances from characters from FFXIII.  Not nearly as linear feeling as 13 was, 13-2 has alot of open areas and the ability to go back and forth between areas, if you just feel like exploring some more or working on side missions.  The combat system isn't really any better than 13, but to me it feels a bit more entertaining with the monsters in the party and lets be honest, who doesn't want a chocobo in the party?? Am I right?  The crystarium is a bit more complex if your looking to min/max your characters, while being a lot simpler for just straigt leveling purposes.  Monster crystarium is very simple and straigt-forward.  All in all, I feel its a better game over all than 13 is and I'm enjoying the hell out of it.			"

												If you enjoyed the first game in this trilogy, but didn't much care for the story, then you'll more than likely like this game too. The gameplay is improved over FF13, which was already pretty good if you ask me, and there's still a ton of content to keep you busy for many hours.The only problem is the framerate. If you thought it was all over the place in FF13, just you wait until you start playing this one. It's absolutely brutal. Not enough to hit the ""No"" button, but it's still quite an annoyance.Overall, good game with plenty of content.			"

												You need to complete FFXIII if you want to understand 90% of what's going on in the story for this game, which is okay because XIII was a great game in itself.XIII-2 is another awesome game, and the story takes an interesting twist. After beating the game I was left with burning questions only XIII-3 can answer, which is great because it's getting a PC port soon.			"

												Bugs and technical issues out right stop you from playing what you purchased without hours of attempted fixes. I tried to start up the game and a massively loud buzzing sound came through my head set. I found a fix for that. Then after that, the game was constantly freezing once every 5 seconds for about 10 seconds before I could click 'new game' on the title screen.My specs are more than enough to run in, they just didn't create a stable game. These are common issues for a lot of the people who bought this game.			"

												this is great port and runs in higher resolutions then 1080p on my PC/monitor. I just want the gamepad controls to have rumble or force feedback and it would add to the experience, as the consoles did so I cant see why this and FF13 doesnt? It looks amazing, and its fun to play again on PC in such hi res graphics....but I guess you need a hi spec PC really to do this (GTX 770 i7 477OK ~3.5GHX w/16GB RAM here), a year old but still running well. I will get LR on release for PC but I was disapointed with PS3 version of that game although the battle system was better, the story and quests in the game time limitations sucked.....But thats not 13-2...Get this if you are Final Fantasy fan, ¬£10 worth spending, IMO.

												A tree branch with a nice set of cans and a young John Travolta go time findin'-behindin' to find out the mystery of the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull walking can's sister's disappearance.Even though I wasn't a fan of FFXIII, this was actually really fun to play and the story didn't leave me at that trucker stop on I-80 for 10 hours and realized that they left me behind and kept going anyway. Kind of grindy, but still enjoyable. If you're on the fence about picking up the FF13 series, I'd recommend it if it's like 15 bucks for the whole set (and assuming you're itching for a JRPG).I recommend playing with a stat-maxing guide and a normal playthrough guide so you don't have to pour over your bestiary for 12 hours like I did last Sunday trying to figure out what was missing.Also, the DLC stuff is overpowered so get on it as quickly as possible to make the game easier than it already is.

												Better than FFXIII. Light-hearted and fast-paced, more oriented towards action (pre-emptive strikes now are obatainable through attacking the enemy with A/X, you must jump, you can explore the world) while the battle system is quite similar to its predecessor (CPs, like the sphere grid of FFX). All in all, it seems that Square-Enix tried to correct many of FFXIII's flaws thanks to reviews and critics of it, and in the end we've got a better game.. even though, like FFX-2, is quite easier. Graphics are great, it's full of J-pop music in the background.. worth the while!!!			"

Pros:Same engaging battle style as FF13.Has a much less linear feel than it's predecessor.You can save anywhere. ANYWHERE.Great use of monster capture mechanic that has a lot of depth and customizability.Post-game content/DLC I actually want to play. The DLC for the PC version is free.Gilgamesh. He has the best dialog and voice acting.Cons:Time travel plot is hella confusing.See Lightning in all the promo artwork? You only get to play her for 10 minutes.RIP Haste on demand.Frame rates drop constantly.Mandatory mini games. If you see a clock puzzle, Google for a solver.Gilgamesh. I stopped laughing when I actually fought him.TL;DR:Do you enjoy JRPGs?Do you have only one kidney so you could afford your computer?If you said yes to both, go play this game.			"

												Played XIII on PS3, it was pretty boring.Started XIII-2 but didn't have the strength to finish it on PS3, turns out the PC version is a tiny bit superior (minus some DLCs, as they said in description. Didn't care that much for the game to be hurt by it).Game has various resolution options, AA that works somewhat but won't blow your head off and an ok optimization (though others say it is quite bad, it works even with x16 AA for me, but I'd stay with x4 for max fluidity).The controlls default layout don't make much sense to me.ESC quits the game and you jump with BACKSPACE? What the hell?One of the VERY few titles in existance where I would actually advise for a gamepad if you have one available.As the game is very old as it is, all I can say it's Final Fantasy, cheesy one of the more child-like kind of grind games where you are encouraged to replay previous parts of the game in order to max them. Something for the OCD game completionists that buy one game a year, a wonder to some. A boring excercise to normall people. A torture for people with 5 second attention span.Story can be quite enjoyable, even if it drags a little bit and the party is limited to 2 people (worst part so far for me, some people like the monster - catcher aspect though). To me it feels a little shallow, but XIII had the least interresting crew of all characters I ever saw in FF games, so that may be the reason.Anyway, solid 7/10 overall.			"

												This positive review is only because I have personally enjoyed FFXII-2 even though I am not a fan of so many things in this game.Final Fantasy, at least my favorite moments in this game anyway, all come from FF1-X for me.  I have never been a fan of how they keep trying to change more and more to a action based type of strategy game.  Almost like a hybrid nowadays, however, I understand that those descisions come out of demand more than loyalty.  With that in mind, I completely disregard that aspect which I hate most out of this game.The next is the story.  Like FFXIII, it is just a very weak and confusing story.  It is almost as if the writers all got together one summer to come up with the most ""amazing plots full of twists, turns and intrigue"".  What the casual gamer is left with is yet another very confusing story line which is supposed to be the hallmark of the FF series.  Gone are the days of good vs evil.  The days in which the games arch villian makes themselves known at the very start of the game and the entire story line through the game is a build up of that final showdown.  Just like XIII, it takes a while to even know who the true enemies are in this game.  I am only 2/5th through it and I honestly have no clue who the enemy will be.  Will it be Caius and Yeoul?  Those are the likely choices.  Or could it even be Sereh and Noel who are actually upsetting times paradox?  Or is it Lightning who is stuck in some sort of confusing limbo I have no clue how she would have got there or why.The story of this FF is perhaps the worst I have ever seen.  I am doing everyhting in my power to talk to EVERY NPC, read up on EVERY story line recap and have been following guides without spoilersto try and keep knowledgable about what is going on.Could writing like that actually be described as a masterpiece?  Sure, depends on how you look at it.  May work great for movies, but I am just not a fan of it belonging to a FF game.But I CAN get passed the story.  It has a lot of story so in a way it makes up for the lack of knowing what is happening.  Half the reason I want to keep playing every day is just to unravel what is happening.  Again, sounds like a compliment, but it truley is not.  I want the old more linear FF's of the old days to return.  Not this confusing crap.  GAMEPLAY: Plays just like 13.  So if you liked the combat style or it was good enough, then don't expect any surprises.  I believe they removed summons as well.  They are mentioned from a few NPC's that are not a part of the storyline at least.7/10 MUSIC: Has enoug original music to make this yet again one of the best reasons to ever play FF.  It carries over many songs and parts of songs from 13, but I also hear a few nods to FF1, FF3 and FFX in there (but not the exact songs from them).  Still not the best music I have ever heard in a FF game, but close. 9/10STORYLINE: So confusing.  There where no hints at all at the end of FF13 that any of this would happen.  They really pulled this one out of nowhere.  It takes a few hours for the utter confusion to sink in before you grudgingly admit this is the course the story line will be for pretty much the entire game.  You understand quickly that some alter-universe is happening, but it gets very hard to wrap your head around as to why and how.  In fact, after pouring over guides, walktrhoughs and wiki's as well as 40 hrs in game, I am still not understanding those two questions.  3/10 - Worst FF storyline everGRAPHICS: Seems good for a PC port to me.  980ti and 6780 i7 (top end).  Only complaint is that they need to support ultra-wide.  No FPS or stuttering issues to report.  CONTROLS 9CONTROLLER): The D-Pad for the Steam Controller works horrible with this game.  Just moving the camera around your character takes 3-7 swipes even at full sensativity.  I'd recomend playing this on a PS3 or XBox controller instead.  6/10Overall, it IS  a fun game.  Certainly not the best, bt it's WAY better than FF12.  And TBH, since FF13's story also sucked,  I find myself enjoying this one slightly more than FF13.  Probably because I already know the charcters more.  And the side content is massive in this game.  UPDATEI have finally beaten the game and the ending was very powerful and well written.  This game immediatly goes up a few notches because of that and you finally start piecing together the overall story a lot more even though their are some pretty obvious loopholes on why the game ended like it did given in earlier parts of the game you where lead to believe something else would happen.  So just beware, you really need to push yourself through the first 30 hours of this game before the meat finally starts coming off the bones and you can start seeing the story.  Another thing I forgot to mention was the top level voice acting the game has.  It was flawless and fit every major character perfectly.  Off to Lightning Returns.  God I hope no more time travel!

												The combat is as bad as it was in XIII. I recommend downloading a trainer and playing this game with godmode/no random encounters. It's a better visual novel/adventure game than it is an RPG.I really enjoyed the story, it's written pretty good and interesting all around. I'd say the story gets better the further you progress into the game, that doesn't mean the story is bad in the beginning. The art design is okay but the music is absolutely FANTASTIC.Can't even get constant 60fps @1080p on an i7-4790K + 980Ti so don't expect the smoothest gameplay ever on older hardware.

												If you played and liked FFXIII this is a really good game for you. I'm really enjoying the game so far (I'm going really slow exploring everything and collecting a lot of things).Compared to XIII, the map is no longer a path for you to follow, you can unlock new areas by doing side quests and explore them after or before going on with the main story. Also you can capture monsters and put them in your party, so you can spend a nice amount of time looking for monsters you like and powering them up. The story works with time travel, paradoxes and different timelines, that's very cool too.PS: In general it's a great game, but I don't recommend it if you haven't played FFXIII			"

												Great Game! Kind of so-so story but overall very fun and enjoyable rpg. This pc port however is terrible. Optimization problems along with fps drops all over the place even when running good hardware really has disappointed me. I hope Square will take their next pc port of Lightning Returns seriously, but after XIII and XIII-2 I hold little faith...My Specs: i53570KAsRockz77extreme416Gb RAMEVGA GTX970 FTW "

												First Impression: Doesn't seem to suffer from the issues that FFXIII did on PC.Edit 1: For those of you experiencing low framerates, make sure to switch your ""Shadow Resolution"" low on the launcher.  The highest setting requires 256x as much processing power as the lowest setting.  It's a big deal for this game and makes a huge difference.			"

												A good story. Huge universe. Excellent graphics. Favorite characters. Delaying for a long time. But alas, not everyone will be able to play at high graphics settings. The game is not optimized. High-rez shadow? Large resolution?

												If you liked the first one, you'll like this one better.Gameplay-wise, 13-2 has more meat to its bones than its predecessor (I know, that's not saying much, but still worth mentioning). Story-wise, you'll enjoy it if you're into string theory and quantum mechanics (with some artistic license, obviously, but they took a page or two from actual science). Also, it's refreshing to see a female-male protagonist team that is NOT a couple and a story with a female protagonist WITHOUT love triangles (Lightning in 13-1 didn't count, given how she was the resident grimdork*).* Final Fantasy is formulaic in its team ensemble, the team always has a grimdork, and every so often, this grimdork happens to be the protagonist. In 4 it was Black/White Knight, in 8 it was Squall, and in 13 it was Lightning. Deal with it.The soundtrack is less epic this time around and more on the pop side of things with more songs than melodies but it doesn't detract from the mood, and the world building now spanning over 700 years of history is still pretty solid.Warning 1: Some of the puzzles are unnerving unless you can actually do Linear Programming, so when the dreaded clock puzzles appear, use this link: https://www.robertwoodward.com/clockPuzzle/Warning 2: If you plan to go all the way and get the Hidden Ending, the whole thing becomes a ""Gamefaqs Game"" (i.e the ONLY way to make heads from tails out of it is reading a guide).All in all, it's a worthy Final Fantasy within the confines of modern-day JPRGs so, if you already have the first one, you won't regret following up (just wait for a Steam sale). Finally, addressing the elephant in the room: is it linear? Well duh! all JRPGs are railroads, and Squeenix' ones doubly so, infuriatingly so, even, so if you're a fan of the publisher or the genre, then you should be long over that one.			"

												It's been said by many, and wow. This port is bad. Real bad. I get jumps from 20 to 60 on 1080P with 2xmsaa and 2000 shadows. The stuttering is really bad. You can see some really bad looking textures and my settings don't save which means I have to change my settings from the main menu everytime I try to play this game. I'm running this off a decent system that can play battlefield in 80+ frames average. I have an AMD 8320 overclocked to 4ghz, I have a GTX 970 SC, 16 Gigs of ram, and I'm still getting an average of 35 frames. I want to keep playing this but I can't enjoy it. I'm essentially just forcing myself to play through this game which is just decent so far. Please save your money and buy this on sale if there is a patch. It is really frustrating to play under these circumstances.			"

Posted: February 15, 2015
												WARNING: Potential Spoilers (Minor) Spread Throughout This ReviewOn Hardware/FPS issuesI'm going to be honest. I've seen a lot of people saying they're getting hard framerate issues with aparently high end rigs. Better than my rig, that's for sure. However, a lot of issues that others are having on better rigs aren't that bad on mine. I think that's a matter of tinkering with the game to get what you want out of it. While I don't hit 60 fps that other people can (occasionally), my fps is pretty stable, with it rarely ever dropping into an 'unplayable' state, and even when it does, it resolves itself rather quickly. This is running at fullscreen at 1600x900 resolution. I could probably get even better fps by putting it to a lowe resolution, but I find the framerate to be playable almost all the time. I feel that a large number of problems when it comes to the game's fps can be solved, or at least minimized, by just messing with the settings and seeing what works for your system. Remember that sometimes you can't just go by your specs (i.e. there's some games that I tend to run better with higher settings rather than with lower ones). Also, as dumb as it might sound, remember to close your other open programs when you're running a game that demands more out of your system. Freeing up RAM is extremely important, as the game will have more resources to work with when carrying out tasks(Just a note, I can't even run Skyrim at 60 fps [though it still runs with a stable framerate], yet I run FFXIII-2 better than a number of people who can. I don't know what it says about me or my machine, but it definitely says that the people complaining about technical problems could definitely do a bit of work on their own before blaming everything on the game)On Graphics  For reference, my game graphic settings are as follows:      Full-Screen Display Mode      1600x900 Resolution      512x512 Shadow Resolution      x2 Anti-aliasing (the minimum. I'd turn it off if I could)A number of people have complained about low resolution stuff. One in particular stated that the graphics all looked blurry above 1280x720p resolution. As I stated before, I run the game in full screen at 1600x900p and I don't get this at all. If anything, I would recommend turning down anti-aliasing (AA). It may sound counter-intuitive, but the point of AA is to smooth out images. If the texture resolutions are low, higher AA means it'll be trying to smooth textures even beyond what they 'need' (as dictated by the player), and can actually be the cause of blurry textures. Try turning AA down to fix the blurry texture problem if you seem to have that (As a plus, this can also improve your frame rate!)On Story/CharactersThere's a number of reviews on this matter, but a few in particular stuck out to me. One was about Serah's 'feminization', complaining how she's weaker than Noel, and more delicate/feminine, unlike her sister. First off, Serah's not really a fighter, she wasn't in the military like Lightning, and Noel survived in a wilderness. How can you expect her to match up to those? That's from a story perspective. In game, her stats aren't as high in strength, sure, but she has a higher magic stat and can perform just as well as noel in battle if you focus on building up her starting strength in magic. Don't forget class passives either, Commando gets a damage boost, if you have Noel Commando and Serah Ravager (like I did), of course Serah's not going to have as much damage output... initially. Don't forget that classes like the ravager can still target weak points that one like the commando can't, allowing them to gain even more damage output than even the commando's damage bonus gives.Sorry, got on a tangent there.A more common complaint is that the characters are flat, and the story is lacking as well.As far as characters go, I think the main reason for this complaint is that there simply aren't that many steady characters that you can compare Serah and Noel to. As characters, I think they're fine. The problem lies in that they're the only characters that remain constant. In a larger group / party of characters, such as in Final Fantasy XIII, there's a lot more variety in personality, allowing for a lot more dynamic in the group as a whole. With just two people, they can't cover as much ground as the larger group can, and so, they seem flat by comparison. That's my spin on the whole thing.As for story, one thing I've seen a few times is that it doesn't make sense for them to be jumping around at random to reach Lightning. My response is: They have no idea how to get to her beyond through the portals they're using. There's no set way to get into Valhalla (as far as I've seen in the game yet). Noel got there by a prayer, quite literally. There was some outside intervention that brought him there, and he has no idea how to do it on his own, aside from knowing that the portals are somehow the way there. What else CAN they do beyond working through this network of portals and hope they find the right one? Besides, them magically winding up on the proper portal early on makes for a short and boring game. If they had an easier way to it, then you can bet even more people would be complaining about the game being short.The rest of the story, how things play out and such. Early on, you don't get too much about the world. For one, the game IS a sequel, you're expected to have at least some basic prior knowledge of the world and its events before playing it. Even if you aren't, there's a system in the game DEDICATED to providing lore about the world around you. Even without prior knowledge, you can get a decent look at the world just by reading through the data logs. And besides, if you got all the information at the start, there's no mystery or intrigue. That makes for a far more boring game than a somewhat convulated story. At least a convulated story gives you something to think about as you play through it, rather than handing everything to you on a silver platter.There's a lot more I could say, but I'll leave it there for fear of this becoming a pure rant.My Personal ThoughtsOverall, I liked the game. I liked the characters, the world, the combat, everything. Though I may be somewhat biased, as I like the Final Fantasy games and Square Enix a lot. I'll admit, sometimes I do wish I could get higher frames, but that's mostly an issue of me finding the optimal setup, and my system IS somewhat bogged down by a variety of things. I'll admit, the game gets tedious at times, but that's to be expected of a JRPG.			"

												I read about all the performance whines etc, but runs fine on my system, the only downside being the rain looks horrible. Everything else is shiny and smooth.Game itself is fantastic though, far outshines the crappy previous game (13). Well recommended if you like collecting and exploring, and pretty light and magic effects.Looks great in full HD too. I am guessing alot of the whining is coming from people trying to run it under spec, because to run this at max, you need a beefy PC. Well recommended though. One of the best Final Fantasy games so far.			"

												Gameplay's largely improved from the first game; paradigm system's a little more fleshed out, unwanted encounters are mostly easier to avoid, more to do, more open. Story has difficulty standing on its own, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's bad, just a lot of missed opportunities and overreliance on referencing the original. Interestingly it's the only time travel game I've seen to make use of string theory. As a port, there's a severe dearth of options. Resolution, shadows, AA, and that's about it. Textures in particular look very dated and can't be adjusted, so I'd suggest finding a third party tool to force antisotropic filtering. I didn't experience any stability or framerate issues, though there was some weird behavior with alt-tabbing that required the game to be restarted. Decent enough game for the price if you have a JRPG itch.			"

												+ Gameplay improvements over XIII+ An open world of sorts+ Caius is probably one of the most interesting antagonists in the FF franchise+ Not for everyone, but the soundtrack is great- Worse port than XIII- Confusing and unnecessary story- Serah and Noel are terrible protagonists- Each area feels awfully small compared to some levels of XIII (especially Gran Pulse)Verdict: Despite my playtime, this is not the first time I play XIII-2. I noticed (not through Steam in any way) that opinions on XIII-2 are polaryzing. I happen to be on the side of the fence that would say it was OK and had good things going for it, but wasn't better than XIII. Since Steam has only ""yes"" or ""no"", I'll give it a ""no"". The battle system was vastly improved in XIII-2, which is probably the most important thing for me, but mostly everything else feels unnecessary. Caius is a great protagonist and I love the soundtrack, but I just didn't have it with the story and Serah and Noel. Therefore, my ""no"" goes for the story and protagonists and how badly optimized it is, but it can be lots of fun if you focus on the gameplay. Recommended for those who want to play LR as that's a direct sequel to XIII-2.			"

												So I played XIII first and had to get used to it. But once I did I ended up liking it alot. This game I did not feel the same way.  After playing for awhile I started to hate it more and more. I don't get why they changed the little upgrade tree the way they did nor the way health works in battle. It was just so pointless. The story is good but I don't like the combate changes nor the way you get stronger.  Those are kind of a big thing with games like this.			"

												I played the PS3 version of this multiple times as it is my favorite of the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy.  The PC port is disappointing.  The game itself is just as good as ever, and so I do recommend the game, but the current state of the port is just lazy.  Seems like Square did enough work to make it play on a PC and said ""Ship it!""I'm playing on a i5-4670K overclocked to 4.4ghz with a GTX 770.  I can play a game like Battlefield 4 at very high quality settings and get > 100 fps.  This game struggles to maintain 30fps.  It struggles in the strangest way, in that I'm standing in an area, rocking a smooth 60fps, turn a little or wiggle the camera and the rate drops to 30fps.  While watching CPU and GPU usage during this time, nothing really changes.  The game just decides to stop doing more than 30fps.  This would be slightly less annoying if it were locked at 30fps, but it isn't, so it looks like little micro-stutters as the rate toggles between 30 and 60.  Doesn't matter the settings I play at, and I've tried all of the random tweaks someone on the forum swears worked for their friend's dogsitter's cousin to no avail.			"

												Doesn't seem as ""epic"" or long as the previous game. Linearity is fine if the context is there. This game is linear too but hides it through optional fetch quests, a few open areas, and time traveling.Almost every single side quest involves an NPC looking for an item in the same location but a different time period, then being amazed that you found the item that shouldn't exist. The only thing that stopped you was monsters spawning on top of you while you wasted time running around finding the floating treasure chest with the item in it.Turn the awful english dub off and make some changes to your nvidia control panel so it doesn't run at 5fps. Then you have a pretty neato jrpg.			"

												Please note that I am very familiar with FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 on the PS3, hence why my playtime may not seem that great.FINAL FANTASY XIII was a fairly ill-recieved game that dissapointed critics and fans alike, the Steam port of which was barrated for having next to no graphics options (thankfully, both ports now do) but it was no where near as bad as people thought. Long drawn out story, annoying characters, pesky bosses aside... it was a pretty eventful 50 hours, after which it's frankly boring narrative was summed up and we could all go home.Until now.FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 literally re-writes the ending of XIII, placing us in an entire new universe as Lightning's younger sister, Serah, and her charming companion, Noel. They join forces on a quest through time to save Lighting (who has now been erased from time. For some reason.) in the sequel that no one asked for - but it actually works.First thing first XIII-2 improves on alot of what XIII was lacking. Freedom is now a big part of the game, players can now choose what time zone to visit and what order they want the story to play out in - which is a very nice addition to the plot as it fuses well with the time-travel theme. The battle system remains similar, except a new feature has been added allowing you to add a monster you have collected into your party - sort of like Pokemon. You are free to customize the monster, and level it up with your party. This is a really neat feature, which opens up the battleground for new opportunities. However, this game comes across like it is trying to hard to be different from XIII. The narrative is convoluted and complicated - worse than the usual FINAL FANTASY formula. The different time zones and multiple (pointless) ""Paradox"" endings do not weave well with eachother, chances are you won't know what's going on half the time. However, unlike XIII you are thrown straight into the drama at the start of the game, no waiting about 20 hours for something to happen. And I do admit, some events in the plot did grab my attention - some of my fondest FF memories reside within XIII-2. The entire story does feel like a kick to the groin, as those 50 hours I spent in XIII are rendered pointless as almost none of it's key ideas are mentioned. You could easily pick this game up and go (it even has a plot summary of XIII.)Another feature I enjoyed of XIII-2 is The Coliseum, a battle area in which you fight off special monsters/bosses in order to win them for your moster collection. It's a pretty neat way to level up your party, or just to have a muck around in. Most of the battles are DLC - but luckily this port comes with most of the available DLCs including the 3 story expansion packs.All in all, FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 (like XIII) is not a bad game. It rights many of XIIIs wrongs, and certainly is a more enjoyable experience while a more confusing one.+ All DLC included. Mostly.+ Improves on many of FINAL FANTASY XIIIs flaws.+ Major improvement on XIII cast.+ New, enjoyable, characters.+ Moster collecting.+ Added freedom. Feels more like an RPG than any modern FINAL FANTASY.- Convoluted narrative.- Makes XIII feel pointless.- Cop-out ending. Sequel bait.- DLC stories unsatisfying.- Easy to exploit the level up system.- QTEs. *shivers*7/10			"

												Like many others, my game crashes at the beginning, even without this crash my pc has a lot of lagging issues even when running it with everything set as low when it worked with FFXIII. It's even more frustrating for me because i'm really curious about the pet system, seems really cool. I don't know if SE plans to release a performance patch, hope so, but i really doubt it. Buy it on console if you want to try it, unfortunately i don't have a ps3.			"

Even with a decent rig the frame rate is erratic, so much so that I uninstalled the game and will wait to see if SE ever addresses it.Buy one of the console versions if you must, but don't support these lazy ports.Edit: Reinstalled this on a beefier rig and it's mostly playable.

												Terrible PC port, compared to the not-too-good FF XIII port. I can't run the game above 25fps with this rig:GTX 760 2GBi5 4440 @3.1ghz8GB RAMWin 8.1This rig runs Battlefield 4 at close to max graphics smoothly, so I can readily say that this is a port issue, not a hardware issue at all.The only way to play this game at a playable fps is to cap my own PC framerate to 30. In doing so, the game runs fine at 30fps constant. But the whole point of buying the PC version is to play it at 60fps and 1080p, so yeah...SEnix, you better patch the game asap.			"

												So I played XIII first and had to get used to it. But once I did I ended up liking it alot. This game I did not feel the same way.  After playing for awhile I started to hate it more and more. I don't get why they changed the little upgrade tree the way they did nor the way health works in battle. It was just so pointless. The story is good but I don't like the combate changes nor the way you get stronger.  Those are kind of a big thing with games like this.			"

The game's combat is very addicting and complex, but a bit too easy. This is an enjoyable, and unique experience for PC gamers.			"

												+ Gameplay improvements over XIII+ An open world of sorts+ Caius is probably one of the most interesting antagonists in the FF franchise+ Not for everyone, but the soundtrack is great- Worse port than XIII- Confusing and unnecessary story- Serah and Noel are terrible protagonists- Each area feels awfully small compared to some levels of XIII (especially Gran Pulse)Verdict: Despite my playtime, this is not the first time I play XIII-2. I noticed (not through Steam in any way) that opinions on XIII-2 are polaryzing. I happen to be on the side of the fence that would say it was OK and had good things going for it, but wasn't better than XIII. Since Steam has only ""yes"" or ""no"", I'll give it a ""no"". The battle system was vastly improved in XIII-2, which is probably the most important thing for me, but mostly everything else feels unnecessary. Caius is a great protagonist and I love the soundtrack, but I just didn't have it with the story and Serah and Noel. Therefore, my ""no"" goes for the story and protagonists and how badly optimized it is, but it can be lots of fun if you focus on the gameplay. Recommended for those who want to play LR as that's a direct sequel to XIII-2.			"

												If you found the original Final Fantasy XIII to be lacking and are hopeful you'll enjoy the redesigned second entry into the FF13 trilogy, be prepared for indifference. While FF13-2's battle and encounter system have been greatly improved, the flaws from FF13 are still present and hamper enjoyment of the game. The time travel element is welcome if you're, like me, a fan of the SNES classic Chrono Trigger, but wears out its welcome when it comes to collecting specific key items required to advance gameplay. You'll quickly grow tired of time-hopping in order to run across a regional map to pick up one item only to do the same thing in several other timelines. The plot is also a mixed bag and only mildly improves on its predecessor's writing, leaving me dreading the last quarter of the game or so which I only completed as I felt obligated to at that point. If you're already an FF13 fan, this game might be worth checking out otherwise avoid this game.			"

												Your mileage may very much vary with this title. For me, the game crashes at a specific point without fail (going back to Bresha Ruins 5AF) and nothing I've tried was able to fix this.To add to these seemingly random crashes the game suffers from the same FPS drops as XIII did and even something as simple as Steam Cloud Saves or the Steam In-Game Overlay are said to worsen the aforementioned issues.It's a lazy, unstable port that I simply can not recommend.(If you own a PS3 or a X360, you can go and buy the game for that platform. XIII-2 is very ""freeform"" when compared to XIII which didn't do a good job at hiding its linearity. The battle system is mostly the same. It's an alright game that might be worth your time, considering the low price.)			"

												Aside from the buzzing sound (which was fixed by running in Admin Mode) and the crash. FFXIII-2 has an amazing and rich story line. I love games that pull on your heart strings and this game does exactly that. If you don't like puzzles and having to search for items, then this game isn't for you. The combat system flows quickly and smoothly. The only complaint I have is the long load screens when going from the Historia Crux to a new area. I love Serah and Noel with a passion. Well written story-line and great game-play!			"

Has multiply endings and can be a very big challenge in parts. One thing that sucks though is the fact that its a bad port from the Console. You'd better have a half decent PC, otherwise its going to not run smooth.			"

												Definitely a step in the right direction from FF13, but there is still room for improvement...We are not completely free from corridors, character limitations (which goes step further actually, by giving you only two characters to play with (AND NONE OF THEM IS LIGHTNING?! Seriously, screw you SE...) and that's it! You can tame hundreds of monsters to fill up that third slot, sure, but it's not complete freedom, you know) or no-think combat, but the game is just too short to make these things unbearable. Which is not a bad thing; you can rush through main story in 30 or so hours and it won't be even that difficult to do it, but you can also choose to mess around, do side quests and explore areas and times  you won't get to in the main line (FF13-2 chose not to use areas from previous game, or at least not at main stage, but rather introduced time travel, so you can explore the same areas in different eras or even in alternate timelines. Which is kind of lazy, if you ask me, as you are at the exactly same spot like three times but once there is sun, other there's night and last it's snowy. And it counts as three different areas...). For that reason most of the encounters are pretty easy because you can literally trigger them at any point of the game.Minor spoilers ahead.So uh, story... How should I put it... FF13 had story but it took a long time to get through it. 13-2 is in story part kind of shallow... At the beginning you are introduced to your goal (and also a minor point that the ending you've seen in 13 is a lie, lol. What a way to build a sequel!), but when you ask anyone how to get there, they're all like; ""Oh I don't know... Try going through this Time Gate and see if something happens..."" So you go and wait until something actually happens (that doesn't take long, mind you) and you kill something that somehow prevents another Gate from being used and you go on. And when you finally somehow made it to your destination, you are told you're late and whole world is being destroyed because of it. And that's it! That's the whole story! No plot twists, just few minor bumps here and there that didn't even matter in the end...And don't even get me started on the conversations... I wanted to say it in FF13 review, but I reconsidered, however FF13-2 did it in so much bigger scale... Absolute most of the conversations are completely pointless, just to fill up awkward silence while you're waiting for something to happen! And what better thing to talk about than the reasons why you're on this journey?! I mean, first few times it's kind of bearable as those are new lore bits for the player. But I was sick of hearing the same; ""For Lightning!"", ""For Hope!"", ""For the future!"", ""For the world!"" and ""You must not give up now!"" over and over and over through the whole game!Spoilers end here.One point I criticized about FF13 is having no way to replay the story with your maxed out characters. In 13-2, areas are not connected in the game-world but only through Historia Crux (Crossroad of Time and Space), that means you can from there reset time in each particular location back to the point before you entered it for the first time! (I guess it might not be so big of a deal for most people but I really enjoy having the option to brutally kick asses of the first bosses)Which kind of leads me to another plus of this game; you get dialogue options! You can choose how your characters will respond, what they will ask about, what approach they'll take to a problem. And the time reset I mentioned allows you to go back and try out the other options you did not pick the first time and experience other challenges or even endings. Although it doesn't always cause much of a difference, it's still much better than the FF13 the Movie...Combat is pretty much similar, but it gets some depth in form of the monster partners as each one of them has some unique abilities but you can consume that monster and give that ability to another one and create super-killing machine (FEED ON YOUR FRIENDS AND GROW STRONGER MY MINIONS!).As I said in the beginning, this is definitely improved version of FF13. So much improved that it even might be worth paying for, how about that?! Just one thing to mention, the game expects you to know the events of FF13 and lore behind the world as it builds upon that. You have the option to read a summarized version of it's story in-game, but it's not too explaining about most of the side stuff and lore, so you might want to go through 13 first...Oh, and for those wondering; I played it on the same machine as FF13 and 13-2 had much better performance than that. I even sometimes hit 30 fps in small areas :P			"

												WARNING, this is a recommendation with a huge list of ""BUT""s and things you need to know and is very much not a glowing one. And first thing to know - do NOT play this game with steam cloud on, turn it off before you even start in the game library properties, otherwise the game will crash very often during ""now loading"" screens and attemtps to switch to offline saves mid-game will result in infinite loading screens for that game, unless switched back to cloud saves. Also, the game port is pretty buggy, you should search for a rain effect fix if you value your eyesight and the game will load like 1/5 times when you launch it, just keep trying.So after this lenghy ""the port is horrible"" opening let's get to the actual game. What's good about it is that it actually tries to use all those ideas found (and wasted) in Final Fantasy XIII properly and succeedes in many cases. All RPG systems and mechanics are still flawed, but are much more fun to play with, battles are less boring and actually require some thought and the progressions is rather open. The levels are no longer ""go from point A to point B in a corridor"" and while they're reused constantly with variations via the whole time traveling plot, they're mostly fun and look good. Game has a system similar to oldschool random encounters, which is both good and annoying. There are horrible puzzle sections, although they are ussually tied to optional areas and quests. And there are few super annoying and boring platforming sections, but the game is not too insane with those.What is also good is that the plot is happening. It's weird to put ""this storydriven RPG has plot"" as a plus, but after FF XIII that has nothing happening for dozens of hours, having things happen, story expand, characters develop all the time is great. The story itself is, like with FF XIII, more interesting in theory than in execution and few twists and turns feel not just silly but completely undermining some of the other stuff, but it has moments. And is surprisingly darker than you might expect. But overall, storytelling and themes are good, waaaay better than hours of nothing from FF XIII, even if a lot of stuff feels stupid or absurd and tone can be off by a lot.It looks good, it sounds very good, if sometimes unexpected (soundtrack switches from usual FF, to Resident Evil/Parasite Eve 2 feel (same composer), to Devil May Cry 3-4 in seconds and always catches you off guard). It has very welcome tweaks to UI and controls. It's a bit too experimental for it's own good. But it's also pretty fun. Not something to go into for a full price, especially with the port quality like this, but a pretty interesting jRPG nonetheless.			"

												Pros:- Battle system is okay and fairly deep for this type of game- Character building allows decent customisation- Fun pet system that ties into the battle system- Nice soundtrack, overall- Cooing Chocobos- Visuals are great, albeit too flashy for my taste sometimes- Voice-acting is mostly decent in English- Outfits for your Moogle (and other characters)Cons:- The story- The amount of story- The cutscenes explaining the story- The NPC dialogues repeating what you just learnt (in a cutscene) about the story- The story is overly convoluted also, not sure I mentioned this- One day they will make a game where controlling your character works well (as in: you don't need to stand in a specific spot to jump a curb), but this day has not yet comeWould recommend in a sale if you don't mind buying a game that contains (literally) 7 hours of cutscenes and cinematics.P.S.: There is so much terrible story, it's as if they hired everyone who ever wrote FF fanfic and said ""go nuts guys, we'll put it all into the game"", and then they did.

												Being that this game has technically been out for over 3 years, I will mostly write about the quality of the port. I have an Nvidia Geforce GTX 980 and an Intel I7 4770k with 16 GB system RAM. The game works just fine for me, however, when I try to play the game at 1080p, I find that the FPS is highly unstable. It goes anywhere from 20-60 FPS, depending on what is going on. Prerendered cutscene: 30 FPS (although the video itself was only rendered at 30 FPS anyway). In-engine cutscene: 60 FPS. Menu: 40-60 FPS. Running around: 20-60 (again, it depends on what is going on).Now, that being said, I have tweaked with the settings and I have found something that works for me:-Resolution: 1600x900-Fullscreen-Shadow Resolution: 2k-AA: 8xWith this setup I was able to play the game at a much more stable 40-60 FPS, depending on the situation. I will also note that I am using a device to measure the amount of wattage that my computer uses and I noticed that it uses almost the same amount of power as it does when I idle on the desktop. This isn't a problem for me, however I will say that it is not pushing my system to it's limits, as is normal for console ports these days.			"

												What will you expect from Final Fantasy XIII-2? (Strongly recommend to play through the previous game, CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM XIII)(TL,DR: Read Pros&Cons and Overall at the bottom, I played on the console version)‚ÄûWhy does mankind defy its fate?‚ÄùThe game takes place three years after the events of Final Fantasy XIII, and depicts the story of Serah Farron's journey across time and space to prevent the end of the world while searching for her missing sister, Lightning.Pros: - Fantastic atmosphere - The battle system expanded (you can catch monsters and they fight with you as third party member)- Epic music (more vocals and remixed versions for pre-battle)- ‚ÄôMore openworld‚Äô than the XIII had, side missions, puzzles, casino etc.- Returning characters and places (You can visit the areas in other timelines, these areas change in appearance)- You can replay the chapters/missions anytime you want, and you can continue your journey (this is the NewGame+)- Paradox (or alternate) endings- Epic final boss battle with one of the best FF antagonist- You will get all the DLCs (3 story, all Coliseum battles, outfits)- Still an amazing story, but...Cons:- ...again linear and complicated (time travelling)- Only two playable characters (the DLCs grant you to play with Sazh, and Lightning in their own story)- Too easy- Shorter than XIIIStory (AF timeline means After the Fall of Cocoon):After the events of XIII, Lightning gets caught by a paradoxon and taken to Valhalla, the realm of death. While everybody thinks Lightning is dead, Serah is confident that her sister is alive. Lightning will be a knight of goddess Etro, and her task to save the future from Caius Ballad, who wants to destroy the time, he is Yeul's immortal Guardian and seeks to end the suffering she sustains by being endlessly reincarnated by killing the goddess Etro. Noel Kreiss comes from the Dying World at 700 AF, where he is the last surviving human in a world that faced destruction 200 years after the Crystal Pillar‚Äôs fall and Lightning ask him to find Serah and help her reach Valhalla. In New Bodhum (on Gran Pulse) at 3 AF Noel coming to find Serah. The two encounters in an epic journey through time and space to solve the paradoxons and save the world and Lightning. What about with the original team? Fang and Vanille are still in the Crystal Pillar, Hope is now 24 years old and the leader of the Academy (the new capital city), Sazh and Dajh have mysteriously gone missing, Snow left to search for Lightning two years after her disappearance, and Serah stayed with the NORA at New Bodhum.Battle:The battle system returns from XIII, you are able to switch the party leader during battle, the third party member will be a monster that will fight along with you with their own role (One monster = One role) and you can upgrade them (new abilites, better stats). It‚Äôs okay because three monsters can be held at a time, and automatically switch to the role a player shifts to in the paradigm. The Crystarium system returns too, with levels not with tiers. A new form of damage, called Wound Damage, lowers a target's member's max HP during battle and can only be healed by items, giving further incentive to defeat enemies as quickly as possible. If the current party leader is KO'd, the party leader is automatically switched to the other human character. The defeat of the human characters in the party results in a game over.Playtime (My first walkhthrough): Story: 32 hours (ofc with cutscenes)100%, All achievements, all (160) fragments, best chocobo for racing: 63 hoursOverall:For me this game 10/10, if I need to compare to the other FF games then 8/10, the story not better than the XIII‚Äôs story, but the atmosphere is better and the battles are exciting, there will be people who like this game more than the previous.If you loved the first installment, you will love this one too, if you hated you will be disappointed again, don‚Äôt buy it then. That's a pity, because I think it promises adventure not to be missed, despite its flaws.If you liked the game, I can recommend the finale of the trilogy: Lightning Returns.Thanks for reading! "

												Runs fine 2k shadows, 4 or 8xmsaa on a 7970/fx-8320@4.0ghz, 8gb ram. I'm running at 1440p. I'd say for a game essentially made for CELL architecture and quickly ported to pc it runs ""fine."" As long as you don't leave fraps up and count frames you'll see there is nothing immersion breaking abou the framerate drops. It's about what you're used to from the 360 generation. I can imagine it's frustrating for guys that want this game to be as well optimized as a AAA game like BF4 with pc as it's lead platform, but it's not going to happen. We're getting a game for $20 that's a AAA console game that essentially has many games on pc that cost much more than this beat. I'd support this on the chance FF XV could come to pc one day. I would appreciate it if Square made the effort to have released this on pc at launch as it seemed like was intended, but whatever. It stands up to current games.If I update this review, I'll tell you about how I've been enjoying this game so far. Luckily people can go on about this being linear because it's Final Fantasy alright, it just has much better graphics than you're used to so they're went through a period of adjustment and they're almost there as far as emotional impact and complexity of the game. Music is great too.Don't expect this to feel anything like an American game. It feels like a Japanese game, like Sonic or Mario, but of course the rpg version. It won't feel like The Witcher or Dragon Age.			"

												It has consumed my life. 10/10 would get consumed againI honestly believe that the FF13 trilogy is extremely underrated and at its core has an excellent storyline. I highly recommend people buy this game and FF13 and once Lightning Returns lands on steam complete the trilogy because despite what many say they are excellent.+ Excellent, thought provoking storyline+ Amazing Soundtrack (One of the best in Final Fantasy)+ Excellent Battle System+ Great Character Development- Some of the puzzles			"

												Looks like a really great game, a little more bubblegum pop than XIII but feels like it should be a good game. It plays well on a console, but the PC version is f*****. Terrible frame rate issues and I have a pretty decent build. Until Square Enix releases a fix for this I would not reccomend purchasing this game and just in general, I'm going to keep my eye on slapped-together console ports before actually purchasing them, especially by Square Enix. Love the franchise but this is f*****.			"

												Might contain spoilers:If you have some sister drama addiction like our heroine here then i advise you to play this game.  if not, and you are actually a pretty normal human then really, dont, just dont play this game (if you wana call the first hour a game, more like a movie). unless you want to go through some of the most boring ""where is my sister, is she alive, etc etc"" scenes which doesnt  move the plot even a tiny bit then  go ahead. It starts with some cinamatic that doesnt explain anything then u have to mash some buttons with the cineamtic scene then more random stuff happens. suddenly you get to the sister this, sister that drama. where is the skip button? why cant  I cut scenes? how about you say something that actually proceeds with the plot? i been playing for abit over 1 hour for now and the over repeated ""i want my  sister, i wish my sister was here, oh i saw my sister"" drama made me hate this game.  ADD A SKIP BUTTON to scenes that has nothing to do with plot. played for over oe hour and here is how much the plot advanced.  lighting send a guy to her sister. THATS IT. one hour so lighting can say ""go find my sister sarah"" and then he meets sarah and te drama starts. *EDIT 1*NVM found the skip button, Press 0 then 1. gonna play and see how it goes.*EDIT 2*over 17 hours now.  Someone needs to tell this lady that her sister isnt a diary. she went over from ""where is my sister"" to fully talking to her as if she is her diary. her symptoms are getting worse.and still the story didnt advance alot.  plot wise nothing. 17 hours of going from one place to another while fighting enemies and watching plotless movies (thank you skip button). i think they focused on gameplay and threw the story away. another thing to cmplain about which no one mentioned. hese is a stutter in the game every 2 seconds which SEEMS to be fixed when an xbox controller is connected (weird?) .

												---------------------Specs----------------------i7 950 @ 3+ GHz980Ti 6GB SC16GB RIPJAW RAM-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT 19 JUL 2015:I have tried a few fixes.  An unnamed ""fps fix.exe"" and disabling all HID-compliant devices.  My framerate is remarkably better, and the stuttering is gone, but instead of stuttering, I now have the game move at half speed every few second.  Like I'll walk half speed, swing swords half speed, jump half speed, etc.Still a nearly unplayable port on my specs.-------------------------------------------------------------------Getting constant 20-25fps. in 1080p.  A hilarious twist from 13's 45/60/30 gameplay/cutscene/battle framerates, 13-2 is getting 20-25/40-60/12-25 in gameplay/cutscenes/battle.  A 980Ti.  A flagship 6GB card... running and looking like a PS2.  Yes, I have gone into the NVIDIA control panel, tweaked the settings, and even tweaked processor affinity on FF13-2 ando ther programs.It looks even worse than 13.  The lighting is atrocious and I actually feel like I'm playing a much older game from my childhood.Essentially, it's a visual downgrade and the FPS drops tremendously compared to 13.  The story so far is cheesy and forgettable.  Not once have I actually cared to see what was going to happen next.  Not that there's any concept of ""next,"" because you can freely backtrack and go forward throughout space-time with zero regard to any sort of linearity at all. It's like a soap opera with 15 simultaneous plots, all of which are forgettable.TL;DR  -- poorly written, visual downgrade, unplayable framerates on a near-flagship PC, with no sense of direction and nothing interesting at all aside from the new blend of 12 & 13 combat.

Hell, you would be lucky to get this garbage to stay at 30 fps. Do you enjoy poorly optimized ports that randomly and frequently jumps from 20-60 fps then this port is for you. Seeing as it has been years since this was released and given Square's track record, I can safely say that this will never get patched.			"

												I recently gave Final Fantasy XIII a negative review, and was told that this one fixed many of the issues that that game had, and that it would be worth at least giving a try. So I did. Or I tried. What do I mean with ""I tried?"". Well, I tried to play it, but the port makes it unplayable.I can't make a rundown of the story, the gameplay or anything like that, because I've spent less than an hour with the game. The makers of this game seem to have taken the criticism of FF XIII having a far too long ""tutorial"" section to heart, and the bits of the game I could see felt a lot less railroaded, which are both things that would have been massive improvements. It did have a really long and uninteresting quick time event section though.Keys are partially re-bindable, but there are keys you can't rebind. Hope you like moving your hand between the numpad and backspace repeatedly, because you need to use the numpad for camera controls, and backspace for certain interactions, plus quick time event commands.Sadly the game does not work. At least not for me. The first issue I had was that the first menu that popped up after I had selected new game, which asked me if I wanted to play the tutorial or not, made the game completely unresponsive. There's a known issue with gamepads causing this issue, and it was also present in FF XIII, but my gamepad was not plugged in. Turned out I had to unplug my bog standard optical mouse, and my cellphone to get the game to respond (yes having a cellphone, a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini, plugged in for charging was enough to make the first menu not work).The second issue is massive stuttering. My computer exceeds the minimum system requirements by a wide margin, yet the game stutters constantly.After finally having got into the game, I noticed that whoever was responsible for the sound mixing had not done their job properly. I could not hear the dialogue due to the music being way to loud. Subtitles helped alleviate this issue, but it's still a rather big issue when you can't hear the character speak.And then the game crashed. Unceremoniously it just dumped me to the desktop with no error message.There might be a good game underneath all these technical issues, but this port is so bad that I'm unable to play the game. It's actually worse than the rather horrible port that FF XIII got. "

												This game improves the gameplay from the original FFXIII but it doesn't improves in many other aspects. Now you can control wild monsters to fight along side you. I didn't like the backtracking, there's a part in the game that you must collect graviton cores and for that you must do sidequestss to collect fragments to open the right gates to then collect the graviton cores needed, that means some sidequests must be done to progress the main story. The story is great and the soundtrack is even better. The port for the PC however is very bad, no graphical options, just 2 resolutions, no sound options, capped at 30 fps, etc. So, I played the game with 15fps till the end.Score: 8/10.			"

Also at times this game feels like a video game movie with quick time events, not exactly unprecedented for jrpg's but bear that in mind going in.

												As you might recall, Final Fantasy XIII was pretty much reviled everywhere. As a response, Square-Enix released a sequel that promised to fix everything that was wrong with the previous game. Did it work?Yeah....sorta.The first thing that is immediately apparent with the game is that there is no longer any linearity.In fact, the game is the opposite of XIII, with both the story and game systems taking a free-form approach, allowing you to level your characters the way you want, and tackle the story chapters with quite a bit of degree of freedom, though this freedom also means there's some tedious back&forth in some sections.Speaking of story...it's still nonsensical, with a LOT of reading done through datalogs to get the gist of it,like XIII was.Liked it more than XIII, but that's mostly due to being a sucker for sci-fy plots (like time-travel), and for  That ending.Graphically, the game's a bit worse than XIII, but nothing serious that could distract you.Some places look just as great as XIII did (Academia looks pretty gorgeous). Graphical Settings are a exact carbon copy from XIII, with nothing to set both of 'em apart in that regard (patch for XIII released at the same time as this released). The performance did change though...for the worse. This game runs even worse than XIII did, on the exact same hardware.I usually don't mention audio, but Final Fantasy games in general are known to have good soundtracks, and XIII & XIII-2 are no exceptions. Special mention goes to that ridiculous chocobo metal song, it's just too silly to not like it!So, the tl,dnr: improved sequel marred yet again by performance issues. Buy it if you're a fan &/or is on sale.PS: Same regional restrictions that applied to XIII applies here. Asian version is restricted to the Asian region.Get the Western version if you want an unrestricted version.(Source: https://steamdb.info/sub/41113/ )PSS: Squeenix...Lightning Returns when?			"

												Decent game; I don't know why so many people whine about it. Even though it's a port and it's short compared to the previous title, I had no issues with it on my PC; it ran smoorthly and it only crashed once, and I enjoyed playing it. The game is pretty good; I honestly liked FF-13 more, but 13-2 wasn't bad. The story was alright, it was confusing at first but it all makes sense by the end. Although, I didn't really feel anything by the end, whereas at the end of FF-13, I felt a tiny bit emotional. It felt like they made a huge game and spilt it into two parts; the second being Lighting Returns. So, I was like ""meh, that's it?"" at the end.  Graphics are great, nothing really to say about it. The music was perfect as it usually is with a Square Enix game. Gameplay was good, but I still don't get why I have to grind, even for a tiny bit, in a single player game. I couldn't be bothered leveling my party past stage 14 and I didn't need to because I beat the final boss with ease. I still had a few side missions to do to get more fragments, but I couldn't be bothered since it has no effect on the story what so ever. Overall, it's a great final fantasy game, not the best, but pretty decent. I defintely recommend buying it, especially if it's on sale. It's worth your time if you're a FF fan. Ignore all those negative reviews; those people either play on ancient PC's or are obsessed with the past and are unwilling to accept change to the franchise.			"

												The controlling system is way better than FFXIII (For me).Comparison:FFXIII - Execute battle is a bit harder to get Preempective Strike. Because you need to sneak behind the enemy or use item to make enemy not see you.FFXIII-2 - Execute battle not too hard since you need to strike the enemy once while the bar meter still green, and you can get Preempective Strike in the early battle.Because of the Storyline, you might need the FFXIII to understand the situation (or you just can read the synopsis of FFXIII  that already in the menu).Seriously I enjoy both of this game FFXIII and FFXIII-2 (Mostly for battle-style and storyline)Preempective Strike: It's a strike that make you easier to get Stagger mode. Which is it will make your damage become higher than normal fight.Enjoy the game and have fun! Peace. ^^,			"

												Possibly the worst port of a console game I have ever played. After 2 hours of trying to get the game to run without crashing on startup, I finally found that it was the Launcher causing the problem. Ran the game from Command Line bypassing the Launcher, and I ran it at maximum settings on native resolution of 2560 x 1440.Performance wise, the game ran at around 30fps. Not great. But what really pisses me off is that even at the highest res and maximum detail settings this game looks awful. Found a thread which advised to alter the Nvidia Control settings which did actually help. But still, the game should not look and perform this bad on my high end PC.Avoid the PC version like the plague! "

												This is the game FF13 should have been. It's almost amazing how well Square Enix managed to improve upon FF13 while maintaining it's core principles and mechanics.Gameplay is an improved version of FF13's paradigm/ATB combat. You still have the same roles (COM, RAV, SAB, SYN, MED, SEN) and the same maximum of 3 members in your party. Except now you have the ability to get rare drops from almost everything you fight (excluding bosses) that allow you to use said monster for your 3rd party member. This really opens up that much needed flexibility, compared to FF13 where all 6 party members were essentially the same apart from their full ATB skill. Also important to note is that there's no longer a long animation for paradigm shifting, which really feels more natural and doesn't make your characters idle for a few seconds, wasting that precious time you could be using to input commands. Characters feel less clunky and slow in their animations and you get the full combat system available very early on into the story. One of the main gripes I had with FF13 was that you were forced into the slow progression into unlocking the full capabilities of the paradigm shifting system. Other than the reasonable improvements, it's still essentially FF13's combat mechanics. You still craft higher tier-weapons with monster materials, although it's less farmy compared to FF13. Accessories take a major backseat due to a limitation being placed on the amount of accessories you can hold on one character, which different accessories having different amounts of capacity they take up. Eidolons/Summons are gone, but it's not really missed since you'd barely use them in FF13 anyway. You also get Fragment Skills, which are unlocked as you go along completing the game. These have a wide range of effects from changing monster encounter rates to opening up different endings by allowing an alternative path.The world itself has been really revamped though. You can now jump (although you're often blocked with invisible walls in most places) and as a result, there's a lot more verticality in the map design. You aren't forced into a corridor driving you forward towards the story. Progression is done by visiting areas of varying sizes, some small, some very large, in different time periods. You'll often have the option of visiting a place multiple times in different time periods, but it's not repetitive due to the slightly altered designs and different npcs. FF13-2 still has that gorgeous visual quality from FF13. The level design really has an emphasis on creating the perfect atmosphere for the situation, It's amazing how well they managed to convey each time period of the same location so uniquely.The story's done much better, with excellent pacing that feels natural and not forced. You unlock new locations (and time periods of that said location) within a level and progress slowly along with the story, although the locations have barely any correlation with each other. The story itself is actually done well. Characters feel natural and likable, and the main antagonist is one of the best Final Fantasy villians in recent memory. Pacing is done well since you control where and when to go and it's fairly open. It feels more like you're just going around places solving time paradoxes and moving onto the next world, which is a really nice change from FF13's forced pacing. There's plenty of optional areas to visit during the story, and the hub (Historia Crux) allows you to visit past areas instantly without having to retrace your steps. Sonically, this is personally one of my favourites from the recent FF games. There's FF13 tracks, remixed FF13 tracks and new music that really helps set the tone of the game. There's beautiful orchestral tracks, well written vocals and context appropriate background music that help drive the atmosphere of each and every situation. Although I felt there were a bit too many vocals and it was definite far more than what's usually present in a FF game. Not that I'm complaining though, some of the vocal tracks are done perfectly. Naoshi Mizuta outdoes herself in Noel's Theme, which features hauntingly sombre vocals, with a simple piano and violin background. The song really encompasses the character Noel and his struggles, and it's used to really emphasise emotional scenes. The main battle theme, Paradigm Shift, is a fast paced track featuring a vibrant violin, a simple but strong drum beat and a bassy synth. It really suits the frantic but orderly nature of battles and it's colourful but subdued enough to help focus on the battle. Eclipse is another standout, with vocals acting as a backing to the sharp violins, frantic pianos and punchy bassline. Honestly, even if my terrible adjectives haven't convinced you, at least listen to the soundtrack. It's really good.As a PC port, it's bad. Not FF13 bad, but still pretty bad. It has graphical options for resolution, anti-aliasing and shadow resolutions but nothing else. And it's not even ingame, but within a window that acts as a launcher of sorts. The EscKey=AltF4 is still here with it's warning box that's STILL a popup box outside of the game. It's 60fps, but poorly optimised so you can expect sudden drops in certain areas. Graphically, it's stunning but with few options to tinker around with. There hasn't been any bugs I've noticed though, compared to FF13 which suffered from random crashes that forced you to save at every available opportunity. As PC ports go, Square Enix still has a long way to go.All in all, it's a good game with great visuals, an interesting time-travel based story with an optimised combat system from FF13 and a very memorable OST. Better than FF13 in every way. Easily get it if you're a fan of jRPGs, it's an excellent choice.			"

												I read all the other reviews on how this game is a bad port. I've played 3 hours give or take and have experienced 5 crashes. Game crashes at cutscenes, when I try to save, and random intervals so far. I'm beyond irritated so I think ill stop playing until this gets resolved....if it gets resolved.			"

												Decent game; I don't know why so many people whine about it. Even though it's a port and it's short compared to the previous title, I had no issues with it on my PC; it ran smoorthly and it only crashed once, and I enjoyed playing it. The game is pretty good; I honestly liked FF-13 more, but 13-2 wasn't bad. The story was alright, it was confusing at first but it all makes sense by the end. Although, I didn't really feel anything by the end, whereas at the end of FF-13, I felt a tiny bit emotional. It felt like they made a huge game and spilt it into two parts; the second being Lighting Returns. So, I was like ""meh, that's it?"" at the end.  Graphics are great, nothing really to say about it. The music was perfect as it usually is with a Square Enix game. Gameplay was good, but I still don't get why I have to grind, even for a tiny bit, in a single player game. I couldn't be bothered leveling my party past stage 14 and I didn't need to because I beat the final boss with ease. I still had a few side missions to do to get more fragments, but I couldn't be bothered since it has no effect on the story what so ever. Overall, it's a great final fantasy game, not the best, but pretty decent. I defintely recommend buying it, especially if it's on sale. It's worth your time if you're a FF fan. Ignore all those negative reviews; those people either play on ancient PC's or are obsessed with the past and are unwilling to accept change to the franchise.			"

												Think of this game as being kind of a combination of Chrono Trigger and SMT.  If the linearity of the previous game bothered you, you will be happy to discover that you can do whatever the hell you want and go to a lot of spots in the game's world after the first couple of hours. Monster party members also add a lot of flexibility to the combat!The story, while insane, is a lot softer than FFXIII's, and the slower pace allows you to learn about the characters and their motivations more. Many have said that Caius is probably the best villian SE's writers have created, and for good reason.			"

												Possibly the worst port of a console game I have ever played. After 2 hours of trying to get the game to run without crashing on startup, I finally found that it was the Launcher causing the problem. Ran the game from Command Line bypassing the Launcher, and I ran it at maximum settings on native resolution of 2560 x 1440.Performance wise, the game ran at around 30fps. Not great. But what really pisses me off is that even at the highest res and maximum detail settings this game looks awful. Found a thread which advised to alter the Nvidia Control settings which did actually help. But still, the game should not look and perform this bad on my high end PC.Avoid the PC version like the plague! "

  ""I shall remember your pain, it will be carved in my heart.""   Pros :- Better performance than XIII.- I appreciated the QTEs: they made some memorable fights.- Beautiful OST: some of them are very enjoyable.- Caius is one of the best villains in the entire saga. Unfortunately, he is in one of the worst games in the franchise.- Unexpected ending for a Final Fantasy game: it shocked me in a good way.- A better combat system than XIII ... Cons :- ... But with only two playable characters + a third one selectable from monsters that you have captured. Bad design choise, imho.- There are a lot of plot holes: all the good things that were made in the previous chapter have lost their importance. Time travels? Gods and Goddesses? Why these important changes in the story?- All characters - except Caius, as i said - are mere puppets. They are victims of events. No charisma. Vote : 5/10PS. Oh, i forget an other Pros:  Serah dies.  "

												Framerate is horrible, even though my PC exceeds the recommended specs given. Changing graphical settings (to the limited degree allowed for by the game launcher) does not affect this at all. Whether I run it at 720p with everything dialed down or 1920x1200 with everything at max has no effect at all. The opening fight is stuck at 20fps for the most part. And given my experience with XIII itself, it doubt it gets any better further into the game.			"

												You played FFXIII and want to know if this one is worth playing?  That depends on what you did and didn't like about XIIII'll compare the two games some to give you an idea of how the sequel changed up the formula.Linearity:XIII-2 is much more open than the first game.  Each area can be explored and has hidden objects to discover, there are also occasionally different enemy types for different parts the zones.  There are less unique locations than the first game, but I think the openness of the areas makes up for it.Party members:  There are 2.  The first game had 6 characters to choose from and while many parts forced you into specific configurations of party members, there were times that you had a choice of how to compose your party.  XIII-2 only has two human party members and the third slot is for monster party members that you capture and level up sort of like pokemon.  There is quite a bit of depth to this mechanic, but I still would have liked some extra speaking party members.Combat:  Largely unchanged.  Big improvements are the ability to continue fighting a battle when your party leader dies, and the ability to change leader mid-battle.  Some of the SAB and SYN abilities appear to be missing, making those roles a bit more simplified(Those skills may be present in monster party members that I haven't used yet)  Monsters are not sitting out of the world in this game, at least for the most part.  They act more like the random encounters of older JRPGs, with the exception that you can still occasionally avoid them after they have spawned by running away.  I feel like this is a better system because it mostly prevents you from farming a single enemy over and over like the optimal CP grind in the first game which ultimately led to me giving up on its endgame. Crafting:  I disliked the crafting system in the previous game, largely because it wouldn't tell you which items were required to improve weapons, and it had no indicator to show when a piece of equipment was at it's max level or could be upgrading another rank.  XIII-2 has solved these problems but also has a much simpler system which lost some of the depth that could have been.  A vendor sells you new weapons in exchange for crafting materials and occasionally an old weapon too.  Story:I found FFXIII's story to be enjoyable but also easily forgettable.  I didn't think any of the characters were well written or very likable(except for maybe Saszh) and only a few months later I barely remember any of the major plotpoints.  XIII-2 is much the same case, There are parts of the story that I liked, but the character dialogue was mostly bland and often grating.  In particular I found one of the main characters very unlikable, and with no option to remove him from my party I had to play the entire game with him.Endgame:  I find that I am enjoying XIII-2's end game much more than that of the previous game.  The path to max level is almost over and I have just been going around doing quests for fragments with barely any true grinding. There is a lot to do with the monster party members that I have not done yet; that appears like it could get grindy later on.  I haven't fought any of the hardest bosses in either game yet, but for XIII-2 I do think I will end up doing that, while I don't know if I can stand the grind in XIII long enough to get there.New Things:Puzzles:  There are some puzzles that are required to be completed in certain areas, and for the most part I found these ranged for boring and unenjoyable to frustrating and unenjoyable.  I think at this point that I've finished all of the puzzles in the game, and I didn't find one of them to be enjoyable at all, and I enjoy playing puzzle games occasionally.Hidden objects:  There are a lot of hidden objects to find in the game for 100% completion.  Fragments are mostly tied to quests but occasionally hidden throughout the game world.  There is an indicator to show you how many you are missing in a particular area, and I've been enjoying hunting these down.  I find them much more interesting than the less varied Ci'eth stone missions from the first game.Then there are the wild artefacts which I ended up hating.  These are hidden objects that must be found to access certain areas.  Most of them I found during regular play, but after beating the game I still had a few that I hadn't found, and with no indicator hinting at which zone they might be in, I had to mindlessly comb every area I had been to looking for the last few.  I finally did manage to find them all, but I found the task very frustrating.  It feels like the developers might have been assuming that players would just go online for a guide for these, but I prefer to avoid outside assistance when possible.Overall I enjoy it and if you enjoyed the first game you may very well enjoy this one as well.  It still has many of the flaws that drove away hardcore Final Fantasy fans, but some of those were fixed. "

												Chocolina and Mog.  Possibly the only redeeming qualities of XIII-2.  Okay and maybe the music.  XIII was a full, flagship title game; XIII-2 and LR feel like they were created by a third-party using assets that were not included in the original XIII.  The developers even stated in interviews that they had enough material leftover from XIII to create another game.  Well, guess what, this is what you get; sloppy story written to fit the usable assets rather than build assets for a decent story.  Time travel can be an excellent tool in storytelling but it can also be an excuse for developers to reuse the same environment but give it a different name.  They did try to make this game seem appealing, and it would be, for, say, people who have never played a above average RPG.  While I did not run into many issues other players have reported a number of issues with the port on the community hub page.  Sadly as a whole the experience was not very memorable for me but for someone new to FF - maybe.  And cripes would it have killed them to change or even modify the model of the treasure spheres?? Pros: a) Mog & Chocolinab) You can throw mogc) You get to see all the assets that could have been in XIIId) Cinematic cutscenese) Couple of nice music tracksCons:a) Messy story (if you were expecting romance, sorry to disappoint)b) Barely any Lightningc) Few new monsters (reused the same models/animations from XIII)d) Gimmicks/time sinks in place of good storytelling (coliseum, casino, quizzes, weather changes, 100% map collection)e) Changes as a result of time travel not tied to the main story are superficial, no significance, minimal impact (you don't get to see the results of the change and quite frankly aren't given many opportunities to make change)f)  Spawn rates are far too frequent to let you just enjoy the game; you never become truly immersedg) lazy end game; at one point it literally turns into a platformer with respawn by falling into void space (FML) h) Poor character development			"

												It's time!I can't say I expected much after the dissapointment that was Final Fantasy XIII.But I ended up enjoying this game a lot more than the original.If you want to read my review for the original XIII :  Link Time for pros and cons:Pros: +The game is no longer a long corridor, the areas are open with things to be discovered and time travel gives a good excuse to see many diverse and interesting locations. There is a nice amount of different locations and some areas are the same location but in a different time period.+Good music overall and some tracks are superb. Like these:  Paradigm Shift   Noel's Theme+The narrative is very focused compared to the muddled mess in the original. This is mostly thanks to there only being a handful of main characters.+The villian is great, you completely understand why he is doing the things he does.+The combat is a lot better this time around while still feeling like the same system:     +When you changed your partys roles in the orignal game there was a animation that took you out of the battle for about 2         seconds, this might not seem like a big deal but removing this animation and just letting the battle flow like it was before does a lot to improve the pacing of fights in this game.     +If the character you are controlling dies you just take control of the other person in your party. This was lacking in the  original game and it is very nice to see them address this problem.      +You can also change what character you are controlling mid battle, a very welcome addition.+The leveling system is actually very open to customization compared to the linear mess in the original. If you want to you could go through the entire game without ever getting the ability to heal. Not that I would reccomend it but it's awesome that you can do that.+You have 2 characters that are stuck in your party and a third slot open for a monster that you have tamed. You can tame most of the monsters in the game and every monster has its own abilites and base stats. I say base stats because you could have 2 ""Behemoth"" monsters but level them up completely differently. You can also find a lot of cosmetic items for the monsters, including hats. Each monster also has a unique limit break ability.+There is loads of optional content. Through the story you will be collecting ""Fragments"" to unlock new locations and time periods. You get these items by doing side quests and just finding them in chests. When I finished the game I only had 36 out of 160. So if you want to, you could spend a lot of time with this game.+This time around they included some actual graphics options. Including resolution, MSAA up to 16x and shadow resolution.+The game CAN run at 60 fps but...+There is dual audio, I played it in english and everyone was fine except for Lightning. She has less peronality than Microsoft Sam. Good thing Lightning only has about 10 minutes of screentime in the entire game.+Weapon system is better than in the original. In the original you could upgrade your weapons meaning that if you just kept upgrading your original weapon you had no reason to ever buy a new one. And because of the effort and gil needed to upgrade a single weapon you literally had no reason to ever get a new weapon. In this one you get access to new weapons in the shop the further you progress in the game, some are just a straight up upgrade, stat wise anyway. But other weapons have special abilites stuck to them but these require some additional items aswell as gil to be bought. All in all it's a straightforward system but at least it works, unlike the original.+Game leads nicely into XIII-3.Cons: -Time travel elements are very ""It's magic I ain't got to explain‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•quot;, but then the characters waste a lot of time in cutscenes talking about how it works and it just ends up wasting time.-The combat is still very much a case of just switching your classes to match the situation and pressing the ""Auto"" button. There was only one time in the game where I actually selected commands and that was because I was against an enemy that had health regen but my character refused to cast poison with auto.-You can't control your characters in battles. This can be really annoying in a lot of different sittuations, like when you have somebody as a tank with the ability to divert enemy attention to themselves and the party just stands around really close to each other, as a result everyone gets hit regardless. This defeats the entire purpose of a system that works in a 3D space.-Story was okay at best but a lot of time was wasted on nonsensical time travel ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t and in the end it just came down to ""X thing is a paradox, we must kill/fix it!"". X often being just a random boss enemy in the area. The story was more interesting when it focused on the stories of Ciaus, Yuel, Serah and Noel.-The game has very unstable framerate. I never dropped under 30 though, nonetheless it can be very annoying to watch as the framerate jumps all over the place.- The game crashed at least once every 2 hours. The biggest time lost as a result was 1 hour. Regardless, this was very annoying and by doing a short google search I can see that I am not the only one with this issue.-This time around there are minigames, something lacking from the original but all of them are luck based and some are even locked behind DLC. Conclusion:I must admit I wasn't excpecting much out of this game but all the non-linearity and freedom came as a big surprise.With loads of optional content, much improved combat system and non-linearity in almost every aspect, this game is actually worth playing unlike the original. As long as you are fine with a combat system that is very simplistic and a story that makes little to no sense.I will likely edit this review soon if I forgot to talk about something.			"

Crafting:  I disliked the crafting system in the previous game, largely because it wouldn't tell you which items were required to improve weapons, and it had no indicator to show when a piece of equipment was at it's max level or could be upgrading another rank.  XIII-2 has solved these problems but also has a much simpler system which lost some of the depth that could have been.  A vendor sells you new weapons in exchange for crafting materials and occasionally an old weapon too.  Story:I found FFXIII's story to be enjoyable but also easily forgettable.  I didn't think any of the characters were well written or very likable(except for maybe Saszh) and only a few months later I barely remember any of the major plotpoints.  XIII-2 is much the same case, There are parts of the story that I liked, but the character dialogue was mostly bland and often grating.  In particular I found one of the main characters very unlikable, and with no option to remove him from my party I had to play the entire game with him.Endgame:  I find that I am enjoying XIII-2's end game much more than that of the previous game.  The path to max level is almost over and I have just been going around doing quests for fragments with barely any true grinding. There is a lot to do with the monster party members that I have not done yet; that appears like it could get grindy later on.  I haven't fought any of the hardest bosses in either game yet, but for XIII-2 I do think I will end up doing that, while I don't know if I can stand the grind in XIII long enough to get there.New Things:Puzzles:  There are some puzzles that are required to be completed in certain areas, and for the most part I found these ranged for boring and unenjoyable to frustrating and unenjoyable.  I think at this point that I've finished all of the puzzles in the game, and I didn't find one of them to be enjoyable at all, and I enjoy playing puzzle games occasionally.Hidden objects:  There are a lot of hidden objects to find in the game for 100% completion.  Fragments are mostly tied to quests but occasionally hidden throughout the game world.  There is an indicator to show you how many you are missing in a particular area, and I've been enjoying hunting these down.  I find them much more interesting than the less varied Ci'eth stone missions from the first game.Then there are the wild artefacts which I ended up hating.  These are hidden objects that must be found to access certain areas.  Most of them I found during regular play, but after beating the game I still had a few that I hadn't found, and with no indicator hinting at which zone they might be in, I had to mindlessly comb every area I had been to looking for the last few.  I finally did manage to find them all, but I found the task very frustrating.  It feels like the developers might have been assuming that players would just go online for a guide for these, but I prefer to avoid outside assistance when possible.Overall I enjoy it and if you enjoyed the first game you may very well enjoy this one as well.  It still has many of the flaws that drove away hardcore Final Fantasy fans, but some of those were fixed. "

												Chocolina and Mog.  Possibly the only redeeming qualities of XIII-2.  Okay and maybe the music.  XIII was a full, flagship title game; XIII-2 and LR feel like they were created by a third-party using assets that were not included in the original XIII.  The developers even stated in interviews that they had enough material leftover from XIII to create another game.  Well, guess what, this is what you get; sloppy story written to fit the usable assets rather than build assets for a decent story.  Time travel can be an excellent tool in storytelling but it can also be an excuse for developers to reuse the same environment but give it a different name.  They did try to make this game seem appealing, and it would be, for, say, people who have never played a above average RPG.  While I did not run into many issues other players have reported a number of issues with the port on the community hub page.  Sadly as a whole the experience was not very memorable for me but for someone new to FF - maybe.  And cripes would it have killed them to change or even modify the model of the treasure spheres?? Pros: a) Mog & Chocolinab) You can throw mogc) You get to see all the assets that could have been in XIIId) Cinematic cutscenese) Couple of nice music tracksCons:a) Messy story (if you were expecting romance, sorry to disappoint)b) Barely any Lightningc) Few new monsters (reused the same models/animations from XIII)d) Gimmicks/time sinks in place of good storytelling (coliseum, casino, quizzes, weather changes, 100% map collection)e) Changes as a result of time travel not tied to the main story are superficial, no significance, minimal impact (you don't get to see the results of the change and quite frankly aren't given many opportunities to make change)f)  Spawn rates are far too frequent to let you just enjoy the game; you never become truly immersedg) lazy end game; at one point it literally turns into a platformer with respawn by falling into void space (FML) h) Poor character development			"

												I have a GTX 770 and I was able to run the game at a perfectly comfortable framerate at 1920X1080, 16x AA, and the second highest shadow resolution it offered.  The only problem I have with this game is that it took so long to start feeling like a final fantasy game.  The first two thirds of the game felt like a half baked dlc for the first game, but for the last third or so of the game it really redeemed itself, and I really enjoyed it.			"

												After playing all 3 FF XIII games, this is my least favorite. While XIII was too linear, Squenix took that criticism too literally, putting the explorable areas out of order, making gameplay confusing and frustrating.The story was lackluster at best, and while it's not time traveling at its worst, a polished turd is still a polished turd.One thing I am glad about was that the first two games being so bad made the way for a third game that was really enjoyable, so long as you don't pay attention to the storyline.

												The game itself is good, but the performance issues, which are exponentially worse than the first game's, are not worth the trouble. Regardless of how good your PC is, you're going to find yourself either disabling the framerate pacer and playing in slow motion or limiting your framerate to 30. You're better off playing this on a console.			"

												I'm not entirely sure of what is going on with the game crashing for other people but running on an i5 6600k processor and a gtx 970 this game seems to run fine graphicly with a few of the settings moved up from the lower settings and I haven't had any issues with crashes. The only time it glitched was first opening it the game stayed on the square enix logo for a little bit. Maybe I'm lucky or someting idk.This game so far has been great its not quite as linear as XIII was but it is still quite linear. The cool thing is that it allows you to go back and redo places, visit anywhere you've already been, and I like how they switched out sneaking up on enemies for preemitive strike. Its golden. You get to have up to three creatures from the game set in to switch up your party so you can run things like Relentless Assault, Tortise, tri-disaster and any of your paradigms from the old game which is pretty sweet and I like how you only have two permanent members of the party for simplicity in leveling people up (not that keeping track of everyone was bad I'm just lazy). These things add up to make the game pretty great and enjoyable. Theres also lots of cinnimatic real time event stuff that looks pretty cool and is pretty easy as long as you kinda know the layout of the buttons the game want you to do.If you thought regular thirteen was fun you'll probably like this one as well. If you haven't played through thirteen it also has a beginner's notebook thing on the title screen so you can instantly read through the events of thirteen if you're a horrible person.			"

												FFXIII-2 got the changes that people wanted from FFXIII.  -Less linear -you can actually spec your characters while leveling them up-change leaders in the middle of a fight which means you no longer lose the fight if the leader dies.-enemies randomly appear rather than already being there-premptive strikes are a lot easier and make more sense-introduced paradigm save slotsThe only major downside was the total nerf of the Synergist role and how you applied buffs.  -Haste is no longer a castable spell but rather a bonus for getting a premptive strike, some items also apply it.  They also added aoe buffs which I guess balances it out.-The two main characters do not have any offensive buffs you can only get them from your monsters or their feral links.-removed fortisols-accessories are restricted, each one has a numeral cost.-some of the accesories got absolutely dirt nerfed.Overal I like FFXIII-2 just as much as the first.  It feels more fast paced in both the story and the gameplay.  The only thing you might have some problems with are finding some good monsters to level up in your party, especially early game.			"

												FFXIII-2 got the changes that people wanted from FFXIII.  -Less linear -you can actually spec your characters while leveling them up-change leaders in the middle of a fight which means you no longer lose the fight if the leader dies.-enemies randomly appear rather than already being there-premptive strikes are a lot easier and make more sense-introduced paradigm save slotsThe only major downside was the total nerf of the Synergist role and how you applied buffs.  -Haste is no longer a castable spell but rather a bonus for getting a premptive strike, some items also apply it.  They also added aoe buffs which I guess balances it out.-The two main characters do not have any offensive buffs you can only get them from your monsters or their feral links.-removed fortisols-accessories are restricted, each one has a numeral cost.-some of the accesories got absolutely dirt nerfed.Overal I like FFXIII-2 just as much as the first.  It feels more fast paced in both the story and the gameplay.  The only thing you might have some problems with are finding some good monsters to level up in your party, especially early game.			"

												I'll probably try it again in future but its not measuring up well to recent RPG I'm playing right now and although more gameplay orientated, less video heavy and less linear then 13, it feels more confusing and monotonous for it.What gate does the new fragment you've obtained go, does it work on any unused gate? I'm also not keen on the monsters  management / collection thing, if they operated like a pet bear or wolf that happens to level up and you get clear choices / abilities on how they can aid you then great but it all feels a little too microey to me.Overall, great music and visuals, interesting concept and some improvements in places but it just feels a little overlay complicated and not easy to play (in terms of flow not difficulty). Maybe I try it again in future and have good things to say about it.			"

Gameplay: 6/10It's almost the same as in ff13, but this time you don't get a stagger bonus when you attack a enemy from behind. So how does it work now? Well you got a timer/clock thing, and you get the bonus if you attack before the timer runs out.Score: 6/10Summary: What were you guys smoking.			"

												In all honesty, An absolutely amazing game.Pro's:- Superb OST's- Incredible villain, Caius is arguably the best villain since Kefka.- Same battle system as 13(it's good)- Monster collecting is good- Cinematic boss battles, boss battle in general are very goodCONS:- Some of the puzzles are genuinely infuriating, Clock puzzles that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing stupid academia puzzle.- Augusta tower battle every 3 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing seconds- Capture rates on rare monsters prior to getting battlemania/monster collector are completely ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed and by the time you get battlemania most of the rare monsters are redundantAll in all though, if you're a fan of final fantasy this game is an absolute must play, Caius is an amazing antoganist easily the best since Kefka, Unless you have brain damage the story line is very easy to follow and quite good(not amazing but it's good) The negative reviews of this game are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and most of them are from people with like 1-3 hours lol.

												This game improves the gameplay from the original FFXIII but it doesn't improves in many other aspects. Now you can control wild monsters to fight along side you. I didn't like the backtracking, there's a part in the game that you must collect graviton cores and for that you must do sidequestss to collect fragments to open the right gates to then collect the graviton cores needed, that means some sidequests must be done to progress the main story. The story is great and the soundtrack is even better. The port for the PC however is very bad, no graphical options, just 2 resolutions, no sound options, capped at 30 fps, etc. So, I played the game with 15fps till the end.Score: 8/10.			"

												Awesome title from Square, even though the port could've been a little bit better, but still, the experience is there...(sidenote: I've beaten both FFXIII and FFXIII-2 first on Xbox and now on PC)Mechanics: IMO Better than FFXIII; Everything feels more responsive while switching paragims and selecting abilities (it was veery restricive in FFXIII, to that extend, that I was thinking about modding it for the sake of beating Long Gui) there are still some balance issues and, if you plan the whole development of your characters beforehand, you will end up with killing everything in one salvo without stagger, srsly, if you want the challenge later on in the game, try mods that increase HP, Strength and Mana of all enemies (google ""FFXIII-2 Difficulty Enhancement Mod""). Oh, and the +50% ATB rate weapons are OP, totally OP. Since you get them, there isn't anything else worth looking when it comes to weapons (MAYBE +1 ATB weapons for that 6 ATB segments action lol)Story: Interesting, yet somewhat disappointing and too short for my taste (when this game was coming out, I was hoping for the title that would be like FFX-2 was to FFX). Tbh I liked FFXIII's story better despite its linear feel, but it does not mean FFXIII-2 sucks in that regard. It has some awesome and funny moments, plus you decide what to do next (you can techically get ~140 fragments before beating the main plot, but that would make the final boss battle laughable considering the amount of CP you will acumulate throughout the game). Overall, it's damn dark compared to the first title and, let's be honest, how many FFs are there where the ""bad guys"" actually win?As for the DLCs, PLAY'EM! the boss battles are a lot better than the main story (read ""more difficult"").Replayability: The amount of combinations that there is when it comes to Serah/Noel stats is just astonishing. Every player is able to create his/her own, unique character setup with the new CP system, that does not make your characters unstoppable. Each development strategy has its strenghts and weaknesses, and leads to different late game scenario, which is shaped by person's individual needs when progerssing though the game, A BIG PLUS for that.Is this game better than FFXIII? In some ways, yesDo I like it? YESIs it my favorite FF? Nope, that title goes to FFXWould I recomment it? If you've played FFXIII and liked it, ABSOLUTELYScore:chocobo/10			"

												Nowhere near as good as the first Final Fantasy XIII-2. It's really that simple. It's not the worst game you'll play, but the story is just flat out boring (while somehow also being confusing) and the art design lazy. While the game may look great on a technical level, the world around you looks like re-used areas from Final Fantasy X, but smaller and with less life.The battle system is good, with it basically being the same as Final Fantasy XIII. However, it has the added annoyance of you running around trying to actually hit enemies before a battle in tight spaces. This ends with you attacking the air for 15 seconds before battle as you try to hit your enemy.If you play it, you won't hate it, but I can't imagine many people finishing it unless they simply have nothing else to do.It's a real shame that we can't buy this game on PC, though. We have to make do with renting it from steam.			"

												Somewhat bland.  The story's forced and doesn't make logical sense. It's a grim reminder that ""time travel is really hard to write about *sobs*"" (--Dean Pelton).  The combat system is as monotonous as the first game in the 13 series and I nodded off quite a few times.  The levelling curve was also awkward with several areas consisting of enemies I can barely kill and then all of a sudden every boss encounter I have lasts barely 10 seconds.  There's quite a few boss fights that are just cheesy and have instantkill mechanics.  Aside from those, most of the boss fights are simplistic.  The game essentially doesn't respect the time of the player, makes progression quite vague, and involves a lot of walking back and forth, which may explain why I ended up outlevelling the content.  My opinion of this game may be clouded by how good Chrono Trigger was by comparison.  If you take the awful bits of Chrono Cross and cram it into a game, you essentially get FF13-2.Gameplay: 2.5/5Story: 2/5Music: 3/5Fun: 2/5PS:  One thing I really liked was the concept of Paradox Endings.  It's nice to have a game that lets you ""fail"" and see the consequences.  This is somewhat from Chrono Trigger as well but takes a lot less time for the most part to execute.			"

												I <3 this game.Pros:-Serah is a cutie patootie.-The music is amazing. So amazing that I actually bought the soundtrack to support it.-The fighting style is pretty neat. If you liked XIII's, then it's pretty much the same with a few tweaks that make it better  such as the fact that switching paradigms is now much faster.-Comes with some of the DLC. So you get some outfits for Serah, Noel, and Mog along with some extra episodes to complete involving characters from the first game. -100%'ing the game isn't super tedious. In fact, it's actually pretty enjoyable since with every fragment comes a little bit of story. The bestiary fragment is the most tedious, but by the end of the game you should have encountered a bunch of the monsters already.-I didn't feel the need to grind too often, though that might just be because I was spending a lot of time in each area in an attempt to get the fragments and exploring the whole map.Cons:-This port isn't the best. I imagine most computers will have problems running this at a constant 60 FPS. But if you can get past that, you should be okay.-The slot machines are awful but you need to play them if you're going for 100% completion as one of the fragments comes from the slot machines. You will never get 3 ochus. Ever. (and if you do please let me know) I can't think of any other cons. The FPS issue is the biggest thing, really, and people are coming up with their own solutions to it. 10/10 would play again. "

												It's imperative you do research before purchasing this game, unfortunately. Look on the Steam forums for potential hardware issues (AMD CPU/GPU owners especially) and only decide after reading around. Depending on your rig, this game either works fine or with a tonne of issues (if at all). Sadly, I am in the latter group.However, the game itself is really enjoyable. I originally played it on the PlayStation 3 so I have prior and relevent experience with it. It is a relatively easy game as far as Final Fantasy titles go - even moreso if you're a well-seasoned RPGer and spend a lot of time exp grinding / farming. Aside from the main content of the story, there are quite a few additional things you can amuse yourselves with: chocobo racing, completing the monster log, slot machines, additional areas to explore, min-maxing pets and of course, the PC version comes with all of the DLC included.The environments are varied and interesting, full of colour and detail. In addition to the main characters, you're able to capture and train a pet for the third party slot. They will fulfil a specific role (Medic, Saboteur, Ravager etc.) and you can build paradigm sets to suit your play style.FFXIII-2 is designed with casual play in mind, I believe. There's a catch-up cutscene every time you load a previously-saved game, to remind you of your progress in the main story missions. This game also has, in my opinion, one of the best Final Fantasy soundtracks in recent years.Worth a try, certainly. If you can get it working properly. "

												This PC port does not allow downscaling, it does not run at 60FPS, and it runs like complete trash.HOWEVER, throw all those elitist PC thoughts out the window because the music is just outstanding. It's great, NO ITS WONDERFUL and it's argubly the best kind of music I've heard since Final Fantasy VII and XIV. This is my favorite Final Fantasy OST! I would give up 60FPS at 4k for good music any day, so, I totally recommend this game!Serah's theme (aka Wish) is one of the best songs I've heard from a video game.			"

												I really loved playing this game when it came out on xbox 360. When i saw it go on sale, it made me really excited to play this game.When i actually started to play this game, i was really disappointed. The port for this game is absolutely horrid. The game crashes at random times,which makes the game unplayable. After 3 hours of gameplay i only got to the second time period and didnt even finish it because of the game crashing and me having to restart from where i last saved.The framrate is not too bad ,but can definelty be better than 59 cap. This game would be amazing to play if square enix actually cared about this port and fixed these problems. I do not recomend buying this until they fix the port.			"

												FFXIII-2, the second game in the FFXIII Trilogy. This time around, you get to play as ""Noel, Noel Kreiss"" and Serah in an improved battle system which most would say is better. There are also cinematic action battles where you get to ""live action"" fight.Most people would have played FFXIII-2 on PS3 or XBOX 360, the game is just a port but now runs at 60 FPS* and 1080P. For those who have played it, you either like it or you don't (or the game is alright, but that means you pretty much like it heheheh).Better to try it out yourself and be the judge to see if it is a good port/game. If you have not played it before then youtube it and be your own judge. Everyone thinks differently and some people like to follow the crowd, while others are fans of the series. Watch some gameplay and possibly buy the game and try it out yourself.			"

												I reviewed the previous title with a positive result but a list of negative aspects that make it a good but not great game, and this one would come only a little behind. Despite very mixed reviews, I find the combat system (essentially carried over from FF XIII) is still challenging and fun, and the new twist with ""capturable/trainable"" monsters was interesting and fresh. Like the previous title, however, the storyline is still bland and the characters too formulaic to be likable. The Steam version also comes with all the DLC from the console version, however it's only unlocked after the main story ends, so while it looked pretty interesting I just couldn't bring myself to complete it. After 60+ hours spent on the storyline, I couldn't muster the courage to keep playing.			"

												I'll write an actual reveiw for the game when it's playable.In the little things, settings, ui elements having greater assests than 720p, this is a better port than FF13. BUT whatever it is with the engine, can't make the game run over 10fps during the overworld and cutscenes/Live segements, and become horridly desynced, when oddly battles are always a clean 60fps.I've used GeDoSaTo, i've used the graphic-card's settings, i've modded the exe and ini's, i've reduced settings to‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and all for the same exact result, laggy overworld, desync'd cutscenes and qtes, and perfectly flow 60 frames per second battles. Soooo till it's either patched or I find an acceptable means of playing it, this reveiw is gonna be: ""Don't Bother""			"

												Awesome title from Square, even though the port could've been a little bit better, but still, the experience is there...(sidenote: I've beaten both FFXIII and FFXIII-2 first on Xbox and now on PC)Mechanics: IMO Better than FFXIII; Everything feels more responsive while switching paragims and selecting abilities (it was veery restricive in FFXIII, to that extend, that I was thinking about modding it for the sake of beating Long Gui) there are still some balance issues and, if you plan the whole development of your characters beforehand, you will end up with killing everything in one salvo without stagger, srsly, if you want the challenge later on in the game, try mods that increase HP, Strength and Mana of all enemies (google ""FFXIII-2 Difficulty Enhancement Mod""). Oh, and the +50% ATB rate weapons are OP, totally OP. Since you get them, there isn't anything else worth looking when it comes to weapons (MAYBE +1 ATB weapons for that 6 ATB segments action lol)Story: Interesting, yet somewhat disappointing and too short for my taste (when this game was coming out, I was hoping for the title that would be like FFX-2 was to FFX). Tbh I liked FFXIII's story better despite its linear feel, but it does not mean FFXIII-2 sucks in that regard. It has some awesome and funny moments, plus you decide what to do next (you can techically get ~140 fragments before beating the main plot, but that would make the final boss battle laughable considering the amount of CP you will acumulate throughout the game). Overall, it's damn dark compared to the first title and, let's be honest, how many FFs are there where the ""bad guys"" actually win?As for the DLCs, PLAY'EM! the boss battles are a lot better than the main story (read ""more difficult"").Replayability: The amount of combinations that there is when it comes to Serah/Noel stats is just astonishing. Every player is able to create his/her own, unique character setup with the new CP system, that does not make your characters unstoppable. Each development strategy has its strenghts and weaknesses, and leads to different late game scenario, which is shaped by person's individual needs when progerssing though the game, A BIG PLUS for that.Is this game better than FFXIII? In some ways, yesDo I like it? YESIs it my favorite FF? Nope, that title goes to FFXWould I recomment it? If you've played FFXIII and liked it, ABSOLUTELYScore:chocobo/10			"

It's frustrating and useless. It's a good thing there aren't that much.

The cutscenes run smooth however, the gameplay it stutters so bad I tried patching it myself, tried fixing it myself. Yet it cannot handle 60 FPS, I am utterly stunned on how bad this console port is. I think the next time I get a console port, is Im never going to buy a console port.

												The amount of times that this game crashes is so insane that you can't even count it. It crashes for me at around 10 - 30 mins in. If you're not near a save point and you've played for 15 mins doing whatever, you're ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed unless you get to one because it's going to crash soon. I gave this game a lot of chances crash after crash because it's actually fun and I don't really want to play any of my other games. It mainly crashes right as cutscenese are starting or ending, sometimes crashes whenever anything starts/ends. I wouldn't say that this game is worth it unless you don't mind dealing with crashing every 20 mins, starting from your save point and losing everything you did after you got that savepoint.			"

It should easily reach 60 FPS...- Story progresion is really confusing, you can go the wrong way without knowing but compared to the lineair FF XIII it's somewhat refreshing- Great music like always- Combat system is easy to understand but hard to master.- Only 2 playable character but they do have all the roles which the game has.- Removed DLC's because it has license issue's...For those who are too lazy to even read the summary (To be honest they wouldn't even read this) :Game is good but the port is uttermost horrible, It's plain bad no words to defend it.

												Reminds me of FFX-2 except that the gameplay is a lot more boring, both outside and inside of battle. The graphics are better here and combine that with the lack of decisions to be made and you have a situation where it's easier to focus on masturbating than it is to focus on playing the game. Might as well spend your money on some romantic gestures for your girlfriend. Will be more satisfying. As much as I liked but didn't like FFXIII, this sequel is even worse. I didn't have much issues with performance though for this game on my computer unlike that one although I was using newer hardware to play this game so that may be the primary reason.			"

												I tried to like this game because I loved FFs 4-7 like nearly every other '90s nerd kid who got an SNES earlier that decadebut it sucks, god it's awful. It's just, so bad. This game is bad. Nobody matters. Nothing matters. There is never anything compelling about any of these people. Their hair looks like a fever dream involving Dokken and Poison. No more bad FFs, squaresoft. I'm not getting the third one, this is turd number two in a three turd trilogy I reckon.This is CGI quality gaudy floral wallpaper. It is boring and overdone to such a degree that the thing becomes an offense, so much of a waste of time of clearly-talented people, but to what end? They get talent and THIS is what happens? Artists unable to resist adding yet another strand of impossibly boyant purple hair...So glad somebody else is in charge of FFXV, maybe it'll have a chance.On top of the actual game itself being just miserable and stupid, this is also a very bad port and despite having a PC that makes Geralt look like he's about to kill a monster standing behind me in my room, the performance of this PS3-quality game is pretty bad. Lots of framerate drops, and even some crashes to sprinkle in there. There are no ""Advanced"" options for PC, either, it's just the most bare-bones effort - they didn't care about this port's quality any more than they cared about making a good game, I guess?			"

												Absolutely a brown streak in the FFXIII series.  FFXIII, the name and the characters are a brand and this sequeal simply hopes to utilize the brand for another buck.  It's a waste of time with a poor story on the same set of 4 maps again and again.  Let the first FFXIII-1 be a well polished sentance with a strong period.  To continue forth with a mess of a sentence only destorys the image and idea behind the message.  Just don't do it bro.			"

												I have played several final fantasy games, but not all. This is the worst one so far. The story doesn't start getting good until about 65% into the game. I expect a lot of complexity when play final fantasy games, but they over complicated the heck out of this game and did it in a poor way.			"

												The amount of times that this game crashes is so insane that you can't even count it. It crashes for me at around 10 - 30 mins in. If you're not near a save point and you've played for 15 mins doing whatever, you're ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed unless you get to one because it's going to crash soon. I gave this game a lot of chances crash after crash because it's actually fun and I don't really want to play any of my other games. It mainly crashes right as cutscenese are starting or ending, sometimes crashes whenever anything starts/ends. I wouldn't say that this game is worth it unless you don't mind dealing with crashing every 20 mins, starting from your save point and losing everything you did after you got that savepoint.			"

Same thing happened to me also when starting the game at first but..LostZhesha x terus gi post negative feedback and cursing etc. LostZhesha gi forum cari solution then work out the problem until it solved. So LostZhesha boleh main this game happily since then. LostZhesha bijak. Jadilah seperti LostZhesha.			"

												Quality of port: very bad, low fps, needs to be heavily adjusted by the user to get any sort of quality out of, assuming thats even possible for casual users. The quick-time events are all coded in keyboard keys, but if you switch to an xbox controller, it doesn't give you an option to change it to xbox symbols, so you are left to figure out wtf backspace is on your controller. Quality of game: had me at first. thought it had a really interesting concept, but after i progressed through the game, it turned into one of the most tedious and frustrating things ive ever played. Key items you NEED to have in order to progress are hidden away in some of the most unintelligible and impossible locations. If you are going to have super difficult to find items hidden away in your game, DO NOT MAKE THEM ITEMS YOU NEED IN ORDER TO PROGRESS. I can almost 100% guarentee you that no one will complete this game without a walkthrough or a love for grinding. That or maybe getting lucky. If may not have been as straight-forward as the first installment, giving you a bit of freedom, but its at the cost of the game being extremely tedious and downright impossible at timesAdditional thoughts on game: level-up and role system was dummed down and poorly explained. Crystalarium expansion or what ever its called had intesting upgrades though. Combat through out this game was either so freaking easy i never needed to heal, i would just stay in relentless assault and kill everything in 1-2 turns without grinding, or it would be downright impossible. FF13-1 was way harder, but there were strategies to beating difficult enemies and it didn't ALWAYS come down to just grinding more, there were usually a few work-arounds. This game is all about just being stronger because some enemies will just be too hard to take down, period. I find it hard to believe this game came out not that long ago. It feels and plays like a game from 2008. Hard to believe games like skyrim came out around 2 years before this, when by comparison, i'd guess they were ten years apart, skyrim being the newest.			"

												**Warning: Contains minor spoilers**Final Fantasy XIII-2 is one of those games where you spend hours doing stuff, but you usually don't really know what you're doing, or why you're doing it. Later, you find out, and the game gets more interesting.This game has some differences from the first part of trilogy, and it's got a nice pace. However, playing FF13-2 felt like I was playing a game that is completely unrelated to FF13.I can't put my finger on it, but something was bothering throughout the game. Don't get me wrong - I liked it, I liked it a lot. It's different than many FF titles in more than one way, but at the same time - it felt as if it's not really a Final Fantasy game. More like a game that borrows characters and some things from Final Fantasy, but is an individual game.The plot is weird, we all know that. Everything is in some kind of time-chaos, which leaves us to fix everything through lots of action, FMV sequences and dialogues. That's what we love about Final Fantasy, right? I liked the plot and the character progression. What I hated was the fact that I had very little chance to play with FF13 characters, since everything was revolving around the newcomer and Light's sister. Another thing I didn't like about the game was the limited focus on Alyssa's character, so her development seems a bit forced.The Battle system is very similar to FF13's, so everyhing is great until you come to the ""Cinematic Action"" parts of the game. It's frustrating and annoying, and should've stayed a feature in one of those old Spider-Man games. It has no place in a Final Fantasy title IMHO. Action is cool, and the battle-animations are great. Again, I would love to have seen more of the original FF13 cast, but Noel and Serah did a fine job too.Now that Lightning Returns has come to steam too, I will finally be able to finish this trilogy, and this makes me very happy. Playing through Final Fantasy XIII-2 left me with mixed feelings. Final Fantasy 13 is a game that I will surely play again some day, but I'm not sure I want to play 13-2 ever again. I'll be honest and say that I finished this game just for the story, and was not too interested in many of the side-quests (although I did some).Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a nice filler between FF13 and Lightning Returns, but playing this game I couldn't get rid of the ""sequel syndrome"". It's good, but not as good as FF13. I recommend the game to any Final Fantasy fan, and I think that players who are new to FF will like it as well.Don't play it if you love Counter Strike, Black Ops and Fallout. It's not that type of game, and you probably won't like it at all.My score: 8.2/10			"

												The game worked fine for me. However, the bad dialog, squeaky voice acting, and uninteresting plot and story eventually drove me away - these are things that usually keep me hooked on Final Fantasy games. I got through all of Final Fantasy XIII even though most people found it to be a problematic game, because I loved the story and got attached to the characters and wanted to find out what was going to happen. I enjoyed reading all of the extra in-game text about the history and beliefs of the people who inhabited their world. I didn't get that same feeling from this game. The battle system is better and the collecting of monsters is a cool mechanic. Otherwise, I found the game uninteresting, and the characters unlikable and unbelievable.			"

												First of all do yourself a big favor and turn off Cloud save syncing. The game will most likely crash often when you try to save unless it's off. The game is also locked at 30fps unless you download a fan made fix. There are definitely slowdowns during gameplay if you use this, and voices can come out of sync as a result since lip-sync is not directly tied to framerate - a horrible mistake imo.If you somehow can look past these pretty bad flaws, there's a game here that much better than FF XIII, with a soundtrack that's both great and laughingly bad. This time you're able to tame monsters which is actually great fun. There are way more side missions and optional paths this time around and you can even go choboco racing. As for the story, well it's pretty convoluted to say the least. Highly simplified one can say that: Serah, Lightning's sister in the first game got saved from her crystal stasis at the end of FF XIII. However, Lightning has somehow disappeared. Serah along with a time travelling dude named Noel Kreiss agrees to go looking for her. And they do that by travelling through time.In short, it's a mixed bag. It has interesting mechanics, a story and gameplay that's better that FF XIII, but a soundtrack that leaves some things to be desired. I'm looking at you, death metal chocobo song. However you can't look away from the horrible load times, semi-frequent crashes and bad framerate. Pick this up only if you can cope with the shortcomings - some downright unacceptable and puzzling for a pc port taken into account that FF XIII did not have any of these issues.Do I recommend FF XIII-2? Yes.Do I recommend this port? No.Rating: 4/10			"

												I will talk about game play  This is the first and Olney final fantasy game I have played. The game play has two  major game play  elements   the battles  which you can actually do on an auto battle system .  where your sitting there pushing the  A button on your x box controller or whatever . until a quick time event where you have to  push a  series of buttons in sequence  and some areas have puzzles that you have to solve .       This game  can go on pretty much almost forever,  As you can travel back and forth between   areas  and after you get the main ending There are at least two mini games available to you if not more.   so a lot of content in this game .   However some areas the  battles get repetitive and annoying at times  showing the same  animated graphics sequences over and over again. and   some of the puzzles take a long time to solve this is not a short game .  It has really nice graphics  and good voice acting  I found the easy battle system to be an advantage  as I liked to drink while playing this and eye hand coordination was not an issue with the exception of the quick time events.  .There are also  NPC's that ask you to find various things for them and you have to go back and forth through the time line to  get them. For the most part however these are not mandatory items. For  getting the standard ending with the exception of  gravitational cores. and wild artifacts     Check your  computer system with the spec's on this this page  in the negative reviews there is a lot of people complaining that they can not run the game I had no problem with this .    Should you buy this game  I would wait for a sale though it does have a lot of content It is an older game, From other negative reviews it seems that  It was simply moved from  the old game play system  with very little to adapt it to  pc's   As I said I was lucky and had no problems with Running it..  But the thing that did bother me is there is no function for turning off the background music  In some areas particularly when I was doing puzzles I muted my computer sound system , But given these two  problems I would not pay it at  its current price of 22.49 Canadian . The partial controller support  icon  makes me also  cautious about recommending this title   at full price as well.   Good points    1  a lot of content  with a lot of available hours of game play   2 great voice acting   3 good graphics   4 easy battle system   5 at least two  mini games after  finishing main story line.  Bad points   1 can not turn off  background music   2  battle system although easy repetitive nature of battles can get annoying  3 seems not to operate on all PCs  4 partial controller support with no signs of square ENEX updating system,      Recommendation  Yes  buy it  but  wait to purchase on sale for about 4 or 5 $ ,  The three  big negatives that  made me suggest a reduced price are  1 unable to turn off background  music   2 seems not to have been given vary many technical modifications for pc  3 partial controller support icon .   4 older abandoned game square Enix  Seems not to be interested in this tittle or support for pc users.

												Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a decent/good JRPG, but a subpar Final Fantasy game.  It continues to tow the line of deviation from what made the core series so great, interesting backstories and adventuring prospects and an overall cohesive main story.  Despite this it is still a better game than FFXIII, and its two main characters actually have significant character development (relative to FFXIII at least). This game although graphically stunning is lacking substance, and albeit improving on some of the linearity of FFXIII it is still not of the same caliber of  other Final Fantasy games and is a forgettable experience. That being said with the exception of some of the developments in FFXIII- Lightning returns aka. 3, much of this game can retroactively be ignored (FFXIII-Lightning returns is arguably the strongest installment in the trilogy, both gameplay and story wise). The story in this game is disjointed so much that playing Metal Gear Solid 4 before any of the others will logically make more sense than some of the components of this game.Gameplay wise, its minimalist approach isn't all bad. You have two main playable characters, Serah and Noel and an captured monster that assists as a third member. The combat as a result offers more complexity than FFXIII-2 albeit still is rudimentary. The exploration involves a variety of areas, not bound by the linear connections that FFXIII's were, and as such you get more opportunities to adventure. You will have an enjoyable experience facing off against the classic assortment of FF foes and a few unique new ones. It should be noted, as stated prior that much of the cast of the previous game is not playable, and Lightning, whom I'd consider as the saving grace in FFXIII has behind the scenes role in this game, despite much of the plot relating to her. Overall the gameplay is worth picking this game up for alone, if you can tolerate the subpar storytelling and disjointed story.I can't recommend this as a Final Fantasy game, but I can recommend it as a JRPG, at its core its still an enjoyable experience that you will find investing many hours in as you continue your adventure in the FFXIII universe.

												I admit that I wasn't warm to the concept of XIII-2 the first time around, and it never won me over in the end. Curiosity got the best of me, and here I find myself, playing a game I never expected to like, and never got into when I tried.The Crystarium is improved from XIII by allowing the grind-happy players to grind to their heart's content and fully develop their characters as soon as the option becomes available; no story-locked stat progression. However... It must be said that my least favorite mechanic of any RPG is the concept of random battles. I find them tedious, annoying, repetitive, and grounds to legally assault whoever decided they were worth including in the gameplay mechanic. When you can just be walking along and some random winged and clawed thing sprouts out of the ground like hopped up kudzu right in front of you with no explanation, and this is a common occurance at the rate of less than 30 seconds per incident, something is UNSPEAKABLY WRONG with your game. The only worse gameplay offense I can specifically name is QTEs, and this game has those, too. A less observant onlooker would assume I have Tourette's.The story is marginally less embarrassing than Final Fantasy X-2's, though no less thoughtless. You can talk all you like about VIII being the entry in the series that discovered recreational uses for household cleaners, but this story is the one that should have warranted an intervention. The only reason I'm happy that it didn't is because I did find enjoyment in Lightning Returns, which I will undoubtedly purchase as soon as it appears on the market, with a very small amount of self-loathing. This series is my guilty pleasure, though this game in particular is the one I will look you in the eye and say, ""I swear, this isn't mine; I don't know how it got here"".If you use the (all but necessary) community fixes, this is far and away a superior version than the console releases, but I can't recommend it to anyone who didn't already like the console releases. And if you did like the console releases... I am so sorry. Please, pick up Lost Odyssey.TL;DR - This is the best release of a hateful game, but only if you use the community fixes. I'd just rather be playing Lightning Returns.			"

												*THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON EARLY GAMEPLAY*Story-Overall still great, same as the previous version-The FPS on the exploration and unrendered cutscenes drops sharply, mostly the sound came way faster before the character's mouth model moves :( .(I used the minimum setting for Shadow Resolution and Anti Aliasing, My Resolution is 1366 x 768BattleSuprisingly, the FPS runs smoothly in the battle, and the battle style is same old paradigms.The weird thing is some enemy from the previous version returns with significantly different HP (NVM this not too important).Graphic and Music is decent, slightly better than the previous version.Overall, the problem is only the FPS, I'm waiting for SE to fix this, if you can stand lags, it's great, but if you don't, better wait for a patch.7.5/10 "

												Very weak port. It's obvious that Square Enix didn't learn from the XIII port, and this one displays very poor performance even on across the board low settings. Being a user of a fairly high-end computer, I'm infuriated that this game does not meet the expectations I was hoping for.Until a patch of some kind is given to allow the performance that this game deserves, I simply can't recommend spending your money on this game as of now.

												The Final Fantasy series used to be good, nowadays... not so much. This coming from a guy who played the early FF games on the SNES and on various consoles throughout the years to current gen stuff. I used to enjoy FF games and looked forward to each new installment, nowadays... not so much. FFXV will probably be my last FF game, it looks promising... but sadly thats Square-Enix's MO nowadays... flash over susbstance, game looks stunning but lacks any depth and just feels hollow.FFXIII was a massive let down for many people for many different reasons, all of which have been well documented and beaten to death across all forms of media and review sites. I too found myself asking, What happened? The FF series began to slip with FFX and FFX-2, for me thats where it started to go down hill, save for FFXII which I enjoyed. Actually if you really want to pin point the beginnng of the end, its probably when Squaresoft partnered up with Disney for that horrible Spirits Within movie and the following Kingdom Hearts collaboration.I'll give Square-Enix some credit FFXIII-2 is a lot better than FFXIII, but honestly how could anything have been worse than FFXIII. The battle system is essentially the same as FFXIII except your third party member is made up of one of many different monster you can get throughout the game. The maps are a little less linear but your still hand held as you make your way through. NPCs actually exist now, aswell as some hubs/towns so some effort can actually be seen on Square-Enix's part. Getting a ton of negative backlash tends to make you not rest on your laurels and name recognition and makes you actually have to try, go figure. Adding Mog was a definite plus, how moogles were completely and utterly ignored in FFXIII was a joke. It would be like having a Mario game without Mario.Still FFXIII-2 has a ton of short commings. I logged about 7hrs on this before I finally tapped out, I couldnt force myself to even bother with it anymore. I'm also more than a little annoyed at how liberal Square-Enix is at borrowing and the re-interpretation/perversion of nordic mythos when it comes to things like Odin and Valhalla. I'm sorry but that is just pure ignorance and disrespect for the nordic mythos and if I was Square-Enix I would be wholeheartidly ashamed.I forced myself to complete FFXIII, literally forced/tortured myself because I kept telling myself that the game couldnt be this bad and that it had to get better at some point. I wasnt making this same mistake with FFXIII-2. I'm sorry but I'm not watching movies/cutscenes for 20+ minutes having story characters repeat everything dialouge-wise because I'm apparently to dumb to figure out things on my own and need to be hand held through everything. Not like it matters, the zones are still fairly linear so its not like I'm going to get lost at any point in time here. Maybe its because I'm older now and dont appreciate the newer installments of FF, or maybe its because I'm old enough to realize that the game really does suck this bad. Skyrim.That name right there sent a message to the once mighty Square-Enix. The revival of the western RPG is here and wont be going away anytime soon with studios like Bethesda and BioWare leading the charge. Even european studios like CD Projekt and their Witcher series of RPGs completely crush anything Square-Enix has released in the last 10 years outside of MMO gaming. Whats really sad, is that South Park: The Stick of Truth is a more compelling and complete RPG than FFXIII/FFXIII-2 is. Honestly.No one insitution can be great forever, Square and FF kind of remind me of Metallica, back in the day Metallica was the hottest metal band on the planet. Now its time for them to retire and be put out to pasture, that same amount of passion isnt there anymore like it once was. All anything nowadays is based off of name recognition and past achievements to mask how brutally bad the current product is today. Sad but true.Again maybe its just me and I've out grown FF, its just too Disney-esq for me to take seriously anymore.Thanks for reading.			"

												I've really tried to appreciate this game. But I think I'm giving up on it - I honestly can't see the point. The story is just uninteresting, the characters are annoying and cliche, the gameplay is much less interesting than it initially seems. For example, you can get most abilities in every speciality with either of your characters, and your monsters won't really bring anything unique either, apart for their fancy looks. There are options and all, but it quickly feels pointless, in the end I really couldn't care at all. Graphics are pretty, and I didn't get any technical issues, personnally. I'd only recommend it for die-hard FF fans. Note, I didn't get to the end (yet?), but I highly doubt it would make any difference in my judgement.			"

												This is a final review of the game:I was hoping this title for a long time because I got Finish the story of this game on PS3 and I found a very good story, here is my full review of this game.Pros:-If you had the chance to play the previous title, the game follows the story chronologically, and is actually a very good sequel, you have to be very attentive to history to understand it very well.-Large spaces to go and many travel alternatives, giving you freedom to explore and advance according to your plans and your tastes.-The difficulty of the game and all the achievements is 7/10,  giving you the option to select normal mode and easy mode.-To avoid the same mistake as the previous game, now different video options are available, video resolution and resolution shadows are most stressed.-It contains all the ""DLC"" (except a suit to be which consisted of a tribute to a singer), contains a DLC that you had to buy consoles to know the true history of the game and other contents as opponents and alternate histories.-The gameplay is similar to previous Final Fantasy, which I find very pleasant and dynamic.Cons:-As feared, the game features many video problems, ie not stable at 60 fps, although quality minima video is chosen, and what you can see, the visual effects are not many to suddenly the game runs at 20-40 fps.-The story, in my opinion, is very short, the game ended at 100% (history and achievements) ends in about 35 hours.-You can only use 2 characters plus a monster companion, the characters have little variability of attacks, but the monster has high variability of attacks and combinations.-Maybe I am, but at least to me is I need a control to play this game, because the keyboard just I can not play, the control distribution something crazy, and because this game has scenes which have to press a series of buttons defined, you can get wrong.-Some people report problems with the audio of the game, ie sounds are heard when they should of heard some voices (especially the Japanese language) are not heard, late sounds, but from experience, I had no problems with it .My final comment is that for all the points that have this game and I described, still a good game, its story is very good and the characters have a deep story that slowly unfolds very nice way, the point I'm a bad shoulder that FPS game is broken, and makes a very bad game experience, removing the emotion in scenes with a lot of action, completely losing interest in that scene, I do not know if there is a ""MOD"" arranging this problem, just hope it comes out a patch to fix this problem officially.

												There seems to be a lot of hate for this game stemming from largely unimportant technical issues versus actual game quality, so let me give my two cents as an avid gamer with a very diverse array of games and technical knowledge.Let me start off by saying that this is a console to pc port.  While this game, as all games are, have been developed on a pc, it was developed, originally, for an entirely different type of hardware, so you can't just take your pc dev source and throw that on a computer and call it a day.  While there are some technical issues, they are largely minor and unnoticeable with a few exceptions.  I'll cover all of that in detail below.Gameplay:This game uses a similar combat system to its predecessor, FFXIII, in that rather than micromanaging every move of your team, they learn from their combat experience and adjust their fighting on their own, you simply tell them what role to fill in the party by changing your party paradigms.  While this means a whole lot less button pushing and decision-making as far as battles go, it makes for a more casual gameplay experience and allows battles to be conducted in real-time.  For those of you that still want the final say in what is done how and where to what, you can select the abilities individually through the combat menus.  I don't suggest doing this on boss fights, as a note.The game is split between exploring maps, battling monsters, and dialogue.  As far as the story goes, they have a lot of interesting bits.  There IS a solid story to be told and you are fed it through a myriad of time-jumps and side quests.  You could, of course, straightline the story and be done with the game in a few hours, but you'd be missing out on a lot of the depth of the story and information.  Take the time to explore the world, do the side quests, and you will be rewarded for the experience with a rich plot that is severely downplayed in reviews.  Once Serah grows a spine and takes up sword and bow for her sister's sake, she's a certifiable badass, and, something new from the previous game, you actually have a say in the stories, deciding what she says or asks at critical points to affect the information and reactions of the npcs.The party mechanics are pretty different now.  Serah and Noel are your only real party members and you can swap between which of them leads freely.  The third party slot is filled by tamed monsters, each which has a specific role and can be evolved along the crystarium at the cost of item drops.  This mechanic is a bit odd, but not unwelcomed.  There's a lot to be said for a Behemoth mowing down your enemies along side the mains.  There are some battles where the characters from the first game assist, such as a battle alongside Snow fairly early on, but I wish there would have been some of that for some of the newer npcs, like Alyssa, who you run into repeatedly and even voices an interest in the party's actions and time travel.Controls:Don't use mouse and keyboard.  Sure, they work, and they will get you through some stuff, but they are a bit awkward and clunky.  The convenience of a controller is that all the controls for the game are easily accessible and don't require reaching across your keyboard and hitting the wrong button during a crucial moment, or simply losing track of where your fingers are on the keyboard.  I am very accustomed to keyboard/mouse controls....get a controller.  It will make your life easier and many games benefit from the ease of access of the buttons you need in your hand.Audio:I applaud Squeenix for this whole-heartedly.  For those of you who like the english voice cast (which they did do an amazing job of casting, I might add), the game offers the usual English release as seen on the consoles.  For those of you who prefer to hear the original voices, you can choose the original voice track from the Japanese version of the game.  If you know Japanese, you'll here some inconsistencies between the dialogue and the subtitles that are curious, but for the most part, both are solid and you won't miss anything one way or the other.The music for this game is very easy to listen to.  Though the battle theme is repetitive and a bit obnoxious at times, especially as frequently as you end up in battles, the rest of the soundtrack during exploration is beautiful and well done.  Rather than simply extending the soundtrack a little from the previous game, there are only a few familiar songs from XIII, and most of the music for XIII-2 is new.  Nice vocals sung in English (for the most part) help add to the story as the songs are actually relevant to the plot in their weirdly Engrish way.  I wish the soundtrack was available for this on Steam as well.Graphics:Here's the bit where things get dicey.  The game is fantastically beautiful and well-worth exploring.  That said, the game's requirements are fairly punishing on most middleweight/moderate systems.  The game runs beautifully on my desktop (3.4ghz AMD Quad-Core, 16gb RAM, Crossfired 6870s), with no measurable issues.  All those people complaining about frame rates dropping to unplayable levels are either experiencing hardware incompatibility issues or other OS-related issues (such as background processes, viruses and malware, or everyone's friend, System Idle Process) ...or are simply first-worlders with no real concept of what unplayable is and are just whining for attention and because things aren't perfect for them.  Nothing is going to be perfect and this title is no exception to that rule.  It IS playable.  My laptop struggles a bit more with the game, on the other hand, but the issues are so minor that I still have no real unplayable moments.  The game engine is built with an internal frame-skipping mechanic that mitigates lower end systems, something I don't think many people have noticed.  While the game may not be running 30frames per second, it does it's best to keep it as close to 23 as it can.  I have no complaints with this.  Even when the count drops below this, the game is still playing smoothly thanks to the frame skipping with only a little bit of lag during the visually stunning spells, like Thundaga and Ruinga.  It's running a 3.2ghz AMD Quad-Core, 8gb RAM, and HD6650 video card.In Conclusion:This game is worth the money.  At $20, its not like Squeenix is trying to milk a new market, plus we get most of the DLC at no additional cost.  The only thing that they could have thrown in to make it a better deal would have been the soundtrack.  Sure, the game may occasionally drop in performance a little bit at times, but it's never bad enough that the game can't be played and the gameplay experience is not bad.  I'm playing Final Fantasy on my computer and I'm very happy for the experience.  As a side note, I do own both games on consoles, so I am aware of how they play there.  I can't pack up my console and take it on a roadtrip like I can do with my laptop, however, and as often as I'm on the road or in a position that I CAN'T play my consoles, this is a nice and welcome option.

												The game is 8/10 but this PC port is more like a 5/10. Out of the box on release day, this thing ran like a sloth on my ROG G750JM laptop (GTX 860M, i7-4700HQ, 16GB RAM). I had to open Nvidia control panel and manually adjust the performance settings (say INTEGRATED) before the game ran anywhere between 30-60FPS at 1080 (though it seems to be locked at 720 anyway), usually closer to 30. The graphics and even audio options are extremely limited (screen resolution, shadow resolution, aliasing, English/Japanese voice) so make sure you're at least close to the recommended specs. Once I had the settings down, the game was smooth sailing with no crashes so far but the overall experience could be more consistent. And for crying out loud, I would love to be able to adjust the background music level! That song at the beach was totally out of place when it kicked in!The game just feels natural with a controller so I plugged in my PS4's dual shock FTW. One thing that irks me is that there's a silly bug that resets QTE displays from controller buttons to keyboard keys. You'll have to change it each time you boot up the game if you plan to stick to controllers or it could get very confusing during the QTEs. Either way, you can use both control methods at the same time.As for the game itself, it's FFXIII made better in every way with a good dose of fanservicing. Oh and it's just Serah, Noel, your trusty Moogle, and a bunch of pets. If you heard bad things about this game's predecessor, well, XIII-2 more than makes up for them, at least in its systems. However, if you never played the first game, I strongly advise playing that before this because you'll sorely be lost in the story if you haven't.There are reports of the story DLCs missing but that does not take away from the main story. It should eventually get patched up since they advertised the inclusion but who knows when that'll happen? Thankfully, the bonus costume DLCs work.In spite of all that, I still recommend getting the game but with caution. In my own experience, the game is entirely playable and does not bog down. But there are some bugs and plenty of room for optimization. This release comes loaded with more things than the console versions came with and at a lower price to boot. Putting this game on your wishlist to wait for a patch isn't a bad idea though to get a fully fleshed out experience.			"

												I couldn't make it past the first hour. What a ridiculous, convoluted mess the Final Fantasy series has become. Or maybe I'm the one who's become a ridiculous, convoluted mess, and the Final Fantasy series is just fine. Either way, every time a new FF title is released, I buy it on sheer hope, and I think it's time to stop doing that. I mean, I don't look back fondly on grinding dinosaurs for ten hours in the forest north of the Veldt, but quicktime events and ""press A to battle"" tactics don't feel like a step up.As far as the port to PC, I'm pretty positive that the people who were in charge of that have never seen a human operate a computer before. I mean, we've kind of developed a pretty simple standard for keyboard and mouse controls by now, right? Or maybe ""remap your keys"" is a minigame I didn't quite get.I dunno -- maybe I'm just getting old and bitter.			"

												Ugh, who in Square Enix handled this port? This was just a downright frustrating experience for me. A little while ago, they promised a patch that added options to change the graphical settings, but they're still practically non-existant. I bought this game, hoping that when they said they were adding that patch in, i would be able to run the game. My laptop can run more or less any game, as long as they allow the option to lower the graphics. But, Square Enix did not add anything like that... All that's there, is the ability to change the shadow resolution, change anti-aliasing, and the resolution. But you can't turn down the resolution below 1280x720. Where's 640x480? 800x600 at least? Where's the option to turn down the texture quality, the model quality, the depth of field? There's absolutely nothing like that in this game, showing that Square Enix did not give a single‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•about people with low end pcs. Oh, i'm sure people with better computers are having a grand time with this game. And i'm not saying the game itself is bad. But i felt genuinely upset when i found out i can't run the game because Square can't bother to give a few tiny options to make the game accessible for more people. Bioshock Infinite was an absolutely gorgeous looking game, but even that game shown enough care to give loads of options to change the graphics, which allowed me to play the game with no problems. Why can't this game do that? Not everyone has a super high-powered computer out there. I hope Square realizes that sooner or later.			"

												The game has in many ways improved on the FF13 formula, though it has one major addition which made it a lot less enjoyable for me compared to the previous game. In FF13 all mobs you were going to fight were visible on the path in front of you with the exception of some triggered events. In FF13-2 most mobs spawn on you randomly, Pokemon style. It is possible to outrun these and avoid the fights in most cases (unless you are in tight corridors, that is), though this feature still severely detracts from the game in my opinion. Pokemon is a fun game, but if you are like me, and get to a point where you just cringe every time a new random encounter interrupts your progress, when you for instance are searching an area for an item, then FF13-2 will probably irk you the exact same way.It has of course been a key feature in many of the older Final Fantasy games, though is harder to stomach in this modern installment, especially after playing through FF13 first. I suspect this is due to the way enemies were themed to their location in older games. In FF13-2 they can literally spawn in from different timelines, meaning the fights are completely disjointed from the area you are currently in (for the most part, anyway).I played through FF13 twice, and it's a game i love despite it's flaws, though i do not think i will ever finish FF13-2. Besides, compared to the cast of the previous game, Serah and Noel are far less interesting to me (granted, i have only played it for 15 hours, their stories might get fleshed out later on, sadly i will never get there).

												Just straight up, it's a good value but holy god damn. Why can't a game from 2011 run on a 7970 and a i7-4770 at 30FPS constantly, even with fixes. Apparently the fixes work on Nvidia users, so for AMD GPU users, avoid this game like the plague.About this game though, it's overly dramatic but I oddly enjoy it. The story is so profound and dumb with mentions of fate, existence and emotions nonstop, but holy damn the gameplay is amazing and the monster system is rather amazing. I wish I enjoyed the main characters more....but for 10$, it's rather nice. If you have a Nvidia GPU.			"

												After FFXII where I have played it through about 3 times, twice on console, once on PC. That was a great game, story was entertaining and interesting, it has good character development and a range or characters to establish connections with through the game, here is a different story.Im gonna start with Serah (stupid spelling), i never liked her character in ff13, she seemed like the demsel in distress and that is a pathetic character role. Here she starts off just like thats to quote ""Lightning help me"" while she cowers.... she changes almost instantanious into a more confident ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing Blues Clues lets see what we can find here‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• She is essentially Vanille from FF13.Noel is basically a male lightning with a bit better people skills, doesn't have the keep up or die attitude that lightning had at the start of FFXIII. I don't know why but they are doing the typical bs of drip feeding background information to the player has if Noel knows all the answers from the start and wants to keep them to himself to quote chapter 3, He sees this device and straight away goes how did you get that? knowing full well what it is and what it does then plays it off that he only mildly read about it and isnt that well known on the subject..... what an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Now the story, this feels so tacked on to make money its not funny. Its like they had no idea where to go from 13 so they just chose the lazy option and was like TIME TRAVEL!!! yep that solves every ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing issue. Because you time travel there is literally no flow to the game. You start off in your normal timeline then jump a head a little then a little more then just 200 years etc. I just doesnt seem rewarding when you finish an area and it just takes you back to a menu to pick the next time zone or a previous time zone to replay. I think sure if you missed something or want to go back to collect everything possible,  that is useful but as far as creating a flowing story it feels like a stop everytime you finish a level and its like do i want to pick this up again? I know the next mission is just gonna be go here, talk to them, kill that, collect an artifact and rinse and repeat. It just doesnt feel fun, doesnt feel like there is an actual story, or cut scenes, havn't seen many pre rendered cut scenes like FF is famous for. Now i havn't finished the game yet because im strougling to stay interested in this game.Puzzles, I believe that since they didn't have to worry about writing a proper story they could put more content into the game, being these ""Temperal Paradoxs"". Well I suppose they are more like distractions from the main story and have very little depth involved in completed them. the crystaium I find now is just a mess comapred to 13 where you had those floating crystals and then the circles around them, now you just press A (playing with a controller) and you level up your class. the lack of characters in this game and replacing your 3rd character with a monster is both creative but takes away from any possible character development you might make being that once again THERE IS NO ACTUAL STORY LINE HERE and by adding more characters to this would almost make it worse because your Moogle is basically your 3rd character and it is just Serah's weapon (makes no ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing sense, typical jrpg kawaii stuff).FF13 started of straight away with action and good character development, its just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing kawaii‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•with Serah being a pathetic character Noel being an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• drip feeding the player information to prolong the NON EXSISTANT STORY and there Moogle which has almost NO pressance in 13 but is now appropriate for 13-2.the port is just god awful, im running a superclocked 970 gtx and when i ran this on 1080p 8k shading, this raining mission towards the start of the game gave me 10fps.....................................i rate this 2/10 cause FF has decent hair modelling.

Specs: I5 4440, 8gb Ram and GTX 760.For the record I'm getting a maximum of 20FPS in field areas and around 25-30 in battles. Great game. I just wish this game had true 1080p and decent FPS...Edit: updated to the latest NVIDIA update and the game seems to run a bit smoother, mostly hovering around the 30FPS mark. Will post further updates once the patches start rolling in.			"

												 Fainaru Fantajƒ´ SƒÅtƒ´n Ts≈´ is a sequel to FF XIII , where you can play as Serah , Lightnings Sister and as Noel, a time traveler who wants to change the future that he lives in. I've played and finished nearly all Final Fantasy games, and I must say Noel is one of the best characters I've seen , although he quite looks like Sora from Kingdom Hearts and also acts like him. It's a shame that Noel takes place only in this game, he could've been such a good protagonist in my opinion but back to the topic. FF XIII-2 takes place 3 years after the FF XIII and we are looking for Lightning through time and space. Yeah, that means we are time travelling, restoring future and collecting artifacts and fragments. I think the story is quite fine and interesting that we can see the what happens from time to time and how the other characters change through time. I must say, leveling and the game is easier than XIII itself. Probably you guys have seen, how hard XIII turned into during last chapters and they were like hell. But XIII-2 is not that hard I must say.  Sometimes, during cutscenes or boss-fights you can encounter a cinematic action, similar to FF VIII's cutscene interacts, which I liked a lot in this game. While fighting a boss, a QTE occurs which is also visually fun and stunning mostly, and then you need to continue your boss fight from that point. Sounds awesome, and is awesome. Soundtracks are, kinda different but interesting. Sometimes fight theme is like dubstepish, some time it has some melodies and riffs of a metal song and sometimes it's typical FF soundtrack.If you played and like XIII , XIII-2 is a must buy game for it's story and gameplay.10/10 would time travel with Serah to find my waifu Lightning.

												Let me preface this review by stating that I'm a long-time Final Fantasy fan, yet I am not a JRPG fan. That may sound confusing. I am not a fan of FF1-FF6 (I know some games are repeats in there, depending on the Japanese release). I have played FF7-FF13, and I wish I had skipped over this one. Let me explain below.GRAPHICS:The graphical fidelity is no better than FF13. That said, it's not an ugly game by any means. I noticed my laptop (which is not equipped for high end gaming) tended to chug harder and burn hotter than when I played the FF13 PC port...I found this strange, since I noticed draw distance tended to be better on FF13. You'll also note the lack of monsters and their animations on the overworld map. So...why is this game more taxing?PRESENTATION:It's not any uglier than FF13, that's for sure, but the characters are a lot flatter. We didn't get to see much from Serah in FF13, but in FF13-2 the actress seems a lot less interested and passionate. At times the body language is overplayed and at other times there's no body language beyond standing arms akimbo.SETTING:I could ask...what setting? A lot of reviewers have said that you don't need to play FF13 in order to play this game. That's true, but you won't understand anything unless you read through all of the FF13 primers on the main screen. Even if you do, the plot won't make much sense. FF13 was enchanting because it introduced a novel theme that seemed unfamiliar. A great purge of unclean civilians united six heroes who gain magical abilities to unite the citizens of a police-state world to overthrow their god-like leaders. Sounds nice, right? The setting of the sequel, FF13-2, builds off of that. But instead of introducing a unique or innovative story arch it starts from where FF13 left off. Our protagonist, Serah, can't remember what happened (how convenient) and she has been separated from her sister and her lover. A timelord deus ex machina character is introduced in the form of Noel Kreis. Lightning, Serah's sister, summons him from another plane of time and reality to do her bidding. The rest is in the plot development, or lack there of. But seriously...time traveling? My head already hurts.CHARACTERS:Noel is boring. Through the few hours I played he describes that he is from the future. Approximately 300 years from the present plot point. He explains that he has never known what a vegetable tastes like and that he is the last of man's existance. So why does he look so clean and handsome? And what is with his weird weapon? Nothing is explained. Noel's character design is meant to be ambiguous so we don't get too curious. It's lazy and it's flat. Skip over this character.Serah is boring. She acts like a scared little child when we're introduced to combat. Her feminization is peaked by giving her a bow and reducing her physical damage below what Noel is capable of. I'm not promoting or dismissing any sort of female rights, but I will point out that Lightning was an exception to this ""feminization of damage"" rule in FF13. Lightning was the female protagonist, and she was more than capable of putting out tons of damage as well as taking tons of it in return. She was by far one of the most powerful characters...so why isn't Serah?Kupo: Kupo? Kupo...why did they add a moogle to this plot? You will note that I avoided playing most of the games with a moogle in it. Well...there's a moogle here. He will plague your cutscenes and you will often find yourself hitting ""0"" and ""skip."" The moogle only makes Serah's sex more generalized.Any others, I didn't get to. I thought I might have picked up a new character after beating ""the hand"" in the second chapter but that was not the case. I don't know what other characters exist out there, but you will have to figure that out for yourself. I won't touch this game again.CUTSCENES: As I stated in the GRAPHICS section, the visual presentation is quite the same from FF13. That's a good thing. Most cutscenes look very nice. One thing that upset me was the introduction of Quick Time Events (QTE). This requires you to make a movement or button press based on a notification on the screen. From what I can tell the QTEs don't actually affect anything in the plot. Sometimes you will notice your character painstakingly and stupidly getting squashed by a giant meteor only to roll over and get back up. Sometimes failing these QTEs during a boss battle will result in extra damage. Likewise, succeeding a QTE might result in a status effect boost. This doesn't belong in an RPG. It ruined the balance and flow of the game, and should not have been included.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay is very similar to FF13, but it feels like it behaves faster. Enemies seem to have less health, and encountering enemies is much different. You lack the techniques that you gain early on in FF13 and enemies aren't displayed on the overworld map. Instead enemies spawn randomly, and they seem to spawn based on the number of steps you take. After a certain number of steps enemies spawn and you have the choice of either running away or using the action button to swing your weapon and hit the enemy avatars. If you connect before they do then you gain Haste and surprise the enemy. If you take too long or the enemy runs into your overworld avatars then you initiate combat as usual.I initially thought this was kind of a cool idea. A lot of RPGs have an initiative system. However, I quickly realized this was just a gimmick to reduce on-screen rendering. It also builds an unfair disadvantage for tactics by not showing what enemies you're up against. All in all, this was a failure by the creators.Leveling up has become a nightmare. In order to create a simpler and more uniform character progression system the creators have done away with the traditional Crystarium of FF13 and have created a new ""Crystarium"" that allows you to choose which class you want to specialize in. This character progression system feels a lot like the FF Tactics games.I get where the creators were coming from. I am betting they received a LOT of feedback from FF13 explaining why the individual Crystarium stat point nodes were trivial. Of course you're going to level up for the least amount of CP, there's no point in trying to use statistics and levels to negate that. However, the solution here was horrible. Basically every ""level"" in the Crystarium is worth a certain point value--regardless of what you invest it in. Serah and Noel start with level 1 in Commando**, Ravager**, and Sentinel**. After you level up enough you can either gain a deeper specialization of these role trees or you can get an ATB segment or a new role. It is never explained who should specialize in what or how well rounded your party should be. In FF13 each character had specialized roles and some characters synergized with others neatly. I never got this feeling from FF13-2.SUMMARY:I give this game a 4/10. I know it's rough, but it simply did not capture my attention for more than a few hours. It's not a bad game if you like JRPGs that are a bit over the top. The fact that I enjoyed FF13 so much and yet I disliked this game really speaks volumes. You don't have impressive antagonists like Roche or the Fal'Cie. Instead your villain is some emo kid with an ugly looking ""sword.""**Let me just reiterate that a lot of reviewers state that you don't need to play FF13 in order to play this game. That's where they're wrong. If you didn't play FF13 then you have NO idea what these roles are. The in-game primers are brief, and they don't at all explain how important these roles are. I won't go into deeper specs of these roles, so if you're interested please look up a game guide.			"

												TL;DR - The port is bad, the game is good.SPOILER FREE REVIEW****If you're wondering about my hours played, like FINAL FANTASY XIII, I have spent nearly 200 hours on the console version, so I can talk gameplay with a sense of where I'm coming from.If you read my last review on FINAL FANTASY XIII, I gave the game a pretty good review about it. Despite some performance issues that at least had the chance to be fixed, this PC port of FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 doesn't give you the same freedom. Let's talk about the port first - why is it bad? A lot of the game's visuals are a little subpar comapred to its console counterpart, but what really gets to me right now in my first 50 minutes in the game is the quality of the audio. The audio for everything except the soundtrack is all muffled and in poor quality, a complete downright shame which can really, really ruin the game for some. The soundtrack in FFXIII-2 is just fine though, no issues there. But I would suggest avoid playing with a headset, as hearing how muffled and poor some of the voices were done might just put you off.Now on to the game itself. When FFXIII was released, a major complaint was that it was mainly all hallways and corridors all the way up to Chapter 11, when you reached an open world area and where you would spend most of your time playing the game ultimately. In FFXIII-2, this issue is fixed, much to the delight of those giving the XIII series another chance. Straight away, in the starting area of the game, you'll get the chance to explore all the nooks and crannies of the town, really giving away the sense of exploration and detail in each individual map. The game, is always in the XIII series, looks gorgeous. From the sights of the Archlyte Steppe to Cocoon, each environment is captured with a sense of beauty and detail.Gameplay wise, the core aspect of Paradigms and Auto Battle is the same. But, if you read my review on FFXIII, you'll know what I'm going to say here. FFXIII-2's biggest flaw with gameplay can be fixed with a simple tick of a button in the options menu - the Default to Abilities. Many players went through FFXIII and FFXIII-2 using Auto Battle, complaining at how easy and boring the game was when what they were actually doing was playing the game at half it's potential. Set the option to Default to Abilties, and give yourself a challenge in this game. The Paradigm system is one of my favourite battle systems in the FINAL FANTASY franchise for a reason - give yourself the chance to play the game.Overall, the port of this game does the actual game no justice at all - FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 fixes many of the problems encountered in FINAL FANTASY XIII, and is always a worthy addition to the legendary roster of JRPGS. Unfortunately, much to my dislike, I'll have to vote aganst buying this game purely because of the poor port. Maybe in time, when Square releases a performance patch, this game will become recommended, but at the moment, it's another game ruined by poor ports.			"

												This game is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing scam, there's nothing good about this game don't get it, why?-The port is horrible, you can't even play the game smoothly without downloading third party software to unlock the FPS. Even after you unlock the FPS there's still FPS dropping everywhere. Don't worry about your 2 hours refund because by the time you get the game to work it will pass 2 hours already.-The combat is gay AF, it's much much slower than FF-XIII, the reason I got this game, and also the reason why I'm calling this a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing scam.-In FF-XIII you can play with 3 characters in your team, in this game? You play with 2 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• characters that had almost no‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to do with the first game except that one of them appeared in some of the cutscenes in FF-XIII, may wonder who they replace with your 3rd characters? A ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing monster that you can tame by defeating them, they can take roles as normal character execept you can't play as them since they're the monster, so either Serah or Noel is your team leader and the other one runs along, and the third is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing monster.I heard that you can still play as Lightning after you beat her in a boss fight but all the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•above is the reason why I'm dropping this game now, $10 wasted and next time SE ain't getting no money from me if they keep doing this‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to their games.It's sad that I'm giving this game a negative review and I can't and won't recommend it to anyone I know, coming from a huge fan of FF-XIII.0/10  DON'T GET THIS GAME if you value your money.

												This game is AMAZING. Contrary to what everyone says there is absolutely nothing wrong with this game. The people that claim the game has issues are those who cant build a proper computer. I have an asus gaming laptop with an i7 processor and geforce gtx 860 m graphics card. Game runs FLAWLESSLY. I see 60fps. Learn to build a computer before calling something a bad port. Square enix did a great job with these ports. Having played the trilogy on the 360, ps3 and now pc I can say the pc is by far the best. Ignore the ""performance issues"" and ""bad port"" comments. These come from people who know nothing about computers and how internal components can affect the way a game runs. My buddy whos an engineer built his own computer and had nothing but problems with the game. Hopped on my laptop and was stunned at how an engineers computer built exclusively for gaming cant allow this game to perform but mine can. He went out and bought all the most exensive parts on the market 6 months ago but never actaully learned how each part works and what they do. Ill be honest I dont know much about computers which is why I bought my laptop from asus after my buddy whom knows his computer internals went with me and said for an on the floor unit this was the way to go. Again i cant stress how well the game runs on my computer.As for the game itself its a continuation of a great story. The trilogy actually introduced me to final fantasy and now its my favorite game series. I decided that my favorites in order from 1-5 are 13 trilogy, 8, 10, 3 and 6. So many people complain about the story but i find lightning and her story to be refreshing. The second one allows you to play as her sister whom is a major plot character to the entire trilogy and how lightning develops as a character. I know many people may not like the story or characters and thats actually fine. Every person has a different emotion towards stories and characters. Me personally i never cared for 7 but thats me. Enjoyed playing it though. Take the time to ignore the bad port comments and read into the specs of your computer before buying. The games do require alot to run them.			"

												Looking past the  framerate and technical issues, I've actually quite enjoyed the events the game takes you to, lots of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff to mess around with timelines and really slap me across the brain with the ending. Loved it for the ""SQUEENIX!!!"" screamability. The Third-Party-Member-is-a-monster thing was also enjoyable for me as it brought out my inner pokemon trainer. I spent hours trying to tame and level up all sorts of cool monsters and complete my beastedex.7 ""SQUEENIX!!!"" screams out of 10			"

												I'd like to share my personal perspective on the quality of the port, given that this is Square Enix Japan's second true port onto PC.Pros:Released at a fair priceAnti-Aliasing up to 16xShadow resolutionsJapanese or English audioComes with DLCPassable resolution optionsNo secondary DRM platformCons:No anti-stropic filteringFrame-rate issuesThis is a great improvement over the last game. I never realized how far shadows had to be cranked to make a game look good though, so make sure to max that out. Anti-stropic has a really small performance impact for a night and day difference, and I would really love to see Square Enix look into that. Keep working on optimization, people will be far less forgiving on a true action game like FFXV.			"

												I've never played this in the consoles (PS3 or Xbox 360) so I guess this is a good port for me. I have a crappy video card and even with a huge RAM and a Xeon processor, I'm experiencing a sharp decline in FPS when the max shadow resolution and anti-aliasing is selected both for window and full-screen mode. So I have to settle to 1920x1080 resolution, 2048 x 2048 shadow resolution, and x8 anti-aliasing option. But neverthless, this is a good port of the FFXIII-2. Looking forward to the next game of the FFXIII saga (Lightning Returns) next year.			"

												I played this way back on my Xbox 360, and 100% it too, and I'll say that the game is great. It's better than XIII in every way really. I personally didn't like the first game that much, it was too restrictive and it took forever before you had some freedom but XIII-2 gets to the point very quickly compared to the first game and doesn't bombard you with as many tutorials. I would still recommend playing the first game or watch all the cutscenes on YouTube or something because this is definitely a direct sequel and you'll be very lost in the story if you don't check out the first game. The game does come with a XIII primer to help people who didn't play XIII to catch up so there's that too.I was pretty happy to see this game coming to the PC. Unfortunately, the game has some issues. There are two main issues that IF fixed will help this port immensely. There is a TON of screen tearing and the frame rate is all over the place (the lowest I hit was 20fps). My rig has an i7-3770K, 16GB RAM and a GTX 670 FTW so it's definitely not my PC which can't run the game at a constant 60fps on its highest settings. As for graphics options, don't expect a myriad of options. This is definitely a console port so don't expect advanced options like Tesselation, PCSS, and so on. You have resolution, shadow resolution and MSAA. The game is not ugly by any means though.I will still recommend it. It's definitely the best in the XIII series, but buy with caution. I hope that Squeenix release a patch soon and/or someone releases a mod which fixes these problems.			"

												Hey, are you one of those people who took Final Fantasy XIII on its own terms and ended up enjoying like me? Yeah, this game isn't for you. It took all the good things about XIII and replaced them with boring towns, painfully easy combat, absolutely insane storytelling, a laughably stupid antagonist, and one of the most aimless plots I've seen in a RPG.Looks and sounds fantastic, though.

												FF XIII-2 has everything that FF XIII does not. Basically FF XIII should have been like this.PROS:- Your character's leveling is open (you control their path and ability)- The world is open (ish)- You can capture and use monsters (and level them up)- The gameplay in general is better- The live action cutscenes are a little thing that makes the game much more engaging - You can save at any pointCONS:- The game's story line is a little washy, rushed, child-like and I mostly skip all cutscenes- The music at times is just annoying- The characters are hard to relate to and impossible to put up with- Very poor port for the PC, getting Micro-Stutters everywhere (annoying when MGS: Ground Zeroes works flawlessly) - do not let that put you off the game though.

												Not many games give me this urge to write a review.While I am only a few hours into it my first impression is that FFXIII-2 has a great balance in storyline and gameplay.Coming from playing old FF and FFVIII on pc I have skipped other PC versions because they did not seem interesting enough.FFXIII-2  was a gamble at first but my worries were for naught as Square Enix has delivered true to the heart and dynamics of old FF games with a riveting storyline that makes you want to play more and varied fun gameplay.I would certainly recommend this game to any person looking for an interesting storyline as the game is very accessible. (Just make sure you have enough time to go through all the beautiful cutscenes as you can't save during cutscenes and battles. There are some sequences where a tough battle and cutscene go hand in hand meaing that you would need a good 15 minutes to enjoy the battle and cutscence.)			"

Oh and whats better, there is an autobattle button, so you don't have to do anything anymore just press one button :D I'm really impressed Square. Dispate the fact that you no longer made videogames only bloody remakes(oh and the famous FF13 - versus - 15) I thought you can do at least that properly. Well, I was wrong. This game runs like‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Of course everything runs at 15fps so after a while you can get ephilepsy or such. Anyway. I really lost hope for Square. Once a great developer and the best at JRPG's. Now not even its former shadow. Btw FF7 remake was announced. What a bloody suprise. Don't even dare to make a new game. Hope you ruin that one as well :D P.s. really Square don't bother with PC porting anymore. You're bad at it.

												Port comparison:+Nicer looking game with resolution options, AA, and downscale shadows.+Cheap-Has issues such as stuttering framerate and random depth of field blurring out scenes that should have no blur. -A recent patch removed the console-only DLC, permanently disabling them even with a DLC unlocker.-Story and Coliseum DLCs locked before completing the gameThe story and Coliseum DLCs being locked ruins the entire experience for me. I've finished the game on the PS3 already, and I wanted to replay it on PC with the much nicer graphics options and Valk Lightning in my party for my entire experience. However, Squeenix took it upon themselves to ""unspoil"" people going through the game the first time. While I can understand their decision process, I do not agree with it. I also do not recommend anyone who has already completed the game on PS3/360 to buy this for nicer graphics, because although it does certainly look nicer, there are extremely frequent, noticeable instances of frame stutters that quite honestly makes it an inferior experience compared to the PS3 original. Plus, there's the issue of locked DLC. I was extremely disappointed as a result, and I will not recommend the purchase of this version of the game.			"

												A pretty good port of a pretty alright game. XIII-2 doesn't have the same level of polish that the first game has even though the port is much better thsi time around, meaning it has a very inconsistent difficulty level and some rather arbitrary mechanics, but the wide variety of new features, an overall improved battle system, and a still-stellar soundtrack make this a game worth playing for the price. The visuals are also spectacular in moments, particularly near the beginning and end, but a painfully padded middle-game really shows that they did not give nearly as much effort to the aethetics in the core of the experience. If you are able to get through a lot of the padding, you'll find a fun game with some moments on par with the high points in its predecessor, particularly the boss battles. Overall, though, the added visual options are a great touch and if you set your rig to maximize performance, you'll get some really smooth gameplay. While I have not played the entirety of the game on PC, I have completed it on PS3 and this review is based on my initial impressions. I will change them if anything significant lowers my opinion later on in the game.			"

Otherwise, no.It's almost as if Square Enix gave fans a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• framerate as a giant ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you for demanding 1080p. Game is borderline-unplayable on high-end machines.			"

												Beautiful game on consoles.. but unfortunately this is a bad port and IMHO a waste of money.   Most of my playing time on this has been me changing settings in the hope to get past a crash.. unfortunately several hours later.. I can't replay the same fight again..no matter how beautiful.  I would suggest any one looking at this.. buy a cheap PS2 and a copy of the game off Ebay.			"

												terrible game.  Wish steam would refund my money.  First 20 minutes of the game is some type of fight scene on the ground in the air, upside down, mash some buttons now and then. No idea what was happening.  Controls were laggy and weird to play. Gave up after 5 minutes of trying to play it.			"

												Unlike the FFXIII pc port, this game has performance issues but it's nothing serious, really. FFXIII-2 is how FFXIII should have been in terms of gameplay and story progression, it's like the enhanced version of the game. FFXIII-2 definitely saved the FFXIII franchise, just tweak the Shadow Resolution (to anything not higher than 4k@1080p) in settings and you're good to go.			"

												I've just completed my last steam achievement, so I am pretty much done with this game. I've bought it for 9,99‚Ç¨ in the winter sale and for that money, it was more than worth it for me. Looking at all the other reviews, it looks like I got quite lucky: I've had no problems with either FPS or crashes, and my system is quite old and certainly below average.In comparison to FF13, I would say that the story was slightly better, which doesn't mean much because I think the FF13 story was crap. The character design hasn't gotten any better either, and I think the ingame music was too loud for most of the game.That said, I still had a blast. For some reason I love the combat system, it's really addicting. The game is a lot more open than FF13, and I liked the monster system a lot. Hunting fragments is fun for the most part, although there are some frustrating ones. Overall, I can definitely recommend the game if you liked its predecessor. Also, there is a naked Lightning, so how could I not love this game!?			"

												I'm gonna say this right off the bat: I'm not one of those cool kids, that's hating on the FFXIII series beause it's required of me as a true FF fan. I quite liked XIII and I'd really wanna like XIII-2 aswell.Here's the problem though:The PC port was probably done by a monkey, a lobotomized monkey that is. Dark Souls was a bad PC port, but this is beyond bad. I'm constantly crashing and the framerate is horrible. At least you can fix the fps-issue by tweaking your driver settings, so much for the bright side.If you can stomach a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• port, go for the game, otherwise save yourself the money.			"

												I didn't half expect what I was getting into when i purchased this game(given the fact that I bought it thinking it was Lighting Returns) I did however give it a shot.Keeping an open mind that they tired to ""fix"" the original by releasing another game in the franchise, only to alienate Final Fantasy fans to crater towards teenage girls is not what i would consider a ""fix"". Yes it's not as linear as the first game, but adding in a female protagonist who is at times ditsy and air headed just baffles me. The moment she started talking to cats I was done. The cutscenes where ""bearable"" but the music was different and gave me a headache to the point where I felt nauseated.I can't recommend this game to anybody, unless your a thirteen/sixteen year old girl, who has a major ego and crushing on some random dude who just fell out of the sky.

												Although I dont like the battle system that much, which btw is almost the same from FFXIII, I liked the overall improvements to the leveling system, and the possiblity you have to tame monsters.The game was launched with poor performance issues, but at this point it is fairly playable, to be honest got a few fps drop from 60 to 32 but it was 2 or 3 times.Pros: -The battle system has been improved over FFXIII.-Loved the BGM, although I believe isnt from Nobuo Uematsu, still good.-The Acting voices are well acted for my taste.-You can still play it if you didnt played FFXIII, it has in game menus where it explains its precuel.-The Models and Scenary are well designed, easy on the eyes.CONS:-The Game sometimes confuses you if you dont pay attention to what are you doing.-Some performance issues, but actually they are very, very rare-You cant easyly save your game in different files.-Pad compatibility issues.

Let's get a few questions answered first.You loved that there were finally no random encounters in FF 13?You didn't want to grind all the time?You liked that you had not to go to an npc and get them to tell you to get a medkit for them because they rather sit at the beach and watch the waves?You liked your characters in FF 13 and want them to be playable in the next part?Well if say you ""no"" to all those points then this game is definitly for you.However if ""yes"" is you answer - don't get that piece of history.I don't get how all those positive reviews come to.Besides the obvious frame drops etc. (yes it has framedrops)So you wanted to play your nice FF 13 characters - Because you know it is a sequel? right? right...? WRONG, you get to play the first 2(3?it's always the same enemy who cares) battles with Lightning and that's about it you see of her. Because you know - you always wanted to play Serah and a random dude from the future, right? I know you want it.I'm just 1 hour into the game and already want to quit it because it just gets everything what was good in the prequel and throws it completly over and says ""we heard you - you wanted a less linear story progress, there you go"".However, that they thought mechanics like completly random leveling (you won't have no idea what you do if you haven't played the other game), the story (yey, time traveling - nice idea actually) and that ****freaking random encounters are a good idea, needs to get his mind washed!Of course the story itself isn't as bad, it seems like it will have it's moments of fun and so on BUT I already noticed myself using a guide for all those Live trigger Events!!!! (YES you have to decide what your characters say! Damnit if I wanted a telltales game I would get one!). But wait if you want to get special items you need to talk to all the ""LTE"" for that sector of the game and if you want even better bonus items you have to get the ""funny"" ones. So I was busy reading what I should take instead of just taking what feels like what I would say.Another point. You like QTE? Ye, Quick time events - Because someone at SQE obviously does. They included in their cutscenes freaking QTEs. Who in their right mind wants to play a FF with those dirty missused things. If that all points are however something you would like you should defenitly get the game, you won't be dissappointed.I will see if, I can get myself to play through that black sheep of FF and see if it gets any better...

												After Steam wouldn't give me a refund on this game, it ended up sitting in my library because it didn't run well at all. I eventually built a new PC with an i7-6800k @ 4GHz, 32GB of 3200MHz DDR4, and an MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X.I can finally run this game at 60-120fps. Usually sits around 75. But seriously, this game as a port is awful. If you have a really fast PC and absolutely must play it, go ahead. If you have any reason to doubt this game not running perfectly on your system, don't waste your money on it. I caught it on a sale so it wasn't a total loss. Plus, now I can actually enjoy the game on my overpowered system.			"

												Worst pc port i have ever seen to date, even the recommended system requirement are not sufficient to play this game.I have tried to select the lowest graphic setting for 720p resolution while using more than one performance guide from the discussion forum but it still ended up with performance so bad that i did not want to play it.So in the end i gave up after 6 hours because of the poor performance, i went on youtube to look for a ""full movie"" of this game, found one that had a duration of 7 hours and watched it to get the story since the game was unplayable for me.Fair warning you get a big fat ""To Be Continued"" at the end of this game so it is not stand alone like FFXIII. For those that want to know why i consider FFXIII stand alone, it is simple, as you probably saw in his game description there is time travel in this game and of course that mean that somebody or something is messing up event in the timeline, and so at the beginning of this game you quickly learn that somebody or something messed up the good ending from FFXIII and that it need to be ""fixed"", that why i see FFXIII as a stand alone game with a possibility to expand the story in two more games if you start to play the second.

												First and foremost: BUY THIS GAME FOR CONSOLE INSTEAD! YOU WILL RECIEVE NOT ONLY BETTER & MORE STABLE FPS, BUT YOU WILL ALSO RECIEVE BETTER VISUAL AND AUDIO QUALITY.Final Fantasy XIII-2 is the sequal to Final Fantasy XIII, but it makes itself a whole different game. While the battle system is the same as before, it spruces it up with the ability to use monsters as companions. This keeps battles fresh and gives you many options for paradigms. I personally like this in combat, but the cost of this is that you won't be gaining a third companion. Also the Crystarium is different. Instead of multiple different trees to grow, there is just one, and what you gain per sphere depends on the role you choose to upgrade. When you reach the end of the path your Crystarium will expand. Then you are given multiple choices to level up including increasing ATB and increasing the amount of accessories you can hold. I like this change as well. The two main characters are Serah, Lightning's sister, and Noel, a mysterious stranger from the future. The premise is that after Cocoon fell from the last game, Lightning vanished. A few years later, Noel appears on a meteor and begins traveling through time with Serah. The story from there is driven by each point in time you travel to. From what I've played so far, the cutscenes are mostly based on feelings instead of character development. This means that most players will find that they don't care about Serah and Noel. The story ends up being weak and unimmersive. To add on, the music is no longer orchestra, but is now electronic J-Popish music. If that's your style, then godspeed but I personally perfered the Orchestral tracks. A few minor  points are that now there are options to pick when you get in dialogue, the side quests are more varied than just helping a L'cie stone out, and there are quicktime events in some cutscenes.  But the main thing I have to complain about it is the quality of the port. It's terrible. No matter what you do, maybe unless you have a REALLY good computer, you will experience frame rates all over the place, but almost never over 30. Also the audio quality ends up being terrible, it sounds like the voice acters are speaking through a cheap headset instead of a studio microphone.So to summarize:Pros:                        -Revamped Battle System (Pets)-Crystarium Revamp-Time Travel makes the game less linear.-More Varied Side Quest Premises-Branching Dialogue and Quick-time events make the game more engaging than it would've been.Cons:-Story and Main Characters are uninteresting and melodramatic.-The PC port is terrible.So the bottom line is if you aren't a fan of FFXIII, look up different & better games. If you are a FFXIII fan, then this game may be worth your while IF YOU BUY IT ON CONSOLE.			"

												I had just finished my live playthrough of the first one, and i'll say I loved every moment of it. I am a bit of the way in to this one and have to say a couple of things about it. The plot is pretty interesting, its not as epic and deep as the first but its good. The combat system has only been improved and expanded on. The leveling system is simplified to a more choose your class role rather than being forced into a couple of classes. They have added a couple of things like summoned party members, monster synthesis and item crafting rather than just upgrading. The cons though:The game is lesser optimized. Even at the lowest settings my beast of a pc, while streaming, has frequent fps drops. Way worse than the first. It feels incredibly rushed in regards to optimization. The plot isnt as powerful, yet still decent. The world overall doesnt flow completely fluidly. The game feels very westernized. Which, to some people is probably a good thing. I dunno.Overall I recommend the game, its a good and solid rpg but I HIGHLY recommend the first one first before you play this. You dont need to have played the first to enjoy this but it definitely deepens the universe when you know who the characters are and what the places are.Below is some gameplay footage of xiii-2

It's faster paced than other Final Fantasy games and far more engagingI will recommend this game, but please play XIII before you play this one so the story actually makes sense.			"

												Being a truly dedicated fan of Square's franchises, (especially Final Fantasy) I sometimes am biased about my opinions. However, this really deserves a down to earth look at what's wrong here.The game itself isn't bad. In fact it's above average by what I consider a fair standard for JRPG's coming westside recently. This game is simply a port of its console predesessor. And that is what I'm calling it through this review. My PC's specs aren't high end, it's completely running on factory hardware. And I can play games such as Path of Exile and Call of Duty AW without much trouble, if any. And I'm running on 6 GB of RAM with an AMD A8 Quad-Core processor. Final Fantasy XIII ran almost PERFECTLY with very little chugging when the particles started flying. So as a PORT this game fails to meet what I would consider even sub-par standards that we've come to expect from an A-class company.This game needs some serious patching. So if you're intending to buy this game, think hard about your rig's specs. This game may not hold up to your expectations, at least for now.			"

												One of the worst performing games I have ever seen on pc. i7 3820, gtx 970, 16gb ram, slam dunks most other games on high-ultra at 60fps 1920x1080, can't do‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•with this game. The frame dips are hardcore and sickening, even way worse than in FF13 and Lightning Returns which both are also optimized like total garbage. I found a fps uncapper program that makes the game run much smoother but still has big time slow motion slowdown when running around bigger map areas which is often, although thankfully doesn't happen in combat. Even so, this is still a sorry, unoptimized, embarassing excuse for a pc port. The game itself is a good fun game on console, but I will not support Square being the worst company in history at making pc ports with a upvote for any reason.Hopefully they also don't use the auto battle system anymore that 13 and 13-2 use. It's decent, but just feels overly simplified. I mean I don't want the whole game to be as hopelessly convoluted as FF8 or FFX-2, but what was wrong with FF12's combat and game system? That is one of their best FF games. They even used its combat system for FF14 online which is saying something.Can't we just get a port of FF12? Actually no square nevermind I said that. Just take your Rio 2016 olympic gold medal for outstanding bad port jobs for pc gaming and smash it up your asses, go bankrupt, and sell your games to a more competent company that actually cares for pc games and doesn't release them in a god awful state and never, ever update them. Any of them. Ever. Because you could care less about pc gaming since 95% of your profits come from console gaming. I guess I could take back everything I just said because I wouldn't care either if that were the case.It looks like hell froze over because Ubisoft is getting better at coding for pc while Square will forever be in the mother ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing stone age.Score: Bend over & blast this game into your asses with a naval cannon / 10			"

												Too many issues just like the initial release of XIII. It's best to save your cash, don't waste it on a half‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•port. Square Enix's promise of resolution options and higher frame rate is a gimmick. The game still renders natively at 720P on a 1080P to 2160P resolution. It also performs poorly on high-end hardware. Furthermore, there's no SLi or Crossfire support.

												The story starts good and continues where FINAL FANTASY 13 left off, but compared to the prequel it's very simple, too simple at time. it's also limited because of the handfull cast of recurring characters (and only 2 of those are playable). There are around 20 or so maps and there is freedom to choose what to do but there is too much backtracking for sidequests. The monster collecting mecanism is boring.There is more challenge to be found and there are things to complete once you reach the end game. Overall an Ok game but its hard to recommend unless for FF fans.			"

												The first part of FF XIII was barely playable, and this is coming from a life-long fan of the series.  This second installment is only mildly better as far as exploration goes since now you actually have alternate places to explore.  Battles are almost identical but leveling up is a bit clearer.  At least now you also gain gil when fighting so there is more of a reason to grind, if you so desire.  The story line, however, is horrible.  Confusing as any game I've ever played.  Then there's the questing, which is the entire game.  It feels more like one big list of sidequests than a coherent story you play through and want to see develop.  I paid for it, so I'm going to get through it...			"

												This game is a nightmare when it comes to performance to a point where it's actually worse then the performance of No Mans Sky (yes it's that bad). If you want to get at least 1080p 30fps, I highly suggest that you put the settings to the lowest possible. Even while doing so, in battle the frames will drop to about 20fps. Outside of battle you will notice that hiccup in frames lost as well. FPS aside, there is a major bug when it comes to saving your game. The game will completely crash to desktop when you try to save the game, and if you do manage to save the game, you never know when that save crash will appear. It could happen right away, or 10 minutes later. So attempting to save every few minutes to hopefully not get that crash to save progress, is fairly annoying. From the brief amount of time that I played with the game, the combat is very familiar to the first game which is a welcome and the soundtrack was very well done as well from what I could tell. The addition of ""pets"" was a nice touch and the quick time events are a welcome addition as well.If you really want to play FF13-2, DO NOT buy this PC verison. Get the PS3 or Xbox version so you don't waste your money like I did on this awful lazy PC port.			"

												I so wish I could say that this is the worst game I have ever played, but in all fairness I've played E.T. the Extraterrestrial.However, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is by far the worst RPG I've ever played in my thirty years of gaming.  I'll highlight the worst parts of it, but first I want to make clear that any of it's many infractions would be sufferable were it not for the horrendousness of the ""story.""  Most of it simply makes no sense, but from what I can gather, there are time travelling asteroid anomolies from other dimensions.  This might seem strange, but in the game world, everyone is an expert on time anomolies, because you know... this stuff happens every day.  Honestly, my five year old niece could have written a more cogent and engaging story.Combat.  They took everything that was good about FFXIII's system out, and left us with everything we wish they'd improved upon.  Nothing you do matters.  I got through most of the fights in this game by simply setting my controller down, going into the kitchen and making myself a beverage while the NPCs finished the fight for me.  I got all the way to the end area this way, but then the enemies became so much more powerful that I've had to go back and grind these meaningless battles for hours upon hours to build up enough hit points to survive the end boss' attacks.Saving.  You can save anywhere, but evidently the time anomolies have infected the game's save system, because it routinely takes 2-5 minutes to save my game.Pacing.  Everything takes twice as long as it should.  There are load screens to load the load screens for the animations.  This game has more in common with a kaleidoscope than anything else.Characters.  Utterly forgettable.  Whatever their motives are, I don't even care.  I stopped listening hours ago.So in closing, if you enjoyed FFXIII as I did, be content to stop there.  This game does nothing to add to the game's world, story, or legacy.  Instead spend your $20 on some glass shards and salt to roll your eyes around in.  The experience will be similar, but will take up less of your life.			"

												Do not buy this game on pc, get it on ps3 if you can. Square Enix showed, that they don't care about pc ports of their great FF games, even people are willing to buy it. The performance, at least on my machine (8gb ram, i5 2500, geforce 970, SSD HDD) is the same and sometimes even worse then FF 13-1, the grafic settings seem like ripped from Durantes mod, the Loading screens remind me of the ps1, really? I have to load 30 seconds on a SSD just to be in another cutscene 10 seconds later? Skip this! SKIP THIS ONE! I played through FF 13 even the combat sucked hard, I like the combat improvement of 13-2 but the performance makes the game unplayable for me. Not even stable 30 fps are achieved, 24-60 jumping like crazy. Lightning returns isn't announced yet, they couldn't even make that run smooth on the ps3, I wonder how ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• the pc port of that will be. Maybe they won't bother with the third one.

												I'm in the unenviable position of having to bash one of my favorite JRPGs in recent memory: Final Fantasy XIII-2.  ... Well, the PC version anyways.  The console versions are still fantastic obviously.I can't believe this.  Original FFXIII actually runs surprisingly well on my PC considering all the port issues, but FFXIII-2 runs like CRAP, even with the lowest possible settings (I freaking played FFXIII the day it launched on Steam and even then it ran WAY better than this).  There's got to be some bigger issues at play here as even people with very high-end graphics cards are reporting problems getting the game to run at a consistent framerate.  This is ridiculous, it's pretty much the same engine as FFXIII, and I remember it running a hair more smoothly than FFXIII on consoles, but it runs a whole heck of a lot worse here.Well, hey, that's nearly 30GB of space I can get back on my PC at least, and I won't have to feel even the slightest temptation to get Lightning Returns when it inevitably comes out.  Glad I kept my PS3 copy.Kind of a shame too, as Square-Enix frequently has PC sales, and the PC version includes most of the console DLC right out the gate (I think the only things not included are a few costumes and weapons and such, nothing major), plus the Japanese language track.I hate to do this, as the game itself is wonderful, but I really can't recommend the PC version at all.  Blargh.			"

												Nothing can save this game. Pick any aspect of a game. This game ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up. - This game will struggle to run itself, lose frame to a point, changing the fight menu will be troublesome.- Graphic: World is empty and incoherent- Story is completely dumb and uninteresting. Cherry on top, it will be ""to be continued"".- Gameplay is garbage, you just spam auto-action and the game chose the best action for you. - Game is easy even in normal. You don't need to look at the screeen, you will win your fight- No summon, no limit break, no shop, 4 recolors weapon, maximum 2 equipment selectableI didnd't know it was possible to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up a game so much. FFXIII serie has to be in the top 10 of the worst games i've ever played.			"

IE click auto battle every battle and occasionally contemplate the nature of boredom, occasionally hinting at that sweet morsel of entertainment if you just push the A/X button a little more, if you just press on in this stupid convoluted mystery that you‚Äôve been thrown into it will somehow be rewarding in the end so you can say wow it was all worth it, trying to not draw attention to the needless repetition of levels copied and repeated under the guise of the narrative, putting in hours of unenjoyable content in an optimistic fervor in hope at the chance of something interesting happening and slowly realizing the reality that the first twenty minutes of the game is identical to the next 2000 minutes.the music isn't so great either			"

												The game opens with an intro movie that's longer than GoT and focuses on Lightning - a character who was already uninteresting and fundamentally unlikable - who has now been made into some kind of super-bland valkyrie style character fighting against an unknown guy in an unknown world when random‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•shit starts happening. (Because FF13 wasn't already full of bizarre yet somehow entirely uninteresting nonsense.) Random‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•involves a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• combat system where you literally do nothing but push the auto-battle button every turn. It also involves quck-time events, which are the game industry's way of looking at the trillions of dollars they've made over the years and saying, ""Now that we're set financially I wonder how ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing stupid and lazy we can be.""So there's a skip-scene feature, and after about five hours of intro I skipped something like 100 scenes in order to get to the part where the game starts. The first thing it did is ask me if I wanted to view the tutorial. I said, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOso it responded by showing me the tutorial, which can't be skipped with the skip-scene feature.What the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• are these people even doing anymore?--to be continued when I feel like I can stomach more of this‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-Cont.:So now I'm Serah, a character who is somehow simultaneously more annoying than Hope and Vanille combined. I'm being followed by the ugliest travesty of a creature that's ever been seen and it has the absolute gall to call itself by the name of a legendary hero. Oh, and it's my sword/bow/gun, because why the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• not.And then there's Noel, who may as well inflate his ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing parachute pants and fly back to Kingdom Hearts where he belongs instead of harassing me with his boring, one-dimensional, neverending monologue.I'm in a beachside village that's attacked by ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing aliens and all the people with automatic weaponry can't handle it because I'm the main character. So I suffer through a few battles using the same complete ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t combat system from FF13 where I can only control one character and the auto-battle completely takes the point out of even showing up.After saving the incompetent villagers I rush the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of the place because Gadot's hairdo is terrifying af, and I head for the hills, only to discover that there's a new SUPER-IRRITATING combat init system where enemies poof into existence right next to you and you can run from them or slash them in order to avoid battle or start with an advantage. This is similar to the init system from some decent RPGs except that in those ones the enemies didn't appear out of thin air for no reason.I'm also constantly bombarded by asinine, unsolicited voice-over every time I look in the general direction of an NPC, which is part of the reason I passionately hate most western RPGs. Great job there, SE. Glad you spent money on that.I reached the alien rock that is apparently attacking my village and got attacked by a giant portal monster that died in about five seconds. Oh good, more cutscenes.Now it's tomorrow and I'm back at the starting point on the beach, but this time when I try to run away I'm blocked. Looks like there's some unresolved drama back at the bungalow, and...I'm not going to do this to myself anymore.‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you, SquEnix. Just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you.Also - and I usually don't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about this, but - glorious 4 FPS ftw.This isn't Final Fantasy. It's not even a decent knockoff... I've followed this series with dedication from the very beginning, but this is so far beyond too far that I can't even wrap my head around how you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing idiots could have generated such a monumental tragedy of a digital garbage pile.AND I ENJOYED X-2.

Drops to 22 at times(so far the lowest for me)2) No xbox 360/xbox one controller button prompts when doing cinematic actions3) Lack of huge graphical options(post processing, tesselation, decals, lighting, etc-at least more resolution options and 1080p)Don't buy right now, FF13 in itself is still being fixed, even though I did not buy that game. FF13-2 gave me hope. So I will not fall for the same mistake when Final Fantasy 13 Lightning Returns that comes about March 2015 will do for PC gamers. This is unacceptable! Be smart and vote with your wallet untill your hear more positivity from the community hub of this game.			"

												They dun f*cked it up.The game has odd framelimits in certain places and what they mean with the ""60fps"" part in the description is that the game OCASIONALLY scratches that limit. Then goes back to either 30 or somewhere between 30-50fps. I benchmarked the opening on the lowest and highest possible settings and there were no changes in the general performance.And no its not my rig, its a thing thats happening to everyone.sooo if you want a headache and have your eyes bleed from a wild framerate thats definitely NOT ""60fps"", then go ahead. Get the game. If you can stand it then good for you.If you cant stand slideshows, skip it untill its fixed (but lets be real here, its not going to get fixed).As for the game itself, I cannot say. I hear its better than the horrible disaster that was FFXIII, but its not going to be some great experience that you'll be ""missing out on"" if you dont play it.TL;DR: Extremely bad port, dont get it just yet.

												Don't let negative feedbacks change your mind.Seriously, I played the whole XIII series on my PS3 back then and I played this game again on PC because the story is so great, I really like its plot (not going to spoil any story) the graphics, the combat and the character conversations is just so great that made me had feeling for the game. It had been great for me to enjoy the whole XIIIs adventures on PC and I'm still waiting for the last piece of the puzzle..... LIGHTNING RETURNS			"

												It has plenty of flaws and mid-game is just filler. But it's aesthetically pleasing, mindblowingly beautiful, in the universe created in FFXIII and has wonderful music.In terms of the story, it's weaker than the first one and does not feel coherent as an adventure. But it explores relationship between people in the captivating myth. Storywise it's still head and shoulders above pretty much any other game out there.			"

												One of my favorite FFs so far, which was totally unexpected since the reviews seemed mixed and I didn't like XIII that much.Good:- Attention to detail with the plot, which makes a lot of efforts to appear coherent and is a lot more memorable than the one from XIII (which is basically a lenghty ultra linear quest which made no sense and lead nowhere). Of course, it's a time paradox based story so you'll find as many plot holes as you want to, but I'd say the writers watched a lot of Doctor Who and it looks decent enough to be enjoyed.- The main paradox in the story is just great, with a Doctor Who style resolution. Awesome.- Real choices with corresponding alternate endings which make sense. And it's a way to escape your doom if you understand the problems with what the main characters are doing ...- The two main characters are annoying and mean good but don't really know what they are doing. Clever. Lightning on the other hand is the best character from the XIII series by far, and they found a nice way to keep her busy while making her look good.- Good combat system, slightly improved from XIII.- The way the side content is blended with the main story (you have to do side missions at some points in the story, explore timelines a bit randomly, etc).- Lots of side timelines and additional missions.- Lots of content.Bad:- Could use a few more locations and one or two major paradox plots in the main story.- Some important side content is gratuitously hard to find without guides (wild artefacts locations ...).- Too grindy to complete the endgame content.- Confusing character advancement (read guides).- The third character in the party are monsters which can be swapped. Nice, but again too grindy and impossible to use correctly without reading wikis and guides. Although they tried to find something original and it's a decent attempt, a regular character would have been better.- Graphics and textures are a big downgrade from XIII. Less budget (but far better game).- Some technical details.			"

												Before I review the game, I need to say this: I do not believe this is a terrible game. I am a fan of the Final Fantasy series and have played through many of the games in it. That being said, this game did not add up to what I thought it would. I enjoyed FFXIII SO much more than this game. It almost seems as if this game is an afterthought of the original. It's sort of like a ""oh, I wonder what might happen after it ends..."" and then this game appeared. You are thrown into a world with the same name as the previous game, but it doesn't have the same feeling to it. This land feels a bit less free than the first game world did. Also, the time travel system was just confusing. It made completing the game near impossible unless you look up what to do online. Altogether, not a fantastic game but also not a terrible game. I would not recommend it to a friend, so I will not recommend it on here. 5/10			"

												Great game. Fantastic combat, and good depth of varried gameplay to keep you busy even after your first play through. Certainly worth the price, and a steal at half off. Story wise, if you liked FFXIII then you'll like this too. I highly recommend listening to the in game Beginner's Primer if you have not played FFXIII; It will provide some much needed context.For anyone who has not played any Final Fantasy games, I would still recommend this game if you enjoy party style combat and tactics. This ia a game that rewards you for investing your time into it. If you only play it for 5 hours, you'll get nothing of value from it; so save your money. If you're willing to give it a legitmate shot, then you'll get what you paid for in spades.Performance wise, it ran perfectly fine on my pc, and mine's nothing overly spectacular. It's not a hunk of junk either though. lol ~.^ ...Think middle of the road, but specifically built for gaming.			"

												Ok, I read all the reviews, either you love this game or you hate it, I get it.  Except that Im sort of in the middle.  I like the game.  Im actually understanding the story fairly well.  I just dont like how long the cinimatics take and this random monster pop up thing where you will be running along and every few seconds a set of monsters pop up out of nowhere to interupt what you are doing.  Its totally annoying.  I know its a part of the story and that you have to have monsters to fight SOMEWHERE but I wish they had found a different way to do it lol!  Otherwise, very pretty game and worth buying at a sale price.			"

												I was very disappointed with the style of combat. I was hoping for something like kingdom hearts and instead got a bad mix on old school final fantasy. It does all of the battling for you. All that is needed is just somewhat timed buttons press and a shift in battle strategy when needed. Yes to can do so manual stuff but the combat is way too automated for this day and age or at least my taste. You really buy this game for the story and to be honest I would want to watch the movie and not do the grind. Not worth the 9.99 I paid for the game.Some tipIf you are a fan of the style of fight in Final Fantasy I would recommend:-getting a USB Xbox 360 control for your PC (You will have to figure out the controls but it is not hard and everything is mapped)-Had a good graphic card. (It‚Äôs Final Fantasy and this means great visual and you are missing half the game with bad graphics) "

												Excellent port, I had no issues (except random alt-tab delays).The game itself is worth playing. You talk about hours of content, it has it. After the main storyline is finished you can continue to the toughest challenges, and they are going to require fully leveled, and almost perfectly leveled monsters.It's like pokemon, in that you have to catch monsters, and level them (but through items, not fighting).There will be much grinding after the game is over, but not before. The game is quite forgiving 99% of the time, which means you won't get insta-killed if you mess up.I always enjoyed the ""spend your points to level up"" system, over the ""you level at the end of a fight"" system.Storyline was excellent, I always enjoy a good time-paradox.This was a fun game to play, I am excited to see x-3 which i never played.

												I absolutely love the game, but the port is just made way too poorly to make it worth playing on PC. There is no official controller support on PC but it freaks out if you don't have one plugged in. Given it still operates with a controller fine, but all of the on screen button queues are given with keyboard key pictures. The battles seem to run fairly well, but the in world graphics really are bogged down and do not run well. Unfortunately the state of the game is almost unenjoyable on PC even though the game is very good in the long run. If you have a PS3, just pick up the original instead.			"

												About the Story:Haven't played FFXIII but could follow the Story in FFXIII-2 because of the fact that you can read the Story from the first Game in the second from Chapter 1 to 13, which was really great, because the Story in XIII-2 could be a lil bit confusing without if you are really willing to follow the story.About the Collectables:There are 160 fragments which you can get from Sidequests or just by finding them, they will unlock some extra abilities like when you jump, you can jump further by holding the button. The Monster Combat System:You can *catch* some monsters like Tonberry, which will fight beside you and your other team mate. Each monster have different abilities and special abilities, which they will learn by leveling them up via monster materials (different from leveling your characters). You can also infuse a monster with another monster to get them their abilities like +XXXstrength.(This will delete the infused monster, but you can still get it back by catching it again).Linear Gameplay yes/no?:I can pretty much say that this game isn't linear at all, you can do whatever you want to do once you entered the first episode. If you do not want to follow the story part, then you can just do some sidequests or search for items. Of course there are some sidequests which will get unlocked after finishing the game, but still good for people who do not want to follow the story immediatly.Does this game have long time motivation?:In my opinion, this FF is really enjoyable even if you already have beaten the game. I was at the final boss in like 29 hours, but decided to do some sidequests and then beat the boss after a total of 44 hours. Also I already played over 50+ hours after finishing the game, because there are some things like the Coliseum, which can pretty much take your time pretty fast. The bosses there are some well-known FF bosses and are challenging if you do not know or have tactics to defeat them.Also... you can play poker as Sazh... that is.... awesome? :PNegative thingys?:Yes, there is one thing which is negative.Sometimes the FPS goes to like 20...BUT I did and I do not care if it does. You should totally play this game!Overall:Almost 100 Hours of playtime and still 3 bosses left + 7 collectables. Fav. FF so far with FFX :3!			"

												I bought FFXIII, and I LOVED IT... but it was released on a console which was prepared to handle the engine it was created on. The battle system in the first game boggled me. I couldn't figure it out, and it really didn't stick to the original context of the skill system. To my dismay, they didn't improve upon it in the sequel. I was hoping they would have, but the game was on sale, so I took a shot. .....  I missed.......The game has a great story line. It is a little too full of fluff, but that is FF for ya. The biggest thing that turned me off about this game was the inefficiency of the portal. The graphics are usually just amazing in these titles, but I wouldn't recommend buying this from STEAM. The portal makes the graphics choppy, and their aren't too many things you can optimize to fix the issue. At times, the problem disuaded me from playing the game. This isn't something I should feel when playing Final Fantasy. I should be enthralled in the game with no disctractions, and enjoying a great interactive story. It didn't happen... so I suppose I will just have to go read a book instead.			"

												""XIII-2"" just barely crosses my ""Recommend"" threshold.It is, indeed, a ""Final Fantasy"" game. It has the requisite production values, large scope, interesting battle system, monster variety, and pretty much everything else you'd expect. Square Enix did well in taking a very different direction than the game's predecessor. The ultra-restricted linearity is gone, replaced with far more explorable environments - and, at a macro level, the ability to time hop. It doesn't get much more nonlinear than that.But the overall result is disappointing.When it all comes down to it, one of the central game mechanics becomes ""find and do as much as you can."" This kind of approach can be entirely functional and fun. It works wonderfully for the ""Mass Effects,"" ""Elder Scrolls,"" and ""Fallouts"" of the world. The problem is that ""XIII-2"" chooses to go the route of the 3D pixel hunt. That is, hints and direction are quite sparse, when they're around at all, and certain things (especially the Archylte Steppe) come down to a process of walking around every inch of an area you've already seen, hoping to run across something new. Which character offers quests? Who knows! What actually has an effect on this part of the gameworld? Who knows!The mixture is both boring AND frustrating, which is not a recipe for a happy player.Now, this kind of thing has been found in the ""Final Fantasy"" series before. It's just that it's very, very optional. Completing the game is usually about the core mechanics of character development and party management, with some very powerful goodies thrown in for the person who pokes their nose into everything. In ""XIII-2,"" poking your nose into everything is much more central to finishing the storyline - and that can make it rather maddening. The game suffers from a case of ""Guide Dang It"" (where you would never logically figure out an element from gameplay alone) more than any other ""Final Fantasy"" I've played.""XIII-2,"" like its predecessor, also has a case of a suddenly steep difficulty curve. You'll find a combat groove, and it will work all the way to the end of the game...and then the final battle occurs, and...looks like we need to go hunting around for more things in places we never thought to look! Let's try talking to everybody again. Again! While getting attacked by monsters the whole way! Again! Some more!Sigh.And then, you finally get to the ending, and it lacks any real payoff at all. (I can't say too much without spoiling things, but my reaction pretty much sums up as, ""They can't actually be serious about this, can they?"")As a final note, I have to say that I just dislike the whole ""time travel and alternate universes"" thing. It really worked for ""Dr. Who,"" but I find it thoroughly stale and disinteresting when used anywhere else. It seems to always turn into a case of ""we just want to throw a bunch of random stuff together, and so we'll explain it with TIME GATES!"" The game doesn't quite go that far - it is decently written - but my not being a fan of the central premise as a storytelling strategy doesn't make me want to award points to the title.In summary, ""XIII-2 "" really does improve on ""XIII"" in certain areas, but it's still more obtuse than it ought to be. Also, it REALLY hits some sour notes with how it wraps itself up. It was good enough to play through, but if ""Final Fantasy"" were a band, this would be one of the weakest albums in the catalog.

												This game is similar to FF13, but it has no boring linear grind.  Furthermore, it has one of the most interesting combat systems I have played.  The hook is the endless possibilities of your third party member/pet.  Since nearly all non-boss enemies can be captured, leveled, and customized through transferring skills, most of my fun came from just working with the recruited enemies.  On Steam is the second time I'm playing through this game.  If the story is extremely crucial, you may somewhat enjoy this game.  If the combat system is crucial to you, this game is worth a shot!Story: 7/10  -I was only interested in bits of it.Combat: 10/10  -The best aspect of the game.Characters: 7/10  -Somewhat less annoying than the original.Music: 7/10  -Many scores are weird, but some rock!Controls: 10/10  -Good controller support.Open Feel: 9/10  -Takes about 1-2 hours to get it to feel more open.Side Story Goals: 10/10  -There are interesting side aspects to take your mind off the grind.Last thought!  It plays great and looks pretty good on my Surface Pro 3!  Portable full game!  Awesome!			"

												I don't know what people are complaining about optimization wise. My game runs beautifully at 1600 by 900 and my pc isnt even that great. I also havnt gotten any fps drops or crashes. This game is running perfectly. The story is also pretty good picking up right where the last game left off. The combat system and AI are also both way better than the first game.I give this game 9/10 easy.			"

												If you want to play this game, buy it on a console. This port is horrid and has a multitude of issues, and has to be modded to even be playable. Not to mention the random‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•crashes that happen not only when you try to save, but when you load, and even completely and utterly unpromted in the middle of an asinine battle.			"

												it's an unfinished, polished turd of a game. I did my best to stick with this series, but Square has really fukt up and dropped the ball. The characters are mediocre, at best(mostly cliche). The story was a HUGE mess. The combat system falls apart with their sad attempt at ""pokemon"" fighters, which doesn't allow you to have a 3rd fighter. Also, there are certain areas of the game that are off limits due to implemented (and unfinished) DLC. This game was a huge disappointment and a waste of everyone'e time and money. Shame on you, Square Enix!!!!			"

												First thing first: I would highly advise not playing this if you havent completed XIII already as while XIII is a game with serious flaws, the story of it will directly be spoiled in like the first half hour of this game.On the whole, I enjoyed the game. There are some underlying flaws but it left me with a positive experience playing through to the end. The plot is very hard to follow, in that sometimes it just doesn't make sense. It's a time travel plot but where usually with this type of plot, you change the past and the future changes, here everything changes including the past, as well as having a location and character in the opening sequence that falls out of 'time' and you arent really sure whats going on. The good? It look's pretty, even if things don't make sense .The battle system is probably the best disguise for a bad system I've seen in a long while. 'Auto Battle' command is back, which lets the CPU choose the best actions round by round. Personally I like to issue commands manually, only the thing is, to do so will put you at a huge disadvantage - manually issuing commands takes a couple seconds more while enemies still attack and prepare moves, and the commands are very generic (Attack, Magic attack, and four elements) for the most part. There are some battles with 6 enemies where I couldn't even tell what was going on, I found most battles I was glued to the HUD without looking at the graphics etc.You control one character while the AI controls the other, as well as a tamed monster you can have. I disliked this system too - it had potential but did a bad job of explaining what monster stats were, what benefit using monster A over monster B was, or even the fact it doesnt flag 'rare' monsters you encounter in the field up so you can easily pass them by.Character progression felt flat. You can level according to what you prefer, class wise, but by the end of the game you realise that in the end you will end up the same as every other player. As well, the points you put into the system to level up, dont seem to actually 'do' much. Partially realted to being glued to the HUD, you don't notice your characters scoring that massive crit thanks to their new stats/gear, because well, the numbers arent that impressive. Additionally the game seems to reward grinding and raw stats over strategy leaving many battles feeling unrewarding.The game is not linear, one of the main complaints many had with XIII. Did they take it a bit too far here? Maybe. I would say no, overall, however the tools you use to unlock extra stages or unlock special skills, or heck to even advance, were very difficult to locate in levels without the assistance of a guide. I didn't have too much issue finding my way to the end of the game, but then going back and trying to unlock extra stages or locate and capture decent monsters is impossible to acheive in any sort of decent time without a guide.Performance wise, it is a bad port, but with a few tweaks it is bearable, even fine if you have a good specced PC (I run it on an i7, GTX 770, and aside from a few frame rate drops it has been fine after tweaking using nvidia's own graphics settings.) There are no meaningful graphics settings in the games menu, so first thing you will want/need to do is google up some reccomended settings and then change these directly in your GFX cards manufacturers tool.Expect to get around 30 hours from the main story, and exploring side branches of the story reasonably well. Post game, FF fans may expect an uber boss, there are a few in this however as mentioned before, to even set about finding them, or preparing for them, you need a guide. If I'm using a guide to do everything I don't see the point in doing it, so I will likely complete some of the DLC and retire from the game. Overall the 30 hours have been enjoyable and I felt I have definately got my moneys worth,			"

												One of my favorite FFs so far, which was totally unexpected since the reviews seemed mixed and I didn't like XIII that much.Good:- Attention to detail with the plot, which makes a lot of efforts to appear coherent and is a lot more memorable than the one from XIII (which is basically a lenghty ultra linear quest which made no sense and lead nowhere). Of course, it's a time paradox based story so you'll find as many plot holes as you want to, but I'd say the writers watched a lot of Doctor Who and it looks decent enough to be enjoyed.- The main paradox in the story is just great, with a Doctor Who style resolution. Awesome.- Real choices with corresponding alternate endings which make sense. And it's a way to escape your doom if you understand the problems with what the main characters are doing ...- The two main characters are annoying and mean good but don't really know what they are doing. Clever. Lightning on the other hand is the best character from the XIII series by far, and they found a nice way to keep her busy while making her look good.- Good combat system, slightly improved from XIII.- The way the side content is blended with the main story (you have to do side missions at some points in the story, explore timelines a bit randomly, etc).- Lots of side timelines and additional missions.- Lots of content.Bad:- Could use a few more locations and one or two major paradox plots in the main story.- Some important side content is gratuitously hard to find without guides (wild artefacts locations ...).- Too grindy to complete the endgame content.- Confusing character advancement (read guides).- The third character in the party are monsters which can be swapped. Nice, but again too grindy and impossible to use correctly without reading wikis and guides. Although they tried to find something original and it's a decent attempt, a regular character would have been better.- Graphics and textures are a big downgrade from XIII. Less budget (but far better game).- Some technical details.			"

												Definitely better than FFX-2 .... but there are so many better FFs out there. I much preferred FFXIII to the sequel: many moaned that the original was far too linear, which is true, but it had a guiding plot and complex characters with interesting interactions. The sequel suffers from Time Gates (you don't know where/when you're going... means you can have no reason to 'GO' somewhere, you only ever get reasons to 'LEAVE') and only having 2 main characters plus a gimmicky Mog.Quick rundown of the characters:Serah: gets no character development from her supporting role in FFXIIINoel: cross between a cliche of a heartbroken teenager and a cliche of a boy with a fallen hero; neither is developed well. He's protecting Serah because he lost someone and wants to fight Caius because of anger... that's basically everything you get.Mog: ""oh isn't he cute..."" there, desired reaction achieved. Lightning: watch the trailer on the store page, look at the screenshots... that's about 50% of her presence in the entire game. I'd call her role a cameo but then I'd have nothing to say about Snow, Sazh, Vanille, Fang or the Nora gang...Hope: hey look, one of the original main characters made it intot he game in a meaningful way... too bad they took the most irritating of the characters and took him from an angry/lost kid to the ultimate boy genious. I'm assuming I wasn't the only one to miss the groundwork to suggest he wasn't just average intelligence... probably because it isn't there. He doesn't even get any noticeable character development: assume he's just a cliche child genious and you won't go far wrong.In fact Hope's role in this game is simply a lazy plot device... same goes for almost every solution to every part of every section of the game: do random things and the answer to your problem drops straight in your path. If they'd called this ""FFXIII-Deus Ex Machina"" I could have understood that, but as it is I just found it robbed any sort of unifying force to the story.			"

												This is a really fun, awesome game, with a ton of good mechanics and interesting characters.BUTIt crashes ALL. THE. FREAKING. TIME. I don't usually write reviews, but people should be aware before purchasing that you're going to be on the edge of your seat the whole game, wondering when (not if, but when) the next crash is coming, and if you'll be able to save first. Every time I stop playing, it's because the game crashes, I lose a bunch of grinding/progress, and I get frustrated and walk away. You'll spend a ton of extra hours in the game, just replaying the same things over and over again, praying that your game doesn't crash.It's a real shame, because the game itself feels fun and interesting. Go play it on a console.			"

I just dont like how long the cinimatics take and this random monster pop up thing where you will be running along and every few seconds a set of monsters pop up out of nowhere to interupt what you are doing.  Its totally annoying.  I know its a part of the story and that you have to have monsters to fight SOMEWHERE but I wish they had found a different way to do it lol!

												I was very disappointed with the style of combat. I was hoping for something like kingdom hearts and instead got a bad mix on old school final fantasy. It does all of the battling for you. All that is needed is just somewhat timed buttons press and a shift in battle strategy when needed. Yes to can do so manual stuff but the combat is way too automated for this day and age or at least my taste. You really buy this game for the story and to be honest I would want to watch the movie and not do the grind. Not worth the 9.99 I paid for the game.Some tipIf you are a fan of the style of fight in Final Fantasy I would recommend:-getting a USB Xbox 360 control for your PC (You will have to figure out the controls but it is not hard and everything is mapped)-Had a good graphic card. (It‚Äôs Final Fantasy and this means great visual and you are missing half the game with bad graphics) "

												I got to say, I was really skeptical going into this game, with all the negativity surrounding it, but I was pleasantly surprised by this game, I enjoyed it more than I expected. Almost every complaint towards FFXIII was addressed in this game:-the combat system is almost the same as in FFXIII, but with great improvements.-explorable towns, people to talk to and actual sidequests.The graphics are really amazing considering it's a 2011 game, most of the locations are a sight to behold. The voice acting is excellent. The music is awesome, with a wide range of different tunes. The story may not be the best out there, but it's still fun.All in all it's great experience.The port isn't perfect, it doesn't maintain solid 60 fps, sometimes it will dip to 24~30, but still playable.

												I absolutely love the game, but the port is just made way too poorly to make it worth playing on PC. There is no official controller support on PC but it freaks out if you don't have one plugged in. Given it still operates with a controller fine, but all of the on screen button queues are given with keyboard key pictures. The battles seem to run fairly well, but the in world graphics really are bogged down and do not run well. Unfortunately the state of the game is almost unenjoyable on PC even though the game is very good in the long run. If you have a PS3, just pick up the original instead.			"

												About the Story:Haven't played FFXIII but could follow the Story in FFXIII-2 because of the fact that you can read the Story from the first Game in the second from Chapter 1 to 13, which was really great, because the Story in XIII-2 could be a lil bit confusing without if you are really willing to follow the story.About the Collectables:There are 160 fragments which you can get from Sidequests or just by finding them, they will unlock some extra abilities like when you jump, you can jump further by holding the button. The Monster Combat System:You can *catch* some monsters like Tonberry, which will fight beside you and your other team mate. Each monster have different abilities and special abilities, which they will learn by leveling them up via monster materials (different from leveling your characters). You can also infuse a monster with another monster to get them their abilities like +XXXstrength.(This will delete the infused monster, but you can still get it back by catching it again).Linear Gameplay yes/no?:I can pretty much say that this game isn't linear at all, you can do whatever you want to do once you entered the first episode. If you do not want to follow the story part, then you can just do some sidequests or search for items. Of course there are some sidequests which will get unlocked after finishing the game, but still good for people who do not want to follow the story immediatly.Does this game have long time motivation?:In my opinion, this FF is really enjoyable even if you already have beaten the game. I was at the final boss in like 29 hours, but decided to do some sidequests and then beat the boss after a total of 44 hours. Also I already played over 50+ hours after finishing the game, because there are some things like the Coliseum, which can pretty much take your time pretty fast. The bosses there are some well-known FF bosses and are challenging if you do not know or have tactics to defeat them.Also... you can play poker as Sazh... that is.... awesome? :PNegative thingys?:Yes, there is one thing which is negative.Sometimes the FPS goes to like 20...BUT I did and I do not care if it does. You should totally play this game!Overall:Almost 100 Hours of playtime and still 3 bosses left + 7 collectables. Fav. FF so far with FFX :3!			"

DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A BEEFY RIG AND EXPECT SOLID 60 FPSGameplay: 10/10Soundtracks: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Performance: 3/10 (that's for me though)Look,I put the review on postive cause this game is indeed great.There's just one thing I hate but other than that,love the game!Compared to XIII,this one is so fun for you to play with.If you are a serious FF series fan,trust me,you won't stop playing this game.So these things I listed below are based on my opinions and the way the game behave on my PC.PROS:-A lot of episodes.Yep,I believe it would take more than 60 hours of playtime if you're type of person who explore a lot instead of going straight for main quests.-Playing as Serah.That will make you want to play this game more and follow her journey.Add on,we always wanted to play as a very beautiful female character from FF anyway.-Lot of side quests.Once you're in-game,you will see this.Don't ask,cause you will like those quests.-The combat system does improved quite well compared to XIII.-Paradigm pack system.I have set up a great offensive and defensive role for characters from the Customization section-The in-game soundtracks.I'm speechless here.I can't believe that I actually enjoyed it more than I expected,it's just great imo.CONS:During my first time launching the game,I set 4K shadow resolution and MSAA 16.Went in-game and was shocked to see how the FPS dropped to below 10.Checked system requirements,I surpassed the recommened specs.Lowered the specs,still same results.-Using only single-threaded.-The better your pc is,the more FPS drop you could get.(LOL)-Random stuttering if there's lot of effects around you.It's been almost 2 months since the release of this game on PC,yet Square Enix haven't released any patch to allow '60 FPS',fix stuttering and allow multi-threaded CPU to the game.That is the only part‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•me off.All the CONS are from the performance issues,everything else in-game are great.

												TL;DR: It feels like DLC turned in to a full game but there are major improvements/changes that make it interesting enough to warrent a purchase. The graphics seem worse than XIII yet the assets look like they were pulled directly from the previous game. The story is the weaker element, not as good as XIII yet the gameplay improved on everything that was annoying about XIII. It's a good title, it holds up as it's own game but it's not something that will keep you hooked.(I jumped right in to XIII-2 just moments after finishing XIII so comparisons will be made between the two, this review will concentrate on the changes made from XIII to XIII-2 as the games are so similar that if you did like XIII then you will most likely enjoy this.)It feels like DLC turned in to a full game, What i mean by this is that it feels like they had a cool idea to play as Serah in an expansion to XIII but opted to turn it in to it's own game, This is common in the industry (Just take a look at Saints Row 4, it was originally a DLC for Saints Row The Third)With that being said  it IS a fun game to play though at first glance it is misleading, With Lightning's character model and face plastered all over the place it is easy for one to think that she is the focus of the game, she is in a sense but not in the playable kind, she is the starting focus of the story.Serah is your playable character in this game, a long with a boy called Noel. Graphics wise it actually looks worse than the original XIII to me but that could be down to the port itself. Gameplay wise itis more of the same only they scrolled things back a bit in terms of enemy encounters.You can no longer see the enemies in full view as you could in XIII, encounters work on a detection system where enemies will randomly appear as you are running around, you can either try to run or attack them. It's a sort of ballance between the way encounters worked in XIII and how encounters worked in the old school games.The combat system as been revamped somewhat though it does feel a hell of a lot slower (even when using the haste ability) One of the major improvements is ability to switch party leader mid battle, this also means that the battle is not over if your current party leader goes down in battle, it simply switches to the next person so you can continue the fight.The major update though is the addition of monsters, you can now ""Tame"" monsters you encounter (Through no special mechanic, you simply beat a monster and sometimes it will drop a crystal wich adds that monster to your collection) These monsters act as your third party member in combat, each one having a specific role from the same pool of character roles that you saw in XIII.These monsters can not become party leader and have the same behavior as any AI set in whatever role it happens to be in but with a unique twist. every monster has it's own special attack which can be used by incrasing the ""Feral Link"" gauge, this gauge works very similar to the ""Gestalt"" and ""TP"" gauge from XIII. Once full you can activate a special attack which then starts a QTE to determine a damage boost to said attack via a ""Sync Level""How fast you complete the QTE prompts determines your Sync percentage which determines the damage boost for the attack, each monster has it's very own unique attack each with different attributes.The leveling system has also changed a fair bit, the Crystarium is back but in a different way, rather than all roles having their own seperate progression track all roles are now on the same track which i honestly do prefer because ""Builds"" are now a viable option. The Crystarium also expands automatically rather than in key points of the story, once you reach the end of what is currently available the track will then expand, you can then pick a bonus. The bonuses are pretty cool, you can pick a boost the roles you have unlocked, unlock a new role or increase your accessory capacity. The Crystarium is also available for your monsters, though you can not use ""CP"" to upgrade them, instead you use componants to progress them but it still works in the same way..the main difference beign you can not change the role of a monster, each monster has it's own set role an dunique progression track.They made a big change to the way you equip accessories, in XIII you started with one slot and unlocked more as you progressed, here you start with three and can still unlock more except now you have a capacity, each accessory has a number next to it, for example a ring has a value of 55, your capacity is 70, if you want to equip a second accessory you will needd to find one that doesn't go above the remaining capacity, example case being 15. Your capacity can of course be upgrade via the Crystarium expansion bonuses.All in all it is a decen entry, far from being the best and story wise it isn't as good as XIII but Gameplay wise it adds enough new mechanics to edge ahead of XIII. It's worth it for the price, give a try.			"

												Everything about the game that doesn't have to be intriguing was (good graphics, semi-interesting story, good loot system, interesting leveling system, cool allies configuration). However, the one thing I need to be challenging and engaging is combat in an rpg. This game's combat system is too passive and can easily be mastered. After only 11 hours of playing I was near mastery. I could fight any group of enemies (except the bosses) without even thinking about it. This passivity quickly became a nuisance and I found myself without any motivation to complete a game that has a lackluster combat system.			"

												I'd like to enjoy this game, but it has a serious problem with fps, unlike XIII, and it has worse graphics than XIII.  Story is nowhere near comparable to the first.  Loved the first game and was really looking forward to this, but meh.			"

												A great sequel to FFXIII, that improves and expands on FFXIII in some terrific ways. Pros:‚Ä¢ Better Plot: I found the story in FFXIII-2 to be easier to follow than FFXIII's plot. ‚Ä¢ Less Serious Tone: More lighthearted moments throughout the story. Moogle had quite a few funny moments.  ‚Ä¢ Less Linear: There are multiple pathways in most levels with hidden loot. ‚Ä¢ Less Grinding: The harder encounters are usually optional, so you don‚Äôt need to grind as much. ‚Ä¢ More Freedom: Can choose where you want to travel to and what content you want to do. ‚Ä¢ Dialogue Choices: A great addition, that was nonexistent in FFXIII. ‚Ä¢ Great QTE Events: I usually hate QTEs but FFXIII-2 does a good job of making the QTEs feel appropriate, without overdoing it. ‚Ä¢ Interesting DLC: Lightning and Sazh‚Äôs side stories were particularly engaging to play through. Cons:	‚Ä¢ Dull Side Quests: Quest design is not that interesting, and usually involves a lot of backtracking. ‚Ä¢ Limited Characters: There are only 2 characters and 1 monster in your party. This is definitely a step back from FFXIII‚Äôs cast of 6 characters.			"

												Excellent port, I had no issues (except random alt-tab delays).The game itself is worth playing. You talk about hours of content, it has it. After the main storyline is finished you can continue to the toughest challenges, and they are going to require fully leveled, and almost perfectly leveled monsters.It's like pokemon, in that you have to catch monsters, and level them (but through items, not fighting).There will be much grinding after the game is over, but not before. The game is quite forgiving 99% of the time, which means you won't get insta-killed if you mess up.I always enjoyed the ""spend your points to level up"" system, over the ""you level at the end of a fight"" system.Storyline was excellent, I always enjoy a good time-paradox.This was a fun game to play, I am excited to see x-3 which i never played.

This is a mix of generic action anime with a cute girl as protagonist and a rpg. the story at the begining seems too forced, too generic but gets a little better ( i think my expectations were low in 13 so they rised a bit in this game). the battle system is good and versatile, you can change you monster companion to other 2 you have in reserve so you can change your strategy in middle of battle ( as in 13 but more dynamic) each mosnter has its own special ability, but you need to fill a ""friendship"" bar to use it and then a real time secuence to make it more effective.you can customize your monster with several objectos (visual only) and leveling up their skills/capacities and also you can transfer skill from a monster to another making better monsters.. . things i hated of this game was lack of having diferent heroes besides Serah, Noel and a monster you recruit.I HATE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING HATE the performance of this game. for me goes to 30 fps to 1 ( i dont have a great pc but still, i mean ff 13 runs perfect for me at 30 fps) and crashes frecuently ( Gedosato can help with that but expect miracles will crash).in this moment is unplayable for me after a patch ( in wich they removed some dlcs)so, buy this game if you have patience or wanna try luck.

												I've completed most of the main Final Fantasy titles: III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, X-2, XII, XIII and now I'm playing this.Ok, there are my FF player credits. Now I am going to ""rant"" more about this game in-detail. STORY/ART STYLEI wasn't a big fan of the thirteenth instalment in the series. That said, in retrospective, I think I actually like it story-wise more than XIII-2. Why? Because of the time travel element! The wisdom I once heard: ""Usually, when a time travel plot element is involved, it tells that the story writers were desperate."" That seems to be the case in some parts of the story. While the story seems much clearer so far in the game, initially, when you first start, the concept of time traveling seems to do nothing but confuse with all the feeling-based concusions about the future and the past. You are given a simple goal: get from point A to point B, and the ""road"" to there is all tangled up. Sort of.Remember FFX-2? It was supposed (?) to be a direct sequel, sure. However, it was a whole different game! There's sort of a stigma associated with direct sequels to Final Fantasy games and it sure made my expectations lower for this ""direct sequel"", too. The plot? with all the ""kupo! look-at-me-i'm-so-cute"" and some painfully slow and outright boring parts aside, I have so far enjoyed the idea of finding Lightning and untangling the tangles. I think I will finish the game (once). I'm not very fond of the violin-piano-la-la-la-remember-my heart-la-la-female vocalist faintly singing type of a thing, as it seems very ""girly"" or overly romanticized and overused in the universe of FFXIII. I do, however, like few of the battle themes and how the track intensifies when monsters appear on the field.The characters? We see three kind of character behaviour in this game:1) Characters state the obvious. and do it again.2) Characters don't know a thing3) Characters (Serah infamously so) become quantum scientists; they pull wild, speculated theories out of the thin air that turn out to be truth.Usually in the following pattern:  1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 -1 - 1 -1 -1GAMEPLAYWithout a doubt, combat and leveling up are my salt and butter in this game. Just like in FFXIII, I find it satisfactory to level up the crystarium and watching the stats go higher. I like the paradigm system as it makes it possible to ""stagger"" the otherwise ridiculously strong opponents and beat them up with the right set of paradigms.I am not entirely satisfied with few things:Mog throwing? ugh. A nice idea, but the implementation is not quite there.Mog clock? In few places of the game, the enemies ""chase"" you and the mog clock turns red. The problem here is, the enemies are no where to be seen! This means, you are forced into combat with no retry option. How convenient. The gameplay really drags the story in some parts. Some dungeon hallways are so narrow that you are practically forced to fight battles every few meters. The same things with fast and aggressive enemies in some dungeons. Luckily, the dungeons seem short, which seems to balance this out a little.Performance issues: the game seems to lag here and there and the gameplay seems capped at 30fps for the most of it. I am running the game on a decent ""gaming"" rig:i5 3570k @ 4ghzgtx 970 4gb12 gb ddr3 ramThe performance definitely could be better. At 1080P 8x AA, The graphics card barely gets a challenge. Seems like this game is more CPU intensive.And by no means my cpu is a slouch.Long story short: I'm glad I bought it on sale! I SAY DO IT!+ If you're a final fantasy fan (not hardcore level) like me and out of curiosity want to play through the game at least once+ you liked FFXIII+ If you are a hardcore ff fanI SAY NO WAY IN H***- If you are new to the series- if you haven't completed FFXIII prior to playing this7/10 story so far8.5/10 battle system "

Taking the timeline after final fantasy XIII, you control lightning's sister named serah to save the fate of Lightning.So far here's my review:Battle System: So far that I'm played the battle system was a little bit same, but a little bit improved for the enemy encounter system which requires you to attack the enemy if you want to enter the battlefield.+Live trigger: when the cinematic was trigger, sometimes it'll trigger the dialogue branching which you can choose any of the dialogue and you could see the result from it.+More interactive npc and quest: okay admit it, the previous one it was like there was no quest on it, especially the npc it was like there was ""no"" npc on the previous sequel, just some story and story. It all fixed in this sequel where some of the npc can be talked with and asking you a request to accept mission.+Cinematic action: while you're watching some of the cinematic sequence, there's cinematic sequence that requires you to push some of the button that'll be displayed.+Graphics: The graphics was pretty well done. For example I can see the rain drops into the monitor screen while the weather are raining.+Music: One of the famous aspect of this game was the music, it's lovely to hear it especially the battle soundtrack.Overall I rate this sequel 8.5/10 and recommend this if you have play the previous one.

												I didn't like the prequel much, but since ""everybody"" claims this one is better, I decided to take my chances when it was on sale recently.Big mistake!Imo, this one is WORSE. The gameplay isn't that different from FFXIII, but now you have to deall with poor framerates (yes, even on a PC that runs most modern games on ultra with no issues). And you have to listen to the ""music"", which makes nail on blacboard sound pleasant in comparison.Don't know what's going on with Square-Enix, but they've lost the ability to make good games. Nothing playable from them in years, imo.			"

												The port doesn't seem to be too atrocious. I was under the minimum requirements, because I don't have a decent graphics card, but it ran alright at best. I had framerates range from about 10-40, which really sucked at first but I got used to it. The only complaint I have is that the game sometimes crashed for no reason when I was saving, and I'm not sure if that was the game itself or just because my computer sucked, but it happened quite a bit.The story and battle system is a step up from FFXIII for me, and the battle linearity is gone at last. It was a really nice feature to be able to switch your leader at will. I'm really glad I won't be getting a game over screen every time Serah dies.All in all, the story is good, the gameplay is pretty great, and I can't have an actual opinion on the port, since my computer was under the minimum requirements, but I'll assume that was okay as well.

												First off, the hours I have on this game don't reflect how many hours I have actually played. I have hundreds of hours on 13-2 and came to the verdict that 13-2 is in my opinion, the best FF game to date. The storytelling, characters, plot, gameplay, visuals, cutscenes, etc in 13-2 all match up together and form the greatest FF game. I'm not a newcomer to FF either, I've played, and beat FF 5, 6, 7, 8, X, X-2, XI, and even played a bit of XIV. All of which were good in their own way but can't match 13-2's depth and immersion. It's remarkable that we get such a great game on PC and it looks so much better than 360 version.			"

												This game is horrible. I desperately want to like any final fantasy game, but they are all geared towards children I feel like. The recipe to this game is *Click click click click*. Basically world of warcraft. Characters play themselves (literally, you can only control one character, and its a whiney girl). Your friend and companion is a Jonas Brother. If you like the battle systems of FFVI, VII, or X then this game is not for you.			"

												Remember that like any modern Final Fantasy game, you may just hate it at first glance and I respect that decision.TL;DR below.Story-  This story is full of plot-holes and makes no sense.  Final Fantasy XII's story is a Godsend in comparison to this.  Imagine Final Fantasy XIII's story but with time travel that goes against all of the modern time travel conventions.  It is really only there to get the characters together for a new adventure.  You should not be playing this game for the story.Exploration-  While still somewhat linear, there are hidden chests placed throughout the world that you can find.  You are also able to accept quests in the field.  Completion of these quests will cut down on grind time because they give you EXP (Crystarium Points).  You can travel between the different areas of the game in the Historia Crux, a menu showing all of the points of time you can travel to.  This menu allows you to reset areas, battling bosses again and gathering treasures you might have missed.  Enemies show up at random on the field, but you are given a short period of time to run away from them or get an early attack on them.Combat-  In combat, you have a bar that is split into several segments that fills over time.  Battle commands can be attached to the segments of the gauge.  You can choose to use the entirety of your gauge at once, or use moves as the bar fills up.  Serah and Noel can be assigned classes and switch between these classes in combat.  This is where the meat of the battle strategy comes from.  You are able to have a Pokemon-esque monster accompany you in battle.  This monster also has a class which will help balance out your team.  The way the class system works still goes over my head, but I think that combat is enjoyable nonetheless.Optimization- This game will run like garbage on YOUR PC.  I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE A TITAN X, THE GAME IS JUST BROKEN.  EXPECT 30 FPS AT ALL TIMES.TL;DR, like most modern Final Fantasy games you will love it or you will hate it.  The story is meaningless, but the gameplay is enjoyable.6.5/10 mediocre, would bluescreen while playing again.			"

												Does what FF XIII done, but much better. It took away all the linearity from the original and opened up a number of revisitable areas throughout different time periods to add much more replay value. The battle system has somehow been topped too as the speed increased to provide a much more fluid experience. The soundtrack has marginally topped what was already a masterpiece from it's predecessor. One of the best Final Fantasy villains is present here, added to that is a lot of the characters deemed annoying from XIII being matured into much more enjoyable characters in XIII-2. As much as I liked XIII, it's sequel is just superior in almost all elements and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the series or any JRPG in general.			"

												The Final Fantasy 13 series was my first final fantasy game since I didn't have a Playsation. So playing the first and then this one I enjoyed both of them very much. You see characters and places from the first game giving you nestalgia. All I have to say is if you're interested in the Final Fantasy series I definetly recommend the FF13 series. The only issue I had with this game is the fps drops and the gameplay lag. I tried an application that would lock my fps didn't work. I tried one that would remove the files that cap your fps in the final fantasy files. Didn't work. What worked for me is plugging in a controller. I don't know why but the fps lag and in game lag is gone. So if you have a controller (any controller seems to work) then plug it in and play with that. (I have a logitech gamepad F310)Please try this series out its by far my favorite, you won't regret it <3			"

												This game is terribly optimized. I knew it was bad, but since I can run another poorly optimized game (TERA) and as I can run most recent games like DS2 and Skyrim with high settings just fine, I thought that I could stand some framerate dips.So I wait 6 hours for this to download over a slow internet connection, and I start the game. Cutscenes and menus look fine. The first tutorial battles run at a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• 20 fps, but at least it's playable.But then -- The game officially starts and puts me in control of my character. And it was like I was trying to run it on a toaster.COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE. I'm talking 5 fps. I don't understand why this game underutilizes both CPU and GPU so badly? I've scoured the internet for fixed, but it seems like I have wasted money on a game I can probably never play because I can't clock my CPU high enough to get it to a playable state. Is my CPU the best? No. But it fits the minimum reqs and it can run other recent games at buttery smooth framerates so I don't understand why I can't get at least a solid 30 in the beginning of the game, inside a small house, with no other characters on screen.1/10 at least the pre-rendered cutscenes are prettyEDIT: so I cranked all the settings down to the bare minimum and changed the power settings for this game in Nvidia Control Panel to maximum performance. This made it playable @ 30+ fps with some drops, but it's still a shame that it's so poorly optimized.Will update rating when I actually play through the game.			"

The plot? with all the ""kupo! look-at-me-i'm-so-cute"" and some painfully slow and outright boring parts aside, I have so far enjoyed the idea of finding Lightning and untangling the tangles. I think I will finish the game (once). I'm not very fond of the violin-piano-la-la-la-remember-my heart-la-la-female vocalist faintly singing type of a thing, as it seems very ""girly"" or overly romanticized and overused in the universe of FFXIII. I do, however, like few of the battle themes and how the track intensifies when monsters appear on the field.The characters? We see three kind of character behaviour in this game:1) Characters state the obvious. and do it again.2) Characters don't know a thing3) Characters (Serah infamously so) become quantum scientists; they pull wild, speculated theories out of the thin air that turn out to be truth.Usually in the following pattern:  1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 -1 - 1 -1 -1GAMEPLAYWithout a doubt, combat and leveling up are my salt and butter in this game. Just like in FFXIII, I find it satisfactory to level up the crystarium and watching the stats go higher. I like the paradigm system as it makes it possible to ""stagger"" the otherwise ridiculously strong opponents and beat them up with the right set of paradigms.I am not entirely satisfied with few things:Mog throwing? ugh. A nice idea, but the implementation is not quite there.Mog clock? In few places of the game, the enemies ""chase"" you and the mog clock turns red. The problem here is, the enemies are no where to be seen! This means, you are forced into combat with no retry option. How convenient. The gameplay really drags the story in some parts. Some dungeon hallways are so narrow that you are practically forced to fight battles every few meters. The same things with fast and aggressive enemies in some dungeons. Luckily, the dungeons seem short, which seems to balance this out a little.Performance issues: the game seems to lag here and there and the gameplay seems capped at 30fps for the most of it. I am running the game on a decent ""gaming"" rig:i5 3570k @ 4ghzgtx 970 4gb12 gb ddr3 ramThe performance definitely could be better. At 1080P 8x AA, The graphics card barely gets a challenge. Seems like this game is more CPU intensive.And by no means my cpu is a slouch.Long story short: I'm glad I bought it on sale! I SAY DO IT!+ If you're a final fantasy fan (not hardcore level) like me and out of curiosity want to play through the game at least once+ you liked FFXIII+ If you are a hardcore ff fanI SAY NO WAY IN H***- If you are new to the series- if you haven't completed FFXIII prior to playing this7/10 story so far8.5/10 battle system "

												Everything about the game that doesn't have to be intriguing was (good graphics, semi-interesting story, good loot system, interesting leveling system, cool allies configuration). However, the one thing I need to be challenging and engaging is combat in an rpg. This game's combat system is too passive and can easily be mastered. After only 11 hours of playing I was near mastery. I could fight any group of enemies (except the bosses) without even thinking about it. This passivity quickly became a nuisance and I found myself without any motivation to complete a game that has a lackluster combat system.			"

												A great game and sequel to Final Fantasy XIII.The story like any FInal Fantasy is all over the place but also enjoyable. You control two characters in the game Serah and Noel and your third party member is a monster that fights for you and can fill every role you want. The time travel mechanic is fun as you have to go back and forth through time to find ways to get to new time eras.The issue with the PC version is sometimes theres sudden FPS drop and its all over the place. For any Final Fantasy fan I would reccommend this game as you'll get  a ton of play time out of it.			"

												Part 2 of the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy starts off fast and gets right into things. The story is nicely carried over from the first XIII title and is generally presented pretty well. We return to familiar faces, along with some new ones.The story starts off quite confusing and you are given tons of info pretty quickly. It may seem messy at first due to alot of unexplained events and the time travel aspect can mix things up a little further. However time travel in XIII-2 is mostly used as a way to get the game world to be opened up a bit and to move away from the linear direction that was FFXIII, from this point of view its done well and doesnt really pose any issues. As the story goes on it gets really intense, i found myself at the edge of my seat a few times.The graphics for the most part seem to be slightly improved over the first game and are really enjoyable. The battle system is fantastic. Its simular to XIII with a bit of a twist with things like the mog clock, allowing you to start off a battle with haste if timed well. There is also the addition of pets and they act as the third member in your party. The Crystarium System is more streamlined and works really well.The performance for some reason isnt as good as XIII and i find myself getting very varied frame rates, this should not happen on a 4000 dollar PC that was purchased in 2015. Overall its not too much of a problem, however it certainly doesnt go unnoticed and its worth mentioning. Hopefully they improve on this for Lightning Returns.Boss fights feel very rewarding and fun. Encounter mechanics are fresh and interesting, this game has one of the most memorable final boss fights ive experienced in ages. There is a fair amount of grinding needed to be done to down the final boss but nothing too crazy, the progression feels right, they really nailed it here. There is a great addition of skins in XIII-2 that are taken to the next level in Lightning Returns, something that i rate very highly as i love customization in any game.There is a lack of CG cutscenes in XIII-2 i would have liked a little more than the 2 or 3 they did for the game.Overall i found FFXIII-2 to be a fantastic sequel that is a must play for anyone that enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII, you get the chance to delve further into Lightning and Serah's story, I cant wait to jump into Lightning Returns, this might be one of the best game trilogies ive played, infact this game was the reason i will continue to invest my time and money into the franchise and purchase a PS4 to contine the legacy that is Final Fantasy.Would thank Square Enix again and again and again for porting this to PC.9/10 "

												Final Fantasy XIII-2 (FFXIII-2) adalah lanjutan cerita dari FFXIII. Bertema tentang time traveler, Serah bersama Noel berpetualang mengatasi paradox untuk menyelamatkan dunia & menemukan Lightning yang menghilang.Cerita (7/10)Lightning menghilang tepat setelah bertemu Serah, terjebak dalam dunia yang disebut Valhalla. Ingatan tentang Lightning terhapus & semua orang menganggap Lightning tersegel dalam Cocoon bersama Fang & Vanille. 3 tahun kemudian, Serah bertemu Noel dan menceritakan bahwa Lighting ada di Valhalla akibat paradox.Meskipun lanjutan FFXIII, cerita FFXIII-2 benar2 baru, villain baru dan masalah baru.  FFXIII-2 menggunakan konsep yang sebenarnya cukup menarik, time traveler, paradox & paralel universe. Permasalahan cerita di FFXIII-2 benar2 bisa dikatakan lepas dari FFXIII tentang Barthandelus & fal'cie lain.Berbeda dengan FFXIII yang endingnya sudah bisa dikatakan ""selesai"", ending FFXIII-2 benar2 cliffhanger yang membuat saya pribadi mengerutkan dahi sambil berkata dalam hati, ""Kok gini?"" dan tertawa.Sangat terlihat kalau Square Enix benar2 merencanakan FFXIII menjadi trilogy di sekuel kedua ini setelah mendapat banyak kritik pada FFXIII sebelumnya (yang sebenarnya sudah tamat ceritanya).Gameplay (7/10)Sistem battle FFXIII-2 nyaris sama dengan FFXIII, masih memakai konsep crystarium & CP, perbedaannya kini party yang ada cuma 2 karakter (Serah & Noel) ditambah monster yang telah dijinakkan & tidak ada lagi eidolon.Gameplay FFXIII-2 bisa dikatakan lebih bercabang. Tidak seperti FFXIII yang isinya cuma maju terus, kita bebas menentukan dungeon mana yang kita jelajahi dulu. Ada kota seperti layaknya FF sebelumnya, kita tidak lagi beli barang2  di save point tapi kini pada ""mbak2 cosplayer"". :DEnding FFXIII-2 juga bercabang, ending FFXIII-2 ada 10. 1 true ending, 8 paradox ending, & 1 secret ending.Grafis (7/10)Tak ada perbedaan yang cukup signifikan dari segi grafis karena pada dasarnya sama seperti FFXIII, FFXIII-2  ini tidak lebih dari sekedar port game PS3/XBox360.

												As a sequel to XIII, XIII-2 does an excellent job of fixing things that didn't work the first time.  Combat has been smoothed out, the linearity has been mostly eliminated, and now there's a mon collecting thing that combines elements of Pokemon and SMT.  The combat is still fun, and the game is still beautiful, so if that's all you need, look no further.  The story gets messy though, as they tend to do when they start juggling time periods.  The alternate timelines are fun to explore, but good luck understanding Square's version of causality.  Overall, it's brilliantly executed, and an excellent game for RPG fans.			"

												Does what FF XIII done, but much better. It took away all the linearity from the original and opened up a number of revisitable areas throughout different time periods to add much more replay value. The battle system has somehow been topped too as the speed increased to provide a much more fluid experience. The soundtrack has marginally topped what was already a masterpiece from it's predecessor. One of the best Final Fantasy villains is present here, added to that is a lot of the characters deemed annoying from XIII being matured into much more enjoyable characters in XIII-2. As much as I liked XIII, it's sequel is just superior in almost all elements and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the series or any JRPG in general.			"

												When the FFXIII-2 originally came out the game was very questionable. Mainly the multiple endings and paying extra for DLC such as The Requiem of the Goddess to see the true ending of the game. However, all of that is pretty much negligible for the PC version. The game is a major improvement to the original FFXIII. Pros:- switch between Noel or Serah when the party leader's HP hits zero- many customizable monsters for your 3rd party member and unique feral links - Japanese and English voices included- improved battle system- includes all or most DLC that weren't inlcuded in the original release of the game- amazing graphics for its generation- easier to obtain gil Cons:- lots of sidequests- annoying mini games- somewhat dull characters especially voiced in EnglishIf you're a Final Fantasy fan then you should play this game.

												Final Fantasy 13-2 improves a lot of Final Fantasy 13's mechanics and refines the battle system to make it more enjoyable. The battle system breaks away from the traditional turn based system which is a nice improvement in my opinon. While the story isn't as stellar compared to previous Final Fantasy games, it is still interesting to play through. The story repeats similar areas in Final Fantasy 13 which may seem bad at first, but they add a certain freshness to each area making them unique and fun to go through again. The Soundtrack for this game is incredible and is definately one of the better FF soundtracks. There is also a lot of replay value in this game because of the alternate endings, side quests, and monster taming. Also purchasing the game includes most of the DLCs so its a nice bonus to the game. Overall the game is worth picking up for its low price and is fun for advocates and newcomers alike!			"

												I've always been a big fan of Final Fantasy games, even their most recent games. I've purchased VII, VIII, and XIII on Steam. the XIII games have had problems being ported so far, but the problems for XIII have been addressed for the most part, and it runs excellently! XIII-2 on the other hand, runs like a dead raccoon. There appear to be some CPU performance issues due to the game being a port from the PS3 version, with the abnormal CPU they put in that console. The game runs fine out in the world, the minimap instantly reduces fps from 60 to 30, disabling it boosts back to 60 right away. Upon opening the menu to equip items, change Paradigms, etc, the fps drops to a solid 20. I know that fps don't seem too important but with the amount of monsters to scroll through the low fps becomes a pain. Getting to the worst thing, in battle, I don't see fps higher than 15. Upon entering the battle, I have a solid 60 fps, but as soon as the battle menu HUD comes up, it drops and sits at 15, not going lower or higher than that. FFXIII menu also has an effect on fps, but not one this great. At 15fps most battles are not enjoyable, sounds seem lagged at that point and effects take a while to finish, I have attempted multiple fixes but have been unable to correct this problem. According to their specs, I should be able to run this game no problem, but that isn't the case.Don't get me wrong, I love Final Fantasy games, no matter how different each installation may be, but this port in its current state is not worth your money. Save the 20$ until they either fix it, or you buy a thousand dollar intel processor to run it. Here's hoping they correct this problem so I can finish the game myself!My specs:AMD FX-8370NVIDIA GTX 98016GB memory G-SKILL 1600Gigabyte 99XA-UD310,000RPM velociraptor HDD			"

												ProBetter than the port of FF13. Some graphical options, albeit limited.ConThe story is really bad. It's about time travel and it doesn't make sense and it's not presented well to the audience.Serah's motion capture actress plays way melodramatically. Also she is uncanny valley-tier.Battles are strategically mindless. Often, there are only one or two optimal ways to defeat a boss at a certain point if you are normal level... it's like, surprise, there's no practical way to beat this boss without Esuna. Go and grind some monsters until you get Esuna.Battles consist of switching paradigms back and forth to attack or defend, which gets really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing old after the first few times.Battles are an incomprehensible ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•how of random people attacking and interrupting each other with an overload of particle effects. You get to control one character during a battle and just kind of hope that the AI for your allies isn't going to go potato mode.Your character can jump, but the geometry is so bad that you'll constantly get caught on invisible objects.I tried really hard to like this game.

Ada kota seperti layaknya FF sebelumnya, kita tidak lagi beli barang2  di save point tapi kini pada ""mbak2 cosplayer"". :DEnding FFXIII-2 juga bercabang, ending FFXIII-2 ada 10. 1 true ending, 8 paradox ending, & 1 secret ending.Grafis (7/10)Tak ada perbedaan yang cukup signifikan dari segi grafis karena pada dasarnya sama seperti FFXIII, FFXIII-2  ini tidak lebih dari sekedar port game PS3/XBox360.

It's like someone put rum rasin ice cream into a hotpot and force it down your throat ( don't try it. trust me it's really bad ) I personally like KOKIA (singer of Noel's theme song) long before and that might be part of the reason. The music of choice is really good at the most part of story until you get into battle or get on Chocobo.Mini games are fun until you get to like ... 50th times? one of those clock puzzle took me one full hour to solve it ( 13 numbers one ) and there're 3-7 of these on each set of puzzle. BUT !If you considerd the one before this. This is a HUGE improvement. Game can be replayable with alternate ending also part of npcs will react base on who is your party leader. So you can play a few more time and still get a new dialog. Combat is much more deeper with pokemon like system. Less grinding and more on explore side (unless you want something extra like super duper ultimate weapon you will have to farm for it) Story .... story still ..meh but not bad. Most of the part make more sense. plus Serah is 10 times cuter than her sister really fun to be with.			"

												Well, here I am again to review a FFXIII game, this time the direct sequel do the original, Final Fantasy XIII-2 (So creative, no?). Jokes apart. This game`s story starts exactly 3 years after the inccidents on FFXIII, having Serah and Noel Kreiss as the protagonists of the game. The first thing I should point out is, I couldn`t manage to finish the game and see it`s end yet,  why you ask? because the game have the worst kind of flaw to a RPG game and any game, it doesn`t make you want to play it, simply doesn`t. Why do this happen? Well, the concept of time travelling introduced with the story which IS about time travelling, alternative dimensions and etc... is poorly used by the game, making everything confusing and pointless. If you imagine FFXIII-2 as a human body, it wouldn`t have either legs or arms, it`s just the chest and the head! So, my conclusion is: Buy this thing ONLY, I repeat, ONLY if you really want to suffer trying to like this. No, I`m not a hater, I loved FFXIII (Still love tho) and this sequel feels completely unnecessery, and it feels more like a big chunk of ""raw"" ideas if it`s even possible to say something like that. BTW, sorry if I mispelled something xD, probably wasn`t intended.			"

												I want to recommend this game so bad, I played it so much on the PS3 and was happy to add this to my collection on Steam. However, this is an exceptionally bad port. I can tolerate a lot and even more so if it is from the FInal Fantasy franchise, I had no problem with Final Fantasy XIII and I thought this would be at least as good. Unfortunately the optimization is worse. It's like playing the game in slow motion. I have tried stripping down all the graphics options, closing all other apps on my PC and even some suggested hacks to make this game run at a normal speed but it is still aweful. Sadly I can not play this until I get more computing power well beyond the system requirements.			"

												Many things that were not good on the first game got fixed, like paradigm shifting time, party leader death, gear upgrade (which was completely overhauled), linearity of the main plot and most importantly, leveling up / farming is not a waste of time anymore. Unfortunately Lightning is not a playable character despite being stamped all over the game. The monster system is a very interesting addition that I wish did not required so much farming to be played with. Overall it is a good game, plays just like the first one, but not exceptional in any aspect.PS: I hate how the game does NOT allow you to turn off the music!			"

												Final Fantasy games have always been tied together by common motifs: crystals, summons, Chocobos, airships, and Yoshitaka Amano's Klimt-esque concept art. In Final Fantasy 13, both towns and exploration were discarded as extraneous trappings, unnecessary to Lightning's mission or - as it was referred to in the game's terminology - her Focus. In 13-2, however, the towns are back with sprawling areas filled with people to talk to for tackling on side quests. In my opinion 13-2 recaptures what was lost in the series's heritage. 13-2 is a game about time traveling, and multiverses. Searh Farron, the main protagonist of this game, is on a quest to search for her lost older sister, Claire Farron.  The idea of including monsters/pets to have their own development trees and can be named, dressed and even fed other captured monsters in order to inherit their abilities is amazing. The customization of developing your characters on a molecular level, then at a squad composition level, can be immensely satisfying. I run this game on high settings, 1080p at average of 50-60fps; however, the fps dips down to 30 in combat, which is bareable. I wish there were more graphics options to tinker with to make this game, but for a console port it is manageable. 8/10			"

I liken this game more similarly to Chrono Trigger due to the time traveling mechanic (a good thing!) and it adds a lot of complexity and depth to solving puzzles and resolving events. If I were to have any complaints it would be that some elements can be exceedingly grindy trying to farm certain items to level up your party, but it's a minor nitpick at an otherwise amazing game.

												No volume controls.Horrible frame rate on even top end pc's because of poor optimization. The supposed patch did nothing to fix the problem.In many ways this port was lazy, a blatant grab for cash with no responsibility towards the customer.Biggest problem I have is the inability to hear dialogue over the blaring music. In a story driven game, that's pretty important.Edit: In the guides section for this game are a couple guides that will help frame rate issues. It won't eliminate them entirely, but the improvement is pretty significant. Downvote remains as the game is poorly optimized, the fix is to set up your card to match the game, which means the game won't take advantage of high end features and improvements.			"

												FF13-2 tries to fix what FF13 did wrong, and mostly succeeds.Now you can freely travel between all unlocked locations, interact with NPCs, choose what to say (through this wont have any significant effect on the story). Combat got some nice tweaks: you can change leader in a middle of a fight and add almost any monster in your party. But the best part - developers stopped to threat players like idiots and you'll get access to most features almost from the start.Ofcourse there are some bad things. Enemies appear randomly, just like in classic FF games. And some side quests (for example gathering data on all existing monsters) are practically unfinishable without reading guides (another trademark of classic FF games).Story starts exactly where 13 ends so playing prequel before 13-2 is a must (there is a ""beginners primer"" in the main menu, but its hardly enough). So, the story... one of the game's features is time travelling, and its even more confusing (at first) and even more epic than before. There are only 2 main characters this time (instead of 6 in FF13) so developers could develop them better and make player more attached to them. Also Caius is easily the best FF antagonist so far.Conclusion. There are 3 games in ""lightning saga"", 13, 13-2 and lightning returns (13-3). 13-2 is by far the best chapter in this trilogy.			"

												If you found the story of this games predecessor a little convoluted, you're going to want to give this one a miss. This game takes the incredible story of the original (including the lengthy cut-scenes!) and continues it on a path filled with complex time-travel paradoxes which I'm still not convinced make complete sense.Otherwise, it's definitely worth picking up for any fan of the series. I did feel however that the changes made to the battle and crystarium systems were a little unnecessary and didn't work quite as well as those in the original.Despite being a lot more open and free-roaming than the original (which is commonly referred to as a corridor simulator because of its linearity), this game is approximately half the length of the last, but does offer lots of replayability if you so desire.It's also worth mentioning that this game does thankfully contain the advanced graphics options that were recently introduced with XIII, but does unfortunately suffer from the same performance issues manifested in some pretty serious dips in framerate. The game dosn't come anywhere near being considered as unplayable because of it, it's just something to bear in mind if dropping below 60FPS angers you.Overall, a very solid Final Fantasy game overshadowed slightly by its predecessor, but not enough to stop me from being keen to play the finale to the trilogy when it releases on Steam.PS. I'd also recommend finding the guide in the community page which explains how to patch in Serah's character skin from the original to replace the gaudy bikini skin SE for some reason thought was a good idea.

Its totally annoying.  I know its a part of the story and that you have to have monsters to fight SOMEWHERE but I wish they had found a different way to do it lol!

												I was very disappointed with the style of combat. I was hoping for something like kingdom hearts and instead got a bad mix on old school final fantasy. It does all of the battling for you. All that is needed is just somewhat timed buttons press and a shift in battle strategy when needed. Yes to can do so manual stuff but the combat is way too automated for this day and age or at least my taste. You really buy this game for the story and to be honest I would want to watch the movie and not do the grind. Not worth the 9.99 I paid for the game.Some tipIf you are a fan of the style of fight in Final Fantasy I would recommend:-getting a USB Xbox 360 control for your PC (You will have to figure out the controls but it is not hard and everything is mapped)-Had a good graphic card. (It‚Äôs Final Fantasy and this means great visual and you are missing half the game with bad graphics) "

												I got to say, I was really skeptical going into this game, with all the negativity surrounding it, but I was pleasantly surprised by this game, I enjoyed it more than I expected. Almost every complaint towards FFXIII was addressed in this game:-the combat system is almost the same as in FFXIII, but with great improvements.-explorable towns, people to talk to and actual sidequests.The graphics are really amazing considering it's a 2011 game, most of the locations are a sight to behold. The voice acting is excellent. The music is awesome, with a wide range of different tunes. The story may not be the best out there, but it's still fun.All in all it's great experience.The port isn't perfect, it doesn't maintain solid 60 fps, sometimes it will dip to 24~30, but still playable.

												I absolutely love the game, but the port is just made way too poorly to make it worth playing on PC. There is no official controller support on PC but it freaks out if you don't have one plugged in. Given it still operates with a controller fine, but all of the on screen button queues are given with keyboard key pictures. The battles seem to run fairly well, but the in world graphics really are bogged down and do not run well. Unfortunately the state of the game is almost unenjoyable on PC even though the game is very good in the long run. If you have a PS3, just pick up the original instead.			"

												About the Story:Haven't played FFXIII but could follow the Story in FFXIII-2 because of the fact that you can read the Story from the first Game in the second from Chapter 1 to 13, which was really great, because the Story in XIII-2 could be a lil bit confusing without if you are really willing to follow the story.About the Collectables:There are 160 fragments which you can get from Sidequests or just by finding them, they will unlock some extra abilities like when you jump, you can jump further by holding the button. The Monster Combat System:You can *catch* some monsters like Tonberry, which will fight beside you and your other team mate. Each monster have different abilities and special abilities, which they will learn by leveling them up via monster materials (different from leveling your characters). You can also infuse a monster with another monster to get them their abilities like +XXXstrength.(This will delete the infused monster, but you can still get it back by catching it again).Linear Gameplay yes/no?:I can pretty much say that this game isn't linear at all, you can do whatever you want to do once you entered the first episode. If you do not want to follow the story part, then you can just do some sidequests or search for items. Of course there are some sidequests which will get unlocked after finishing the game, but still good for people who do not want to follow the story immediatly.Does this game have long time motivation?:In my opinion, this FF is really enjoyable even if you already have beaten the game. I was at the final boss in like 29 hours, but decided to do some sidequests and then beat the boss after a total of 44 hours. Also I already played over 50+ hours after finishing the game, because there are some things like the Coliseum, which can pretty much take your time pretty fast. The bosses there are some well-known FF bosses and are challenging if you do not know or have tactics to defeat them.Also... you can play poker as Sazh... that is.... awesome? :PNegative thingys?:Yes, there is one thing which is negative.Sometimes the FPS goes to like 20...BUT I did and I do not care if it does. You should totally play this game!Overall:Almost 100 Hours of playtime and still 3 bosses left + 7 collectables. Fav. FF so far with FFX :3!			"

												Many things that were not good on the first game got fixed, like paradigm shifting time, party leader death, gear upgrade (which was completely overhauled), linearity of the main plot and most importantly, leveling up / farming is not a waste of time anymore. Unfortunately Lightning is not a playable character despite being stamped all over the game. The monster system is a very interesting addition that I wish did not required so much farming to be played with. Overall it is a good game, plays just like the first one, but not exceptional in any aspect.PS: I hate how the game does NOT allow you to turn off the music!			"

												I want to recommend this game so bad, I played it so much on the PS3 and was happy to add this to my collection on Steam. However, this is an exceptionally bad port. I can tolerate a lot and even more so if it is from the FInal Fantasy franchise, I had no problem with Final Fantasy XIII and I thought this would be at least as good. Unfortunately the optimization is worse. It's like playing the game in slow motion. I have tried stripping down all the graphics options, closing all other apps on my PC and even some suggested hacks to make this game run at a normal speed but it is still aweful. Sadly I can not play this until I get more computing power well beyond the system requirements.			"

I don't usually write reviews, but people should be aware before purchasing that you're going to be on the edge of your seat the whole game, wondering when (not if, but when) the next crash is coming, and if you'll be able to save first. Every time I stop playing, it's because the game crashes, I lose a bunch of grinding/progress, and I get frustrated and walk away. You'll spend a ton of extra hours in the game, just replaying the same things over and over again, praying that your game doesn't crash.It's a real shame, because the game itself feels fun and interesting.

												Straight away I was blown by how fluid the game ran at full graphics with an i7 processor and Nvidia 750M, but once the cutscene voice over started lagging an incredible amount it was starting to get annoying. However I checked forums and found that updating my graphic card driver fixed the voice over lag significantly, with such little lag I only notice it in long cutscenes and if I pay close attention. Some have complained about in-game lag, and yes, it lags a good amount when too much is happening (especiialy ruinga spell), however for any FF fans this is no where enough of a reason to play this game. They have managed to create a sequel with a completely new feel to it. Though it is technicaly in the same world as FFXIII everything feels different, in a nice and refreshing way. The combat system is similar, though seeing how we had the same combat system for over 9 main FF titles, and this one is only shared with FFXIII, we cant complain at all. The story is amazing, the visuals are compelling, and the game may seem short at first but you quickly realised they have found an ingenious method to make a seemingly linear game into a game almost entirely based on side-quests, all which tie in well with the main plot. If anyone felt disappointed with FFXIII and its linearity, and is scared this may be the same, this sequel redeems its predecessor quite well.			"

I want it to succeed, so my review miiiiight have a hint of bias.In this game you have a sequel to XIII that the fandom has a consensus of hate for. This game was somehow seen as lesser than XIII, and yet it was better than XIII in every way.It had expanded maps, secrets, hidden bosses, super bosses, rpg weapon unlocks, and my only complaints are the narrative and the fact that costumes were for purchase, not unlock. This is a Final Fantasy where you can catch a Chocobo and make it race for you. In a way that looks more stylish than FF7 ever did.Gameplay has been enriched, story eclipses original XIII with use of Caius Ballad, arguably the most illustrious villain in Final Fantasy since Sephiroth, though lacks the primal evil of Kefka Palazzo. I give Final Fantasy XIII-2 a 10/10 go play it.			"

												One of my favorite FFs so far, which was totally unexpected since the reviews seemed mixed and I didn't like XIII that much.Good:- Attention to detail with the plot, which makes a lot of efforts to appear coherent and is a lot more memorable than the one from XIII (which is basically a lenghty ultra linear quest which made no sense and lead nowhere). Of course, it's a time paradox based story so you'll find as many plot holes as you want to, but I'd say the writers watched a lot of Doctor Who and it looks decent enough to be enjoyed.- The main paradox in the story is just great, with a Doctor Who style resolution. Awesome.- Real choices with corresponding alternate endings which make sense. And it's a way to escape your doom if you understand the problems with what the main characters are doing ...- The two main characters are annoying and mean good but don't really know what they are doing. Clever. Lightning on the other hand is the best character from the XIII series by far, and they found a nice way to keep her busy while making her look good.- Good combat system, slightly improved from XIII.- The way the side content is blended with the main story (you have to do side missions at some points in the story, explore timelines a bit randomly, etc).- Lots of side timelines and additional missions.- Lots of content.Bad:- Could use a few more locations and one or two major paradox plots in the main story.- Some important side content is gratuitously hard to find without guides (wild artefacts locations ...).- Too grindy to complete the endgame content.- Confusing character advancement (read guides).- The third character in the party are monsters which can be swapped. Nice, but again too grindy and impossible to use correctly without reading wikis and guides. Although they tried to find something original and it's a decent attempt, a regular character would have been better.- Graphics and textures are a big downgrade from XIII. Less budget (but far better game).- Some technical details.			"

												Definitely better than FFX-2 .... but there are so many better FFs out there. I much preferred FFXIII to the sequel: many moaned that the original was far too linear, which is true, but it had a guiding plot and complex characters with interesting interactions. The sequel suffers from Time Gates (you don't know where/when you're going... means you can have no reason to 'GO' somewhere, you only ever get reasons to 'LEAVE') and only having 2 main characters plus a gimmicky Mog.Quick rundown of the characters:Serah: gets no character development from her supporting role in FFXIIINoel: cross between a cliche of a heartbroken teenager and a cliche of a boy with a fallen hero; neither is developed well. He's protecting Serah because he lost someone and wants to fight Caius because of anger... that's basically everything you get.Mog: ""oh isn't he cute..."" there, desired reaction achieved. Lightning: watch the trailer on the store page, look at the screenshots... that's about 50% of her presence in the entire game. I'd call her role a cameo but then I'd have nothing to say about Snow, Sazh, Vanille, Fang or the Nora gang...Hope: hey look, one of the original main characters made it intot he game in a meaningful way... too bad they took the most irritating of the characters and took him from an angry/lost kid to the ultimate boy genious. I'm assuming I wasn't the only one to miss the groundwork to suggest he wasn't just average intelligence... probably because it isn't there. He doesn't even get any noticeable character development: assume he's just a cliche child genious and you won't go far wrong.In fact Hope's role in this game is simply a lazy plot device... same goes for almost every solution to every part of every section of the game: do random things and the answer to your problem drops straight in your path. If they'd called this ""FFXIII-Deus Ex Machina"" I could have understood that, but as it is I just found it robbed any sort of unifying force to the story.			"

												After finally finding fixes for the issues I was having, I can now easily recommend this game. I'm not stingy about framerate, so playing this game at a steady, unmoving 30fps feels really nice, in comparison to the wonky 10fps-60fps I was having with the framerate unlocker.Here's what I did: I first tried the framerate unlocker, which, as I said, was giving me some rather inconsistent framerate, among several other issues such as lip-sync going off. After that, I used a program called Nvidia Inspector (there's another program called RadeonPro for AMD cards) to limit my framerate to 30fps and v-sync to 1/2 refresh rate. My game was working perfectly after that, though the rain glitch still existed. After picking up the fix for that, I can enjoy the game fully, completely, how it was intended to be played. If you follow those steps, this PC port is definitely the best version of the game. Coming with most of the console version's DLC, and now with Japanese audio (which in my opinion, is vastly superior to the English audio), this game is a great experience that improves upon the original XIII in every way I can think of. While I haven't beaten it yet, the story is great so far, with interesting characters, good graphics, fun gameplay, ear-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ic soundtrack, and fantastic atmosphere. I can see why Famitsu gave this game a 40/40, it's rather incredible. The XIII series is criminally underrated by ""fans"" of Final Fantasy, but if you like JRPGs with high production values and go in with an open mind (the story isn't told to you completely, you have to figure some of it out yourself), you'll like this game a lot.

And that's if you have NVIDIA video cards, I have yet to find a stable fix for AMD cards.

My only complaint is that Lightning takes a back seat to her sister Serah, and an unknown named Noel. But still, a solid game, and would recommend to all FF fans. 8/10			"

												I really don't know what to say with this, aside from ""rushed port"", starting the game normally causes a buzzing sound that will drive you insane trying to play with, fixed that by changing some compatibility settings, only to start having frame issues once the opening sequence ended, followed by the worst issue of all, random crashes of the game. All of these are things I've dealt with in 3 hours, and bear in mind this game has been on Steam for a long time now, so its unlikely to get a fix at this point, also worth noting that if you didn't like FF13, don't torture yourself, I'm not saying the game is bad, in fact it fixes a number of problems most players had with 13, however I know prejudice is a powerful thing, and this game relies a fair amount on its prequel in terms of world building, if you can fix the issues that many players find (I know I've barely scratched the surface here), I would personally recommend this game, though as I said, only if you played, and somewhat enjoyed FF13			"

I liked the previous game better even doe it's almost the same.Now the world is more open and you can walk freely around but there is really nothing else to do except following the storyline...It's still the old roundbased tactical combat system but this time you have less party members, which means not so many combinations.

												This game is terribly optimized. I knew it was bad, but since I can run another poorly optimized game (TERA) and as I can run most recent games like DS2 and Skyrim with high settings just fine, I thought that I could stand some framerate dips.So I wait 6 hours for this to download over a slow internet connection, and I start the game. Cutscenes and menus look fine. The first tutorial battles run at a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• 20 fps, but at least it's playable.But then -- The game officially starts and puts me in control of my character. And it was like I was trying to run it on a toaster.COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE. I'm talking 5 fps. I don't understand why this game underutilizes both CPU and GPU so badly? I've scoured the internet for fixed, but it seems like I have wasted money on a game I can probably never play because I can't clock my CPU high enough to get it to a playable state. Is my CPU the best? No. But it fits the minimum reqs and it can run other recent games at buttery smooth framerates so I don't understand why I can't get at least a solid 30 in the beginning of the game, inside a small house, with no other characters on screen.1/10 at least the pre-rendered cutscenes are prettyEDIT: so I cranked all the settings down to the bare minimum and changed the power settings for this game in Nvidia Control Panel to maximum performance. This made it playable @ 30+ fps with some drops, but it's still a shame that it's so poorly optimized.Will update rating when I actually play through the game.			"

It's about time travel and it doesn't make sense and it's not presented well to the audience.Serah's motion capture actress plays way melodramatically. Also she is uncanny valley-tier.Battles are strategically mindless. Often, there are only one or two optimal ways to defeat a boss at a certain point if you are normal level... it's like, surprise, there's no practical way to beat this boss without Esuna. Go and grind some monsters until you get Esuna.Battles consist of switching paradigms back and forth to attack or defend, which gets really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing old after the first few times.Battles are an incomprehensible ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•how of random people attacking and interrupting each other with an overload of particle effects. You get to control one character during a battle and just kind of hope that the AI for your allies isn't going to go potato mode.Your character can jump, but the geometry is so bad that you'll constantly get caught on invisible objects.I tried really hard to like this game.

												FFXIII-2 is such a good game that it almost makes me like FFXIII in retrospect. Almost.First, let's just get the elephant in the room out of the way: yes, this port is terribly optimized. It may work fine for some, but I played at 30fps with drops, with is really pretty abysmal. The only thing this has over playing on console is resolution and the ability to use the Japanese audio. The Japanese audio, by the way, is fantastic.So now on to the good. I played through FFXIII and really hated the experience by the end and still consider it the worst entry in the franchise. Then this game comes along and basically fixes every problem I had with the original.Combat:- Paradigm switching is now instant! A no brainer change, really, but it changes the pace of battle so much when you don't have to watch the camera stupidly focus in on every party member one at a time for each paradigm shift.- You can now tame wild monsters and have them fight along side you. This not only goes a long way towards offering the player choice in how to compose their party early on, but it's also just a lot of fun finding badass or adorable monsters and taming them.-The game just generally utilizes the game mechanics much more. I was forced to rapidly switch between paradigms and change up my party compositions SO much more than the original.-Boss fights typically include QTE's to finish off the fight. Some might take issue with this but I liked them and it made beating bosses feel really satisfying. Reminded me of Bayonetta.-Enemies no longer appear in the field all the time, but rather randomly show up in circle around you as you walk around. This isn't reeeaaally a positive or negative change, but what IS better is that you now have a dedicated attack button to get the drop on enemies instead of runnung around in circles like an idiot tryng to run into enemies from behind like in the original. -Actually, there is a negative to be mentioned here: difficulty spikes. I have no problem with challenging games but when a section or boss comes out of nowhere and just wipes the floor with you repeatedly it tends to raise an eyebrow. This thankfully only happened to me twice (once in the middle, and then final batshit crazy boss), but it was more than a little annoying.General Gameplay:The original game had you do 2 things and 2 things only: walk forward and fight enemies. FFXIII-2 not only gets you up and running with all the game mechanics MUCH quicker, but generally has a greater amount of variety in it's gameplay, including:- Actual sidequests! And lots of 'em! - NPC's to talk to and interact with! Lots of those too!- Branching pathways and areas that aren't a simple straight line! - Monsters to tame and level up! Fight with a chocobo at your side!- You have an adorable Moogle companion who you can throw (yes, throw) to reach far away treasure. A small but hilarious addition.- The crystarium has been changed. It's still a pretty linear affair, but every time you fill up a full grid or screen or whatever, you can choose a big reward like adding a new section to the ATB guage or even unlocking a new role.Story/characters/world:- I was completely sick of most of the characters in FFXIII by the time I was through with it. Serah and Noel are, thankfully, handled in a much better fashion. I found Serah to be likeable from the get go,  and while her motivations aren't really that deep (""I just want to see my sister again!"") she's characterized really well and her sincerity is really charming. Then Noel is like FF's version of Riku, minus the being a d*ck to the main character part. Both have really solid voice acting whether playing in Japanese or English.- This game is also pretty dark, which might not be what you expect from looking at it. The farther and farther into the future you travel the more hopeless things become. This sense of desperation, to me, is the heart of Final Fantasy.- On a similar note, the time travelling is a lot of fun. Seeing how the world and characters change depending on what time period or even timeline they're in is really interesting. There's a good chance you'll get sick of hearing the word ""paradox"", though. You've been warned.Graphics/sound:- The soundtrack is phenominal. The original certainly wasn't dragging it's feet in this department but I feel like it fell a bit short of pulling off a ""different"" sounding FF score. XIII-2 absolutely pulls it off. The three composers have put together an awesome collection of beautiful tracks ranging from the classic FF sounds, to some more electronically infused numbers and,  best of all, a handfull of tracks that include vocals. The New Bodhum theme alone sets this score apart.- The game's a looker, no doubt about that. Special mention goes to the animation however, as I think Square is really great at animating their characters and especially faces.There is one more negative however, and that's how the game handles it's ending. To see the ""real"" ending you have to play a (thankfully included) DLC chapter that is incredibly tedious and feels entirely divorced from the whole experience. It's weird that Square would get such a huge amount of things right in this game and then bork up the delivery of the ending. Yeah. Just weird.That aside, I can't recommend this game enough. If you already liked the first, then you robably didn't need any convincing anyway, but if you are like me and hated the original, then I have to urge you to give this one a shot. It's not often that a studio puts in this much effort into fixing a game, so when they do I think they deserve to be rewarded.			"

												One minute of Lightning nÃ∂aÃ∂kÃ∂eÃ∂dÃ∂  *cough* -correction transforms.11/10 will watch it again.Although music is kinda ruined everything sometime. For god forsaken hÃ∂eÃ∂lÃ∂lÃ∂ Ã∂bÃ∂rÃ∂eÃ∂aÃ∂kÃ∂sÃ∂ Ã∂lÃ∂oÃ∂oÃ∂sÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂fÃ∂*Ã∂*Ã∂kÃ∂ Ã∂uÃ∂pÃ∂  *cough* some ... reason I have to constantly switch between really soothing soft music and rock version of Chocobo theme. It's like someone put rum rasin ice cream into a hotpot and force it down your throat ( don't try it. trust me it's really bad ) I personally like KOKIA (singer of Noel's theme song) long before and that might be part of the reason. The music of choice is really good at the most part of story until you get into battle or get on Chocobo.Mini games are fun until you get to like ... 50th times? one of those clock puzzle took me one full hour to solve it ( 13 numbers one ) and there're 3-7 of these on each set of puzzle. BUT !If you considerd the one before this. This is a HUGE improvement. Game can be replayable with alternate ending also part of npcs will react base on who is your party leader. So you can play a few more time and still get a new dialog. Combat is much more deeper with pokemon like system. Less grinding and more on explore side (unless you want something extra like super duper ultimate weapon you will have to farm for it) Story .... story still ..meh but not bad. Most of the part make more sense. plus Serah is 10 times cuter than her sister really fun to be with.			"

												A great game and sequel to Final Fantasy XIII.The story like any FInal Fantasy is all over the place but also enjoyable. You control two characters in the game Serah and Noel and your third party member is a monster that fights for you and can fill every role you want. The time travel mechanic is fun as you have to go back and forth through time to find ways to get to new time eras.The issue with the PC version is sometimes theres sudden FPS drop and its all over the place. For any Final Fantasy fan I would reccommend this game as you'll get  a ton of play time out of it.			"

A semi turn-based JRPG game in a form of two persons and one things(?) in your party. First, I must compliment the soundtrack. IT IS THE MASTER PIECES! that is first best thing in game. The second thing is that everything in game flexible then the first one. The story is nice but it is not finished you have to buy Lightning Return in order to continue. (It is spoiled? I think not).

												- Updated -Changed my review to positive, after disabling steam cloud I had 0 issues and was able to play without problems.That aside this was quite enjoyable to play, building your own party from captured monsters, time-travelling storyline which at times does get you a little bit lost but not a bad thing since searching for your next progress point normally leads to discovering more side-quests.It is 'Linear' in a sense like XIII but not as direct, you pick areas to roam but each area is a rather small save a few, and since your jumping time-lines the same areas are re-used but usually with slight changes to surroundings and sceneary.Simply put if you liked XIII then you'll like this, its more of the same just in a slightly different way. :)=== Original Review ===Ive had nothing but trouble with this since I bought it, So far ive had game breaking bugs 3 times, in the form of my save data being completely corrupted and un-usable twice at the same point in the game, and another earlier on.At some point ill proberly attempt one last time before I skip this game completely, It is frustrating since XIII runs fine no issues, and even this when im playing it, I have it in 4K and smooth gameplay, great visuals, no loss of speed.If you want to risk it then go for it, otherwise id say either get this as cheap as possible if you have to know the story, or buy a PS3 copy and play it on that, but I have little faith in these issues ever getting fixed.Supposedly turning off steam cloud sync should stop save data getting corrupted from what i've read but I havent had the motivation to attempt it again as of yet, ill update the review when/if I do and what happened.

												A good game, but a very, very bad PC port.  If you're interested in this game and have a PS3 or 360, i'd recommend playing it on one of those systems.Storyline;An incredibly tragic time-travel based storyline.  It does it very well (in my opinion) and is the strongest game, story-wise, in the Lightning Saga.Gameplay;It has a streamlined, simplified version of FF13's ATB battle system.  Serah and Noel are your two static characters, with your third character being a tamed monster of a fixed role.  You can have up to 3 differnet monsters in your ""Party Pack"" that you can use to make paradigms.  Still a good system, but I prefer FF13's.Difficulty;This is a pretty big one for me.  There's almost no difficulty at all here. The superbosses, as you might expect them to be, aren't a challenge at all.  I came across both of them while doing sidequests with no preperation at all and was able to defeat them with ease.  I didn't even know they were supposed to be ""superbosses."" The only difficulty in this game comes from fighting the poor frame rate and the DLC Colosseum.Music;It has a mix of original songs and songs from FF13.  There are some songs made for 13-2 that are nice, but the majority of them are quite bad.			"

												Remember that like any modern Final Fantasy game, you may just hate it at first glance and I respect that decision.TL;DR below.Story-  This story is full of plot-holes and makes no sense.  Final Fantasy XII's story is a Godsend in comparison to this.  Imagine Final Fantasy XIII's story but with time travel that goes against all of the modern time travel conventions.  It is really only there to get the characters together for a new adventure.  You should not be playing this game for the story.Exploration-  While still somewhat linear, there are hidden chests placed throughout the world that you can find.  You are also able to accept quests in the field.  Completion of these quests will cut down on grind time because they give you EXP (Crystarium Points).  You can travel between the different areas of the game in the Historia Crux, a menu showing all of the points of time you can travel to.  This menu allows you to reset areas, battling bosses again and gathering treasures you might have missed.  Enemies show up at random on the field, but you are given a short period of time to run away from them or get an early attack on them.Combat-  In combat, you have a bar that is split into several segments that fills over time.  Battle commands can be attached to the segments of the gauge.  You can choose to use the entirety of your gauge at once, or use moves as the bar fills up.  Serah and Noel can be assigned classes and switch between these classes in combat.  This is where the meat of the battle strategy comes from.  You are able to have a Pokemon-esque monster accompany you in battle.  This monster also has a class which will help balance out your team.  The way the class system works still goes over my head, but I think that combat is enjoyable nonetheless.Optimization- This game will run like garbage on YOUR PC.  I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE A TITAN X, THE GAME IS JUST BROKEN.  EXPECT 30 FPS AT ALL TIMES.TL;DR, like most modern Final Fantasy games you will love it or you will hate it.  The story is meaningless, but the gameplay is enjoyable.6.5/10 mediocre, would bluescreen while playing again.			"

I just dont like how long the cinimatics take and this random monster pop up thing where you will be running along and every few seconds a set of monsters pop up out of nowhere to interupt what you are doing.  Its totally annoying.  I know its a part of the story and that you have to have monsters to fight SOMEWHERE but I wish they had found a different way to do it lol!  Otherwise, very pretty game and worth buying at a sale price.			"

												I was very disappointed with the style of combat. I was hoping for something like kingdom hearts and instead got a bad mix on old school final fantasy. It does all of the battling for you. All that is needed is just somewhat timed buttons press and a shift in battle strategy when needed. Yes to can do so manual stuff but the combat is way too automated for this day and age or at least my taste. You really buy this game for the story and to be honest I would want to watch the movie and not do the grind. Not worth the 9.99 I paid for the game.Some tipIf you are a fan of the style of fight in Final Fantasy I would recommend:-getting a USB Xbox 360 control for your PC (You will have to figure out the controls but it is not hard and everything is mapped)-Had a good graphic card. (It‚Äôs Final Fantasy and this means great visual and you are missing half the game with bad graphics) "

												Excellent port, I had no issues (except random alt-tab delays).The game itself is worth playing. You talk about hours of content, it has it. After the main storyline is finished you can continue to the toughest challenges, and they are going to require fully leveled, and almost perfectly leveled monsters.It's like pokemon, in that you have to catch monsters, and level them (but through items, not fighting).There will be much grinding after the game is over, but not before. The game is quite forgiving 99% of the time, which means you won't get insta-killed if you mess up.I always enjoyed the ""spend your points to level up"" system, over the ""you level at the end of a fight"" system.Storyline was excellent, I always enjoy a good time-paradox.This was a fun game to play, I am excited to see x-3 which i never played.

												I absolutely love the game, but the port is just made way too poorly to make it worth playing on PC. There is no official controller support on PC but it freaks out if you don't have one plugged in. Given it still operates with a controller fine, but all of the on screen button queues are given with keyboard key pictures. The battles seem to run fairly well, but the in world graphics really are bogged down and do not run well. Unfortunately the state of the game is almost unenjoyable on PC even though the game is very good in the long run. If you have a PS3, just pick up the original instead.			"

												About the Story:Haven't played FFXIII but could follow the Story in FFXIII-2 because of the fact that you can read the Story from the first Game in the second from Chapter 1 to 13, which was really great, because the Story in XIII-2 could be a lil bit confusing without if you are really willing to follow the story.About the Collectables:There are 160 fragments which you can get from Sidequests or just by finding them, they will unlock some extra abilities like when you jump, you can jump further by holding the button. The Monster Combat System:You can *catch* some monsters like Tonberry, which will fight beside you and your other team mate. Each monster have different abilities and special abilities, which they will learn by leveling them up via monster materials (different from leveling your characters). You can also infuse a monster with another monster to get them their abilities like +XXXstrength.(This will delete the infused monster, but you can still get it back by catching it again).Linear Gameplay yes/no?:I can pretty much say that this game isn't linear at all, you can do whatever you want to do once you entered the first episode. If you do not want to follow the story part, then you can just do some sidequests or search for items. Of course there are some sidequests which will get unlocked after finishing the game, but still good for people who do not want to follow the story immediatly.Does this game have long time motivation?:In my opinion, this FF is really enjoyable even if you already have beaten the game. I was at the final boss in like 29 hours, but decided to do some sidequests and then beat the boss after a total of 44 hours. Also I already played over 50+ hours after finishing the game, because there are some things like the Coliseum, which can pretty much take your time pretty fast. The bosses there are some well-known FF bosses and are challenging if you do not know or have tactics to defeat them.Also... you can play poker as Sazh... that is.... awesome? :PNegative thingys?:Yes, there is one thing which is negative.Sometimes the FPS goes to like 20...BUT I did and I do not care if it does. You should totally play this game!Overall:Almost 100 Hours of playtime and still 3 bosses left + 7 collectables. Fav. FF so far with FFX :3!			"

												While a lot of people would write off the entire FF13 trilogy, this game is one of my favorite RPGs, and many people never gave it a chance because of the first game in this series. The game is just pure fun, exploring through locations and flying through the timeline. The combat system is fairly lax, with you essentially swithing strategies throughout a fight instead of picking individual moves to use (though you do that sometimes as well, especially for boss fights). The game also features a Pokemon esque monster capturing and leveling system, with less emphasis on catch em all and more emphasis on get the strongest.This isn't a game for the hardcore, meticulously plan and grind rpg fans, but it is a great game to chill out and kill giant monsters through the timeline with a typically wierd JRPG story. And I love it.			"

												I hesitated to buy this game after reading some many reviews citing all kinds of problems with the port. I am happy to say that I have not exerpeinced any problems. I do not have a very powerful computer and am comfortably able to run it between 25-30 fps, which for me is fine. It doesn't stutter and it hasn't crashed yet. In terms of gameplay it seems very similar to FFXIII. Being able to jump, change outfits, and have a bit of choice in some conversations is quite nice, however, there are quicktime events, so make of it what you will. I just finished beating FFXIII, and so far the game has a very similar feel. The world does seem a lot more open, but I haven't played enough to be certain yet. I bought it for $10 during the Winter sale, and for that price I would recommend it. If you enjoyed FFXIII I think you will enjoy this game.			"

												The Final Fantasy 13 series was my first final fantasy game since I didn't have a Playsation. So playing the first and then this one I enjoyed both of them very much. You see characters and places from the first game giving you nestalgia. All I have to say is if you're interested in the Final Fantasy series I definetly recommend the FF13 series. The only issue I had with this game is the fps drops and the gameplay lag. I tried an application that would lock my fps didn't work. I tried one that would remove the files that cap your fps in the final fantasy files. Didn't work. What worked for me is plugging in a controller. I don't know why but the fps lag and in game lag is gone. So if you have a controller (any controller seems to work) then plug it in and play with that. (I have a logitech gamepad F310)Please try this series out its by far my favorite, you won't regret it <3			"

And that's if you have NVIDIA video cards, I have yet to find a stable fix for AMD cards. At this point I'm willing to just play FFXII-2 at a stable 30fps (which is mediocre) or just not play it at all.The Xbox controller does not work properly through the PC with this game. The buttons become unresponsive whenever you go through menus and you'll have to spam your left trigger for 5 seconds just to enable it.FPS hits <10 when enemies spawn/ 10			"

												This game is amazing. The battle system is almost the same as 13. but has added monster training as a third party member instead of another character. They also introduced dialogue options. Overall the level design is much better as they are way less linear and more interesting. Not to mention there is time travel and a ton of sidequests and alternate paradox endings to explore and find. The game has way more replayability than 13 and is a pretty big improvement on an already great game. English voice acting is still bad so I reccomend setting Japanese audio in the launcher.The ONLY DOWNFALL of this game is severe framedrops. Overall during battle my game plays @60fps but some specific cutscenes where 10fps. Most cutscenes and exploration played at 40-60 fps with a lot of fluxuations. And there is a mod/patch someone made but it actually makes the framerate worse in some areas and some areas it does nothing. Also I have to get a patch for an Xbox One controller to work, but 13 had the same problem as well. (that's not too big of a deal though)I honestly don't mind the optimization issues becasue its a great game either way, and honestly it probably still runs at a hgher framerate than the console versions so it's better in that aspect anyways.

												First things first, if you didn't like Final Fantasy 13, odds are you aren't going to like this one much.  Being part of a trilogy, you can expect to see similar things like people and lore.  If you did enjoy the first one, odds are you'll enjoy this.  I actually found Serah pretty annoying for most of the first game, but she's much better in this one. The same battle system returns, though improved I think.  The biggest improvement in this game to me is that they removed the annoying paradigm shift animations from the first game.  If you played FF 13, you likely remember these.  The music and graphics are still great, also.  The story is good, but it relies heavily on time travel, so you can expect it to be complicated. Overall, I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable game.  I only hope Lightning Returns wraps everything up nicely.			"

												I am basing this review mostly on the ps3 version of the game. I personally enjoyed this game. It was head and shoulders above the 13. A much faster combat system, a much better villain, and less characters to complicate the narritive. It is also not as linear as 13 was. My only complaint is that Lightning takes a back seat to her sister Serah, and an unknown named Noel. But still, a solid game, and would recommend to all FF fans. 8/10			"

												I do not recommend getting this port. I bought it when I upgraded my system to a 8-core AMD FX 8350 at 4.0GHz, 8GB of RAM, and an NVidia GeForce 750. This game runs like trash. Don't let the cinematic framerate throw you off, because as soon as the actual game begins, you will not get a consistent framerate, and I've had maybe 20fps at best.The original XIII runs the smoothest out of the three titles, with XIII-3 being a runner-up. I do not see Square Enix releasing any sort of patch or fix to the game to fix the poor porting, so I recommend spending your $19.99 elsewhere.			"

												DO NOT PURCHASE THE PC VERSION OF THIS GAME... YOU ARE MUCH BETTER OFF GETTING A USED COPY OF THIS GAME ON A XBOX 360 OR PS3 CONSOLE FOR CHEAP INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Note; I am not writing a negative review towards the game itself. From what I played so far with my few hours in this version, it's actually quite GREAT!! Obviously, the game takes place after the events of the Final Fantasy XIII and takes the original concept of XIII's game play and well... Pretty much sets it on fire.It throws away the linearity seen in the original and makes it entirely open and free to explore (although personally I didn't mind linearity at all.. And imho it actually fits the stories theme but that's just my personal preference.) as well as adding some new features to what's an already great combat system... One of the new features being is that you can now have POKEMON ON YOUR TEAM!!! ...erm, I mean monsters of course...BUT....There is just one thing wrong with this...IT'S THE PORT OF THIS GAME.. IT‚ÄôS GOD AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!! I was able to run the original game just fine with some minor issues here and there, but nothing too serious and was an overall enjoyable experience for me. However with this game, it runs terrible even though graphically the game is NOT any different as the orginal!! I keep on getting CONSTANT frame rate drops left and right, yet when I explore in some areas the frame rate runs buttery smooth. IT MAKES NO SENSE???Not only that, but the port also LACKS graphic options. The only options are just resolutions and anti-aliasing. SERIOUSLY!?!? This port is so bad that I had to download patches for the game that was made by the community, but even then the game still ran terrible. I understand that porting console games onto the PC is no easy task, but seeing this coming out from SE, this is unacceptable. I had to watch a ""movie"" version of this game onto YouTube instead, and it really made me sad seeing as how I'll never get the chance of actually playing this game.. Which is a huge let down.What's even worse is that this port has been out for an ENTIRE YEAR... AND SE HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT!!!!Like I said, just get the console version of this game, or watch a ""movie"" version of this game like I did on YouTube. Some people have been able to run this game smoothly but I wouldn‚Äôt bet my money on it.. Trust me, it's not worth a single penny..			"

												While I personally felt largely positive towards Final Fantasy XIII, this installment in the XIII series has left me feeling mostly frustrated and disappointed. Lightning was the focal point and poster girl of XIII but this time around you instead play as her sister Serah. Normally I‚Äôd have no problem with the idea of a spin off focusing on a different character however Serah was probably one of the least interesting characters in the original game and I was never really thinking ‚ÄúHey, I sure would like to play as her‚Äù. Unfortunately the supporting cast is pretty lacking and the second member of your party ‚ÄúNoel‚Äù is nothing to write home about either. This also leads me to my next problem with XIII-2 which is that you only have two members in your party (the third slot being allocated to a monster of your choice). The plot is one of the most convoluted and dull time travel stories I‚Äôve yet to see in a long while and at no point did this installment really ever feel warranted to me. The gameplay and progression is changed up a bit this time. The much criticized linearity of XIII has been somewhat remedied by adding branching levels which gives the player more options as to how they‚Äôd like to progress. The levels mostly feel pretty empty and dull with some nice scenery here or there. Lifeless npc‚Äôs inhabit most of them providing lackluster side quests to keep you from progressing too quickly. My biggest grievance however is that this port does not feel like it was given very much love or care. Your mileage may vary but even after installing an unofficial patch I suffered a lot of frame drops and low fps in the open world segments (however menus and battles mostly remained smooth). This doesn‚Äôt seem excusable when my PC is capable of running games like GTAV and The Witcher 3 on reasonably high settings at consistent frame rates. I was fortunately able to tough it out through most of the slower segments of the game. I should probably mention what I actually did like about the game. You get a lot of the same quality scenery and pretty cutscenes that you should be familiar with from XIII. It‚Äôs got the same easy and action based combat that I enjoyed from the last installment. The music is varied from the usual pretty tunes you expect from Final Fantasy to some perplexingly strange songs (Wild Chocobo theme, anyone?). The game doesn‚Äôt seem to always take itself too seriously which is fine by me. Be ready for some goofy anime nonsense. I could only really recommend this game on very particular circumstance. While this review is mostly negative I did however enjoy a good portion of my time with it and for the price I felt satisfied. It‚Äôs a pretty bad port and I‚Äôd imagine most wouldn‚Äôt have the patience to complete the game because of this. If the performance was improved I‚Äôd easily recommend it on the basis of an impulse buy during a sale however you may just be better off skipping this installment. There‚Äôs a lot of better Final Fantasy games on Steam.  "

												Bought this back on the PS3 when it first came out but couldn't get into it. Tried it again a few years later, pushed past the slightly dull opening few hours and now can't put it down. It's an interesting concept: travelling through time to try to change history, visiting alternate versions of the same places on different timelines - as well as the obligatory 'save the world' theme. Sure, it still has that slght repetitiveness that FFXIII had, but this time the world at least feels more open and not so much a 'walk down this corridor and fight lots of enemies ad infinitum' feel that its predecessor had.I know there are meant to be issues with the port, and my FPS fluctuates wildly between 20-60 all the time, but I can't say I've actually noticed any difference when it does (i.e. lagging or screen-tearing), so can't comment on the actual issues themselves.All in all, this is a more interesting game than FFXIII (minus some of its most interesting characters in Lightning and Fang, for me) and I'm looking forward to completing it so I can finally play 'Lightning Returns'. Even if you got bored of XIII, I'd recommend giving this a go, especially for the sale price.			"

												I would say this episode is a really well made game, even I just play for like 50 minutes. For some people; this story might not be interesting, but it still have some fun parts to play with. I'll give it some examples:- First of all, one thing is not going change is this game has an excellent graphic, no doubt it. I can adjust the screen size resolution same as FF13 Lightning Returns up to 1920x1080p and shadow resolution up to 8120x8120 before the game starts, which is really high definition. I found when I put my shadow resolution into 8120x8120, everthing seems like too lagging, almost gone to frozen. I was not able to turn off game, then started panicking. After like 10 minutes, I shut down my PC and restarted again. Listen carefully, I can hardly to move the mouse to the shut down button. I found myself quite silly sometime, I should have made sure my PC can run that level before I go to adjust the resolutions. As a result, I just wanted to find that setting how high resolution my PC can handle itself.One thing I would like to suggest is making a game on a PC should have an Exit button, then player can go exit the game easily rather than clicking the window tab to go out to the window bar and close the game app or going into Steam app to play a game and closing the game on Steam app. Just my opinion sharing.- Second of all, I want to be clear I am not a spoiler, I just want to talk about the battle combat in this episode. In this episode, the battle combat still keep the old version of the function the most which I feel a bit not functional like Lightning Returns, it would be good to have some movements controling by the players, let players feel they're actually controling what Lightning is going to move next. At the same time, I found a new battle combat, which was Cinematic Actions"". I found Cinematic Actions quite fun to play with, it's also about testing how fast you can react. I think Cinemtic Actions makes you more exciting and what makes players to expect something that is cool and fun would happen. I have a thought of this Cinematic Actions, if this could put it into Final Fantasy 7, to me I think, it would be really epic! Myself quite like this kind of cinematic actions, it is also really making a game come to life. People like playing something different, such as something interact something move by using hand or joypad button or mouse, & VR Gear.- At last, this game is not bad, it has a lot of things and fun stuff to play. As usual, I would recommend this game to my friends! Thanks the director and the group of game developers for making this three long episodes for every player here included me! I really appreciate it! Glad I have bought this game! Keep making great games!			"

												+ Music is good+ Graphics are fine- Combat system is boring or annoying, it is very simple hence why they did it in real time, however when you need some specific actions to be done, you are basically sent straight to hell since there is no way to pause the game while you browse the various menus- You cannot create your own party and you are stuck with the same 2 characters- You can tame monsters... however the varieties are very limited - Progression system is horrible, everything is automatically selected for you. Everything has been made so that it is impossible for you to accidently screw up your game hence why it does not take much brain.- Story is okay-ish, however there is a lots of little points which just felt like they were fixed together without any proper thoughts.- Dialogs / Interactions often include choices which are absolutely meaningless- Cinematics have quick time events.- They tried to randomized the encounter by spawning the monsters right into your face but this is just as bad and can create issues are times.- The game crashed due to Steam cloud, fixed it by disabling it for the game but these kind of thing should simply not happen on a finished product.Please do yourself a favor and play Chrono Cross, Star Oceans or probably any other RPGS instead of wasting your time on this game. I already poured a lot of time to learn the various aspects of the game since they don't unlock everything for you straight away and I will probably continue until I have finished this game since I like to complete what I start however let me tell you that it is far from being fun. The game doesn't even need grinding and that's usually the bad parts of JRPGS.			"

												Heyyo,[Update December 29, 2015]I've decided to change my review to not recommended. The framerate issues due to HUD messing up the framerate still not fixed? Meh, Square Enix doesn't bother polishing their PC ports. Even Lightning Returns has framerate issues apparently, just not nearly as bad as this or FFXIII but bad enough that most reviews seem to mention it.This game? I'm on the fence... it's a decent RPG... but yet again? Square Enix ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ED UP THE PORT! Yeah I can select screen resolutions, MSAA and Shadow Resolutions... but the framerate... oh man, it just SUCKS how much it flops between 60fps animations and 30fps animations... and how the Heads Up Display (menus and the Action Time Bar) is the main issue of the framerate never reaching 60fps in combat! Outside of combat? Disabling the minimap improves framerate!! WHY DOES THE 2D HUD CAUSE MY FRAMERATE TO TANK SO HARD!?The best solution I've found is to unlock the fps via a .exe mod discovered by FF community members and then forcing a 30fps cap. It at least keeps the frame time variance quite leveled so at least the game doesn't have such terrible framerate stuttering.

												The game itself isn't bad - the gameplay is pretty great. Fast paced combat and  semi-non-linear exploration (a major plus given XIII's hallway simluator) manage to carry the game's nonsensical story. However, as a PC port, I can't recommend it. The advertised 60 FPS is a joke.Even on a GeForce GTX 950 (way beyond the recommended specs) I can't maintain even a steady 30 FPS. When the spells start flying in combat, FPS goes from a chaotic 60 down into the 20s. It's unplayable - I bought the PC version for a stable, smoother experience than the console version and I didn't get that at all. Good game, bad port.			"

And I love the timelines and time travelling stuff.If you enjoyed FFXIII, i HIGHLY recommend you getting a copy of this game. "

												I gotta say I like it so far. After three hours it's got my attention better than FF13. I like how the maps aren't just linear with small pockets that obviously hold item chests. I like the NPC interaction, even if it is just flavor. Overall, I think the addition of more explorable map areas is a vast improvement over FF13.My only beef is the controller. It says Partial Controller supprt, but I can play just fine with my controller... Except my left stick doesn't work, gotta use the D-pad. X=A. A=B. B=X. Y=Y.  LB and LT equal LB and RB, not sure which is which. Rt is RT, not sure what RB is or does yet.The controller misfires aren't that big a deal, once you figure them out, they might‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•you off at the start, but once you get them down, it's alright. Haven't really had any framerates issues, a stutter here and there, but nothing I'm gonna get up in arms about.Overall I like this better than 13. Story is more engaging, world is more explorable, I just got into the meat and potatoes, if you will, of the combat, and I like it better. I like how the general combat system is the same, but the third party member tweak, and tuning, are what make it awesome. Graphics and soundtrack are pretty much what you would expect from a Final Fantasy title. In a word, Amazing.I'd give it 9/10 based on the three hours I've played so far. This review, and that rating are both subject to change. The controller thing is a pretty big minus, even though it's pretty easy to adjust to.Edit 03/09/16: I love the monster system. The way they worked it into the Paradigm System, effing awesome. It let's you focus teh PC's one one or two roles, then use a Monster you've levelled to pick up the slack. On my first playthrough, I've got the PC's doing a Main Role and Secondary Role. Like I'm leveling Raveger har, and Sabateur a little on one. The other is Commando and Sentinel. I might put a little Synergist on the second one, don't know if or wehn I'll get a monster that can buff.In short, six hours in, I EFFING LOVE this game. I haven't had a game grab me like this since Fallout 3. I have to force myself to stop playing so that I can go to bed for work the next day.			"

I tried overclocking my Graphicscard to get some better results, but nothing changed ... it's just a really really bad port. I even daubt the game uses the Graphicscard, since NOT even over/under clocking changed the Framerate.			"

												Heyyo,[Update December 29, 2015]I've decided to change my review to not recommended. The framerate issues due to HUD messing up the framerate still not fixed? Meh, Square Enix doesn't bother polishing their PC ports. Even Lightning Returns has framerate issues apparently, just not nearly as bad as this or FFXIII but bad enough that most reviews seem to mention it.This game? I'm on the fence... it's a decent RPG... but yet again? Square Enix ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ED UP THE PORT! Yeah I can select screen resolutions, MSAA and Shadow Resolutions... but the framerate... oh man, it just SUCKS how much it flops between 60fps animations and 30fps animations... and how the Heads Up Display (menus and the Action Time Bar) is the main issue of the framerate never reaching 60fps in combat! Outside of combat? Disabling the minimap improves framerate!! WHY DOES THE 2D HUD CAUSE MY FRAMERATE TO TANK SO HARD!?The best solution I've found is to unlock the fps via a .exe mod discovered by FF community members and then forcing a 30fps cap. It at least keeps the frame time variance quite leveled so at least the game doesn't have such terrible framerate stuttering.

												I hesitated to buy this game after reading some many reviews citing all kinds of problems with the port. I am happy to say that I have not exerpeinced any problems. I do not have a very powerful computer and am comfortably able to run it between 25-30 fps, which for me is fine. It doesn't stutter and it hasn't crashed yet. In terms of gameplay it seems very similar to FFXIII. Being able to jump, change outfits, and have a bit of choice in some conversations is quite nice, however, there are quicktime events, so make of it what you will. I just finished beating FFXIII, and so far the game has a very similar feel. The world does seem a lot more open, but I haven't played enough to be certain yet. I bought it for $10 during the Winter sale, and for that price I would recommend it. If you enjoyed FFXIII I think you will enjoy this game.			"

												After finally finding fixes for the issues I was having, I can now easily recommend this game. I'm not stingy about framerate, so playing this game at a steady, unmoving 30fps feels really nice, in comparison to the wonky 10fps-60fps I was having with the framerate unlocker.Here's what I did: I first tried the framerate unlocker, which, as I said, was giving me some rather inconsistent framerate, among several other issues such as lip-sync going off. After that, I used a program called Nvidia Inspector (there's another program called RadeonPro for AMD cards) to limit my framerate to 30fps and v-sync to 1/2 refresh rate. My game was working perfectly after that, though the rain glitch still existed. After picking up the fix for that, I can enjoy the game fully, completely, how it was intended to be played. If you follow those steps, this PC port is definitely the best version of the game. Coming with most of the console version's DLC, and now with Japanese audio (which in my opinion, is vastly superior to the English audio), this game is a great experience that improves upon the original XIII in every way I can think of. While I haven't beaten it yet, the story is great so far, with interesting characters, good graphics, fun gameplay, ear-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ic soundtrack, and fantastic atmosphere. I can see why Famitsu gave this game a 40/40, it's rather incredible. The XIII series is criminally underrated by ""fans"" of Final Fantasy, but if you like JRPGs with high production values and go in with an open mind (the story isn't told to you completely, you have to figure some of it out yourself), you'll like this game a lot.

This is a mix of generic action anime with a cute girl as protagonist and a rpg. the story at the begining seems too forced, too generic but gets a little better ( i think my expectations were low in 13 so they rised a bit in this game). the battle system is good and versatile, you can change you monster companion to other 2 you have in reserve so you can change your strategy in middle of battle ( as in 13 but more dynamic) each mosnter has its own special ability, but you need to fill a ""friendship"" bar to use it and then a real time secuence to make it more effective.you can customize your monster with several objectos (visual only) and leveling up their skills/capacities and also you can transfer skill from a monster to another making better monsters.. . things i hated of this game was lack of having diferent heroes besides Serah, Noel and a monster you recruit.I HATE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING HATE the performance of this game. for me goes to 30 fps to 1 ( i dont have a great pc but still, i mean ff 13 runs perfect for me at 30 fps) and crashes frecuently ( Gedosato can help with that but expect miracles will crash).in this moment is unplayable for me after a patch ( in wich they removed some dlcs)so, buy this game if you have patience or wanna try luck.

												I bought this because Final Fantasy XIII wouldn't start at all on my PC. It was somewhat of a relief then, that it actually started.  Not disappointed with the game at all, because it is definitely living up to the FF saga I know and love.The graphics are incredible, compared to playing FF7 on a PS1 and FFX on a PS2.  Battles have similarities to the previous games, with some nice improvements such as paradigm shift - a setting that allows you to change your party's battle strategy mid battle.  The controls are clumsy, as you'd expect for a PC port; it seems weird not to get the map by pressing 'M' for example, but accepting that this is how it will be played, doesn't detract from the enjoyment.This is a must have for Final Fantasy fans, and a playable game for those new to the franchise.  Recommended!			"

												The port doesn't seem to be too atrocious. I was under the minimum requirements, because I don't have a decent graphics card, but it ran alright at best. I had framerates range from about 10-40, which really sucked at first but I got used to it. The only complaint I have is that the game sometimes crashed for no reason when I was saving, and I'm not sure if that was the game itself or just because my computer sucked, but it happened quite a bit.The story and battle system is a step up from FFXIII for me, and the battle linearity is gone at last. It was a really nice feature to be able to switch your leader at will. I'm really glad I won't be getting a game over screen every time Serah dies.All in all, the story is good, the gameplay is pretty great, and I can't have an actual opinion on the port, since my computer was under the minimum requirements, but I'll assume that was okay as well.

The gameplay isn't that different from FFXIII, but now you have to deall with poor framerates (yes, even on a PC that runs most modern games on ultra with no issues). And you have to listen to the ""music"", which makes nail on blacboard sound pleasant in comparison.Don't know what's going on with Square-Enix, but they've lost the ability to make good games.

												FFXIII-2 is such a good game that it almost makes me like FFXIII in retrospect. Almost.First, let's just get the elephant in the room out of the way: yes, this port is terribly optimized. It may work fine for some, but I played at 30fps with drops, with is really pretty abysmal. The only thing this has over playing on console is resolution and the ability to use the Japanese audio. The Japanese audio, by the way, is fantastic.So now on to the good. I played through FFXIII and really hated the experience by the end and still consider it the worst entry in the franchise. Then this game comes along and basically fixes every problem I had with the original.Combat:- Paradigm switching is now instant! A no brainer change, really, but it changes the pace of battle so much when you don't have to watch the camera stupidly focus in on every party member one at a time for each paradigm shift.- You can now tame wild monsters and have them fight along side you. This not only goes a long way towards offering the player choice in how to compose their party early on, but it's also just a lot of fun finding badass or adorable monsters and taming them.-The game just generally utilizes the game mechanics much more. I was forced to rapidly switch between paradigms and change up my party compositions SO much more than the original.-Boss fights typically include QTE's to finish off the fight. Some might take issue with this but I liked them and it made beating bosses feel really satisfying. Reminded me of Bayonetta.-Enemies no longer appear in the field all the time, but rather randomly show up in circle around you as you walk around. This isn't reeeaaally a positive or negative change, but what IS better is that you now have a dedicated attack button to get the drop on enemies instead of runnung around in circles like an idiot tryng to run into enemies from behind like in the original. -Actually, there is a negative to be mentioned here: difficulty spikes. I have no problem with challenging games but when a section or boss comes out of nowhere and just wipes the floor with you repeatedly it tends to raise an eyebrow. This thankfully only happened to me twice (once in the middle, and then final batshit crazy boss), but it was more than a little annoying.General Gameplay:The original game had you do 2 things and 2 things only: walk forward and fight enemies. FFXIII-2 not only gets you up and running with all the game mechanics MUCH quicker, but generally has a greater amount of variety in it's gameplay, including:- Actual sidequests! And lots of 'em! - NPC's to talk to and interact with! Lots of those too!- Branching pathways and areas that aren't a simple straight line! - Monsters to tame and level up! Fight with a chocobo at your side!- You have an adorable Moogle companion who you can throw (yes, throw) to reach far away treasure. A small but hilarious addition.- The crystarium has been changed. It's still a pretty linear affair, but every time you fill up a full grid or screen or whatever, you can choose a big reward like adding a new section to the ATB guage or even unlocking a new role.Story/characters/world:- I was completely sick of most of the characters in FFXIII by the time I was through with it. Serah and Noel are, thankfully, handled in a much better fashion. I found Serah to be likeable from the get go,  and while her motivations aren't really that deep (""I just want to see my sister again!"") she's characterized really well and her sincerity is really charming. Then Noel is like FF's version of Riku, minus the being a d*ck to the main character part. Both have really solid voice acting whether playing in Japanese or English.- This game is also pretty dark, which might not be what you expect from looking at it. The farther and farther into the future you travel the more hopeless things become. This sense of desperation, to me, is the heart of Final Fantasy.- On a similar note, the time travelling is a lot of fun. Seeing how the world and characters change depending on what time period or even timeline they're in is really interesting. There's a good chance you'll get sick of hearing the word ""paradox"", though. You've been warned.Graphics/sound:- The soundtrack is phenominal. The original certainly wasn't dragging it's feet in this department but I feel like it fell a bit short of pulling off a ""different"" sounding FF score. XIII-2 absolutely pulls it off. The three composers have put together an awesome collection of beautiful tracks ranging from the classic FF sounds, to some more electronically infused numbers and,  best of all, a handfull of tracks that include vocals. The New Bodhum theme alone sets this score apart.- The game's a looker, no doubt about that. Special mention goes to the animation however, as I think Square is really great at animating their characters and especially faces.There is one more negative however, and that's how the game handles it's ending. To see the ""real"" ending you have to play a (thankfully included) DLC chapter that is incredibly tedious and feels entirely divorced from the whole experience. It's weird that Square would get such a huge amount of things right in this game and then bork up the delivery of the ending. Yeah. Just weird.That aside, I can't recommend this game enough. If you already liked the first, then you robably didn't need any convincing anyway, but if you are like me and hated the original, then I have to urge you to give this one a shot. It's not often that a studio puts in this much effort into fixing a game, so when they do I think they deserve to be rewarded.			"

												First off, the hours I have on this game don't reflect how many hours I have actually played. I have hundreds of hours on 13-2 and came to the verdict that 13-2 is in my opinion, the best FF game to date. The storytelling, characters, plot, gameplay, visuals, cutscenes, etc in 13-2 all match up together and form the greatest FF game. I'm not a newcomer to FF either, I've played, and beat FF 5, 6, 7, 8, X, X-2, XI, and even played a bit of XIV. All of which were good in their own way but can't match 13-2's depth and immersion. It's remarkable that we get such a great game on PC and it looks so much better than 360 version.			"

												One of the best Final Fantasy game that I have ever played. Good graphics, nice and interesting storyline, nice OSTs/Songs, beautifully made characters, awesome battle formations and much more. This is a highly recommended game, you would instantly fall in love with it once you started playing it :) <3			"

												I really enjoyed this game. The graphics are amazing especially now that higher screen resolutions are supported. My only complaint about the series is, however, that there is a lot of post game material that usually involves endless hours of grinding. This, I believe, defeats the purpose of a good RPG game. I have played older stories (like FFVIII) that offered a much longer storyline (100+hrs) and the leveling occurred naturally because of the many enemies you encountered throughout the story.The other thing that is unfortunately common to all FF series, is that most of the good items require a lot of guessing on how to acquire, and so you have to resort to walkthroughs, if you wanna make your characters really powerful. I believe a few hints in game here and there wouldn't hurt...			"

												While a lot of people would write off the entire FF13 trilogy, this game is one of my favorite RPGs, and many people never gave it a chance because of the first game in this series. The game is just pure fun, exploring through locations and flying through the timeline. The combat system is fairly lax, with you essentially swithing strategies throughout a fight instead of picking individual moves to use (though you do that sometimes as well, especially for boss fights). The game also features a Pokemon esque monster capturing and leveling system, with less emphasis on catch em all and more emphasis on get the strongest.This isn't a game for the hardcore, meticulously plan and grind rpg fans, but it is a great game to chill out and kill giant monsters through the timeline with a typically wierd JRPG story. And I love it.			"

												I bought this game purely because I couldn't play it on Xbox 360 like I originally did. The story itself is not as gripping as I found the first game (albiet still not entirely gripping), and thus I found myself not playing the game for long periods, which cut immersion and furthered my lack of interest. After finally completing the first game, I thought of completing this one just so I can say I've done it and having gotten past Bresha Ruins 005 and starting the next parts I found the game crashing and freezing multiple times. Next to this, the poor graphics for the rain let the game down as well as it's really not pleasing to have white lines falling down the screen pretending to be rain. Overall, the game is probably alright for those who can deal with a lacking story line and a main character whose intelligence fluctuates frequently in trying to be somewhat flirty and then knowledgable. While the game doesn't live up to the Final Fantasy legacy, it really isn't the worst game out there, and if there is some sort of patch for these new issues then maybe it'll be more playable and comparable to the console versions.

												After getting a new computer, I got around the constant crashing issue I was having with this game.  As a result, I was able to 100% it, and it was a lot of fun.  The overall difficulty was pretty low, but it was still an enjoyable JRPG, and is actually the first final fantasy game that I have 100%'d.  Took around 50 hours or so to do that, and there were certainly a fair share of insanely annoying fragments (the bestiary one, and the the fragment / achievement related to the casino), but overall it was fun.  I wouldn't recommend going for 100% unless you are masochistic, like me.As an aside, the issue I was having with the XBOX One controller (namely, the controller not working after opening a menu) seemed to be resolved when I switched to a steam controller.  So, if you are having that issue, I guess either use a keyboard, or switch to a steam controller.			"

												After completing the game on PS3, I decided to give the PC port a go, I read up that the FF 13 ports were bad, but as I played, they were terrible! (And FFXIII is worse!) I am playing on a top gaming PC (6700k processor and NVIDIA 980ti) and I get stuttering and framerate drops (Apart from when in combat which is wierd) Anyway, ignoring the issues with the bad port, this game is amazing, I have never had the patience to play a FF game before and this is the first FF game I have actually completed. The game sadly follows on from FF XIII which is essentially a corridor simulator with a boss at the end of each one. Luckily this has been thrown out of the window and replaced with free-roaming, exploring, time travel and paradoxes, plus the okay combat system from its predecessor makes this a interesting game to play. Sadly, because of the exploring, the story can be mixed up and forgotten. On PS3, I came back to the game after around a year of not playing, I had to re-trace my steps using walkthroughs to figure out what I had to do and if I had missed anything. The biggest problem for me is the part of the game where you have to collect 'gravitron cores' as they are in different times. To get into the times is the hardest part because they are unlocked in steps, it may take a while to get to the place you need to go. Lastly, the menu system and item recording is a bit wierd. There is no way to figure out where you collected previous (and used) wild artifacts which is just confusing for the 'cores' questTLDR: If you have a lot of patience (And its a steam sale) Buy this game. I am not a RPG guy in terms of Turn Based games but I enjoyed it!			"

												To me, it's unfortunate that the string of Final Fantasy games that were released with the main number of XIII are written off as lousy games. Yes, they all have flaws, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy playing them. FF XIII-2 is a prime example of such a game.When you release a sequel, the game will inevitably be compared to the source material and I'll do such a thing here as well. While I personally enjoyed XIII, it has received its fair share of critizism. The complaints were mainly aimed at the long tutorial sequence, the linear gameplay and the convoluted story. It also had some other issues, such as a long transition time between the first paradigm shift (the battle system in these games) and the sometimes uninteresting or downright annoying characters.Square seemed to have done something about most complaints with the sequel. For starters, the opening level (playing as Lightning, the protagonist of the first game) is pretty interesting and while the tutorial sequence with Serah (Lightning's little sister) is a bit tedious again, it doesn't drag on for hours to come. Besides that, there are many ways to explore and revisit different regions and they give the player more options to choose from and more routes to follow. This is probably the biggest change compared to its predecessor and it really helps the game.I myself embrace most of the changes they made compared to the first game. Like I said, I enjoyed XIII, but most annoyances I had with the first game are removed. For instance, it took me about 60 hours to finish XIII and a few sidequests but it took me ANOTHER 65 hours to wrap up every achievement in the game, including having to grind the toughest enemy of the game in the hope of getting an item I needed for every weapon available. It's way less tedious to complete everything in XIII-2, with the chocobo rider and slot machine achievements being the exceptions. Most battles are now avoidable, which is also a step up from XIII. They also improved and simplified the leveling system, sped up the first paradigm shift and gave us the opportunity to use monsters as part of the team.Another feature they added in this game is the possibility of alternate endings. While some can be found and viewed during your regular playthrough, most can only be seen after beating the final boss. That also brings us to the post-game content. There are many fragments in each world that serve as a sorts of collectibles. Some serve a purpose, for instance opening a portal to a new and unexplored world or timezone. Some are easier to find than others. The alternative endings you view also net you a fragment for that region. With the time map you use to explore the worlds, it's easy to see if you have found every fragment in that world and time zone. What's even more interesting is that you have the power to ""rewind"" a certain section of the game, meaning you can go back and play that part of the story as if you had never set foot on the world before. This serves as a fun way to kill time and make sure you have explored every nook and cranny of the game.The biggest drawback of XIII is the story. While XIII's story was convoluted and complicated if you didn't take the time to read TONS of story-related content in your menu, XIII-2's story is just too simple. Every problem in the world has to do with time paradoxes and time-travel (which is a key part of the gameplay as well) and they can all be resolved by fixing said paradoxes. That's as straightforward as it can get. The game has a really interesting enemy in the form of Caius Ballad, though he's mainly made interesting by some stellar voice acting by Liam O'Brien. The fights with him are especially very epic and the first battle with Caius proves a hefty challenge if you don't level up some more. It's too bad he didn't get as much screen time he deserved.That being said, the game is still very much enjoyable. If you can look past the obvious plotholes, or timeholes if you will (badun tss), XIII-2 will give you a fun time exploring the wonderful world of Pulse in an abundance of time zones. The music, the graphics and especially the gameplay make for a game I wouldn't mind completing over and over. I hope you'll give it a chance - and enjoy it as much as I did!			"

												Highly recommended for FF fans, despite its average-to-weak story, everything else is spot on. Battles, environments, collectibles and all RPG elements are excellent and manage to draw you into the chaotic time pool of FFXIII-2. Taming a very rare monster, beating the strongest enemies or finding the best hidden treasures feels very rewarding, as these details can change the difficulty and strategic gameplay a lot, giving you new ways to approach future battles and monster hunting.And when you wish to take a break from the storyline or your hunting expeditions, you can always chill out at the ""Amusement Park"" with traditional chocobo races and ""gambling"" mini games.Enjoy!

												I will start by saying that overall it is a good game. I feel it falls a little short of the 'wow' factor that FFXIII had, but it also has its own moments. Characters are ok, with all of the originals (main cast) returning in some way or another. Noel is not a bad addition to the cast and his overall arc is decent. Sarah (who I never really liked anyways) is still the same innocent/clueless girl she seemed like in the first game and was maybe the worst part about the game to me personally. I felt like her arc was almost non-existant.Overall story was good, not great. I liked to whole timeline element they had going, but I feel like they could have done a little bit more with it to really feel like what you were doing in the past made a difference.The soundtracks were probably the best part of the game for me. I thought most of them fit the game really well and were very well done.If you liked the first FFXIII game then I reccomend playing this one too.			"

												I enjoyed every moment of this game. After playing FF13 and this, the story has become much more interesting to me and I can't wait for the final installment. And I've actually grown to like the combat system. At first I thought it was complicated, but now I've realized how much more interactive it makes the game. Although long battles are a pain.-Just like its prequel, the game looks beautiful, especially during cinematic cutscenes.- Music and voice acting were superb.-I didn't experience any technical issues during my playtime, and the game ran pretty smoothly all the time.If you liked Final Fantasy 13, I'm sure you'll like this too. Even though the story/gameplay might get a little bit confusing with all the time travelling etc, it's not too bad. Also there are some nice new features, like Live Trigger and Cinematic Actions.

												I bought FFXIII, and I LOVED IT... but it was released on a console which was prepared to handle the engine it was created on. The battle system in the first game boggled me. I couldn't figure it out, and it really didn't stick to the original context of the skill system. To my dismay, they didn't improve upon it in the sequel. I was hoping they would have, but the game was on sale, so I took a shot. .....  I missed.......The game has a great story line. It is a little too full of fluff, but that is FF for ya. The biggest thing that turned me off about this game was the inefficiency of the portal. The graphics are usually just amazing in these titles, but I wouldn't recommend buying this from STEAM. The portal makes the graphics choppy, and their aren't too many things you can optimize to fix the issue. At times, the problem disuaded me from playing the game. This isn't something I should feel when playing Final Fantasy. I should be enthralled in the game with no disctractions, and enjoying a great interactive story. It didn't happen... so I suppose I will just have to go read a book instead.			"

												This game is amazing but i can't suggest buying the pc port because depending on your system and display the performance sucks. I had issues with the game crashing during quite a few of the important cutscenes. Luckily with my older gforce 660 ti with inherent multi texture threading i was able to beat the game and had pretty amazing framerate too even though some of the shading was rendered poorly and a few of the cities were laggy. The main reason i don't suggest buying it on steam is because it seems like steam may be part of the performance and crash issue. I really wanted to play some of the DLC that came with the game but it was unavailable until you finish the game and the lightning dlc crashes on the cutscene for me every time..... argh!!! Steam and square are not feasibly supporting this game with any developmental resources so it is a gamble on ""as is"" software that was really only designed for the xbox (xbox is lame)...			"

 HOW TO GET SMOOTH FPS FROM THIS GAME ON NVIDIA CARDS	There is a way to get constat smooth 30 fps on Nvidia cards. You need nvidia inspector app and these instructions:https://steamcommunity.com/app/292140/discussions/0/619574421538109499/https://steamcommunity.com/app/292140/discussions/0/619574421475692604/ (just a one reminder from this latter page's instructions. DO NOT CHANGE ""Antialiasing - Mode"" to  ""Override any application setting"". Leave it at the ""Application Controlled"" option. If you do not your game will probably won't open at the start because of a conflict on the launcher aa level and your overridden aa level).And one last thing. Even if you have super duper card (like gtx 1070 or gtx 1080 or above) you need to downdrage shadow resolution to 2048*2048 and anti-aliasing to 4 from ffxiii-2 launcher (I have  gtx1060 btw). Because this game engineered for PS3 and X360 consoles. And it has got ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• PC port. And to tell you the truth there is not a slight difference between ultra high shadow level and ultra high aa levels. Believe me.Also you need to understand: THIS GAME IS MEANT FOR 30 FPS. If you want to play on smooth 60 you probably cannot do it. If you follow upperside instructions you will MOST LIKELY get smooth 30 fps from the game. And one last thing: I did this on my computer and get this satisfying results. It doesn't mean that you will get the same results. This method doesn't have any risks but if you do something wrong I won't accept any accusation. If you are a tech-savvy guy a bit you will do these veeeery simple.My Computer Specs: i5-2500k, 8GB RAM, 1060 GTX, Win7-64bit.

												I like this game the best out of the FFXIII trilogy. It didnt feel as linear as the first game, and the story had a better plot point in my opinion. I feel people give the series negative reviews because it wasn't what they wanted out of the Final Fantasy brand and I feel that's a bit unfair. I feel like if you take away the ""Final Fantasy"" name and review it as if it was its own game with no ties to the franchise, people would review it differently. At any rate, I enjoyed this game the most out of the trilogy and I highly recommend playing the series regardless of the name brand.  "

												A good game, but a very, very bad PC port.  If you're interested in this game and have a PS3 or 360, i'd recommend playing it on one of those systems.Storyline;An incredibly tragic time-travel based storyline.  It does it very well (in my opinion) and is the strongest game, story-wise, in the Lightning Saga.Gameplay;It has a streamlined, simplified version of FF13's ATB battle system.  Serah and Noel are your two static characters, with your third character being a tamed monster of a fixed role.  You can have up to 3 differnet monsters in your ""Party Pack"" that you can use to make paradigms.  Still a good system, but I prefer FF13's.Difficulty;This is a pretty big one for me.  There's almost no difficulty at all here. The superbosses, as you might expect them to be, aren't a challenge at all.  I came across both of them while doing sidequests with no preperation at all and was able to defeat them with ease.  I didn't even know they were supposed to be ""superbosses."" The only difficulty in this game comes from fighting the poor frame rate and the DLC Colosseum.Music;It has a mix of original songs and songs from FF13.  There are some songs made for 13-2 that are nice, but the majority of them are quite bad.			"

												This game is amazing but i can't suggest buying the pc port because depending on your system and display the performance sucks. I had issues with the game crashing during quite a few of the important cutscenes. Luckily with my older gforce 660 ti with inherent multi texture threading i was able to beat the game and had pretty amazing framerate too even though some of the shading was rendered poorly and a few of the cities were laggy. The main reason i don't suggest buying it on steam is because it seems like steam may be part of the performance and crash issue. I really wanted to play some of the DLC that came with the game but it was unavailable until you finish the game and the lightning dlc crashes on the cutscene for me every time..... argh!!! Steam and square are not feasibly supporting this game with any developmental resources so it is a gamble on ""as is"" software that was really only designed for the xbox (xbox is lame)...			"

												Basically it's a great game ported somewhat badly.You need a quite powerful rig and even with it you could see framerate drops.The story is enjoyable (provided you played XIII) and the gameplay is great. I mean, you can use chocobo as pokemons. Do you really need more?The battle system has to be one of the best of the entire franchise, it never feels stale and the save feature for the paradigms and monster packs is there not only for show, but as a necessity for quick shift in tactics.Also the tutorial is over with a couple of battles and the whole battle system is unlocked very soon (unlike in XIII).

												""The monster partner is very attractive system. I found it very funny to adopt it and let it burn the face of my enemy.""  A semi turn-based JRPG game in a form of two persons and one things(?) in your party. First, I must compliment the soundtrack. IT IS THE MASTER PIECES! that is first best thing in game. The second thing is that everything in game flexible then the first one. The story is nice but it is not finished you have to buy Lightning Return in order to continue. (It is spoiled? I think not). Play it now to listen ""Heart of chaos & Invisible Depths"". (So EPIC!!!)			"

 HOW TO GET SMOOTH FPS FROM THIS GAME ON NVIDIA CARDS	There is a way to get constat smooth 30 fps on Nvidia cards. You need nvidia inspector app and these instructions:https://steamcommunity.com/app/292140/discussions/0/619574421538109499/https://steamcommunity.com/app/292140/discussions/0/619574421475692604/ (just a one reminder from this latter page's instructions. DO NOT CHANGE ""Antialiasing - Mode"" to  ""Override any application setting"". Leave it at the ""Application Controlled"" option. If you do not your game will probably won't open at the start because of a conflict on the launcher aa level and your overridden aa level).And one last thing. Even if you have super duper card (like gtx 1070 or gtx 1080 or above) you need to downdrage shadow resolution to 2048*2048 and anti-aliasing to 4 from ffxiii-2 launcher (I have  gtx1060 btw). Because this game engineered for PS3 and X360 consoles. And it has got ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• PC port. And to tell you the truth there is not a slight difference between ultra high shadow level and ultra high aa levels. Believe me.Also you need to understand: THIS GAME IS MEANT FOR 30 FPS. If you want to play on smooth 60 you probably cannot do it. If you follow upperside instructions you will MOST LIKELY get smooth 30 fps from the game. And one last thing: I did this on my computer and get this satisfying results. It doesn't mean that you will get the same results. This method doesn't have any risks but if you do something wrong I won't accept any accusation. If you are a tech-savvy guy a bit you will do these veeeery simple.My Computer Specs: i5-2500k, 8GB RAM, 1060 GTX, Win7-64bit. Here is the discussion page:http://steamcommunity.com/app/292140/discussions/0/142261352642587872/ "

												This is  rating about bugs, not the story or gameplay as I was not able to finish it due to constant crashing. So the game isn't half bad. The problem I had was almost every time I would transition to a new area the game would crash and force me to reload and sit through loading screens...over and over and over again. After pushing through for 13 hours of gameplay I finally got sick of it and read the story online. I have never done this before for a game I enjoyed. Also, I would like to note that I have a decent computer system. New motherboard, processor, ram, and graphics card that all cost roughly $3300 (these were all upgrades, not a new computer, to give you an idea of their quality.) So when you see all these warnings about bugs don't do what I did and think ""oh well I have a pretty bad‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•comp, I should be fine."" There is a reason such a decent game got so many terrible reviews. There were other minor bugs as well but the one that ruined the game for me was the constant crashing.			"

												My computer meets the minimum requirements for this game and it still runs terribly. I looked online and saw that many people had the same issues I did. The game runs at 12 frames per second for me. I found an online fix so now it stays at 60 FPS but now it runs slowly. Waste of money, developers need to fix their lazy ports. The PS3 version ran better than this crap. My refund request was also decline.  Uninstalling.			"

												Final Fantasy 13-2, the second installment in this trilogy. I'm not sure if i want to love it or hate it... When i first heard about FF13-2 after having played FF13 i imagined a different story. imo this story feels much weaker to me, especially Noel... I imagined him to be more older? Rough around the edges. But we get this 18 year old boy that looks alot like Sora from Kingdom Hearts.It's not all bad, love the game mechanic. Especially because there is nothing missable. You can always reset the timeline and things different. It also looks like Square have taken notes from FF13 so... Monsters drop Gill again. to make it short here are some pros & cons.PRO:- Nothing is missable (you have a time machine)- Battles have Money reward again.- No insane driving mini games. (still got migraines from FF10 & FF10-2)- No need for level grindingCons:- Weak Characters (Noel's story isn't believable)- Loading screens drive me insane- Weak story because of main characters.I wish there was a Mixed button, A simple Yes or No recommendation is Hard to give for this game for me its a 5/10. so recommendation is only YES because of fanboy issem and that it isn't all bad.

												Personally......it's better then the 1st (Both storylines aren't the best). The taming skill is fun but also annoying. Reasons why this is better:*With the previous leveling system it was very daunting on grinding, This one is fun.*Mog*The story is actually interesting (compared to the 1st one hard to follow)*poker =)*the ability to replay an event (This is the good'n)Why it isn't:Serah and noel too soopytime trials i recommend MUTE (as mog will make you go mad)going to and throw. Expect to jump in and out of timelinesStory can get abit toooooo much but not to badThe best part is when the story end, I would recommend a guide for the wild artificats or your going to end up going wrong.My question if this game is half decent why did the story go so wrong in 13?I do have lag issues mainly with Atlas and places that rain.....But i've played games in worse conditions and mine computer isn't the best about and i can get through it.So if your looking for a random ff game this is it.....Mind you i did miss this one and go to lightening return (another good'n).Let's hope that story gets better as time goes on......

												Having owned this on ps3 I was quite excited to get it on sale for pc.   Yet as I install having met max requirements.   This game is out played by the first title in this trilogy, FF13.   I don't know what it is that makes this game so darn laggy over ff13.   Its like playing a ps2 emulator on a pc that doesn't have the proccessing power.  Cutscenes run good, but get into exploration and battles. it lags.    With everything closed out, it still lags. -.-So in short, if you have something better then the max requirements this thing demands, maybe you can get 30+FPS.   But if you meet max requirements, your stuck with stuttering 20fps.Or better yet, invest 20 or 40 dollars into the ps3/xbox 360 version of this game shold you own them consoles.  Where it still remains jaw dropping gorgeous and doesn't lag.EDIT 4/17/2017:  Note: Added 8more gb of ram.So around march I installed some ram, went form 8gb to 16gb.   Then had a thought.   Will this game play smoothly with the added ram.  SO i reinstalled it a week ago and just got around to playing it today only to find yeah.   quite noticably.  Minus a few action heavy scenes it does indeed play smoothly now.   Of course started a new game just to test it out and only just arrived in bresha ruins for the first time, so I dunno how the later parts of the game is affected.  But I still stand at my vie of this game until I can progress to later parts of the game.			"

												Review on Final Fantasy XIII-2   1. Intro.   2. Problems/Why this is Honestly Not Recommended.   3. Advice and Recommended to play.   4. Finale. 1. Intro.  First, If you Have Windows 10, dont buy this. Most problems are held buy people with Windows 10 but not held by others. It isn't properly supported, dont get it.  Next, I've played this game for 200+ hrs,By saying this, most gamers understand the amount of experience I have with this story-based game that can be finished in 40-70 hrs, compared to an angry review after 2-10hrs of blindly butting heads with the terrible *edit* bad, port. This is a review by someone who has played through this game for a significant amount of time.  2. Why this should Honestly Not be Recommended,   a) This review is from a gamer that played this PC version for months I want to say that I Honestly think this is a great game brought from the PS3, but the performance put out by the port isnt very good. Unless your PC runs at some amazing stats, Its hard to play at anything other than the base image settings and the FPS is still pretty bad.   b) One of the Biggest problems happens during Cinematic Cutscenes, your game will try to load a lot of new information and also try to autosave which worked on the console, however the longer you play the game, the more information the game will tryto process. i.e. completed/ongoing quests, certain events that need to be implemented, and the biggest thing are Savestates which will take a significant amount of processinging all occuring in the small amount of time oof moving between the world you are in, and the World Select. Whenever you transition between worlds, which in mid to late game is a significant amout of times, this game will try to load , process and save all at the same time. During the early game this problem isn't very apparent, but at 40+ hrs, the change becomes much more apparent, eventually past 100+ hrs triggering even small cutscenes, which automatically load and autosave at the same time, will often crash the game, causing whatever progress was made to all feel worthless. While the game itself is fun and engaging, with a great story, and  good design, the PC version has its issues.   c) Occasionally, if the amount of data in your Savestate is fairly high, (100+ hrs worth, but possibly less.) Steamcloud, where all default savestates are managed will randomly""move"", essentually deleting them. Meaning that they are no longer accessable to you from your Main Menu or found any where in your PC's Files, leaving only the New Game option available. 3. Recommended and advice  a) Steamcloud shouldn't be turned on while playing this game. There is a warning on the Launcher stating that processing may take longer because of Steamclouds synchronisation with the servor. The fact that there is any kind of Warning on the launcher should be a clear indicator that there is a problem.There will be planty of times that SteamCloud will start synchronizing and crash your game. It would be best if you played this while in offline mode, the trophies may be fun to get but if you want to enjoy this game its not worth the risk's.  b)  Make sure you create an independent Save file location that is not managed by Steam. Frequently delete unnecessary savestates, and you can keep the amount of information processed farther on in the game to a more manageable amount.  c)  Keep your settings low, again this port isn't the most capable, during the early game when the amount of data being processed is rather low, it should be fine to raise the settings to whatever your PC can handle, just remember that even if your game runs fairly smoothly later on in the game, cutscenes and loading processing requirements will grow at a steepening curve. Whatever you can do to help your game run smoothly even at the cost of quality is worth it.  d) Look up Crysterium and Monster Guides before you leave the first world. Like others in the FF Series this Game will seem fairly easy at first, but even moreso then prievious games, it will absolutly punish unknowing mistakes, stopping you from even reaching the late game, let alone post game. Leveling the Crysterium (Essentually Levels) is an irreversable process, that if left to a novice will cause any small mistakes in building your character, that might not be so relevent early on, will become devestating to those that want to enjoy the late game.  d.i)  Monsters play a huge role in this game, and just like with Crysterium, are a major part of the game that will eventually be the focus of your team, as in they will be the party member that you recruit, train, and carry you through the game.  d.ii) While its not neccesary to look up guides on these to succeed, it is reccommended, finding the Hidden Monster(s), that can become the Gods to carry you through late game and final bosses. Finding the correct Infusiuon Recipes to build them into said Gods, finding which monsters youll need to grind for in certain conditons. And realising before you kill certain indespensible and unrespawnable monsters that you actually need them and should save in front of them and soft reset if you dont get it until you do.4.  Altogether this is a great game. I would say that this Port has to many problems that havent been corrected, and can only be managed by the user who pays the full price for this, but then has to do the providers job of making it usable in order to actually play this. After playing over 200+ hrs on the PC version of this game I can say that for those who still want to purchase this after reading this review, follow the above recommended advice, and hopefully someday this game will be Patched enough That I can honestly Recommend this to prospecting FF Players.

												Posting this mainly so it'll help others. I bought this game a few years back and have never been able to play it until now. It was a mess on windows 8/10. After installing the new Windows 10 Creators update the game now runs perfectly in fullscreen with working audio! Only thing I had to do was disable steam cloud to stop the crashes. Now playing in a crash free 1080p @ 60fps constant! (i7 6700k - GTX 1060)It's a fantastic addition to the Final Fantasy 13 series vastly improving on the first game in almost every way. Loving the battle system and the open world! My advice to those who are saying it's a horrible port which it was, is to update to the latest version of windows 10 and try it again. You won't regret it!			"

This game is out played by the first title in this trilogy, FF13.   I don't know what it is that makes this game so darn laggy over ff13.   Its like playing a ps2 emulator on a pc that doesn't have the proccessing power.  Cutscenes run good, but get into exploration and battles. it lags.    With everything closed out, it still lags. -.-So in short, if you have something better then the max requirements this thing demands, maybe you can get 30+FPS.   But if you meet max requirements, your stuck with stuttering 20fps.Or better yet, invest 20 or 40 dollars into the ps3/xbox 360 version of this game shold you own them consoles.  Where it still remains jaw dropping gorgeous and doesn't lag.EDIT 4/17/2017:  Note: Added 8more gb of ram.So around march I installed some ram, went form 8gb to 16gb.   Then had a thought.   Will this game play smoothly with the added ram.  SO i reinstalled it a week ago and just got around to playing it today only to find yeah.   quite noticably.  Minus a few action heavy scenes it does indeed play smoothly now.   Of course started a new game just to test it out and only just arrived in bresha ruins for the first time, so I dunno how the later parts of the game is affected.  But I still stand at my vie of this game until I can progress to later parts of the game.			"

												Just to first note, yes this game is buggy for the PC, but this is one of the best FF games. You can get around a lot of issues limiting your cores to real cores if you have a Intel CPU, if you're running AMD you should be fine. Then setting the game to window not fullscreen and use ""Borderless Gaming"" to achive fullscreen.  I've had the game crash very little since doing that. There are various fixes through the community you can look into. I'm running an Intel i7 4790k with a R9 390, my FPS is normally 60 but this game does drop frames even if you do the fixes. I'm not holding my breath for Sqaure to come back and patch this game, there isn't much of a point now considering the game's age. Now to the actual game. Overall I've really enjoyed this FF a lot, the improvements they made to the gameplay aspect really improved it. I like the fact that there are puzzles and almost a ""treasure hunt"" throughout the game. The characters are really likeable, which is something I think the XIII series get's looked over for. The story is actually really good, it's not confusing if you have half a brain, I saw some reviews critiquing that. You can easily get about 30 hours on this game, right now I have 29-ish and I haven't even completed the story. You're rewarded for exploring (much like XIII) and taking your time in this game, so do so.Game can kinda be a press ""x"" simulator at points like it's predecessor, but the leveling up system in this one provided more a challenge as well as your Paradigm Shift and ATB playing more of a factor in this one. I also like the addition of having monsters that fight with you.All in all this game isn't perfect for the PC, but it still get's a 5/5 for me for the actual game.And finally it's got Mog. :3			"

												This game is good but port is awful. My game constantly crushing and even if it's not there are some serious fps and stuttering problems. This is ridicolous after 3 years from release SE can't solve this problems and this is one of the main FF games.			"
