												It'll make you laugh.  It'll make you cry.  It'll make you spill juice on your good pants.Half-Minute Hero plays like a normal RPG on speed:  Each map has you grind, get new gear, and fight a big bad boss, with each RPG taking about only 3 to 5 minutes.  There are plenty of different maps with branching paths and titles to challenge to go through maps different ways.Unlike the 360 version, it comes with Evil Lord 30, which is a top-down beat'em'up where you summon monsters to beat up people, Princess 30 where you play a shoot'em'up under a very strict 30 second royal curfew, and Knight 30 where you protect your sage for 30 seconds against monsters.  All of these is more than reason enough to pick up this game if you are even remotely interested by the premise.			"

												Super funny game with many JRPG reference and humors on itGood:- Fast and tense 30 sec rule- With all addictive JRPG elements such as secret map, NPC mercenaries, Flying on map, etc. which keeps you playing- Good humors and adorable cute character designs- Full controller support with very easy to use control scheme- Good variations for diffferent levels- Free Bonus materials after cleared the game is satisfied rewarding. It is very precious in recent Season Pass still not include all DLC different colour skins era- Multiplayer mode add replayabilityBad:- Not enough hints for discovering secrets since you got 30 sec each pray, will rush to boss and easily missed out the secrets. Replay the map will not reward the new equipment, force to read walkthough before start level for completionist- Same attack effects no matter you're using iron sword or legendary sword- Graphics is little bit roughScore: 80/100			"

												This game is the polar opposite of what an RPG should be and it's kind of fun. It adds all the old school references you admired as a child and throws you in to a frantic panic to grind out levels, complete side quests and defeat an evil boss all in under 30 seconds! Well let's get one thing straight, you don't have to beat every stage in 30 seconds, in fact, some stages can take up to a minute and a half to complete which is kind of false advertising  but it's still pretty fun.The user interface could of used some tweaking, it's poorly optimized for PC. Alt + tabbing minimizes the window, it doesn't run the program in the background, so that was getting kind of annoying when I had to look up a guide.My only real gripe about the game design is the convoluted side quests you have to do, there's no indication or explaination in game of how to get them done either, some are very cryptic as well... You'll be replaying levels twice or even three times and some of them can get incredibly obnoxious. You definitely need a guide if you're going for 100% completion on this one, you've been warned.

												More a puzzle game than an RPG. Balance speed vs. grinding vs. money management to solve each stage, contains 99% of the content of all other versions of the game... probably the ""ultimate"" variant. A crazy game which has some silly moments and a barrage of replay value given the multiple awards, unlocks, and branches each stage might come complete with.A speedy game deserves an equally-quick review, no?

												A game in 8-bits that doesn't feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ retro game. Everything on the game goes faster than lighting (no pun intended), and there are a lot of references. A lot of stages to play, 4 long stories to complete, one hell of a final battle, and a little Challenge mode if you have the balls, all with great music, and non-8bit mode for people that don't like them.It's at 1,74€ right now.

												It's a great game, though it was slightly better on the PSP. The original graphics don't scale well to a PC screen, and the new alternative graphics are terrible.

												I gotta hand it to the developers - Whomever had this idea that you could save the world in 30 seconds is awesome! There are lots of challeneging elements that create a do or die situation and it makes the game more and more interesting to play - and you can even replay the levels to see if there was something you missed. You can turn back time in the scenario your in , but everytime you turn back the clock it costs you more and more money. Game has 2 different graphic modes to choose from, but I like the updated graphics the best for some reason. I'm wondering if in the future, they can add a retro 8 bit soundtrack to the game as a selectable option, like the retro graphics option that is present in the game. Would make it more complete, but for the challenge this game provides I can't complain			"

												It's not a bad game. It's kinda fun. The problem for me is that it's only kinda fun. The gameplay is kind of like a puzzle game, but when you run out of time you have to start the puzzle over from scratch. The core of the puzzle element is deciding how to allocate your precious time, and this sort of challenge really isn't mentally stimulating, it's just a bit annoying. Basically, the core gameplay mechanic of trying to manage your time just isn't quite as fun as other gameplay mechanics. Also, the game pitches itself as a parody but I didn't really find anything to be very humorous. It definitely achieves a lighthearted tone, though. I wouldn't recommend this because there are games that are more fun and less ""mind numbing resource allocation"" out there.			"

												I bought this game with my boyfriend, hoping to play it together. Unfortunately, the developers were too lazy to create multiplayer lobbies so you get matched with random people if anyone. In our case, we managed to play ONE game together before the multiplayer mode kept keeping us seperate.PLEASE NOTE. YOU CANNOT INVITE ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS. I'm not sure how the developers expected us to play with our friends, if you cannot invite or get into game with them. Really disappointed.			"

												A fun little game that's easy to pick-up and play.  I'm not usually a big fan of timed games, but thankfully Half Minute Hero's gimmick is easy to work around and looping time to do everything you want to isn't very difficult.  Not needing to stress about time limits is a good thing.Every stage boils down to you leveling-up, finding secrets, buying items and killing stuff in relatively densely packed levels with little fat.  The game auto-attacks and the only real actions you have in your arsenal are using items and dashing.  The simplicity of it works really well and despite most levels playing very similar to one another, there's enough variations to keep things fresh.  There are multiple branching paths you unlock by beating levels through different means and every level has a couple of unique titles you can earn by meeting various conditions.  There's just enough to each level to warrant a replay if you're interested.HMH also has a surprising amount of content.  There's 50+stages in the main game and after beating it, different game modes unlock that are essentially mini tower defense, RTS, and shump campaigns.  These modes are very basic and honestly not that great, but they're fun enough and have the same light-hearted tone as the main game.   Princess 30 is probably the best of the bunch since the fast-paced shooting stages are the closest of the extra modes to the pace of the main game.  One important thing to know, you need to set the game to retro graphics mode to play these in their full campaign, otherwise they're just one-off stages in the vein of the main game.  There's nothing suggesting this in-game so if you're playing with the updated graphic option, you'll miss out of the full version of the modes.As for the bad stuff, the port has some problems, like one of the stages in the main game crashing consistently if you're not playing in retro graphic mode.  So if Quest 26 keeps crashing on you, that's the problem.  Resolution options are limited to 1280x720 windowed or a stretched fullscreen.The other main issue with the game is the equipment UI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Having to scroll horizontally though a bunch of icons when equipping stuff is really annoying and since you're limited to replaying levels only with the equipment you had up to that point, the terrible UI is something you'll have to deal with a decent bit.  The pixel graphics also look quite bad when they're blown up and used as ""speaking"" models.  They just take up too much screen real estate in relation to their size and look like a jumbled mess In short, a fun, casual game that's easy to play.  It's also now packaged with the sequel game for the same price as the original by itself, so make sure to buy the right version so you get both games.			"

												This is no doubt one of my favorite games in the library, and I highly, HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who likes Action games or Old School RPG satire. The game is about a boy who sets out to save a kingdom and, through a twist of fate, ends up making a pact with the Time Goddess to save the world...which only has 30 seconds until it explodes!The game mostly parodies people, gaming, and most of all, the classic RPG, and it does it well. The game as a whole is really a parody, making it a point to ""Grind, Grind, Grind!"" when really getting to high levels only takes a few minutes. While the player only has thirty seconds to save the world, they can pray to the Time Goddess and, with an added fee, can turn back the clock. The story is expansive, and there are multiple paths and multiple endings, as well as multiple ways to go about each level (some story arcs even being surprisingly serious and tense).And that's just the first mode. There are several modes, some of which tie into each other. This game will last you many, many, many hours, but the best part about it is that it doesn't matter whether you want a game that's easy to pick-up and stop at any point or one that keeps you in for the long haul, because this game occupies both of those roles. Really, I feel that this game should be in anyone's library regardless of whether they like RPGs or not. It's a great game, and for $9.99 it's a steal (and these days you'll probably find it for less, even if you just get it from buying the sequel).			"

												If you've played many RPGs from the NES and SNES era (Final Fantasy, Dragon Warrior, Breath of Fire, Lufia, etc.), then you'll probably find this game hilarious. I know I did. In each level, you have 30 seconds to defeat the local evil lord before he casts the spell of destruction and destroys the entire world. Like, 30 actual seconds, so the gameplay can be quite fast-paced. You fight enemies for gold and xp/levels, buy stuff in towns, talk to people and do sidequests all in this short time limit, but you can turn back the clock by paying the time goddess increasingly large sums of gold. Very fun game, almost like a fast-paced puzzle game dressed up as an oldschool RPG. The levels are short and varied, which made it all too easy for me to lose large chunks of time to the game without noticing.This edition of the game has two graphic modes, an ""anime"" style, which looks really amateurish and terrible IMO, and a ""retro"" style, which looks like a SNES game and is nostalgic and awesome.The other game modes are fun, too, especially Princess 30, which plays mostly like a scrolling shmup. Hero 300 is pretty epic, too.			"

												Half Minute Hero has you play as ""HeroA"", aided by the Time Goddess, whose duty is to protect the land against the Ultimate Evil.The premise of the game revolves around time-rewinding, which, at the start of the game, can be confusing and tedious, but after a short learning curve becomes very easy and fun to manage and exploit to improve your character.The game is really funny and quirky, being very meta and making fun of itself often in a playful way. I completed All Hero games in 5 hours (apart from the last one which is an uberhard bonus which I couldn't work out how to complete) and enjoyed it. Controller integration is also perfect.A quick, quirky bit of fun in the style of a Final Fantasy type game. Very enjoyable for the cost!Nilesy			"

												I just ♥♥♥ this game. It tries to innovate the (action) RPG genre with a feature that is regularly used in different genres; rewinding time. You control a guy who has to save the world within 30 seconds. Yup, 30 seconds. Let me give you an example; with each level you play you are introduced to a boss. Then you're dropped into the level, populated with towns, caverns, seas, anything really. Please note that the levels are not open, but there are several ways to solve a level. Enemy encounters are random and help you level up, while also earning you money. When the timer is about to hit 00:00 you can pray to a statue in certain towns to rewind time and level up further, finish sidequests and, eventually, kill the boss. You can do this endlessly, but it costs more money every time you do this. So there's a bit of puzzling involved as well.The graphics are (semi)-retro, and done very well, but the music and sounds are quite basic. One word though: gameplay.Verdict: a must own ![Rating: 86/100]			"

Just an endless number of levels and you do basically the exact same thing in all of them. This game is completely mindless and boring.			"

												Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy is a set of different campaigns each with their own playstyle. The first playstyle resembles a RPG, the second is a top down action game where you play as an evil summoner, the third is a top down shooter for lack of a better term. Each campaign has at least 30 lands (levels) that have a 30 second countdown with the potential to get more time. This is a dialog heavy game with a comedy slant if you couldn't tell from the Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy in the title. I'm happy there's a one button skip everything. I didn't need to read anything, because its all so simple.The first campaign is the main appeal. In 'Hero 30' you have 30 seconds in each land to save the world. In the first land, you'll meet the Time Goddess. For a price she'll reset the timer back to 30 seconds. Each time you need her, she charges more and more. The only time the clock isn't counting down is in the towns. If you don't have enough money to reset the clock, the goddess will still grant you a reset, but she'll repossess your weapons and the timer will forever count down to 0 even in towns. There is a world map consisting of lines and dots where the lands are. The little lands each have a few towns, caves, a castle and a boss. The only place to explore is the overworld. Towns, bosses and caves are all single screens. Combat is automatic, your character will bump into the enemies and do damage. When time is of the essence, you can run, but that costs health. When you die, you respawn with minimal health. Sometimes its quicker to die, respawn and use the Time Goddess statues in town than risk a game over from running out of time. You can also run from combat.  When each land begins you start at level 1, but you can quickly grind your way back up with most battles giving you a level or two.Before going into each land you can equip weapons and armor, but you won't be able to change them while in the land.  You can only buy new things to equip them in a land. Each piece of gear has its own weight, making you slower, but preventing knock back from enemies. If you get knocked back off screen from an enemy, you don't die, but the battle has ended. So it becomes a push-of-war. If you buy equipment in further lands, the game will not let you use the gear in previous lands. Other equipment has special uses like the swimmers ring which does uh.... I forget. Some weapons are insta-kills against certain types of foes, the bug swatter, the demon slaying silver sword. It makes for nice choice when replaying a lands for the 30th time trying to kill a giant sub boss far tougher than the main boss.Towns consist of single screens with many NPCs. Each land has at least two side quests. The world map highlights the name of each quest to give you a vague hint. Some of which unlock other lands. Its not that difficult. Most if not all lands can be finished in under 2 minutes. The tricky part is the two extra quests and fitting them in while beating the boss before you run out of time or money. Hero 30 makes use of time, because the 30 seconds are an entire day, so different events happen at different times. You may see the tide come in and block a path or a destructive fire destroy a town. Its a nice touch. After each land, the credits scroll by. Every time! Like you've just watched a 30 minute episode in under a minute! Then you are taken to a hint screen where four people don't ever have much to say unless you missed an extra path to a hidden land.  Some of the lands are setup in such a way that even if you beat a level your path doesn't continue without completing certain quests.There is a multiplayer where you can compete with people online on different lands to see who is the fastest. In a fast paced game, it makes it even faster. Plus there are leader boards for each land of the Hero 30 campaign. The game will also notify you of where your Steam friend was where you are in each land. To keep pushing the pace, your friend will beat the land in 3 2 1. It will even show you their recorded ghost in the land or your own depending who was faster. The second campaign, 'Evil Lord 30' is a top down action game that feels more enjoyable and deeper than the Hero 30. You have three spells that summon different types of creatures. Ranged creatures, brutes that bluntly melee and nimble which dodge attacks from enemy supporters. You also have the ability to push them into battle, but I never used it. Around you is a magical set of circles. The larger your outer circle, the more powerful the creatures are. The inner circle is your current magical power to make those creatures. If you get hit, the outer maximum circle shrinks. The time goddess can restore the size though. This time the goddess hides in golden barrels and takes all the money you have each time you use her. Luckily each enemy drops coins. The goal of each land is to kill, destroy or touch something.The third campaign 'Princess 30' is the top down shooter. You are a princess surounded by your soldiers and can shoot north, south, east and west. The longer you shoot in a direction the more focused your arrows become. When you take a hit, you lose some of your soldiers, which is your firepower. When you leave the castle you dash one direction, then collect an item at the end or defeat a boss. Then you dash back. All with the 30 second timer ticking down. If you run over a red carpet, you gain time. There are even fairies to pick up for additional firepower. It felt like a fun minigame, but it was the same every time, just with different enemies. In fact all of these feel like minigames turned into a campaign. Its perfect for on the go like a PSP or DS.'Knight 30' is a top down action strategy game where you are a knight defending a sage against monsters. This fourth campaign needs to be unlocked. It can be more difficult than the others. When the mage is standing still on her own, the 30 second clock will count down to 0. Once it reaches zero you complete the area. Control wise you can grab and use the sage or other objects. You can dash, call the sage over to you and set traps such as fences, spikes, bombs and scarecrows to bait birds. When you dash it will drain your stamina. Without any stamina you put down what you're carrying. If you die, your spirit rises and will need to touch the sage before you can do anything else. If the sage dies, its game over. It is more difficult than the other modes since there is a lot to keep track of. Its interesting and employs strategy.Overall, everything feels very easy even with a 30 second timer. I never ran out of time in all 30 lands of Evil Lord and Princess. They were a breeze. For the hardcore out there, you can unlock Hero 300 and Hero 3. The 'Hero' campaigns all have a good dynamic of gold vs time, forcing you to complete each land before you can't earn enough gold to reset the clock. The non Hero campaigns feel more fun than the Hero campaigns even if they end quickly. I also have to question why the game says the 360 controller is the Ultimate way to play and then has keys for everything on screen instead of buttons.			"

												 This game is actually quite decent; while a time-based RPG game, it's also very simple to understand. In the game, the whole world is in peril, and you have 30 seconds (a half-minute) to save the world! But thing is, if you can't save the world on time, you can use some gold, at a statue for an offering, in order to REWIND time! (At a portion, at least.) While $9.99 is a fair deal, it's still a bit pricy. For a cheap game, it's still worth trying out. It's cute, silly-looking, and also creatively well done! Definitely a unique take, on the RPG genre.			"

You will level, gain party members, visit towns, gain equipment etc.. The usual rpg mechanics with a twist of 30 seconds to accomplish this task. If you need more time, you just need to pay the time goddess to reset time back to 30 and defeat the evil lords. This game is still a gem on the psp and is just as great on the big screen. I can almost guarantee that you will not be dissapointed playing this game.			"

												Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy is a cool hypersonic RPG action game with several time attack modes and a good storyline (even though it may appear quite repetitive).The retro-like graphics and midi music makes me wanna grab back my old video game consoles.On a side note, the multiplayer mode should probably add extra features (like more than 2 players, new maps and other game variations).Short and intense with achievements! (badges would be more than welcome).			"

												At first I thought this game was pretty silly and there didn't seem to be much there, but I've put much more time into this game than I initially thought I would. Not only are the game mechanics and gameplay really nice and pretty quick (which means this game is a wonderful time-killer!) but it's also got a cute little story which features many branching paths and a nice inventory system. Replaying past levels surprisingly don't feel too repetitive and is really fun. There are tons of challenges to complete, not to mention the difficult achievements which aren't impossible but just require a bit of extra effort! Overall a really solid game, 8/10 from me.			"

												DONT LET MY PLAYTIME FOOL YOU, I played the original game on PSP and loved it, and after discovering this game was available for steam, i had to buy it.Its a definitive upgrade from the psp version.For the true half minute hero experience, play Hero 30 on any style you want, and the rest on the retro style as it restores the original games instead of what they did in the neo cartoon styleHero 30: The story is about a hero who arrives at a kingdom and its immediately asked to kill some monsters outside the castle, later an evil lord appears and casts the spell of destruction, which will destroy the world in 30 seconds, after failing the goddess of time offers him her assistance in exchange for money, allowing him to turn the clock back 30 seconds as long as you find a statue. its a fast paced rpg parody which comprises most Rpg tropes in every levelEvil lord 30: Not really evil just wants to help her lover Millenia, the game plays like a Real time strategy game with rock paper scissors mechanicsPrincess 30: A princess who goes on a quest to find out who wants to kill her father, armed with a crossbow, soldiers who will do anything for her. and a personality disorder when she holds her crossbow, has to complete missions before her 30 second curfew runs out, the game plays as a 2d shoot em upknight 30: Unlocked after completing the first 3 modes since this happens 200 years after princess 30. After the time goddess is killed by the big bad of the story (Who has been present in every story of this game) since no heroes appeared to defeat the evil lords, it seemed everything was lost, you play as a weak knight who was revived by a sage and your mission is to find the other 3 heroes, but is not gonna be easy since evil rules the world, and your only hope is a spell the sage knows but needs 30 seconds to cast it, your job is to protect him until the time runs outHero 300: the finale of the game, immediately after knight 30, the ultimate evil lord is revived, existance is beginning to disappear and is the job of the hero to recruit the other heroes and finish this once and for all.The game has a nice ammount of replay value, finding new ways to beat levels, or the secret path exclusive to super mega neo climax ultimate boy edition, well written and actually funny dialogueThe music is AMAZING, go and listen to some of its songs like the main theme, The hero arrives, To the high heavens, Melody of Happiness, Casablanca. This soundtrack is amazing8.7/10			"

												Half Minute Hero is an old-school RPG with one twist: you have to win in 30 seconds. You can pay the incredibly frugal Time Goddess to reset the clock, but you can't do it forever. The result is a fast-paced game that cuts out the fluff and has you figuring out how to best spend your last precious seconds. The story is simple and very goofy, but effectively told. The music and graphics are both very good. Controls are bad, though... this game was ported from consoles poorly. You basically need a controller for some modes (not Hero, thankfully). The game comes with six modes, but Hero 30 is the big draw: the rest pale in comparison. Evil Lord 30 and Princess 30 are fun distractions and don't take long. Knight 30 was okay once I figured it out. Hero 300 is the big climax, and gives you a big payoff for playing the other modes. Hero 3 is infuriating. I didn't try the multiplayer. Anyone who has enjoyed 8- or 16-bit RPGs needs to pick up this game. Other RPG and puzzle game fans will probably enjoy it as well. It's definitely worth the money.			"

												I will refrain from making the obvious innuendos from the title.  I first played this game on PSP and had no idea what to expect.  HMH pokes fun at many of JRPG's long running tropes while also feeling like a pretty fun game due to its unique mechanics.  In the main game, you only have 30 seconds to beat each stage while traveling from towns and obtaining items.  Thankfully, you can pay money to extend the time, but the cost increases with each use, so eventually you'll run out of either money or time (a la real life).  There's actually quite a bit of content here, as beating hero mode will unlock other modes that span different centuries in the same world (princess, sage, knight, etc), all culminating in an epic 300 second hero mode that brings all stories to a satisfying... climax.  Oh yeah, and you can play 3 second hero mode once all that's done too.  Is that really enough to earn the title ""Super Mega Neo Climax"" though?			"

												Half-Minute Hero isn't a bad game by any means, and is in fact, quite a novel experience. At least, for the first few hours.The game has a good amount of content, but every level basically plays like the last, and it doesn't have any other redeeming to qualities to make-up for that fact (such as sharp dialogue, for example). So what you're left with might be a monotonous slog that is helped along by, at best, very average dialogue.The game seems to go for a pick-up-and-put-down experience, and that's exactly how I tried to play it. But even after putting HMH down for a long time, and picking it up again, I always felt underwhelmed after completing a level, and always just wanted to quit.The other modes (Princess 30 and Beautiful Evil Villain 30) suffer from the same problem, and were -- arguably -- even worse when it came down to being repetitive, and having boring-to-average dialogue. So there are no saving graces to be found there.HMH is a game that spread its novelty way too thin (imagine if Portal 1 was a 30-hour game), and as a result, eventually becomes a mind-numbingly repetitive experience. It could have benefited from being a much shorter, and sharply-focused experience.			"

The new graphics are not as appealing as I would have wished and the interface was definitely not designed for a PC. It's only worth a purchase if you have a gamepad, but other than that it's a very fine port of an amazing game!			"

In those 30 seconds all you have to do is traverse the world map, level up fighting random battles, buy new equipment, recruit new party members and then take down the boss and save the world. How?

The downside? 30 seconds to grind your way to a fitting level, fat equipment and rid the lands of him.

												Truthfully, going into this game, I didn't know what to expect. With the name telling me I have 30 seconds to complete a mission, I thought it was going to be very easy. This is far from the case. As others have mentioned, this game makes you think strategically about when to grind, when to spend your money, how to spend said money, when the best time to fight the boss would be, etc. It's this balance while forcing you to think on your feet that makes it so interesting. Some missions you may beat the first time, others, especially the bonus missions, may take you two, or three, or even more attempts at them, but you will most likely end up loving it every time and, at least in my experience, rarely, if ever, ever give up in anger because it's that fun and addicting.Would I say it's one of the best games I've ever played? eh, not really, but it's definitely up there high on the list. Reason for this is while yes, the game is fantastic and addicting, it's also really repetitive. This is probably it's biggest, and only flaw in my eyes of the game. Now don't get me wrong, each stage is set up to give you a new challenge to get to the boss, such as monsters are absent from the map so you can't level up, an avalanche can hit you causing you to lose all your armor and weapons, etc. but at it's core, it's the same thing each level. Grind early, reset time, buy items, grind a bit more, reset time, proceed to go through the stage, reset time, fight boss, go to next stage, repeat. If the thought of repeating the same core gameplay every stage doesn't appeal to you then I'd recommend watching a few videos on youtube or watching other people play it on twitch or something first to see if it really isn't your thing. If you can look past this flaw then you will most likely enjoy this game and for ten dollars, it's not too bad of a price if you can afford it.			"

												Brilliant, there more to this game than there first appears. You will play through different missions but keep the equipment you find on the way. Although the 30 second limit is there it can be extended by paying gold, but this then affects your score on the leaderboards. It has all the ingredients for a good RPG (You can even hire allies) but in quick time.			"

												Truthfully, going into this game, I didn't know what to expect. With the name telling me I have 30 seconds to complete a mission, I thought it was going to be very easy. This is far from the case. As others have mentioned, this game makes you think strategically about when to grind, when to spend your money, how to spend said money, when the best time to fight the boss would be, etc. It's this balance while forcing you to think on your feet that makes it so interesting. Some missions you may beat the first time, others, especially the bonus missions, may take you two, or three, or even more attempts at them, but you will most likely end up loving it every time and, at least in my experience, rarely, if ever, ever give up in anger because it's that fun and addicting.Would I say it's one of the best games I've ever played? eh, not really, but it's definitely up there high on the list. Reason for this is while yes, the game is fantastic and addicting, it's also really repetitive. This is probably it's biggest, and only flaw in my eyes of the game. Now don't get me wrong, each stage is set up to give you a new challenge to get to the boss, such as monsters are absent from the map so you can't level up, an avalanche can hit you causing you to lose all your armor and weapons, etc. but at it's core, it's the same thing each level. Grind early, reset time, buy items, grind a bit more, reset time, proceed to go through the stage, reset time, fight boss, go to next stage, repeat. If the thought of repeating the same core gameplay every stage doesn't appeal to you then I'd recommend watching a few videos on youtube or watching other people play it on twitch or something first to see if it really isn't your thing. If you can look past this flaw then you will most likely enjoy this game and for ten dollars, it's not too bad of a price if you can afford it.			"

												This game, its so much fun that its almost hard to describe. Every single level is its own miniature RPG, complete with story, villain, loot, and credits. Your objective is to save the world in thirty seconds, aided by the Goddess of Time in the likely chance that its impossible to do the whole thing in the alotted time. It's simple controls and laid back playstyle are unique, and completely intended to be a parody of the generic RPG. I highly recommend this as a quick fun way to kill time, and also as a long term game to try to complete to the fullest, as there are some missions featuring alternate pathways.10/10 would extend title again.

												Uhmmm initial recommendation.Game gets pretty difficult near the end.There are a lot of modes to play, and they're different enough but the essential theme is the same: you have 30 seconds to complete an objective, so do it.Except you have much more than that, really, because you can set the timer back to the start in the main campaign, so missions take a lot longer than 30 seconds.  What I expected was a hard limit of 30 seconds and a really small rpg goal, but what the game really is, is more of a standard kind of rpg with a quirky story.Combat is interesting, for sure, and the time mechanic works pretty well.Warning: there is at least one part in the story where if you listen to the navi-esque fairy, like YOU DO WHAT THE GAME TELLS YOU TO DO, you will get a game over.  This was maybe the only time I really got one aside from the final level and dude, I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥.There's plenty of game here for a 30 second-mission dealy-o, with a lot of collectibles and objectives for each mission as well as a target time to hit.I mean, check it out.  Just don't blame me if you hate it.			"

												edit: will be updating this review after I play it againLol. This game is great. It really is. Its a unique sort of arcadey take on RPGs. Its a lot of fun to play. I can't really say much else. Its something you have to try out for yourself. Its easy to just jump into and have fun with it.The music and visuals were nice - I much preferred the retro looking graphics. The newer ones looked kind of bad. You can change your visual setting so no biggie there.There were a lot of levels including hidden and alternate paths on the world map. Lots of things to gear your character out with which was cool.There are a few different game modes, but only one of them was really good. Doesn't hurt to have the extras though I suppose. Some problems were the game being locked to 720p - If you like the retro artstyle then its no biggie and the game will look played on a monitor with a larger native res. If you like the cartoony artstyle then it becomes a problem.Also, the multiplayer kinda' sucked because it had like no proper way to specifically play with friends or someone you want. It was so random. Not sure if anything relating it has been changed.Anyways, the couple flaws are easy to look past when the gameplay is so much fun. Its a fun take on a classic genre. Worth playing for certain.			"

												A game with great charm and a humorous parody poking lighthearted fun at more serious RPGs. The best thing about Half Minute Hero is the fast paced game play. Take any RPG and shorten it to 30 second quests and you get the idea! It is a novel idea and explored very well.The soundtrack and pixel graphics are top notch and fit the theme of this game nicely.There is a revamped new look in this version of Half Minute Hero which attempts to bring new life to the game, but it fails to accomplish this as it just simply looks awful and I switched back to pixel graphics which are far superior.To vary it up a bit, there are various different game modes that invoke various playstyles (on rails shooter, defending etc..) which are all fun but are short and none quite match up to the greatness of the main game mode.The story is not serious at all and is often predictable, cliche and humourous, which is what you expect to a parody of RPGs!It is the most complete collection of Half Minute Hero - I have played the PSP version before - and this steam version has all the content from this version and then some!

												Half Minute Hero is a game in which every level takes place in 30 seconds. But you can reset this 30 seconds by praying to the time goddess for more time. In those 30 seconds you will slay monster, dragons, demons, make allies, make pacts to the devil, reawaken an ancient weapon run by gear power for your disposal, train with the turtle hermit Roshi, defeat the black knight, make piles of gold, make multiple reference to different RPGs, animes, movies, and ride a dragon, all in the first mode of the game. After this first mode Hero 30 you'll unlock additional modes fill with the same fun. The game also offers a multiplayer mode where you and up to three of your friends can duke it out together only to fight each other at the end to beat the final boss of the map and be dubbed the True Hero and win the match. The game is wacky, fast-paced, and a lot of fun and I highly recommended it to anyone.			"

												I would give this game the full review, but the Multiplayer doesn't seem to work for me. Oh well, the Single Player is stable enough. (Any Buttons will be the Controller/Keyboard Layout)I stay Stable, It doesn't explain some elements, like holding the B/X Button to Dash. It's really helpful for getting around, although at the cost of your HP.The Achievements for the game are either terribly hard/cryptic to achieve, or downright easy. It ranges from Simply completing 5 levels of a mode, to having to defeat the Final Boss using only the Wood Sword (The weakest weapon in the game... You do not know how much grinding is needed for that)If the Multiplayer would work, I would review the community, but I can't.I'm not going to reccomend this game, for the simple fact the Sequel is now out on sale. I may do a review on that too when I get it. If you would like, you can read what I have to say on that.EDIT: Turns out the Multiplayer can only be accessed through NEO Cartoon Mode... I don't like that move. The Graphics in NEO Cartoon are just... nothing like Retro. Retro multiplayer would have been so much better.Still not giving the Reccomendation simply because the Sequel is there, and you can buy the bundle, which has This and The Second Coming for less than the Second Coming Alone. So get the bundle if you can and let me know of your opinions.			"

												Do you enjoy managing things? Puzzles? Witty writing that makes you smile a little? Then give this game a shot. Like the title states, you only have 30 seconds to save the world because some idiot continues to tell evil lords a magic spell that takes 30 seconds to cast. That's right, the game isn't 30 seconds long. Each evil lord is considered a ""level"" and you have 30 seconds to defeat him (there are exceptions. Each level has a statue you can use to turn back time in exchange for your hard earned in-game coin. There are no micro-transactions, if that wasn't clear.) You need to level up, find the right equipment, and get to the evil guy. leveling up is quick, yet you start over at level 1 each time you start a level. This game even has branching paths depending on how you beat the level. It's a clever little game. A clever little game indeed.			"

												Half Minute Hero (TL;DR) versionDo the Time Goddess' bidding and save the world from destruction! Nice fun game that you can do in quick bites.More in depth version;This is by far one of my favorite games, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes old school RPGs. In this game you play as a young boy who's goal is to save the world from total destruction (original plot right? But remember, it's making fun of itself.), and you only have 30 seconds to do this in before the world explodes! Sounds easy right? Well unfortunately for you, you're just an ordinary boy so this might actually become a real problem. Fear not though because luck is on your side this time and you'll soon be receiving a little help from a certain Time Goddess who will aid you in saving the world from this total destruction! Yay.This game parodies itself and parodies itself well, it parodies all those old classic RPGs we all grew up playing and have grown to love. The game really likes to poke fun at its self, making fun of such RPG tropes like ""grinding"" when really it only takes a few moments to level up. It's worth mentioning that while you only have technically 30 seconds to save the world, the lovely and not-selfish Time Goddess will allow you to turn back time, with a fee of course, and with this help is how it's all done in under 30 seconds.The story is really well done, with multiple paths and many endings, expect stages to have several different ways of tackling them, for instance you could just grind, grind and grind some more so your able to just over power the boss with brute force, or instead you can help one of the local NPCs with their own quest, who will then return the favor in defeating the boss a alternative way.By the way, this is only the first mode of the game! There are other modes I haven't mentioned here in detail but I can assure you that those other modes are just as fun. So that's it for my review, you have 30 seconds to get this game, unless you just so happen to know a Time Goddess, but then again Time Goddesses are not cheap so it's still probably a better option to just buy this game for a measly $9.99 or if on sale a HOLY COW $2.49 BUY IT NOW!!! Seriously you will not be disappointed with this one, there are many hours of gameplay here, and if you are someone who is looking for something that can be played in small bit-sized sessions, then this game just became an even better match for you (how is that possible!).

												Half Minute Hero is better described as a puzzle game rather than an RPG. With only 30 seconds on the clock, you will need to strategize well to min-max your time in ~60 quests. As a bonus, the game's cheeky humor making fun of typical RPG tropes (and itself) makes this a pretty entertaining experience.			"

												It's like a JRPG made for ADHD people... a ADHDJRPGOverall the game is pretty good, the story has a good sense of humor and the whole ""beat a level under 30 seconds"" game mechanic is quite unique although it does start to get repetitive after awhile. There is a bit of replay value though, there are titles for beating the missions in certain ways, items to find, allies to ally with, alternate paths in some missions and just simply trying to get the best completion time. The graphics look quite nice (the new graphics not the classic graphics) and the music and sounds are quite nice. I should also add that the dialog is actually quite nice. It's got a sort of adorable feel to it, through the dialog, graphics and humor. Did I say quite nice a few too many times? Yes I did. Anway I give it 4 out of 5 gottagofasts.			"

												Do you enjoy managing things? Puzzles? Witty writing that makes you smile a little? Then give this game a shot. Like the title states, you only have 30 seconds to save the world because some idiot continues to tell evil lords a magic spell that takes 30 seconds to cast. That's right, the game isn't 30 seconds long. Each evil lord is considered a ""level"" and you have 30 seconds to defeat him (there are exceptions. Each level has a statue you can use to turn back time in exchange for your hard earned in-game coin. There are no micro-transactions, if that wasn't clear.) You need to level up, find the right equipment, and get to the evil guy. leveling up is quick, yet you start over at level 1 each time you start a level. This game even has branching paths depending on how you beat the level. It's a clever little game. A clever little game indeed.			"

												The game itself is hella fun. I know that because I had it on the Xbox 360. The reason I'm giving it a Thumbs Down is because the game is bugged for me. The map always goes to the top left, so I can't see any of the paths for the missions. Then add to the fact that there's no name changing option. And the game flat out crashes when steam cloud is disabled. I would assume there was some porting issues from the console version. When it works though, it is very fun, and I know that because I remember spending hours in front of the TV to beat Hero 3 Mode. (Which I did end up beating) A shame that I can't do that in PC because of bad porting.It's highly unlikely that they would patch the game considering they have limited man power and they released the sequel to this game. Last patch seems to be back in 2012.EDIT: Well, I found a fix for the screen issue, via unplugging and plugging in my controller. The name changing can be fixed via some more complicated method of removing the game's steam cloud saves. But to be fair, that's still a hassle to do. I'll keep my review as not recommended just due to the sheer amount of issues the game has.			"

												Don't take this game seriously.No, really, don't.If you can't tell from the title and the concept of the game, it's a silly game. If you can embrace that, and slog through the mediocre gameplay, it's great for a few laughs. It burns through ALL the fantasy game tropes at a blinding pace, and does so somewhat compitantly. It might not be enough to make up for some of the failings of this game, but it will for some people. so yea, pick it up if your thinking you'll be ok with that.Don't go in looking for a chalange or anything overly complex. this is not that kind of game.Play for the sillyness. not much else to it, and I don't think that's necisaraly a bad thing...

At that point I had a decision to make. I could either use my filthy snot covered manos to continue to a town and stop the clock OR I could run to the bathroom next to my room and attempt to clean it off and run back to my room to attempt to get to a town without making my keyboard all gross.

												Interesting concept, fun at first, but quickly grows easy, dull, and repetitive.  Each board starts you at level 1 and gives you 30 seconds to run around and kill bad guys to level up and get gold which you use to buy equipment, heal up, or reset time.  Fighting happens automatically with your only options being to 1. Increase your attack speed while doing damage to yourself; 2. Run away; or 3. heal yourself during the battle if you've bought an herb.  Boards generally have multiple villages/towns/caves/etc that you can visit to talk to villagers and get various things.  Some boards have splitting paths or side missions/characters you can get for that board only.  You grind up enough levels until it says you're a higher level than the boss, then you go and defeat him at his castle.     The problem with the game is that you're doing all of this for every single board.  Essentially, once you've played 3-4 boards, you've seen the whole game.  Most maps come down to whether you're a high enough level to beat the boss.  If you are, go fight boss, if not, then go grind some more until you are.  Dying in combat doesn't penalize you in any way that I've noticed, you simply go back to the starting village.  At the worst, you might have to run 3 seconds to get back to where you were.  It can actually be helpful to die at times if you're low on time and need to get back to the start village to reset the timer.  Also, for some strange reason, the game shows you what stats equipment increases but doesn't bother telling you what the stats actually mean.  I'm still not sure if weight is supposed to be a helpful or bad stat?  You can replay boards, but in order to do so, you must de-equip any equipment that you received on that board or after it, which is often a hassle.  Also, the inventory system for your equipment is a mess, making it annoying to find what you want to equip.The main factor in the game is supposed to be the time you have to complete a board, but it's often the least important factor.  This is because every board gives you the ability to reset the timer back up to 30 seconds while keeping all your stuff.  The cost of doing this goes up each time you do it during a board, but the cost is very minimal.  Resetting time once costs 100 gold, 2nd time costs 200 gold, and so on.  The problem is that you can grind out 500-1200 gold during those 30 seconds, so not having enough gold to reset the timer is almost never an issue and you'll have leveled up significantly during that time.  Most boards can be completed resetting the timer just once or twice, as you'll already be stronger than the boss by then.  Being able to reset the timer removes any sort of meaningful challenge from the game.     There's not enough happening in this game to keep it interesting.  Quests often devolve down into fetch quests or go there and kill that thing.  Side characters are almost always useless since you can quickly grind up levels and beat the board without them.  Equipment is nice, but I'm still unsure on what some of the stats mean, and being a higher level negates the need for good equipment anyway.  The only useful equipment I found were the swimming gear to swim around on water boards, or the weapons that allow you to 1 hit kill certain monster types, but those are almost always only useful for killing some otherwise invincible mini-boss to complete a sidequest.  Being able to reset the timer makes the main draw of the game pointless.  They should've set the clock for 2 minutes with no way to reset, called the game 2 Minute Hero, and made players deal with the time limitation.  This would've made exploring boards more tense and actually given some meaning and challenge to the game.  Instead, it's just a pale imitation of the game that it should have been.			"

												Back in the days before DIablo and The Elder Scrolls ruled the land, Japanese RPGs  were king. Run throughout the land, gaining levels and equipment until you meet the biggest, baddest, eviliest cliche' in the game and kill him. No stat and skill trees to master, no pointless customization, just you on a quest to vanqish an evil that's almost always different than the one you originally set out to defeat. Just you and your countless hours spent grinding away.This game is all that, except each nefarious fiend must be killed in less than 30 seconds. While this sounds impossible and at least somewhat silly, the way the game presents itself makes it one of the best JRPGs I've ever played.The game is basically seperated into over 100 mini RPGS with a small overworld in each where you run around and defeat monsters to gain enough power to defeat the resident Evil Lord before it casts its world destroying super evil spell of evil, in 30 seconds. Since it is basically impossible to even get to the baddie in half a minute, the benevolent Time Goddess will reset time for you at any point, for a fee of course, giving you another 30 seconds to level up, make it to the boss, and kill him. Along the way you gather new equipment that you can keep across stages, although your level resets after every boss, This all may sound overly simplistic, but there is a lot more under the hood than it seems at first glance. Beat the game and you unlock new modes to play. Complete challenges and sidequests in each stage. Multiplayer, anyone? There is a lot of content for a game that expects you to save the world in 30 seconds!If you liked the old-school JRPGs like Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior, this game will make you smile so wide it will connect in the back and your head will fall off. If you just need a quick game to play on break or whenever you have a few minutes to kill, this is better than most.			"

												Half-minute hero is what you'd call a parody on RPGs - you've got the leveling system, enemies, and bosses all scrunched up in a tight little package that encourages playing as fast as possible. In truth, it plays more like a multi-level time attack game: can you save the world in 30 seconds, or do you need to extend it to make the deadline?That being said, the entire feel of the game is a bit... ""whatever."" Combat is automatic, NPCs do nothing when not helping you forward the quest, and the humor is perhaps a bit simple. Most of the game is bashing sticks together until you get a positive result, and optionally fine-tuning the mechanics so you can make it within 30 seconds (which can take a few tries).It's hard to find a game to compare it to, but if you've played flash games, it's in a similar vein; simple premise, simple execution. Perhaps a bit too simple, as the game randomly throws rewards at you while not making failure threatening. There are hints that the game may have some secrets, but with the meat of the game feeling like a mess of random junk incoherently thrown together, the details don't compensate.I don't like writing negative reviews, especially not when I've only had an hour's playtime, but there's just nothing to captivate the imagination here.

												As you can guess by the title, this is a very quirky game.....which is why you should buy it! I've played it before on the PSP and it really is a good game. Its got lots of humor and unique gameplay. This PC release has new graphics but I urge you to give the retro graphics a try. The retro graphics option was how the game originally looked like on the PSP and I think it's better that way. It enhances the charm of the game, in my opinion. Plus, with the retro graphics option, this game is playable on pretty much any computer. This game is also perfect for short play sessions. Each level is no longer than 5 minutes. There are 2 challenges for each level but the game only gives you a one word hint. You can keep playing without passing these challenges but going back to each level trying to figure out how to pass these little challenges makes for great replay value. With multiple modes, unique gameplay, and lots of humor, there is no reason to not pick up Half Minute Hero during a sale.			"

												I used to play the original Half-Minute Hero all the time on the PSP, and loved it. This game goes a little more in-depth, but keeps all the fun and gameplay from the original. I would highly recommend this game to all rpg-lovers, and to people who like adventure games as well. 30-second intervals can turn into 1-5 minute intervals... Still a good time-safe game that you can play while waiting around or something.			"

												You like fast action games? Retro game that make you feel... um... RUSHING? This is bring your answer. Half Minute Hero is fast pact action game that let you browse (a bit) large world, get companion trough the story, and save the world only just 30 SECONDS! First launcing for PSP and now turn into better game. What are you waiting for? Buy it and play! +)PLUS- 8 Bit retro game that didnt have to take seriously- Fast pact action- Simple gameplay- Multiple ending- Very challenging achivement and game mode- Fun music- Feels like a hero (LOL)- Funny stories (trust me!)- Full controller support that make easier to play-)MINUS- Although its rare to meet people in multiplayer lobby- If you beat it rush, its only take almost 7 hours to complete it (im already finished it on PSP)Its only my review of this game. So if i wrong, please correct me :D-Narendra Mrs			"

												The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing.			"

												If we looking from the behind the idea of the game, thats brilliant. You have a 30 seconds to save world and you must do every thing in that time, like leveling up, taking weapons and armor, talking npcs and defeating boss. This is a fun game if you like time countdown like games, but for me i dont like thats kinda games. you have limited times to do everything and every new level starting from the zero, quest looks like same every time.

There are parts that can be challenging if you want to unlock specific things like equipments and whatnot, but other than that, it's a breeze. It SEEMS hard at first, but once you get the play style it gets quite easy. Can't say I played a game quite like this.

The game gets boring really quick maybe that's why you can call yourself half-minute hero :\ because you got bored after half a minute.+Achievements for those who like to grind-No steam cards and pretty high price for such a game.

												You have 30 seconds to save the world from oblivion! ...Wait, that's it? And after you beat it the credits roll? So how in the world is this title supposed to keep your attention for more than a minute?Well to begin with there's 30 stages, and you have to save the world in 30 seconds each time. In reality each stage is likely to take you more than a minute to complete, as time is halted in town (except in hard mode) and you will likely make use of the time-reset function to buy more time.In a weird way this game is like Warioware. You basically have a short minigame with some new rules or mechanics introduced each time.It's... simple, and yet surprisingly stimulating. You have to make snap decisions, since, well, you have 30 seconds!Once you've cleared the first 30 stages, you'll find even more modes of play! And if you play in classic mode, you'll find a whopping 60+ stages, as they differ from neo mode. When you've cleared most of the content, you open up Hero 3 which gives you all of... 3 seconds to clear the stage. It's every bit as hard as it sounds.I give this game an 8/10. I enjoyed its self-awareness and silly humor. It certainly kept me busy for 12 hours. In a good way. Thanks wraith!			"

												A niche concept and simle graphics are, aparently all I need to have fun with a game. This, however, offer's so much more! There's tons of levels, allthough the replayability seem's to suffer. Also, the choice to return to the original version's graphics seem's like a realy cool feature.			"

												I'm a half minute hero every day, sometimes it only takes me 20 seconds. Anyway I don't think a $10 flashgame should be on steam. Luckily I got this from a humble bundle (A filler so they can sell their (for the most part) ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bundles) so I'm not worried about playing it, its not that bad but it isn't worth any money.			"

												Half Minute hero is an extreamely simple RPG that anyone can take up and play for a couple hours. its the type of game you play to kill a few minutes inbetween activities of the day, or if you just need a break between games. Its has an addictive charm to it that will keep you coming back for more, and if the mastering the main quest wasn't such a fun task, their is also half minute villian, and half minute princess to keep you occupied even longer. This is well worth the purchase.			"

												Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy is the pinnacle of modern gaming.With the passing of time, also comes a shortening of the attention spans of the modern day youth. It is for this reason that i believe that Half Minute Hero can change the gaming industry. -The play sessions that i have had with this game have been very short, yet rewarding (the same can be applied to my sex life.)-The controls feel intuitive and does not take too much effort to master, especially if you own a controller.-The title is absurdly long which justifies the high price. Steam charges real estate by the letter (except for reviews because it's free advertisment.)Buy it. You know you want it. It's the game for you!			"

												If you've been looking into getting into RPGs but don't have time to invest 60+ hours into a game, then this is the perfect RPG for you! Half Minute Hero is streamlined RPG at its most addictive - level up, beat the UBG (ultimate bad guy), then move on. But what makes this game even more compelling is its uproarious sense of humor and the splendid retro soundtrack - I rarely laugh so much while playing a game. This is a gem - one that you won't regret playing. 9/10			"

												Not a fan of the graphics, especially the storyline images. I dont like anime style  and the retro graphics scenes are too pixelated (even more than old nes games). The point of the game surrounding 30 seconds makes the game seem like a big joke and I cant take it seriously. The fight scenes are pointless, holding down buttons too see who wins. Whats the point? No challenge, you either win or loose. I dont recommend this game.			"

												I started out thinking this was more like a puzzle game, but after playing a bit it lost all its shine. It initially seems puzzling because you dont understand the game, however after you understand you can farm more than it takes to reset the timer the game becomes far less about figuring out every level. What are you left with? Setting high scores, which is running a 30s level over and over and over again until you set a high score. Not my cup of tea. It is a fun concept but I personally need something far more engaging.			"

												I don't get all the love for this game.  you don't really seem to do anything, just move a character on an overworld map, all the battles are automatic, all you seem to do is use healing items when needed.  I am an onld school JRPG player and thought I would like the game for the nostalgia, but the lack of actually game play left me disapointed.

												Being a long time HMH fan, owning it on PSP Xbox and now PC I can say without no trace of doubt that this is one of the best games ever made. The idea itself is simple, finish a level in a 30 second timeslot. While this sounds easy enough on paper, in game it makes every level, battle and quest a hectic race to go as fast as possible. Each level is its own RPG, with multiple ways to finish it, multiple quests and of course multiple characters to which you can ally yourself with.In game you have the oppurtunity to select which graphics style you prefer (Either NEO Cartoon mode or 16Bit mode). These choices will affect the game greatly, and you will want to finish this game twice just to see the different cutscenes.Without spoiling the start of the game, I can say with assurance that once you give this game 10 minutes, you will never stop playing. Half Minute Hero is, and always will be, one of the best RPGs ever made.10/10			"

For a game that focuses on 30 seconds of play, it pauses all the freaking time (like going into town and having dialogue), and is cursed by the existence of its plot.

												Disclaimer: did not finishThis game tries to be funny and I didn't laugh; I think if its humor had worked on me, my experience would have been really different.  Humor aside, this is a game where you play essentially a speedrun of a distilled RPG - bad guy will destroy world, you grind, kill bad guy.  You finish one level, and the next one is the same, but with a twist (maybe you need a key, or a boat, or there's a sidequest, or whatever) but the challenge is the same- how can I get this done in <30s?  (or <1m30s, or whatever; you can get a small number of 30s time boosts on each level after the first few).Ultimately, if you aren't laughing, the fact that each level is extremely simple and similar to the previous starts to grate on you.  Then you turn the game off and move on.			"

												I know I'm long-winded, so I'll keep this  simple. This is trash. To it's credit, it has multiple stories, and if you change the ""graphics"" mode, you are actually replaying them with completely different gameplay (and sometimes mechanics) However, all of it practically plays itself, its so bloody easy. Flash quality throughout. Now onto the humor. This is not a deconstruction of the RPG genre. It comes off as juvenile rather than a proper parody. You  feel like they aren't insiders coming up alongside you and saying""you know, for all that they see us as ridiculous, we love it"".

												Could have been betterThis is by far one of the best indie RPG titles I've played in a while except it has a lot of flaws.1. There is no customization (which is important in an rpg)2. There are no characters besides the one you start off with (aka no parties)3. No Combat System (its all about the story) *The battles are automated* (would have been better if it was turned based*4. its an average rpg story, could have been better written.pros 1. Great music (it kept me wanting to play the game)2. smooth and nice looking visual effects (except for when you're traveling around the main map) 3. Had a Final Fantasy I - II fibe to it (would have been better if the creator tried to make it a FF kockoff.)4. good battle animations, (would have been better if it was a turn based game)After playing the game I'd personally would rate it a 5/10 it was a nice new experience but not something I'd recommend. I really would have loved this game if it would have been turn based combat and if it didn't have a linear storyline.			"

												I don't know about this game. It is equal parts fun and frustrating. While I like the idea of a time trial-based game, I am not completely sold on how this one is formatted. Every time you complete a mission, it seems like your stats and level is reset, and the fact that it goes to credits after every mission, then go through the intro menu EVERY TIME is really irritating and unnessecary. I'm not sold on the way the fighting sequences are set up either. With no real control over what your character does, it seems almost like an afterthought. There is also the fact that if you somehow  run out of money, you're pretty much screwed, because you can't pay the Goddess to turn back time in villages. Overall, I give this game a ""meh"" rating. It in not worth more than what I payed for it: $1.99.			"

Even if you lose a level, you don't have to worry about going through a long and lengthy process to get back to where you were, because as you play, you get more efficient. The art style is amazing for anyone looking to play an epic fantasy, or a classic 16-bit game, this game has them both, and they can make it seem like you are playing an entirely differant game.

												You've got 30 secs to save the world! oh noes!Gotta go fast!A parody of the typically slow, grindy, complicated and expansive plotdriven J-RPG, it condenses the game into much simpler 30 second stages. You will need both the reflexes and the smarts to plan an optimal route to beat the clock!Speedrunners and RPG fans will get the most kick out of this game. It's also a fantastic, fresh experience for any other players interested and well worth the few bucks it costs when on sale.I highly reccomend playing to beat the >time<, not the game. Go for the gold, and go beyond!30 secs to do everything sounds daunting, but you have the option to pray (aka bribe) to the time goddess and reset the clock. Kill some random monsters and you can buy yourself some leeway. This is necessary for the much larger stages and gives even casual players the oppurtunity to get through the game easily.But you're not a filthy casual, are you? You're a huge nerd with the penchant for speedrunning! Enjoy reverse engineering the game mechanics, planning routes and equipment, executing optimal frame-perfect runs, and feeling great about yourself as you destroy your friends' inferior records. Kill those leaderboards, KILL THEM! Many levels can actually be completed under 30 secs without praying a single time. You'd be surprised how the people on the leaderboards got there. (the legitimate ones, that is)EXTRA DETAILS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~= Port Features/Differences =This Steam version mirrors the xbox version. It is missing 1 level that is exclusive to the PSP, but has a different set of 7 stages and equipment (the time beast route). Some levels, items, and mechanics have changed as well; the wiki is somewhat inaccurate in some areas. You can play in the original 8bit style or the new neocartoon look. I reccomend neocartoon for larger resolutions. Multiplayer mode is expanded from the xbox counterpart, but unfortunately very few people are around to play it.= ""60+ RPG Games and Extra Modes"" =The flavor text at the steam page is somewhat misleading. The game advertises itself as 60+ seperate full RPGs; its more truthful to identify them as seperate levels. The main game consists almost entirely of Hero 30 and Hero 300. Knight 30, Evil Lord 30, Princess 30, and so on are advertised as ""extra modes"" but are in fact seperate chapters that are still relevant to the plot and serve to bridge Hero 30 to Hero 300. The important thing to note is that the graphics you chose matter in these modes:- If you play in neo-cartoon mode, Knight 30, Evil Lord 30 and Princess 30 become very short single-level chapters. You'll play different characters with slightly different mechanics, but it will mostly be identical to hero 30.- If you play in the original 8bit retro-mode, these same chapters become completely different, fleshed out mini-games each with thier own set of levels.= Bug =Sometimes entering holes teleport you out of the map and unable to complete the level. It may also cause the game to crash after a level ends. To fix this, you'll have to verify the cache. This glitch is prevalent in quest #22.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Quest #30 (Cursed Hero) is the best level.At least play through that.It is a better love story than Twilight.			"

												I'd like to start out by stating what may not be obvious at first, Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy is a combination of the PSP and XBox versions of the game.  If you've played either version, or both then you aren't missing much here.  With that said I this review (like most I suppose) are based entirely on what you believe to be important in a game.The premise of half minute hero is that an evil lord is working a spell to destroy the world, and you have 30 seconds to grind, upgrade your equipment, complete quests and defeat the 'Evil Lord'.  As frantic as it sounds (and can be) you have the Goddess of Time on your side, but as we all know Time is Money, and she will charge you for resetting the clock - while this isn't entirely burdensome it does become expensive quickly which encourages you to move quickly through each quest.The battle system is pretty straight forward requiring very little outside of keeping an eye on your health and using an herb if needed.The PC version has three modes: Hero 30 (which is RPG based), Evil Lord 30 (revolves around summoning minions) and Princess 30 (shooting), plus three unlockable modes (which I honestly haven't unlocked yet).The PC version also includes two graphics modes, retro and 8-bit which was released with the XBox version.  Personally I enjoy the retro look, but that's simply a matter of opinion.The charm and replayability of Half Minute hero is in the humor, multiple branching stories, collectible titles, and equipment.  Although the humor didn't always hit the mark with me, it was still charming in it's own right and although I haven't played through the entire Hero 30 (which is the core game-mode) I did find that collecting titles and unlocking branches could become a little onerous since some of the tasks and hints can be oblique, even with assistance from your caravan.I was initially hesitant to make this purchase because many of the reviews I had read weren't descriptive enough for me (which I hope this fixes for others), but overall I would give this game an 7/10, and dispite it's shortcomings there is more than enough content to justify $9.99, especially if you haven't played the PSP or XBox versions, if you have and you're still interested I would wait until this goes on sale.

												This game is awesome!  I played it long ago on the PSP and I'm happy to be able to play it on Steam, now with achievements.  :D  If you like RPG's and you like 8-Bit fun, then you'll love this game!  The original game only had 8-Bit graphics, but they made some awesome additions to the game when they ported it over to the PC including a revamped graphics engine.  You can switch it back to the original 8-Bit if you like, but it's fun to play it either way.  I'm currently enjoying the new graphics and once I beat it, I'll replay levels with the original graphics when I go back for achievements I missed.  In addition to the main RPG story mode, there are several other modes to play to keep the enjoyment going, including a really hard speedrun mode for all of you hardcore players.  Tons of replay value with this one!  Buy it if you love old school games!  ^_^			"

												You end up with the ""stress"" of the 30 second limit but nevertheless it is a great game. The graphics can be changed and honestly I love both the NEO cartoon and retro modes. But although everyone thinks you have ONLY 30 seconds to finish the level but thanks to a character you are able to get more than 30 seconds by resetting the clock. But the creator made it in a way that you dont wan't to do it often. I also like the different gameplays. You get to play as different characters after you unlock them and there are a few different ways of attacking for each player. But thats in NEO cartoon mode. When you change the graphics you actually change the game. In NEO cartoon mode the battles are automatic like hero 30 mode. But in Retro mode you battle completley different. And that just makes it more fun.For those people that like story it has a good story about a 500 year old war and the many complications of the story. But also for the RPG players it has a few levels where you travle around and do ""complicated"" quests. But who can forget comedy it is involved with lots of jokes and a few references.I do not see any reason not to buy this game. (unless you are waiting for it to go on sale.)			"

												This game is pretty fun, but it gets quite repetitive quickly. All you have to do is guide your character in various directions to fight monsters and buy items, but you have only 30 seconds to beat the level. You can reset the clock for some money, which you will undoubtedly have to do at  least twice for most levels. For the fighting system, there really isn't one, everything is automatic except for when you use a healing item. You really don't need much experience with videogames to do well in this one.			"

												I've played this game so many times, and I keep on getting back to it. I thought maybe I'd write a review on it.It's a fast-paced game, but it's not unfair. There's an engine which makes it possible to complete with ease on 30 seconds (actually takes longer irl to do it, even though the game time flows just like real life time). This is possible due to the engine they added, which makes the game so interesting and it's not unfair at all, not to mention it's a genious engine. I find myself finishing the stages with spare time.I also find myself coming back to this game everytime to play it over and over again, either to remember the storyline (yes, I bought this game quite a while ago) or to try and get some of the achievements I didn't have.I think I've finished the last boss fight 3 or more times already, and it still is pretty interesting and awesome.Although it's hard to find players to play multiplayer nowadays, I can easily see your money being well-spent for the single-player levels only. As for the multiplayer level: If you have a friend to play with, I can easily see you both having loads of fun trying to cooperate while fighting each other to be the true hero on multiplayer. Or you could also try tagging the multiplayer levels yourself! I haven't finished all the multiplayer levels by myself because some are hard to be done alone, but by editing your starting status, it becomes easier.Also, I highly reccommend having a controller for the game. I have a PS2 controller with an USB port, which I use to play this game. I actually haven't tried the keyboard controls, but I have a friend who uses them, and he says they're not hard to get used to and he also thinks this game is fun.			"

												Silly and fun, this game is entertaining and can actually be played in chunks of 30sec.  Despite this, it's still possible to play ""one more time"" and look up again an hour or two later.  It takes level grind and distills it to its basic components so that you can grind ten levels in the span of a minute or less -- basically taking that Skinner Box and mashing the reward button so hard your brain might short out.

												WELCOME to the only RPG that has-          `no controlable combat system          `near 0 customisation          `almost completley linear storyline          `a leveling system that resets after each area          `no voice acting          `and some of the most fun gameplay you will ever see!First off if you do buy this game and dont enjoy the first few levels i can safley say that you wont enjoy the game. The games runs on the idea of been fast (very fast) and rediculous. every level features a new boss who is trying to cast a spell to destroy the world because [incert weird motive here]and it is up to you to defeat him before he does (30 seconds) don't be foold by that though, each level generally takes a few minutes to do because you have help from the goddesswho resets your time if you get to a check point and have enough moneythis is where you will find you most intence moments, experiencing the relief of getting to a rest zone with less than a second left is fantastic, until you realise you dont have enough money to reset the time....other tings to mention are the the graphics and soundtrack. Both feel like an old nintendo game which give it a unique feel. Summary:  The game has a very good unique feel to it, and a over the top intence concept, great level design and characters,    That will give you at least several hours of entertainment if you take to it. I highly recomend.			"

												This game is... alright. It's a better pick-up-and-play game than it is a game you play long sessions of. Fairly lighthearted, pretty simple in concept but each battle does try to mix things up a little. I played through the story to the end (Hero 300) and it never felt like it got ""old"", but I feel like there were things that could've been done better.First and foremost, if you run out of time... why not just reset you back to the last point where you reset time instead of making you redo everything? I feel that would've been super easy to do, but nope, gotta restart the whole thing, which is really tedious. Really this is my one big complaint, it would've made the game a lot more fun and less stressful. I can nitpick about some other small things (some of the challenges feelng like filler, flee buttons literally never working for me, the overly-strictness of hero 300 despite it being one of the longest levels in the game, etc.) but really the main problems come down to this.If you want a fast-paced puzzle/RPG hybrid with some lightheartedness and not a looot of replayability but a decent bit of it (there's time challenges and titles and stuff that I couldn't be bothered to complete, meh) then you'll probably enjoy this, I'd probably put this game at ""meh"" if I had the option to but it's definitely alright enough to recommend, sure.

												Half Minute Hero. Is half of minute enough to be Hero? And... well, I won't spoil the fun. Just keep in mind that Half Minute Hero is not only a game where you are Hero. Anyway, half of minute It's more than enough. It's plenty of time to level up, buy some stuff and beat the main boss... with little help of someone, but you need plenty of money for that.This game was one of main reasons to get PSP console. I did that, played and completed Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy few years ago and now it's avaible here, on Steam. With achievements! This reason alone was good to jump into magical world of half minute to do everything once again. Graphics, at least retro graphics, looks amazing. The characters, story, music is great. It's very fun to play. Longer or shorter sitting, it's perfect for both. Half Minute Hero is perfect way to describe a parody game.Earlier there wasn't deal like that but if you will buy the sequel game, you will get Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy for free. In my opinion, that's a great deal. It's a game for many hours, even more if you enjoy to 100% your games. It's something different and I love when devs come up with something original. Lately games are missing it so if you aren't scared of trying something new, then try it. I didn't regret it and I will gladly continue being a Hero, or someone else, in the sequel.			"

												What appears to be a fun game at first, quickly becomes very repetitive if going for full completion. While titles seem like they give out obvious hints from their name on how to do them, there is no clear explanation for some of them and it can be a real pain to figure them out. Example: Getbacker title - you need to get pushed back by the water.. but how many times? How many prayers are allowed or can it only be done in 1 prayer? Where exactly can you do it and in what order? No matter which way I try, it just won't register.The soundtrack is great, though!			"

												This game is a BLAST. Not everyone's cup of tea, for sure, but it is a quirky, EXTREMELY fast-paced (as the title says) JRPG... thing that definitely brings a smile to my face.Basically, you have 30 seconds per level to save the world from a terrible spell. A greedy, snarky Time Goddess helps you by rewinding time... that is, IF you pay her good coin to do that!You run around trying to level up and solve quests within the extremely restrictive time limit.This game gleefully lampshades every and all JRPG cliches, with its cheerful dialogue and wacky characters.I especially like the way the game world is visually presented, because you get to choose between two very distinct graphics settings: retro pixelart-ish goodness and stylized cartoonish graphics!It also has online leaderboards to compete with your friends if that's your thing :)All in all, this game is cheap, fast-paced and (if you like the whole retro JRPG aesthetics, and I know I do) beautiful.

I Have this game on both My PSP go and PS vita Both with the same save file and I got 95% of the game compled so far on the PSP version(And The Only Item I need Left in This Original Version Is Balmung). Now 3 things are missing in the PC version that was in the Orginal PSP version The Goddess Room, Music Player (To get it on PSP Beat Hero 3 And I also got it), and The Another Goddess Quest (to get on PSP First you don't save the village from the Volcano from the Fire Mountain quest THEN You have to beat 108 Evil Lords (Repeats Allowed so Beat whoever mutiple time) in Total). I like how the 8 bit Graphies looks it makes the game works but the Neo cartoon Graphies just look UGLY to me And That version Is where Evil Lord 30, Princess 30, and Knight 30 is like There own version of Hero 30 Feels weird to me but there Ok. The Xbox version And PC Has 8 quests Thats not in the PSP version(And am Not a Xbox person Im a Playstation person). Atleast Mutiplayer is Online while the PSP version is just AD HOD. I got the PC version for free because of getting the 2nd game as a bunile (I wish it came out on the PS vita(or PSP)). In My opinion The Orignal PSP version is better. I got True Hero Overall Rank on Both Versions Still wish the 2nd game came out on PSvita (or PSP) 8.9 PSP in my opinion I highly Recommend This Version (Need some one to play with you on Ad Hod)(Want to get the Good Equitment in AD HOD Mode) It's The Best version to me. with Those 3 things. (How Do I get The True Hero (Overall and some Quests) Rank Again If You Lose It For The PSP?) And For Hero 300 I'm Having Troble Trying to Beat That Snake Superboss On my PSPgo (And PSvita) And Don't Have it on the PC version.7.5 PC in my opinion I sorta Recommend This version (At least Mutiplayer is Online and I can play mutiplayer on my own) It's ok Some Changes I did not like. NOT Everything is on This Version.Update- The Alt Ending Route Is On Both Versions of PC and Xbox.-as for the Lord Haders level mess up the Count of Numbers in Qusets of Hero 30 And As For Overlord Hol I had to be over Level 60 to beat him level 65 why? (In The Original PSP Version You Have to be level 35 to beat him(My quickest time on My PSP with the Last Battle on Hero 30 is 1min and 59secs)) And This version Confusses Beast killer for Silver Spear and Silver Spear for Beast Killer FTW Why?- Enjoy! (I may Edit this Review Later. Ok?)  I Beat the 2nd Game I Writen A (somewhat) Review on it  and For HOARD That I also Have Both Versions PSP (And PSvita Again) and PC. Have Fun!			"

												Una sorpresa fresca e originaleUn gioco banale? Assolutamente no, anzi per dirla tutta si è rivelato un ottimo RPG con un suo stile particolare. È l'antiZelda per eccellenza con un'ottima longevità. La quest principale è di per sé sufficiente a giustificarne l'acquisto. Lo scopo del gioco è ripetitivo, ma la quantità di oggetti, armi e bivi spinge a rigiocare molti livelli. Un gioco  di ruolo ridotto all'essenziale, giocabile anche per qualche minuto senza problemi. La brevità è il suo punto forte anche se per completare la prima parte occorreranno diverse ore, soprattutto se si cerca di ottenere tutti i bonus e/o tempi migliori.Ironico, in grado di stravolgere i canoni classici degli rpg trazionali. Visivamente  piacevole con la doppia possibilità di scelta dello stile grafico. Non avendo completato ancora le altre quest posso solo dargli un 7/8, meritato in gran parte dalla capacità di costringermi a giocarlo in maniera quasi compulsiva. Assolutamente da avere e da giocare, zero tempi morti, in 30 secondi se ne fanno di cose...no? Provare per credere! Durante i saldi è venduto ad un prezzo ridicolo, meglio non farselo sfuggire.			"

												This is an almost over the top cute game. I like the mechanic that you have to do everything in a soft 30 seconds, but it's almost to the point where you will spend more time in the credits screen and talking with people instead of actually doing anything. It's definitly possible that later on in the game this will happen, I feel that I'm still in the introductory part, so here's hoping.			"

												Clever concept executed beautifully- this game has tons of replayability and a gradual difficulty curve, even if the dialogue is, at times, nonsensical and groan-worthy. The playful tone and cartoonish graphics may make this seem like child's play, but the lightning pace and puzzle-oriented RPG-style levels will make it clear that you are wrong on so, so many levels.In short- buy this game. Cherish it forever.			"

												This game is perfect for the gamer-on-the-go. I'm a busy guy! Whether I'm off trying to solve mysteries with my talking dog, using my time machine to stop crimes before they happen, or simply practicing my ability to hovertate, I simply DO NOT have the time to play other longer RPGs which involve things like reading and talking to other human beings. Half-Minute Hero is perfect me, in this sense. It's an RPG which unfolds across a 30 second timer and it slots into my hectic day perfectly, somewhere between tea with the Queen of England and my translation of the Voynich manuscript.			"

												If you're impatient (like I am) when it comes to RPGs, here's the game for you. Alright I take it back, this isn't an RPG, this is a puzzle game with some Action RPG elements that requires fast fingers and just as fast thinking.To summarize the game, you're Hero. Hero's job is to run around attacking monsters with his face. As you run around the landscape you'll get into random battles where Hero shows his expertise in that field. After thiry seconds, the world ends so you need to kill loads of monsters to level up, get better gear and heal occasionally, and defeat the boss before time runs out. Oh, and you're working with the Time Goddess (whose cartoon version has great hips that I can't stop looking at) so you can turn back time to thirty seconds at any point and keep all of your stuff. After you beat the boss, you lose just about everything sans your equpiment and go onto the next level. Repeat as much as necessary. There are also other characters but the updated (this is a remade port from the original PSP game) cartoony graphics version only has Hero's first and last story in full while heavily abridging the other characters (along with removing their unique gameplay styles) to which I blame laziness. If you want to play the original game with its pixels and great anime-fantasy art (which is much more lacking for the cartoon version later on), that's an option as well. Also the music's awesome.Watch on Youtube to get a better idea of this game because I don't think that I summarized it very well.			"

Score: 8/10Similar GamesHeroes of Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes, Tales of VesperiaSummaryYou are some hero dude. The spell of destruction is being cast and the world will end in 30 seconds. Chosen by the time goddess you become the warrior of the goddess. Though the goddess loves money above all else so every time you want to turn back the clock you'll have to pay up. Various weapon, and armor upgrades are spread out throughout the levels. Sometime the level will give multiple ways of finishing it and sometimes doing so will lead to separate paths. The run at each other combat is automatic unless you have a special item. You must find who is spreading the spell of destruction and stop him.PositiveThe game levels play out a lot like different puzzles which is great. It makes fun of itself and the JRPG genre in delightful ways. The soundtrack is nice and retro. It offers two different graphic modes. Once you beat the main story other gameplay modes gradually unlock. It is important to note that Princess 30, Knight 30, and Evil Lord 30 are different in retro mode then in cartoon graphic mode which means even more variety. Finding all the secrets in the levels is actually pretty fun.NegativeThe gameplay does repeat itself and it very fast paced so it can wear on you. This is a port of a port and the menu setup is not the greatest if your hoping to customize controls or options. I used a 360 controller and it worked great by default, but the button prompts always show keyboard keys. They don't explain hardly anything so you'll have to look at guides to even know what stats do for example. The human characters in cartoon mode are very bad compared to enemy design.ConclusionIf you love combat  mixed with puzzles in combination that are fast paced this is your kind of game, but if not I suggest staying away. Though to be honest it's hard to imagine somebody totally hating this game. It's just a silly fun game.ValueI'd suggest buying the 2nd game and getting this one free. So if you do that at the $10 mark you'll get a great value here.			"

The fast-paced action really puts you in the mood, not to mention the story branches out into many different endings and possibilites. I hadnt even realised I had put so much time into the game.Not to mention the fighting style is very unique, that I personally have not seen before.Also, for the past year i have been sitting at rank 1 for the 10th multiplayer map for the fastest time. The leaderboards really bring out the competetive side of people.10/10. Would Buy Again.			"

												Pretty good game. I got it for free, and I thoroughly had a few hours of fun with it. Though it's a little poorly programmed, as it tends to be slow in some areas, and the game actually crashed right after I beat the final boss. Very frustrating, but overall the game is still worth a playthrough.			"

												The blend of epic game modes that each revolve around a 30 second gameplay is outstanding. it is definantly a game you can play at your own pace, if you only have a few minutes, then you can easily beat a level, and the replay value is outstanding. Even if you lose a level, you don't have to worry about going through a long and lengthy process to get back to where you were, because as you play, you get more efficient. The art style is amazing for anyone looking to play an epic fantasy, or a classic 16-bit game, this game has them both, and they can make it seem like you are playing an entirely differant game.

												For ages I had this game on a negative review because of some issues with the port's controls. Honestly, that isn't enough to dampen the game.This game is a lot of fun, and for its price (which includes its sequel, which I am currently playing through) it is hard not to justify a purchase.The writing is witty, levels are varied, there are 4 game modes, plenty of content....Just be aware that changing the graphical style changes Evil Lord, Princess and Knight 30 from their own campaigns with their own gameplay in retro mode to single levels with the same gameplay as Hero 30 in the Neo Cartoon mode.

												Half Minute Hero is one of those games that once picked up, cannot be put down. With it's whacky sense of humour and retro style this game has it all, packing a plethora of different game modes that can be played in short bursts or happily eat up a few hours of your time. The premise to the games main mode ""Hero 30"" is different to say the very least. What on the surface appears to be a retro Japanese RPG has actually been condensed into an insane amount of 30 second missions that lampoon traditional RPG tropes. Now this premise may sound completely broken but thanks to a wonderfully helplful deus ex machina known as ""The Time Goddess"" (who gives our hero some leeway with his thirty second time limit) it totally works. But that's not all! The game also has a few other modes up it's sleeve to give it a longevity boost that will keep you playing for more than half a minute. Princess 30 is a sidescrolling shooter where you play a kind hearted but borderline psychotic Princess who blasts her enemies with a semi-automatic repeating crossbow whilst being rushed around by a small army of guards. Evil Lord 30 is a real-time strategy game that puts you in the dapper outfit of the fabulous ""Beautiful Evil Lord"" who has renounced his evil ways so that he can grow flowers and drink tea with his newly beloved. When this peace and tranquility are threatened however the Evil Lord breaks out his summoning skills and unleashes wave after wave of monsters upon the castle's unsuspecting invaders. Knight 30 is an action game where you play as a lone knight protecting a wandering sage from hordes of monsters. The story here plays out a lot like Journey To The West (one of my favourite books of all time) which it clearly takes a great deal of inspiration from. The final two modes are Hero 300 and Hero 3 mode which are expansions upon Hero 30 mode that give you 300 and 3 second time limits respectively.If like me you are a retro gamer then you will adore Half Minute Hero. It does help if you have a whacky sense of humour, but even if you don't I'm sure you will still be able to appreciate the way the game lampoons those classic video game tropes that we all love and grew up with.

												Fast-paced puzzle-like action RPG... and I love everything about it. Super witty and clever, gameplay is solid, truly everything is top-notch.

												A very basic game, but still fun. You play through multiple levels with different obstacles to overcome (usually) within 30 seconds. Random encounters to level up, and to get strong enough to fight the boss. You can turn back time, and have to most of the time, but the counter can never go past 30 seconds. It's fun, but there isn't much variety in the gameplay. I've also read that.. someone (IGN? Destructoid?) called it funny in a review. It's not really funny, and usually feels a bit forced if it's trying to be.Nevertheless, this isn't that bad of a game. I'd definitely buy it again.			"

												oh man this was MUST GO FAST:THE GAMEWhile this game has a simplistic rpg sections (running into something till it dies), it also make you have to think how to use your time and money wisely before the spell of destruction ends the world in 30 seconds.There are 5 game modes (2 needing to be unlocked) that revolve around time eras that are connected.The game not only contains rpg style game play but also bullet hellish and castle defense by summoning monsters and escorting a sage...Beat it, loved it for its simplicity. Well worth the money.♥♥♥♥ the 3 second hero mode though, Im too casual for that			"

												-Set graphics to 'Classic'.-Enjoy the crazyness that is half minute hero.Honestly, this spins the ENTIRE concept of 'RPG' on it's head. YOu got your stats, your gear, allys, EXP and levels with cash to earn and spend. Yet it's been all cut down to the bare bones that on paper it sounds just stupid, but in practice makes for a wonderful experance. It's more like a puzzle game then anything else, as you attempt to hit objectives, finish side quest, and get gear to stop the next overlord before your every tiny timer runs out. Honestly I HAVE to recommend this game because of how much it breaks the trends, and really offers you a truly one of a kind experance....also add onto this it's extra 6 modes one can unlock, each one playing quite a bit different from the others, and really for it's pricepoint I doubt you'll be finding anything better in a LONG time.

												Save the world in thirty seconds. Sounds impossible? Not for a time traveler!Part an affectionate parody of the JRPG, part love ballad to it, an experience that I fully expected to grow repetitive after an hour hooked me and kept me playing. It's a simple experience, yes, but the game gets an astounding amount of mileage out of its core concept of each level being a mini-RPG that you must clear in thirty seconds.Although I doubt this will be for everyone, anyone raised on console RPGs should at least consider this. It feels a little like an enthusiastic garage band doing a ""remix"" of a punk song they love only for it to end up being mostly a cover, but they're so earnest that you headbang to it anyway.			"

												This Epic Game Orginally came for the PSP in 2009. I Have this game on both My PSP go and PS vita Both with the same save file and I got 95% of the game compled so far on the PSP version(And The Only Item I need Left in This Original Version Is Balmung). Now 3 things are missing in the PC version that was in the Orginal PSP version The Goddess Room, Music Player (To get it on PSP Beat Hero 3 And I also got it), and The Another Goddess Quest (to get on PSP First you don't save the village from the Volcano from the Fire Mountain quest THEN You have to beat 108 Evil Lords (Repeats Allowed so Beat whoever mutiple time) in Total). I like how the 8 bit Graphies looks it makes the game works but the Neo cartoon Graphies just look UGLY to me And That version Is where Evil Lord 30, Princess 30, and Knight 30 is like There own version of Hero 30 Feels weird to me but there Ok. The Xbox version And PC Has 8 quests Thats not in the PSP version(And am Not a Xbox person Im a Playstation person). Atleast Mutiplayer is Online while the PSP version is just AD HOD. I got the PC version for free because of getting the 2nd game as a bunile (I wish it came out on the PS vita(or PSP)). In My opinion The Orignal PSP version is better. I got True Hero Overall Rank on Both Versions Still wish the 2nd game came out on PSvita (or PSP) 8.9 PSP in my opinion I highly Recommend This Version (Need some one to play with you on Ad Hod)(Want to get the Good Equitment in AD HOD Mode) It's The Best version to me. with Those 3 things. (How Do I get The True Hero (Overall and some Quests) Rank Again If You Lose It For The PSP?) And For Hero 300 I'm Having Troble Trying to Beat That Snake Superboss On my PSPgo (And PSvita) And Don't Have it on the PC version.7.5 PC in my opinion I sorta Recommend This version (At least Mutiplayer is Online and I can play mutiplayer on my own) It's ok Some Changes I did not like. NOT Everything is on This Version.Update- The Alt Ending Route Is On Both Versions of PC and Xbox.-as for the Lord Haders level mess up the Count of Numbers in Qusets of Hero 30 And As For Overlord Hol I had to be over Level 60 to beat him level 65 why? (In The Original PSP Version You Have to be level 35 to beat him(My quickest time on My PSP with the Last Battle on Hero 30 is 1min and 59secs)) And This version Confusses Beast killer for Silver Spear and Silver Spear for Beast Killer FTW Why?- Enjoy! (I may Edit this Review Later. Ok?)  I Beat the 2nd Game I Writen A (somewhat) Review on it  and For HOARD That I also Have Both Versions PSP (And PSvita Again) and PC. Have Fun!			"

												Aw, man...so fast. It took me a bit to warm up to the passive battle system (you just run or run away) and the core game got repetitive for me at the half-way mark, but the chain of 5 modes that unlock after beating it redeems this title. I probably got $10 of gameplay out of Hero 3 mode alone.			"

												You end up with the ""stress"" of the 30 second limit but nevertheless it is a great game. The graphics can be changed and honestly I love both the NEO cartoon and retro modes. But although everyone thinks you have ONLY 30 seconds to finish the level but thanks to a character you are able to get more than 30 seconds by resetting the clock. But the creator made it in a way that you dont wan't to do it often. I also like the different gameplays. You get to play as different characters after you unlock them and there are a few different ways of attacking for each player. But thats in NEO cartoon mode. When you change the graphics you actually change the game. In NEO cartoon mode the battles are automatic like hero 30 mode. But in Retro mode you battle completley different. And that just makes it more fun.For those people that like story it has a good story about a 500 year old war and the many complications of the story. But also for the RPG players it has a few levels where you travle around and do ""complicated"" quests. But who can forget comedy it is involved with lots of jokes and a few references.I do not see any reason not to buy this game. (unless you are waiting for it to go on sale.)			"

												During one of the sales, I bought Half minute Hero on a whim because I heard some funny things about its gimmick, the 30-second timer before apocalypse happens.I did not expect this game to be this excellent. The ""gimmick"" of the game and the fact that it's (mostly) a JRPG parody, lead me to underestimate this game.Did I expect optional missions that both unlock new, interesting equipment and BRANCHING STORYPATHS? NoDid I expect multiple different kinds of game modes changing from action/puzzle RPG, to shoot'em up, to action-RTS? NoDid I expect to cry thanks to the game's story and a bit of absolutely fantastic story-gameplay integration? Absolutely notPlay this game.

												If you're someone who like to check all of the boxes, snag all the armor, get all of the awards, beat all the bosses and kiss all the princesses... Well, this game can either be a blessing or a curse. There is a ton to do -- so much game play packed in if you're literally trying to do everything. You may actually be able to zip through some levels in 30 seconds and still get everything, but the majority of the levels are going to take you several tries to be able to get through efficiently. You may even find yourself playing the same, 30-second level over and over again for near an hour if you're trying to achieve one of the time-based awards -- it's happened to me, they take practice.OVerall, though, there is an insane amount of diverse gameplay crammed into this game, with a number of different paths that you can take through each of the different campaigns. Its one of those rare games that has something for pretty much everyone, doesn't take itself too seriously, and is easy to pick up for just a few minutes near the end of lunch -- but then hard to put down again.

												This game is awesome!  I played it long ago on the PSP and I'm happy to be able to play it on Steam, now with achievements.  :D  If you like RPG's and you like 8-Bit fun, then you'll love this game!  The original game only had 8-Bit graphics, but they made some awesome additions to the game when they ported it over to the PC including a revamped graphics engine.  You can switch it back to the original 8-Bit if you like, but it's fun to play it either way.  I'm currently enjoying the new graphics and once I beat it, I'll replay levels with the original graphics when I go back for achievements I missed.  In addition to the main RPG story mode, there are several other modes to play to keep the enjoyment going, including a really hard speedrun mode for all of you hardcore players.  Tons of replay value with this one!  Buy it if you love old school games!  ^_^			"

												I'd like to start out by stating what may not be obvious at first, Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy is a combination of the PSP and XBox versions of the game.  If you've played either version, or both then you aren't missing much here.  With that said I this review (like most I suppose) are based entirely on what you believe to be important in a game.The premise of half minute hero is that an evil lord is working a spell to destroy the world, and you have 30 seconds to grind, upgrade your equipment, complete quests and defeat the 'Evil Lord'.  As frantic as it sounds (and can be) you have the Goddess of Time on your side, but as we all know Time is Money, and she will charge you for resetting the clock - while this isn't entirely burdensome it does become expensive quickly which encourages you to move quickly through each quest.The battle system is pretty straight forward requiring very little outside of keeping an eye on your health and using an herb if needed.The PC version has three modes: Hero 30 (which is RPG based), Evil Lord 30 (revolves around summoning minions) and Princess 30 (shooting), plus three unlockable modes (which I honestly haven't unlocked yet).The PC version also includes two graphics modes, retro and 8-bit which was released with the XBox version.  Personally I enjoy the retro look, but that's simply a matter of opinion.The charm and replayability of Half Minute hero is in the humor, multiple branching stories, collectible titles, and equipment.  Although the humor didn't always hit the mark with me, it was still charming in it's own right and although I haven't played through the entire Hero 30 (which is the core game-mode) I did find that collecting titles and unlocking branches could become a little onerous since some of the tasks and hints can be oblique, even with assistance from your caravan.I was initially hesitant to make this purchase because many of the reviews I had read weren't descriptive enough for me (which I hope this fixes for others), but overall I would give this game an 7/10, and dispite it's shortcomings there is more than enough content to justify $9.99, especially if you haven't played the PSP or XBox versions, if you have and you're still interested I would wait until this goes on sale.

												Even though I have about 4 hours on this game, I'm positive I have at least 30 on my Xbox. That being said, Half Minute Hero in itself is a simple game. Save the world in 30 seconds. Although you have a little help from a [strike ]greedy ♥♥♥♥♥ [/strike] wonderful goddess; the time goddess. Evil Lords all over the world are learning a spell that can destroy the world in 30 seconds. So you, the fastest hero alive must defeat ALL the evil lords and the person handing out this spell like candy. The Time Goddess wil reset time from the time of the Evil Lord casting that spell if you pray at her statue and pay 100 gold. Then 200 gold. Then 300 gold. Then 400 Gold. I think you get my point. This game has multiple paths at certain points depending on what you do. There's also conditions and a lot of weapons, and armor in the game. You can even race your friend's to see who can finish a level faster. There's even a multiplayer mode. So this game is all around fun, but it's pretty short. You can probably speed through it in about 12 hours if you know what you're doing. And finishing the game 100% takes a lot of effort, considering there's other game modes, which are other characters. You unlock them by beating the preceeding character. Anyway, you should buy this game, is good game. Go and buy it now.			"

												I've dumped over 200 hours into the XB360 version, and I'm planning on dumping even more into this version. A fantastic game (while repetitive with the scenario of 'Evil guy learns a spell that'll destroy the world in 30 seconds, and you have to stop him', but as you progress further and further into the game, you'll unlock more scenarios, of varying degrees of difficulty, hilarity, and lovableness. If you want a game that is easy to pick up, and hard to master, all the while being able to be played in small chunks or long sessions, then you'll wanna pick this up.			"

												Half-Minute Hero is JRPG stripped down to the bloody core and accelerated by a factor of 100 -- becoming, in essence, a sort of fast-paced, open-ended puzzler.  The story is cute, the music is great (very Japanese, very RPG, very SNES) and the graphics are nice whether you choose pixel or cartoon mode.  Most importantly, it's fun as heck!  An exemplary game and the first of its kind, Half-Minute Hero should be in every gamer's library!			"

												I came, I saw, I saved the world with .2 seconds to spare. Now I need to do the next level to get gold for a new, clean pair of pants. GODDESS!!!The gameplay is fun and hectic, if you're into quick gameplay, this will scratch that itch wonderfully. Don't be expecting a deep story for the most part, but you won't need one with the story they've made for this. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll scream a battle cry loud enough that the Evil Lords will tremble in fear of you and your allies.And if you're a completionist, there's still a TON of Achievements and unlockables to find in the game. The replay value is amazing!Definitely give this AND the sequel: Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming, a play. You won't regret it.			"

												Half Minute Hero is an awesome game and you should buy it. At the very least, you should watch some video gameplay. This game is an innovative mashup of different genres (primarily JRPG and Puzzle). If you enjoyed the PSP original, ever enjoyed JRPGs in your life, like to play puzzle games, or like quirky/innovative games... you should just stop reading and buy the game. If you're on the fence, I'll do my best to describe to you what this game is and what this game is not. I'm going to write a lot, but it's necessary to give a good picture of this game.(If you've played the PSP version before, skip to the end of the review for a list of changes made.)As you can tell, I'm a huge fan of this game. I enjoyed it a lot on the PSP and I enjoy it even more on the xbox. I'm going to be very enthusiastic in this review since I don't think many people even know the game exists and it can use all the hype it can get. But I seriously encourage you to at least try the demo, it's such a interesting concept that I think most gamers should at least experience it.I can't guarantee you'll like it. But who definitely won't like Half Minute Hero? People who loathe solving puzzles, the JRPG concept, japanese-quirky games, or non turnbased games. People who like the genres they're already playing and don't want to try something new. People who buy it expecting it to be a traditional JRPG. People who need top of the line graphics and voice acting to enjoy a game. People who need to spend more than 60 hours on a 10 dollar game.Needless to say, this game does not take 30 seconds to beat. It's not a 60 hour game either, but there isn't any fat... no grinding hours for items or toiling on mindless tasks.- Gameplay -The gameplay is a JRPG stripped down to its barest elements. It is not a traditional JRPG, although it uses the JRPG elements. The game is composed of several stages that could be mini-JRPGs in their own right (complete with title screen and credits.) You start off each stage at Level 1, although you can use any of the equipment you've found in previous stages. You get into random battles to kill monsters to get money and level up, buy equipment at villages, read through walls of dialogue, complete quests to progress the story, complete optional side quests to gain allies or special items, then ultimately defeat the Evil Lord threatening to destroy the world. The twist is that you have a 30 second timer to do all this and once that timer hits 0, it's game over. But you can pay an ever increasing sum to reset the timer to 30 seconds at any village. You can also dash around to move faster and avoid random battles, but while dashing, your HP is consumed.Battles are also stripped down to their barest elements and made to go as fast as possible. Battles are viewed from the side where you and your opponents simply run at each other. You clash, damage is dealt based on your respective stats, and you repeat until one of you is dead. You can choose to dash, which eats more of your life but makes the battle go faster, or use a healing item, which can be expensive and you need money to reset the timer, or run away if you don't think you'll win. Battles are still strategic... you have to decide when you can take an enemy and you can equip items that can cause the battle to be a lot easier (such as equipping a Silver weapon that can One Hit Kill demon enemies.) They're still exciting, especially late in the game when you might finish battles with milliseconds to spare, then need to rush to the nearest village to reset your time.The game parodies the JRPG genre and the different stages address the many tropes of JRPGs. Some stages focus around you needing to collect special equipment to defeat the big baddie, others have you do fetch quests, another has you chase your rival around, while others send you hunting for special monsters. There are 72 different stages and they're all really creative. As the game goes on, some new gimmicks are introduced. Most of the stages have different paths you can take to complete them. Sometimes you'll unlock hidden stages by finishing levels in unconventional ways. Some of the secret stages are really challenging.In my opinion, the best part of this game is the level design... there is so much packed into each level. In order to beat the stage at all, you'll probably play the stage one to three times. To unlock the titles (you gain titles by performing certain tasks in levels), collect all the equipment, or get the top times you'll need to play the stages a lot. It's a joy to go through them. Playing through a stage is like solving a small puzzle. And you can get that satisfied feeling of leveling up in a game and overpowering your enemies.Let me explain how a stage might work. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm just making up an example, but the stages play out a lot like this. Here's what you can expect:In your first run through a stage, you might grind for a few minutes, pay 300G to recruit a mercenary ally from a bar, complete a sidequest for him by finding a memento left for him by his deceased wife in a cave that boosts his power, grind some more, reach level 60, then finally be strong enough to take out the mini-boss and the boss. You unlock a title and completed the stage in maybe five minutes (throughout the stage you'll be stopping at villages to chat, learn some backstory, heal, and reset the timer.)But then you play again. You grind for a bit and recruit the mercenary, but don't do his quest. You remember a townsperson in the first village mentioned something about a hidden village you ignored the first time, so you go searching for it this time. You go through a cave of monsters and find the village on a peninsula in a hidden patch of a forest. The shop there sells a demon slaying sword for 200G. You may need to grind for a minute to afford the sword, but now you can rush through the rest stage and One Hit KO the miniboss and boss. This will get you a new sword to use in future stages, unlock a title, and it took you only three minutes instead of five.Maybe you're satisfied with what you've done so far. Or maybe you want to get a lower score. Speedrunning may not be your thing, but it doesn't mean you won't enjoy the game. Even without the speed running, the stages are still really fun to go through and you can beat them no matter how good or bad you are at games. But if you want more of a challenge and want more gameplay, it's definitely an option.Let's say you looked at the leaderboard and saw people were beating the stage within 30 seconds and you want to figure out how. So you play the stage a ton of times, finding several new paths through the stage and some time shaving shortcuts. You finally get the 'Aha!' moment. You equip some armor that lets you swim, shoes that make you dash faster, and a sword that increases your base HP by 30. You don't equip a shield so you can move faster. You start the stage and dash off to a forest in the east, where there's a really weak monster that drops 230G, but no experience. Once you got the gold, you dash off to the village on the peninsula, taking a shortcut through the water this time. Because you're using the sword that boosts your base HP, you don't need to stop by any towns on the way to refill your HP. You use up all your money to buy the demon slaying sword and heal, but it doesn't matter because you're aiming to beat the stage within 30 seconds, so you don't need money to reset the timer. Now you rush through the rest of the stage, again through the water, and beat the mini-boss and the boss with a second to spare. You get nothing new, this playthrough was entirely optional, but you have the satisfaction of beating the stage in 29 seconds rather than three or five minutes. You can play again to lower your score even more. Maybe you took some wasted steps or maybe you finished the boss with a lot of life remaining and you realize you sh			"

												I thought this game was pretty fun, you have a 30 second timer to complete the level but you can spend gold which you earn to reset the time to 30 seconds, there are several bosses in the small map and you can buy character upgrades such as swords and armor to make it easier but obviously you need to keep gold to reset the time. I think this game is much more fun being played with friends but the multiplayer button is stupid, you simply click multiplayer and it puts you with some people. I am not sure if it was luck but clicking the button all at the same time put me and my friends together without problem most of the time.I music in the game is pretty good matching the ""gotta rush"" theme of the game and one of my friends who I was playing with was singing it throughout the entire match lol.It's worth buying if you have a few friends to play it with but it may become boring after playing for about an hour of it as it does become very repetitive and there isn't really that many features in the actual game.6/10			"

Id spend the time to write out the whole title but it's far too long for such a short time frame to write this review, which in honor of the game itself, I’ve decided to think up in thirty seconds.... readysetgo!Graphics are about what you would expect a game to be played in thirty seconds should be, as is the sound.  The controls are simple enough, and the gameplay is basically short snippets of typical rpg quests shrunk down to thirty second chunks.  The overarching storyline makes enough sense to continue the story between mini chapters but really doesn't extend beyond that.  The game is reminiscent of something I would pick up from the Android store and waste an hour or two on during my commute, but in the end doesnt really feel like something I would even take the time to fire up while on a computer.  Cute, maybe, but just not really enjoyable after the first thirty seconds.  Which I guess may be the point.Game’s Fate: Uninstalled.  Though this is a lot of fun, there are better ways of time wasting already in my collection. Buy/No Buy:  Not here.  Will keep an eye on the Android Play store though.			"

												Good for a lark, but ultimately low on substance. The gimmick is neat but gets old after a while. Not all game modes are available in the nicer looking graphics mode, which was confusing. No real story, no compelling characters, no interesting choises to make, and not particualrly chalenging to get through. Cool to see it, but ultimately: meh.			"

												Really great game, Enjoyed it. So far I think the game has alot to offer on replay. You can try and beat your own time with each ""level"". It's not really an RPg, but more or less an arcade style fighting game. You level up on each ""point"" of the map, but upon completing it, you lose that level. It's rather fun and unique, I suggest anyone to buy it, especially if its on sale.			"

												Half Minute Hero is an awesome game and you should buy it. At the very least, you should watch some video gameplay. This game is an innovative mashup of different genres (primarily JRPG and Puzzle). If you enjoyed the PSP original, ever enjoyed JRPGs in your life, like to play puzzle games, or like quirky/innovative games... you should just stop reading and buy the game. If you're on the fence, I'll do my best to describe to you what this game is and what this game is not. I'm going to write a lot, but it's necessary to give a good picture of this game.(If you've played the PSP version before, skip to the end of the review for a list of changes made.)As you can tell, I'm a huge fan of this game. I enjoyed it a lot on the PSP and I enjoy it even more on the xbox. I'm going to be very enthusiastic in this review since I don't think many people even know the game exists and it can use all the hype it can get. But I seriously encourage you to at least try the demo, it's such a interesting concept that I think most gamers should at least experience it.I can't guarantee you'll like it. But who definitely won't like Half Minute Hero? People who loathe solving puzzles, the JRPG concept, japanese-quirky games, or non turnbased games. People who like the genres they're already playing and don't want to try something new. People who buy it expecting it to be a traditional JRPG. People who need top of the line graphics and voice acting to enjoy a game. People who need to spend more than 60 hours on a 10 dollar game.Needless to say, this game does not take 30 seconds to beat. It's not a 60 hour game either, but there isn't any fat... no grinding hours for items or toiling on mindless tasks.- Gameplay -The gameplay is a JRPG stripped down to its barest elements. It is not a traditional JRPG, although it uses the JRPG elements. The game is composed of several stages that could be mini-JRPGs in their own right (complete with title screen and credits.) You start off each stage at Level 1, although you can use any of the equipment you've found in previous stages. You get into random battles to kill monsters to get money and level up, buy equipment at villages, read through walls of dialogue, complete quests to progress the story, complete optional side quests to gain allies or special items, then ultimately defeat the Evil Lord threatening to destroy the world. The twist is that you have a 30 second timer to do all this and once that timer hits 0, it's game over. But you can pay an ever increasing sum to reset the timer to 30 seconds at any village. You can also dash around to move faster and avoid random battles, but while dashing, your HP is consumed.Battles are also stripped down to their barest elements and made to go as fast as possible. Battles are viewed from the side where you and your opponents simply run at each other. You clash, damage is dealt based on your respective stats, and you repeat until one of you is dead. You can choose to dash, which eats more of your life but makes the battle go faster, or use a healing item, which can be expensive and you need money to reset the timer, or run away if you don't think you'll win. Battles are still strategic... you have to decide when you can take an enemy and you can equip items that can cause the battle to be a lot easier (such as equipping a Silver weapon that can One Hit Kill demon enemies.) They're still exciting, especially late in the game when you might finish battles with milliseconds to spare, then need to rush to the nearest village to reset your time.The game parodies the JRPG genre and the different stages address the many tropes of JRPGs. Some stages focus around you needing to collect special equipment to defeat the big baddie, others have you do fetch quests, another has you chase your rival around, while others send you hunting for special monsters. There are 72 different stages and they're all really creative. As the game goes on, some new gimmicks are introduced. Most of the stages have different paths you can take to complete them. Sometimes you'll unlock hidden stages by finishing levels in unconventional ways. Some of the secret stages are really challenging.In my opinion, the best part of this game is the level design... there is so much packed into each level. In order to beat the stage at all, you'll probably play the stage one to three times. To unlock the titles (you gain titles by performing certain tasks in levels), collect all the equipment, or get the top times you'll need to play the stages a lot. It's a joy to go through them. Playing through a stage is like solving a small puzzle. And you can get that satisfied feeling of leveling up in a game and overpowering your enemies.Let me explain how a stage might work. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm just making up an example, but the stages play out a lot like this. Here's what you can expect:In your first run through a stage, you might grind for a few minutes, pay 300G to recruit a mercenary ally from a bar, complete a sidequest for him by finding a memento left for him by his deceased wife in a cave that boosts his power, grind some more, reach level 60, then finally be strong enough to take out the mini-boss and the boss. You unlock a title and completed the stage in maybe five minutes (throughout the stage you'll be stopping at villages to chat, learn some backstory, heal, and reset the timer.)But then you play again. You grind for a bit and recruit the mercenary, but don't do his quest. You remember a townsperson in the first village mentioned something about a hidden village you ignored the first time, so you go searching for it this time. You go through a cave of monsters and find the village on a peninsula in a hidden patch of a forest. The shop there sells a demon slaying sword for 200G. You may need to grind for a minute to afford the sword, but now you can rush through the rest stage and One Hit KO the miniboss and boss. This will get you a new sword to use in future stages, unlock a title, and it took you only three minutes instead of five.Maybe you're satisfied with what you've done so far. Or maybe you want to get a lower score. Speedrunning may not be your thing, but it doesn't mean you won't enjoy the game. Even without the speed running, the stages are still really fun to go through and you can beat them no matter how good or bad you are at games. But if you want more of a challenge and want more gameplay, it's definitely an option.Let's say you looked at the leaderboard and saw people were beating the stage within 30 seconds and you want to figure out how. So you play the stage a ton of times, finding several new paths through the stage and some time shaving shortcuts. You finally get the 'Aha!' moment. You equip some armor that lets you swim, shoes that make you dash faster, and a sword that increases your base HP by 30. You don't equip a shield so you can move faster. You start the stage and dash off to a forest in the east, where there's a really weak monster that drops 230G, but no experience. Once you got the gold, you dash off to the village on the peninsula, taking a shortcut through the water this time. Because you're using the sword that boosts your base HP, you don't need to stop by any towns on the way to refill your HP. You use up all your money to buy the demon slaying sword and heal, but it doesn't matter because you're aiming to beat the stage within 30 seconds, so you don't need money to reset the timer. Now you rush through the rest of the stage, again through the water, and beat the mini-boss and the boss with a second to spare. You get nothing new, this playthrough was entirely optional, but you have the satisfaction of beating the stage in 29 seconds rather than three or five minutes. You can play again to lower your score even more. Maybe you took some wasted steps or maybe you finished the boss with a lot of life remaining and you realize you sh			"

												Buggy, but fun. There's no real support for the game, as the forums are closed and all emails are met with radio silence. However, the game is genuinely fun to play both single and multiplayer. Even though it states its intended for controller play, my controller (which works with every other game, including games that don't have controller support) refuses to cooperate with HMH, creating an unplayable mess.HMH is fun, and despite the warning of being best played with a gamepad the keyboard does just fine. It's quirky, addictive, and cute.			"

												With the release of the Half-Minute Hero: The Second Coming I think its appropriate to take a long look back at the first game. Half-Minute Hero is a silly and experimental RPG developed by Opus releasing in Japan and the US in 2009 on the PSP. After weak sales on the PSP the developers gave the game a second chance on the Xbox 360 and PC platforms. The game is split between 4 diverse game modes ""Hero 30"", ""Evil Lord 30"", ""Princess 30"" and ""Knight 30"" all centered around the half a minute theme.Gameplay:""Hero 30"" is the star of the game as it distills everything RPG down to their most basic elements. Each level is essentially a full RPG campaign where you'll start off at level one, talk to NPCs, gather info, take on quests, buy equipment, and grind your way up to the world destroying Evil Lord all in 30 seconds. Fortunately your allowed to turn back the clock for an incrementing fee of gold. This cost will eventually force you to find a quick way to complete the stage, so you'll need to move smart as the game values tactics over reflexes. Battles are automatic affairs where you and the enemy will ram each until one of you dies. Fortunately you have input through dashing which drains life so you can move faster (useable out of battle), use an item like a healing herb, and running away. Combat goes by in a flash but can be surprisingly tense as you'll have to worry whether you made the right preparations for a fight.As you can imagine such a simplified set of mechanics requires creative level design to make the most  out of it and you'd be right. Levels are packed with content and often provide a lot of freedom in completing an objective which will likely lead to repeated playthroughs to find secrets, collect gear, and find the quickest way to complete a level.Next up is ""Evil Lord 30"". This mode is a real-time strategy game where you play as a Evil Lord, where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors with creatures you summon against various enemies you'll face.  There are 3 types to account for and you can summon: high damage dealing Brutes; fast Nimbles; and long ranged Shooters. You're limited in how quickly you can summon creatures by the magic circle around the Evil Lord the smaller it is the weaker the creature you summon, so keep an eye on the size of your magic circle. Its quite satisfying to watch your army of massive minions trample over an enemy force when you've gotten a hang of exploiting enemy weakness. Unfortunately the simplified control scheme tends to work against this mode as you lack any precision when commanding your minions, since all you can do is tell all minions in your magic circle to charge in a specific direction. ""Princess 30"", a scrolling shoot-em-up where you control a princess and her soldiers as she blasts her way through enemies with her crossbow to find a cure for her fathers sickness. The objective usually involves traveling across the stage by shooting enemies and avoiding hazards to defeat a boss or pick up an item, and make it back to the castle before time runs out. The stages will have you frantically avoiding obstacles and keeping you on your toes with some pretty interesting variety of enemies. But it can get repetitive due to having less variety in its objectives than the other modes so it's best played inter-spaced between play sessions of other modes. Lastly there's “Knight 30” where you control a perpetually optimistic knight who must guard the sage who brought him back to life. There's a surprisingly strong somber atmosphere here as you desperately search for a hero who will purge the evil that infests the world, through desolate settlements and castles you've been to before. The trademark humor is still present so it never gets particularly bleak. This isn't exactly just a set of escort mission either as the knight is too weak to actually kill any monsters, so he must depend on the sage's magic which takes 30 seconds to charge. The knight's job is to stall the creatures with anything he can his hands on such as rocks, sticks, and even his own body. He can also move the sage by either lifting him or calling him over, which will not only be necessary in finding a more defensible position. But also to get to areas that will speed up the sage's magic. This all plays on the strong level design of these stages as you need battle against new environments to keep the sage safe.There's also a multiplayer mode in the PC / 360 releases and it plays like ""Hero 30"" only multiple players will compete over who defeats the Evil Lord first on multiplayer unique maps. Its also very difficult to find people playing multiplayer, so I have little experience here. Story:There is actually a over-arching story tying these campaigns together which come together in fairly satisfying manner despite their simplicity. But its really the dialogue and self-aware humor that stand out as it has a lot fun with various RPG conventions/tropes. While still providing plethora of humor for those less experienced in the genre. Your constant companion the greedy Time Goddess is always good for a laugh as well.Something to note is the surprising moments of sincerity that almost seem to come out of left field. These rare moments juxtapose with the general satirical atmosphere while using the episodic nature of stages so well, that I found them completely unforgettable. All the story sequences are also skippable which makes replaying stages a lot more convenient.Presentation:The game has great presentation sporting a 8-bit art-style harkening back to the early Dragon Quest games. Alternatively there's the default paper-craft graphics of the PC release which you can switch between. While its not quite as fitting it will scale better on larger monitors. The soundtrack is also fantastic sporting quality rock and orchestral tracks from a variety well-known Japanese composers (Yuzo Koshiro, Motoi Sakuraba, Norihiko Hibino, etc.).Conclusion:Half-Minute Hero is a game with a lot heart. Its clear that the developers love the  genre or they couldn't have so lovingly satirized RPGs on both a story and mechanical level so well. I heartily recommend this game despite a few misgivings I have for the ""Evil Lord 30"" and ""Princess 30"" modes as they're still good fun. The main attraction ""Hero 30"" will definitely give you constant hours of entertainment especially since it'll likely tug on the inner explorer/completionist in you. To top it off its an excellent value at only $10 for PC. Notes:-Important: You can only play non-Hero 30 modes in the original 8-bit graphics style in the PC version. -You can get useful hints from your caravan, so make sure to talk to them.-The Goddess Room which contained unlockable artwork and the music player was removed in the 360 and PC releases.-Stat symbols can be a bit vague. So I'll try to explain them: Sword=Attack,  Armor = Defense, Boot = Speed, Weight = Weight, Target = Critical Hit, Shield = Evasion			"

												Really interesting and fun parody of JRPGS. It plays nothing like most JRPGS, but the storyline and the humor will make even the most cynical of fans laugh. Each level feels like a short, individual speedrun of a SNES era JRPG (make sure you play on the 8bit graphics setting, the other setting looks awful).

												Not a bad little game.  I put in about 14 hours into the main story trying to collect equipment and allies.  However the game does kinda get boring after while.The basic idea is that you have 30 seconds to grind and accomplish tasks before running back to a city and paying gold to reset the 30 second timer.  Farther into the game they start to apply certain mechanics to tweak this time reset concept, but overall each mission is the same.  Grind to level up and get gold, to buy and reset the clock ~ until you can kill the bad guy.Pretty fun, but also repetitive.  If you like old school nintendo RPG's with a twist of short time limits, it could be for you!			"

												A fresh take on RPG's, completely obliterating the labour of turn-based titles with a more direct, flowing and absolutely insane approach. It's own ridiculous sense of humour is a highlight, as it seeks to amuse on every front. It also adds a stranger take by including different stories and game roles, such as the Hero, the Princess, and the Evil Lord himself. An experience I can definitely recommend.			"

												The idea of distilling a JRPG down to 30-second chunks and still managing to fit random encounters, leveling up, buying equipment, talking to NPCs, side quests, and boss fights into there somehow is brilliant. Everything that's left is in its purest form, and it's still fairly entertaining, at least for a while. It unfortunately doesn't feel like it has a whole lot of room for depth in it, and while the rather generic and minimal story is cute and makes fun of RPG tropes, it's not enough to carry the rest of the game.It's worth checking out for some clever design and fun gameplay, but it may not be enough to last the entire length of the game.

												-Set graphics to 'Classic'.-Enjoy the crazyness that is half minute hero.Honestly, this spins the ENTIRE concept of 'RPG' on it's head. YOu got your stats, your gear, allys, EXP and levels with cash to earn and spend. Yet it's been all cut down to the bare bones that on paper it sounds just stupid, but in practice makes for a wonderful experance. It's more like a puzzle game then anything else, as you attempt to hit objectives, finish side quest, and get gear to stop the next overlord before your every tiny timer runs out. Honestly I HAVE to recommend this game because of how much it breaks the trends, and really offers you a truly one of a kind experance....also add onto this it's extra 6 modes one can unlock, each one playing quite a bit different from the others, and really for it's pricepoint I doubt you'll be finding anything better in a LONG time.

This game is that - grind levels, do sidequests, get loot, defeat the antagonist - in 30 seconds. Has tons of 30 second save the world RPGs and many, MANY different sub-games if you're getting bored of those ;)			"

												Despite seeming incredibly simple, and while it isn't exactly your standard RPG, this game is full of hilarity and definitely puts the fast-forward button on old-school Final Fantasy style of gameplay. If you like witty humor, old-school graphics, and a good ol' grind-and-kill-the-bad-guy RPG, but don't have the time for it, then your prayers have been answered.Half-Minute Hero contains more than one game, for starters, such as Princess 30 and Evil Lord 30, each of them maintaining the speed factor and humor of Hero 30. It comes with two different graphics settings that not only (obviously) appear different, but also change how some of the games are played.So for those tight on time and cash but are looking for a speedy RPG, don't hesitate to pick up this little title. It's well worth every penny and every second.(Oh and it has head-to-head online multiplayer, too)			"

												I've dumped over 200 hours into the XB360 version, and I'm planning on dumping even more into this version. A fantastic game (while repetitive with the scenario of 'Evil guy learns a spell that'll destroy the world in 30 seconds, and you have to stop him', but as you progress further and further into the game, you'll unlock more scenarios, of varying degrees of difficulty, hilarity, and lovableness. If you want a game that is easy to pick up, and hard to master, all the while being able to be played in small chunks or long sessions, then you'll wanna pick this up.			"

												Date: 2/20/16Review Number:22 Game: Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate BoyFrom (Creator Publisher):OpusPlayed On: LaptopSteam Price as of Review: $9.99 (Including the sequel)Total Time played: 40 MinutesReview:Today’s random selection is Half Minute Hero from Opus.  Id spend the time to write out the whole title but it's far too long for such a short time frame to write this review, which in honor of the game itself, I’ve decided to think up in thirty seconds.... readysetgo!Graphics are about what you would expect a game to be played in thirty seconds should be, as is the sound.  The controls are simple enough, and the gameplay is basically short snippets of typical rpg quests shrunk down to thirty second chunks.  The overarching storyline makes enough sense to continue the story between mini chapters but really doesn't extend beyond that.  The game is reminiscent of something I would pick up from the Android store and waste an hour or two on during my commute, but in the end doesnt really feel like something I would even take the time to fire up while on a computer.  Cute, maybe, but just not really enjoyable after the first thirty seconds.  Which I guess may be the point.Game’s Fate: Uninstalled.  Though this is a lot of fun, there are better ways of time wasting already in my collection. Buy/No Buy:  Not here.  Will keep an eye on the Android Play store though.			"

												I enjoyed this at the beginning; then it started feeling like a bit of a slog; but then it got better again. I beat the first act, and the mini-games showed up - which all seemed like half-baked concepts that the devs still wanted to throw somewhere. After you beat those, you get to the final act (and bonus super-hard act) which were both really challenging and fun. I think, overall, I enjoyed the game, but I probably spent too much time on it trying to get every title and item.			"

												Half Minute Hero. Is half of minute enough to be Hero? And... well, I won't spoil the fun. Just keep in mind that Half Minute Hero is not only a game where you are Hero. Anyway, half of minute It's more than enough. It's plenty of time to level up, buy some stuff and beat the main boss... with little help of someone, but you need plenty of money for that.This game was one of main reasons to get PSP console. I did that, played and completed Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy few years ago and now it's avaible here, on Steam. With achievements! This reason alone was good to jump into magical world of half minute to do everything once again. Graphics, at least retro graphics, looks amazing. The characters, story, music is great. It's very fun to play. Longer or shorter sitting, it's perfect for both. Half Minute Hero is perfect way to describe a parody game.Earlier there wasn't deal like that but if you will buy the sequel game, you will get Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy for free. In my opinion, that's a great deal. It's a game for many hours, even more if you enjoy to 100% your games. It's something different and I love when devs come up with something original. Lately games are missing it so if you aren't scared of trying something new, then try it. I didn't regret it and I will gladly continue being a Hero, or someone else, in the sequel.			"

												This game is... alright. It's a better pick-up-and-play game than it is a game you play long sessions of. Fairly lighthearted, pretty simple in concept but each battle does try to mix things up a little. I played through the story to the end (Hero 300) and it never felt like it got ""old"", but I feel like there were things that could've been done better.First and foremost, if you run out of time... why not just reset you back to the last point where you reset time instead of making you redo everything? I feel that would've been super easy to do, but nope, gotta restart the whole thing, which is really tedious. Really this is my one big complaint, it would've made the game a lot more fun and less stressful. I can nitpick about some other small things (some of the challenges feelng like filler, flee buttons literally never working for me, the overly-strictness of hero 300 despite it being one of the longest levels in the game, etc.) but really the main problems come down to this.If you want a fast-paced puzzle/RPG hybrid with some lightheartedness and not a looot of replayability but a decent bit of it (there's time challenges and titles and stuff that I couldn't be bothered to complete, meh) then you'll probably enjoy this, I'd probably put this game at ""meh"" if I had the option to but it's definitely alright enough to recommend, sure.

												The game is very fun most of the time. However, it's a bit buggy and may crash at times. These bugs have existed for years which probably means that the developers no longer take care of this, which is too bad. Some levels on Hero 30 crash the game, too, unless they're played on certain graphics settings. Quest 32, for example, crashes for me if I play it on Retro mode and end up getting to the castle before recruiting all of the allies (when there's a title you win if you manage to do this), but doesn't crash on Neo. Other quests will crash if you play it on Neo cartoon graphics but play fine on Retro graphics.Also, the other modes that you can unlock after beating Hero 30 are very different games on Neo cartoon graphics versus Retro graphics. They're shorter (one level each) and are basically the same as Hero 30. If you want the most out of this game, then you should play on Retro graphics.			"

												What appears to be a fun game at first, quickly becomes very repetitive if going for full completion. While titles seem like they give out obvious hints from their name on how to do them, there is no clear explanation for some of them and it can be a real pain to figure them out. Example: Getbacker title - you need to get pushed back by the water.. but how many times? How many prayers are allowed or can it only be done in 1 prayer? Where exactly can you do it and in what order? No matter which way I try, it just won't register.The soundtrack is great, though!			"

												This is one crazy ride! Relentless and fun. I really can't think of any other way to put it. The challenges inherent to every stage provide a certain degree of replayability, which is always nice. The theme song is also really good, and the controls are tight and responsive. There is some ""post-game"" content, which is a little repetitive and lackluster compared to the main quest, but it's still good and fun.It is especially interesting to see how this quick game can set the stage for better, more engrossing adventures in younger players; my 5 year old got a hige kick out of it, and asked for similar, more engaging stuff - which lead to Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.

												Save the world in thirty seconds. Sounds impossible? Not for a time traveler!Part an affectionate parody of the JRPG, part love ballad to it, an experience that I fully expected to grow repetitive after an hour hooked me and kept me playing. It's a simple experience, yes, but the game gets an astounding amount of mileage out of its core concept of each level being a mini-RPG that you must clear in thirty seconds.Although I doubt this will be for everyone, anyone raised on console RPGs should at least consider this. It feels a little like an enthusiastic garage band doing a ""remix"" of a punk song they love only for it to end up being mostly a cover, but they're so earnest that you headbang to it anyway.			"

												It's a great RPG design to be satirical against other RPG. Kinda like the whole idea of grinding, quest but everything is contensed into 1-5 minutes so you don't need to invest a lot of time to enjoy it.Not in your face like DLC quest but more subtle. The game mechanic is simple and the plot though quick and short is quite decent. The game is loaded with all sorts of mini secrets and branching path and once you get the hang of the game you can run trying to get a competitve score.The basis of the game is to kill monster to gain exp and money to be strong enough to beat the levels boss. Their are twist like sacrfising hp for higher dps and mini quest to hire allies and get better weapon/armor. Things you do in previous level carry over so you would need to beat the game with certain criteria and time. This also effects branching path and how you progress through the story.The game is by no means the most intricate game ever but it is surprisingly deep for the short amount of time needed to be invested.My verdict is this is a great minmalistic rpg that doesn't require heavy investment. Pick it up if you have an RPG itch but can only play a few minutes at a time. 8/10BONUS: The game comes included with other 30 second games. An arcade shooter, an escort quest game, and a summoner's battle arena quest game.Much vaule, So fast, WOW!			"
