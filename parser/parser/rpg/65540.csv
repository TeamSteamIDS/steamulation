												Gothic 1 is absolutely brutal.You are nothingYou are worhlessYou are just a bag of meat to puch some ore fromUntil, you learn how to gain some ore.Gain some respect.Gain some skills.Yes this game has its issues with controls and little bugs, but hey, there was no ""patching"" or other stupid thing back then.This game has the ultimate character progression that really makes me have strong feelings even after 10 years later writing this review.

- When I was washed ashore, one of the guys punched me in the face!- They do that to all the newcomers. They call it ""Standing Godfather"".This short and absurd dialogue exchanged between our nameless hero and a shadow - an agent of the old camp - basically summarizes the tone of the whole Gothic series, starting with this first installation: ruthless, cruel and challenging. Its dog eat dog world from the moment you start your game, and it won't get any easier for quite some time. Nevertheless, coming out in 2001, Gothic is one of the first open world single player RPGs where you get to choose your own progress; roaming around, choosing quests and eventually deal with one primary problem that would very much define your whole story. With this game, Piranha Bytes set the baseline for all Open World RPGs that will be eventually advanced by The Elder Scroll series and many other wondrous RPGs, changing the market expectation of a computer RPG forever.With the opening cinematic, we are informed that there has been an ongoing war between humans and orcs for ages now, and the King Rhobar II desperately needed magical ore to finance the war. Thus, he ordered a mining colony populated with prisoners to be established by all criminals, bandits and cutthroats of the land. 10 of the most powerful mages put a magical barrier over the colony. Yet, something has gone wrong. The barrier extended beyond the intended limits; trapping all and any that were present around at the time. The barrier was harmless for the one coming into the colony from the outside, yet it was impenetrable from the inside. None would be able to leave alive... Taking advantage from this mishap, the prisoners revolted and killed all guardsmen, seizing the control of the colony. Desperate for the ore, the King came to an agreement with brigands exchanging all kinds of earthly goods for the ore needed and still keeping to send in new prisoners for the work force.This is the point our nameless hero - whose ""name"" or its instant of not being revealed in any circumstances is an ongoing gag for the series - a prisoner of unknown crime, is sent down to the colony, to deliver a message to the Arch Mage of the Circle of Fire. We are given the message, kicked down to the colony to meet some locals - and get smacked by them as a casual welcome... From this point onwards, it's gonna be a zero to hero scenario. Our relatively mundane character will become the one hero of the land through exploration, careful choice of allies and smarts enough not to do or say certain things in certain conditions.I must say that the setting and the story are fairly creative about the idea of a society established by criminals. Anyone and everyone in the colony are convicts or at least shady enough people with their own agendas anyhow. Most NPCs you'll end up meeting are pretty much a**holes and they'll lie, cheat and change alliances easily. Characters have motives, depth, agendas and personalities. So, not trusting anyone becomes our main motto quite easily. Even though the game world is relatively small here, the setting itself - with 3 primary gods, orc/human wars, different lore and system of different camps, the nature of magic and runes, fiends of vile realms etc. - are imaginative and intriguing, yet sadly the storyline hasn't been thoroughly developed into its full potential in this first game. As the series progress, we'll become increasingly invested in both our character and the setting of the world - especially with Gothic II, which I'd consider a masterpiece RPG.Animations and display are nothing miraculous considering the age of the game, yet they are really good for their time. We are even capable to observe some basic facial features, mimics and remarks of NPCs while they are making comments - which was altogether quite new and fascinating for its time. The game world is kinetic too, with NPCs having routines, sharing meals and attending mundane business when you are not interacting with them. Even mob monsters do sleep according to day/night cycle!Let's talk about the sucky parts of the game anyhow. Controls from hell are the primary problem that many people would prefer to pass this game. Mouse is merely used to direct camera angle - like an action adventure and you are expected to arrange a handful of odd key combinations for everything. If you are to rearrange key bindings, you'll probably override some other management option and render everything much more complicated than before. So... it's either getting used to hellish controls or not playing this game. You'll be expected to use 2-3 key combinations just to pick an item from the ground! That is some meaningless chore, I won't lie. But if you get used to it, you won't be even aware that you are arranging the combination after some point.Let's make our peace with one certain fact at this point: dying is a natural and common part of Gothic series. With this kind of gameplay difficulty and somewhat bug-ridden environment, you gotta be either a hardcore fan of the series or a bit masochistic to learn and have fun from getting your a** kicked in casual ways. Combined with hellish controls, combat becomes fairly hard and disorienting sometimes. You are expected to perform a series of combo attacks, blocks or dodges to face your enemies or else, anything coming your way might make an easy meal out of you. When you bear the controls finally, you'll notice that input detection bugging quite annoyingly sometime too. AI is somewhat imaginative too; maintaining different approaches of combat for different kinds of enemies and monsters. Some will downright charge, some will hunt in packs, others will dance around you and some others will try a couple of hit and run tactics on you.The AI and the environment texture are fairly old and buggy, so I strongly recommend installing some mods before taking on this journey; and for that purpose I'd certainly recommend GOG version of the game rather than Steam version, considering its way more stable with less crashes or conflicts. Worst case scenario, you are able to use a series of cheat commands called the Marvin Mode - which was used by developers to test certain modification - to arrange nearly anything in the game. Many things in game are left semi-developed due to time management problems on Piranha Bytes' part so installing Dark Mysteries mod + Ironforge Patch would fill in the blanks left by developers and fixing most glitches perfectly if it doesn't cause any problems for your system.This game - with its scenario, its environment and its humor will always find a way to surprise you both in good ways and bad ways. Even after stating all its problems - and casual ways to work around them, I strongly recommend playing this game as a part of computer RPG history at this point. It is not only nostalgia, it is a classic - alongside Gothic II.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Although my Steam time says 22 minutes for this game, I played it mostly offline because I've had internet troubles. I completed the game after 31 hours.I had never heard of the Gothic series before, but I got interested in checking it out after watching an interview with Jonathan Blow, the creator of 'Braid', where he talked about gameplay and game design. In that interview, he described the Gothic series as, ""like Skyrim, but with good gameplay"". Such zing!I then found it on Steam and got a deal for all three games. I've heard 1 and 2 are amazing, and 3 is just okay (according to most hardcore fans), after which there are some spinoffs that are considered absolutely appalling. I'm yet to play 2 or 3 though, so this is just based on my experience with Gothic 1.I really enjoyed Gothic 1. It's an RPG adventure type game with open world exploration. The story is great, the characters are interesting, the world is a good size (large enough to explore, not so large that it's overwhelming). The controls take some getting used to, and I recommend reading up on Google for some explanation and guidance on it. After about two or three hours though, it's a piece of cake. (You can also find the original manual for the game - yes, it was made in the era of actual game manuals - which will help in explaining a lot of how the game world works)The main thing about the controls is that a person or item needs to be selected first before you press something else to interact with it. For example, if there's some berries on the ground, you press the select tool and then press action to pick them up. If you're trying to pick up a particular item on the ground amongst others, you press the select tool, press left or right to toggle through which item is highlight and then press action once the item you want is highlighted. Same goes for interacting with people and even moving items around when trading (explained more below). You also need to highlight a creature and then press action to attack when you have a weapon ready.You start off being introduced to some characters and one of the three main camps. You eventually learn about all three camps and you'll need to choose one to join (each with its own way of living, style, etc). You can access almost any part of the map at any time, although early on there are places where the people and creatures will absolutely crush you until you're strong enough to survive (kind of in a Dark Souls way). You can learn all kinds of skills, including one hand or two hand weapons, agility, stealing, getting resources from animals you kill, etc.A lot of your time will be spent trading with people, so take your time to collect everything you find as it will be worth something. The trading system appears odd at first, but like the controls, it's a piece of cake once you learn in. You put things into the middle you want to trade from your side and get from the other side, then you press 'Enter' to make the deal. The values at the top will show you if you're getting a fair deal or not. The NPCs you trade with will accept any deal that's equal or where they get an advantage, so be careful. You could end up trading away things worth 1,000s for 10 worth of stuff.Most of this stuff you will learn over time, and there's a joy in exploring and learning to understand the world. However, there are other things that you'll wish you knew at the beginning. Some things I learnt after 20 hours into the game just by accident that would've been good to know from the get go. Here are a few of those things:1. You can switch weapons using the number keys, but you can also hold down the space bar to toggle through them.2. When your character is out of health and not breathing on the ground, he is dead. The game will not load a previous save for you. It's up to you to pause the game and manually load up a save. Otherwise you'll just sit there staring at your dead corpse forever. :O3. Armour really matters in this game, both for you and enemies. There are some enemies you won't be able to even damage unless you really stagger them and get a lucky hit in. For those ones, you'll need to wait until later in the game to get some better weapons. Same goes for you though. Once you have some quality armour, a lot of enemies won't be able to really do anything to you.4. If you're falling from a great height, hold down left or right and you won't get damaged. Can save your life and also make travelling the world a lot faster at times. (this is obviously a glitch and not an intended game design, but still)This is not a positive review based on nostalgia for this old game. This is the first time I've ever played or seen a Gothic game (in 2015). Gothic 1 is not a perfect game, but if you can get past the graphics (although there is a mod that will help with that a bit), and get used to the controls, it has great gameplay with and an interesting storyline. I'm looking forward to playing Gothic 2 (considered by most fans to be the best in the series).			"

												Gothic is one of the best RPGs ever, and it laid the foundations for other great titles to come. It's open-world and mostly non-linear, though completing certain parts of the main storyline progesses your game to the next ""chapter"" which can change things pretty significantly.Save frequently and don't skip the dialogue quests, because you're going to want that experience to actually survive outside of the camps (and sometimes inside too). You're pretty much dogmeat early on, and fighting multiple enemies at the start is almost guaranteed suicide. Yes, the game is difficult in the early stages and that's why I like it - you're a nobody that gets beaten up from outset, continually threatened and attacked, but you rise up from that to become a hero.You can choose whatever playstyle you wish by advancing certain stats and using the proper gear/items. The main builds are melee fighter or mage (archery exists but doesn't seem entirely viable for several reasons), but you can hybrid as you want and there are some thief/rogue skills available as well.Nearly all dialogue is voice-acted, which was a pretty big deal back when the game came out. A number of NPCs roam around in the camps, making background conversation with each other, wandering off to pee in the alley, and heading to their homes at night, adding a realistic atmosphere to the world.While Gothic is an amazing game, it's not without its flaws. Enemy AI can sometimes be abused to allow you to casually pick off enemies. The game tends to crash a lot later on (it often has to do with it not loading sound files for the orc weapons properly on startup, which could be a huge problem if you or an NPC/mob has one near your save location). The game lacks a crafting system which was disappointing when a conversation early on with a blacksmith suggests you can actually craft more than a standard sword (you can't). The tools are in place for it, because you can cook meat in a pan and smith some basic items... but that's about it. Additionally, some content was stripped out of the North American version - a side questline involving a bandit camp as well as an in-game music concert (though mods have restored these). There are a number of mods available for the game that range from additional content to crafting to entirely different gameplay styles.Some experience problems getting the game to run on modern systems, but there are a number of resources/fixes posted on the forums that have worked for most people. That said, it took me about 7 steps to finally get the game to run (and in doing so it wouldn't completely log my full hours played on Steam, which is nearly double what's officially posted). Because of this, I'd recommend buying Gothic when it's on a big sale just in case you can't seem to get it working... but if you do, you'll find a satisfying RPG worth many hours of play.			"

												The most underrated RPG of all time that should have deserved more attention.Released in 2001, it was one of the first video game to have an immersive, believable living open world with rich dialogues and voiced NPCs, main character can eat, swim, climb, fully interact with the world. It has everything that defined this game as a great and quality RPG.The story overall is not really rich or unique, but it's good and engaging enough to keep player in the loop, with memorable characters and situations. Combat and control will confused people who just started the game, but you will get used to it.Because this game was made by a German company and wasn't well marketed in worldwide, it is not known to many players thus result in being a very very underrated gem. I couldn't understand why Morrowind (released after this game) got more attention, even though its story was indeed better than Gothic and was my favorite TES game. Still, I consider Gothic to be an essential part in video game's evolution and a must play for every avid RPG player.Here are some recommended mods;Unofficial Patch: http://www.worldofgothic.com/dl/?go=dlfile&fileid=164The game itself is not really buggy, some claim this patch causes more trouble than it's worth but I had no problem with it.Texure patch: http://www.worldofgothic.de/dl/download_247.htmGothic 1's textures are very outdated, this texture patch will bring most textures from Gothic 2 to G1. It's not your kind of fancy HD texture pack, but it will improved the graphic A LOT and keep the visual style in a lore-friendly way.IMPORTANT: This game is no longer working with Steam overlay, so make sure to disable it if you don't want to get errors.

												This is truly, together with its sequel, one of the best RPGs in gaming history, and probably a game that set standards for lots of games that came after. It has a well thought combat system that once get used to, it makes the game even more fun. Most importantly it has a unique storyline with player choices that DO matter. And despite the lack of graphics, even now a decade after it was released, it is worth a buy for a true RPG fan.			"

												It's hard to believe an old game released in 2001 already has so many merits that today's modern RPGs are proud of! Gothic has fully voiced dialogue (including the hero himself!), day/night cycle system, weather system, smithing (which is somewhat in detail and realistic), animal skinning, NPCs all have their own simple daily schedule, player even have several different factions to join  ... and yes these all in a 3D hand-crafted open world!In the dark evening (it can be really dark), the hero can cast a light spell (that will summon a light ball hanging over his head for a while) or simply lighting up a torch. Though this does sounds quite usual to today's players, I still have no idea if Gothic was the first 3D RPG that introduced such feature just to add immersive feeling, what I can say is it's quite an useful function in this game. The sound design is also outstanding in its age(except for npc's chatting lol) and its background music is very well done that not only adding points to atmosphere but also can be seamlessly switched between different areas. The storyline is good enough to me that not only makes me keep progressing but also providing a comparatively convincible explanation of that border of an open world lol (instead of some kind of ""invisible wall"" which you've seen a lot in other games...)

												This one is a pillar to the computer RPGs!And even more to that - it is a game that was made in the opposition to the mainstream at given moment, and established some new standards to the RPGs with an open world. So funny to see many critics towards the game because of its ""simplified skill system"", ""over complicated controls"", ""bad voice acting"", ""lack of quality animation""... And you know what? I will not be busting myths there.Just make a statement: without that mature, realistic and hardened gothic game, players around the globe was in chains of stagnation, where all the brightest RPGs were an extensions to already acclaimed ideas (like Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance or Final Fantasy X). Pyranha Bytes created a new pattern, made a new trend.I'm grateful to them. And to that game, which I explored the length and breadth 13 years ago. In which I lived for very long time.As of question ""is it worth buying and playing now?"", well, it is working for me. If you played it earlier and want to refresh memories, or if you are a fan of old games in general - you may give it a shot. And if you simply want to bate your curiosity, like ""I wonder, how it was 14 years ago?"", just go for youtube letsplay and try a Risen game. You'll get almost the same experience (first Risen is quite a retrospective project for Pyranha Bytes).10/10 killed orks			"

												This is one of the best games ever made and a must-have for every RPG enthusiast !Although the game has been released in 2001 and thus doesn't meet current graphical and gameplay standards à la Skyrim (2011), obviously, it clearly proves that the German developers Piranha Bytes understand how to thrill players with astonishing medieval in-game atmosphere, exciting main and sub storylines, hilarious patters, avid anticipation for level-ups, rewarding skillsets, story influencing decisions, powerful orchestral music, and a real existing in-game live band !I played this as a teenager and I feel like playing it again from time to time because in terms of atmosphere Gothic remains unmatched to date. Several different endings and skillsets encourage players to replay the game and dig deeper into the story.Thank you Steam for offering this (rather old) game on your platform !!!  :)Some technical remarks:To get the game running on newer OS avoiding the Access Violation Error right after the start you'll have to make sure GOTHIC.exe runs in compatibility mode (Win XP works fine here). The file can be found in Steam's standard directory:C:/Programs (x86)/Steam/SteamApps/common/Gothic/systemFor many steam users the game starts in window mode and won’t let you access full screen mode.To fix this you either need to install a patch as described in Karuhm’s Guide:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=132167831 or people who don’t want to do that can simply overwrite the video resolution settings in the GOTHIC.ini file, which is located in the same folder as GOTHIC.exe.If the non-cancellable Pyranha Bytes intro video annoys you, just search for the „playLogoVideos“ entry in the .ini-file and set it to 0. There are lots of useful settings in there.			"

Followed by it's sequel gothic II, both games are masterpieces!====Offtopic issues====If you have trouble launching the game in windows 7-10 the try the following:Gothic I:- Install patch 1.08k- In gothic.ini (it is inside the system folder of the game) find startupwindowed and set to true- Set your resolution in the ini file (something like xwidth=... ylength=...)- Set your texture size the ini file to 16 or 32- Set extendedmenu to trueGothic II:- In gothic.ini find startupwindowed and set to true- Set resolution size to your monitor's- Set texture size to 16 or 32- Set extendedmenu to true====Topic-related review====The game is a wonder, but the sequel is even better so go buy them both.The game has very unusual quests, rather than the typical 'fetch' quests like in most rpgs. You get to expand your character during the game by joining one of the 3 factions and training in the weapons you want to unlike in other mmorpgs where you choose your class and weapons from the start. Rather fine storyline, but that's not the main focus of the game. The combat is quirky and hard but once you get used to it you'll love it, but I suggest taking a look at gothic 2's system for something more polished and fleshed out. All in all I think that this game is a unique fish in a gray sea and is definitely worth checking out.			"

												Overall the game aged remarkably well and left me quite stunned as to how modern-games have regressed in terms of making games. To start off I will say there are elements in the game that are rather old-fashioned in comparison to how games have progressed, for example the developers took an extreme use of the ctrl key that is normally used for crouching (or walking depending on the person). So that being said the combat, menus, lockpicking, and nearly every action you can think of is bound to the ctrl key which takes time to get used to.The story of the game was all that a generic story tells and nothing more. I wouldn't expect for people to play this game and be stunned as to the twists that the story told, everything comes at face value in the game, and it's meant to be taken more light-heartedly than other RPGs of it's kind as told by the dialogue and various cutscenes.The combat is relatively interesting and I was reminded of the style of combat that Witcher (CDProjekt RED) decided to use as well. So much so that I even thought perhaps it was the same developers working on the games. I can't say for sure but it is mighty suspicious knowing that Gothic 1 was distributed by CD Projekt a subsidary of CD Projekt RED. It's mainly odd that no one mentions the connection that Gothic 1 had rhythmic styled fighting where you press the directional movement (with ctrl) in accordance to how your character holds the sword. At any rate I can help but feel that Witcher was inspired by Gothic possibly through the connection mentioned above or simply because it was quite popular for it's time, your choice.I'll go ahead and say there wasn't anything sound-wise in the game to make me hate having to hear the same song over and over again. But I also won't say I heard anything too spectacular aside from the one german band that wandered it's way into Chapter 2 of the story in Old Town.Now for some odd faults I found with the game. I'll say previous to this that there was an unofficial patch I found out about after finishing the game with a vanilla playthrough. This could be a fix to all the problems I'm going to mention, but I feel I should say some of them anyways.-Ladders are completely broken in certain areas which can leave players stuck-Enemies can completely dodge attacks infinitely until you block and allow them to attempt a shot at the hero-Enemies grouping give an unfair experience due to you being unable to attack anything but the single target you lock on to while they can mindlessly swing at you-Getting hit causes the hero to get 'stunned' See: Enemies grouping^ to understand why this sucks so horribly-Any and all animations are not invincible animations and while I can understand why this is placed in certain areas, the final boss desperately should have had some sort of invincibility frames when doing actions-Mud-Humans are completely annoying to kill which leads back to invincibility animations as you have to stop attacking them when they fall to the ground, and THEN press ctrl+up to finish them off otherwise they'll infinitely stand back up-Mud again because he got me stuck in the bed when he tried to dialogue with me as I tried to sleep and was forced to reload a save quite a ways back-other odd glitches and whatnot such as clipping through the floor and just dying or sliding off areas that didn't appear to be unsafe leading to untimely deathsOverall despite the glaring flaws towards the end of the game (at least to me), the first half of the game was amazingly fun.The main reason I disliked the last half of the game is because it felt like it was working backwards while trying to progress, for example I had someone working on giving me a piece of armor while I had already gotten the end-game armor. And he still hadn't finished the armor that was weaker than the one I'd gotten. It just felt like I was constantly dealing with stuff like this. Another instance was when I was a high-ranking member of the city and was told that I couldn't buy armor since I was a stranger.To me this is something easily worth checking out and be sure to look for the unofficial patch, perhaps it'll make the game even better for you than I since I had encountered so many bugs.Also there are tons of bugs with simply STARTING the gameHere's a quick troubleshoot list before I found an end-all solution for my problemIf you get an error when you try starting the game, i.e. you can launch the game but then you get an error when you load or start a new game.-Disable Steam CommunityIf that doesn't work-Run Gothic as an AdministratorThe final one-Disable sound in the .ini Gothic file or in the settings menuThis doesn't have to be the background music, but it does take away all dialogue/sound effects for the rest of the game including cutscenes. But doing this fixed the game entirely for me and I no longer had any start-up issues.Again patch may or may not fix this.			"

												One of the best open world rpg games. This game is from 2001 and it has things like parkour, sitting on benches and chairs, swimming, cooking food, picking up flowers and herbs, smoking weed, stealing, lockpicking, sneaking, crafting and animations for eating and drinking. The world is small, but still interesting and feels alive thanks to the great NPC A.I. Some people say that the controls are bad, but in my opinion they were ok (using the alternative controls option in the settings). Controls still take time to get used to. Graphics are good for 2001. Overall the game is a must have for RPG fans.			"

												This is my favorite early childhood game! I have played it hundreds of hours. If you are classical RPG fan this is definitely for you! Recommend for everyone!  Long time ago theese was very nice graphic's , new generation people will possibly never undestand that... It still beats some of the new generation RPG's. Thanks for great memories GOTHIC! :)You may have problems to run game, because game is provided to old generation computers. 1.Go to Steam>Library>Gothic>Properties>General and uncheck the box next to ""Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game""2.Go to your Steam install folder and rename the GameOverlayRenderer.dll to something else (Like to GameOverlayRenderer32.dll) and then should work fine! :)			"

												Just like most people here, I prefer having all my games at one place. I always loved this game and wanted to get a copy on Steam where all my other games are, but it would have been a much better idea to get this on GoG. All Steam does is dump in their DRM and sell it, regardless of the fact that there is no way to make this run on newer OS (Win7 64bit here). After hours of trying multiple patches and fixes, i finally got as far as starting the game, only to find out the graphics got totally corrupted to a point you couldn't see anything. If you get this on GoG, it works out of the box. Just install and play right away, no fixes needed. Unlike Steam, they make sure the game actually runs. There you buy a game, here you buy a bunch of files that used to be a game 14 years ago.			"

												UPDATE: There's a DirectX 11 graphics mod that's in development by the community right now which makes the game look AWESOME and along with the SystemKit and some other patches you can fix the issues that this game has. There's a guide on the Community Hub which explains everything.I remember getting this game from a PC magazine called LEVEL. They had the full game on a CD, I was so little and so naive back then. I used to play this game for hours...and hours...never even getting past the first chapter but enjoying the game more than a kid enjoys christmas. That's how good this game was and still is. While it's somewhat hard to recommend the game since it has a few bugs here and there and it's old, I do so because I loved the story and the gameplay of it.For a game from 2001, this is extremely well done. It's very immersive you if you let it. You can talk to every single NPC from the game, ask him how he's day has been, how things are going and so on. They have their own routines, jobs... it's awesome.When you learn new things, such as the one-handed sword fighting skills, the NPC actually explains to your main character how to behave, the form he needs to take and how to swing, it's epic.About the story, well.. it's great and well explained. One thing you should know if you've never played the Gothic series, is that the game doesn't really hold your hand. You don't have waypoints or anything like that. You only have your journal which explains what you need to do (kind of). The combat is not that easy and takes a while to get the hang of it but it's very entertaining and in Gothic II it's even better.That's all I have to say for now. If you've never played this gem, give it a try! :)			"

												Reading through all the Gothic reviews I noticed barely anyone has something negative to say about the game, so yeah... I'm afraid this is going to be the most negative review on gothic and some people are probably gonna hate me for it, and if you disagree with my review feel free to hit the dislike button but please read the entire review first.First of all I did really enjoy the game, and I do concider myself a Gothic fan, I'm definitly not the biggest Gothic fan but I do think that the Gothic trilogy is the best RPG franchise ever. This game is without a doubt really great. the controlls are a bit akward but you can get used to it. the storyline is pretty danm good. you take the role of the nameless hero who is send to the prison colony with a letter for the magicians of the circle of fire. the colony is surrounded by a magic barrier, you can get in the colony but you cannot get out of it alive, so your goal is to escape the colony. I won't tell anymore than that about the story because I donnot want to spoil anything for those who still want to play it. besides the main story there are a lot of interesting side quests and there are a lot of interesting memorable characters. the leveling system is a bit different from other RPG's like The Elder Scrolls. every time you level up you get 10 learning points/skill points which you can spend to improve your skills or learn new skills and you have to find a teacher to teach you instead of let's say increase your fighting skill by fighting hoards of enemies. I really love the leveling system for multiple reasons, it's something refreshing because you donnot see that in any other game and it gives you the option to train skills you're not using much at that moment because your skills with let's say two handed weapons isn't good enough yet to handle strong opponents. there's quite a lot of variety in skills and it will be difficult selecting the skills that work best for you, like should you train hunting skills so you could obtain trophies from dead animals, or alchemy to create your own potions or should you just train your fighting skills/strength/dex and so on, every skill is usefull in it's own way.the world is also interesting. there are three camps, the old camp which was the first camp, the new camp which consists of people who disagreed with the old camp and there's the sect camp which consists of people who pray to the sleeper, a giant beast who will free them from the prison colony once it wakes up according to their ""religion"". besides the 3 camps there are a lot of different sites you can visit, and what i really like about gothic is taht some areas are filled with creatures you donnot want to meet if you're a low level which makes it even more rewarding if you're finally strong enough to search for loot in that area.If you're a new player the combat system will be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥, well the controlls in general will probably be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ but it won't take long before you master it. I think the combat system is really interesting as you use three buttons to fight and one to block and timing is key in performing combo's so mashing the W button won't do you any good.even though I really love the game this game isn't all good and I have to be realistic about it. this game does have some major problems. the game crashes from time to time, i'm pretty sure it's a compatibility problem as i donnot remember this happening on windows XP. the lockon is buggy as it won't follow your enemy when he's rotating around you from time to time which makes an already difficult game unnecessary difficult and sometimes your lockon remains locked on a single area or target even when it dies making it impossible to turn towards other enemies, sometimes your melee weapons won't do any damage for a longer period of time during combat, you could literaly keep hitting your enemy for minutes without them losing any health. and last but certainly not least if you close the gate to the old mine in the first chapter you won't be able to open it again in the second chapter because the lever (or whatever it's called) is bugged making it impossible to enter the old mine and therefor making it impossible to progress unless you cheat.I really love this game, I really do and I definitly want to give it an 9/10 but the game can be really frustrating because of these bugs making some situations feel unfair because mainly the combat fails you at that specific time, and I hate to say it because I was able to look past these bugs because i was dedicated to finish this awesome game but most new players won't so I have to give this game, because of it's problems, a 6/10			"

												This is on my top list of rpg's and i played quite a lot. It has quite a large world to explore and all of it is hand crafted by the designers. Its not huge but not a computer generated world like in elder scrolls games. There are many interesting places to explore many interesting characters to meet and monsters to kill. There is no special area for strong or weak monsters. You can bump into strong monsters anywhere. So you should learn to escape and come back when you improve. An important rpg feature most games lack unfortunetely! And monsters are also hand placed by the designers and dont respawn frequently or level up with you. They are static throughout the whole game. It has very strong story and atmosphere. You feel like a rat to be kicked around at the start of the game. Everyone pushes you around. But in the later game you feel yourself like a real hero. Exploring the wilderness is an horrifying experience. There is surprise at every corner. I experienced this kind of feeling in very few games. Story unfolds slowly and its epic! And there is night/day cycle. Npc's sleep at night, do their daily jobs during day and some of them gather around fire and chat in the evening. Everyone has his own place to sleep and work. Most of the people dislike the controls but i think it is more than ok. You will get used to it in no time if you be patient and will like it. The story continues in the Gothic 2 and that game is even better! Gothic 1+2=Epic Journey on an Epic World!    9/10  I advice these games to every true rpg fan!			"

Not if you want a deep character-development RPG or an action-packed hack-and-slash game, or if you'd have trouble dealing with the game's various problems. However, if none of these conditions really bother you and if you'd be interested in playing a game that places more emphasis on character interaction and quests than on fighting monsters, you should give Gothic a try!

												Valve really screwed up on pricing this, given its age and the fact that Gothic II, with the add-on, as well as Gothic 3 and the first Risen, are all half the price of this one. It makes no sense, but it's due to the fact that Gothic has not been available for sale on Steam until very recently.Anyway, into the actual review: This is the game that really defined and revolutionized the Western RPG. It gives you a delicately hand-crafted world filled with dangerous enemies and characters with extremely varied motives, who follow a daily schedule. And it plops you right into the middle of it, with little more than the shirt on your back. Go ahead, try and take down the first enemy you come across; you'll probably get pummeled a few times until you learn how to fight.So there you run into the first justified complaint: The controls. While it was an ambitious, complex control scheme, it simply failed to be utilized correctly, due to its general clunkiness and unresponsiveness. However, if you get used to it, you can endure the awkward use of mouse-and-keyboard interface to really enjoy the depth of this game.The setting is truly unique as far as games go. Instead of a world full of peasants, paladins, mages and monarchs, you are dropped into a prison colony which has been entirely usurped by the convicts themselves. Nearly every character you meet is a criminal, to a greater or lesser extent. It becomes a point of stress as you delicately choose your words and who to interact with to ensure you don't run into a twitchy cutthroat or crafty thief. Thankfully, the determined adventurer will find enough NPC's who guide you through this troubled world safely.The three factions in the game give a lot of depth to the opening chapter. You can explore three unique settlements: the Old Camp, occupied by a rigid hierarchy of convicts who adorn themselves as agents and soldiers, and answer to the tyrannical Gomez; the New Camp, a ragtag group of rouges and mercenaries, who live in careful harmony, and who answer only to their chosen leaders; and the Swamp Camp, or the Brotherhood, a group of fanatical monks and novices who believe they have found the path to salvation in a mysterious diety known as the Sleeper.Once you're past the first chapter and have chosen your faction, the game gets increasingly linear, perhaps to its detriment, but the story escalates and becomes exciting enough that you may be able to ignore the fact that you're given only one path. As you continue to develop your character, you may open paths to magic, giving you a powerful arsenal of spells to rain hell and become the colony's ultimate powerhouse.So I've really talked up this game, but now the question is: is it worth the price? Well, if you're going to play Gothic II or 3, I definitely recommend taking the time to play the first one, to help you really understand the world and conflict, as well as learn where the characters you encounter repeatedly in the sequels have come from. Of course, I've already stated that this game should not be priced twice as high as the next two games in the series, so I wouldn't hold it against you to wishlist the game and wait for it to go on sale. But at $20, it's still worthwhile for a classic RPG that set the standards that developers such as Bethesda and CD Projekt made sure to abide by.			"

												1000 + hour in Gothic trilogy ( not on steam ) Now , let's begin. The game itself is really painful I mean not like the games we play these days. It's brutal , unforgiving and controls are hard to figure it out (kinda bad but  they fixed it in Gothic II )  It's really easy to say ""this game is not worth my time , we are in 2016 what is this garbage man really "" well actually I said that too (about 7 -8 years ago) however this game worth your time and money.       This game is difficult ! I mean you will probably blame the game %90 of the time , like monsters are overpowered , controls are bad , you can't even do any damage to some strong opponents.You don't even have quest marks! You need to learn how to use map. You will get lost most of the time . Ohh well we can talk about those situations another time , no need to scare people from the beginning right?  First you will walk with Diego everything is fine but wait some bullies are trying to take your money by offering protection , how hardcore those guyz can be ,    right ?  ""Come and get it""  but damn , they will beat you up so bad you will probably cry. You are just a simple messenger ! You are not fighter , paladin or mage. They are not gonna respect you , they are not going to let you sneak upon them and steal stuff and they will beat you everytime they can because they are NPC's of this world and this is their world. YOU ARE NOTHING , you are just a prisoner who needs to deliver a message. This thing is the reason why this game is so beautiful and awesome . LEGENDARY NAMELESS HERO will learn how to fight , how to use magic he will make some friends , improve his talents , join a faction (Old camp , New camp , Swamp boyz) , smoke weed etc.( You can smoke weed anytime and anywhere you want (BLAZE IT!)). There are 3 faction / camps you can join one of them. Every one of them have different quest-lines and they are changing the story a little bit. Thanks to Kai Rosenkranz soundtracks are awesome and improving atmosphere. I don't want to say anything about story just play it.-Story 9/10-Gameplay 7/10-Atmosphere-Soundtrack 10/10-Overall 9.6/10.Recommended ! For Innos.			"

												I know it only says 2.5 hours but I played this game way back when it first came out. Yes the controls, graphics/acting is kinda eh but this game is great. The storyline is good even though the acting is kinda eh at times. Gothic 2 picks it up and makes it grand.Regardless, I am writing this review because I think people should play it, it's a good 7/10 for it's time period which I played when it came out. NOW, for those who are putting up negative reviews cause the game doesn't work.Go to STEAMAPPS/COMMON/GOTHIC/SYSTEM/Gothic.exe(It should be the G icon). Right click it, go to properties, compatibility mode, then put it to Windows XP SP3. Click apply, and then launch the game through steam. It might crash when quitting the game but who cares about that. The game works without any silly fan patches and etc.			"

												Every great series has to start somewhere, and Gothic starts off with a solid bang. The story's surprisingly well-done, the gameplay's (extremely) challenging and rewarding, and it provides a level of immersion that had previously been unrivaled in RPG's similar to it. There's one massive problem with it that really makes it hard to enjoy however: the controls. It quite simply has the most idiotically awful control scheme I've ever seen in my entire history with RPG's. This ends up making the game far more difficult than it really is, because the player has to adapt to a system that's designed specifically to cripple them. Still, it's worth looking at, especially for fans of the later games in the series who never got to play the original.			"

Even though the graphic is old this game belongs to games you like to return.The only con of this game are bit wonky controls and slightly annoying fighting systemAlso for everyone experiencing troubles with this game, there is a fix online which also adds 16:9 view and helps with performance on newer graphic cards, so if the game doesn't work then check here: http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1340357-Release-Gothic-½--SystemPack-(ENG-DEU) "

												Decent graphics and a well-developed storyline. It also has a great amount of replayability, as each time through the game could yield different experiences with different choices.The dark and mature theme gave this game a distinctive feel and the graphics take the player in deep within the prison world.One of the best role-playing games of all time. Fact that after 13 years from release date it's still entertaining and addictive as hell is best recommendation I could give.			"

												I just got it to play and finish it for second time. I had done so when it was released.For the new guys, Gothic was the first RPG that introduce:1.	Open world2.	Full speech dialogue - the death of text conversations3.	Classless characterAnd also revolutionary features like:1.	Gamepad control2.	Nonlinear story progress3.	… and many moreBack to its age, it was a diamond. From every aspect. Even graphics - Piranha used revolutionary techniques like blinding on longer distances.Unless you want top today's graphics or arcade combat, I suggest with no second thought.Below are some gameplay elements you may wonder about:No, there are not 1234456654 possible random weapons and armor to accompany you on your every level.You get experience, which is points to use on a trainer to learn something or improve an existing knowledge. Besides the level based learning points cap, all choices are free.When you lay on hands on a decent weapon and armor, then you will really feel what it is like. A good simple sword will deal real damage and armor will really protect you.No, you cannot block a wolf's attack. Or other animal. But you can block a weapon attack if you time your block properly regardless who your opponent is. Still you cannot take on strong opponents that most likely wear armor that your weapon cannot really penetrate.You start as an errant boy, become hunter/archer/thief, then fighter, then mage. By story you become a mage but you may keep dispatching enemies via melee. But magic is magic here - you really hit hard with spell casting.Hardcore players may stick to a class but there are still learning points for secondary alternatives. Even if you become a top mage you certainly have miscellaneous other skills like acrobatics or skin animals or been expert at least on one melee style or range combat.And some tips:1.	Gothic is very hard, and especially at the beginning, deadly hard. Be patient and if you don’t like dying, treat is more as a RPG simulator than game, it is deadly realistic. Dark souls is arcade compared to Gothic2.	You can play with mouse and keyboard, keyboard only or joy pad. Familiarize with controls. Make sure you ‘have it’.3.	Action and forward is action. Like pick up, open chest or door, talk to someone or strike melee or range or spell. Melee also has moves for action and left or right and block for action and back. Locks are picked by action and left or right at a predefined sequence. If you fail the sequence, your tool will probably break and you need to start over.4.	Exhaust dialogs. Save before. Sometimes you better not say something yet. Few times you get into deadly trouble if you lie to someone who you shouldn’t for example.5.	Explore everything at the vicinity which is free or monsters there are manageable.6.	Monsters you can kill – it is important to know what you can handle each time. All monsters with the same name are the same. If you can kill a wolf, you can kill all wolfs. One after another of course.7.	To kill 2 or 3 or more monsters at the same combat you must either be very superior at armor (not damaging you or damaging like 5% max per hit) or a combat genius or both.8.	Use a bow to scan ahead for enemies. If you don’t have be careful until you do.9.	Starting monsters are youngsters of the kind. Don’t get full by graphics alone – same monster is adult later on and much more difficult. Read the name – always. 10.	If you don’t like dying to find out if you can manage an enemy, the only safe option is bows because you cannot escape melee easily and strong monster may kill you with 3, 2 or just 1 hit. With a bow you can safely get an idea and run if the idea was not good!11.	Pick up everything. There is no inventory space or weight or other limit.12.	Ore is the game currency.13.	When trading, use items as payment by priority and not ore.14.	Also, if you can give items to get the traders ore, do it.15.	There are cases where you need ore to buy, armors mostly.16.	Try to keep few items of each kind at least until you enter a camp. That’s for food and miscellaneous. There are some quest you can finish instantly that way.17.	Complete what quest you can complete and kill what you can kill. Gaining levels will help you increase health and get learning points. Learning points will help you deal more damage.18.	If you go melee you need strength. +1 strength is +1 damage. Very useful because you can hardly get a better weapon just because you level up. Loot is also rare from that aspect. You will find weapons but worse than the one you have that you probably bought. Skill with one or two handed weapons helps in combat but increase damage only because of higher chance to do critical hits. So it is strength first, weapon skill afterwards. Chance to hit is full manual, if you check distance and timing your blow correctly you hit, else you miss. So it is all about your combat skill, then character strength and weapon, then weapon skill.19.	For ranged combat you need dexterity and bow or crossbow skill. Dexterity increase damage but not at the rate strength increase melee damage. Bow or crossbow skill however not only increase critical hits but chance to hit. The shorter the enemy is, the less it moves and the higher the ranged weapon skill, the higher the chance to hit. So plan is dexterity required to wield the best ranged weapon available, top skill possible. Please note that there is extra resource cost – arrows and bolts are not to be found at sufficient quantities and you will need to restock.20.	For defense now, you can only buy armor. It is not a matter of cash alone however. You need to advance your status by joining a camp and raise into the hierarchy to buy better armor. Baan a member of a guild now, the level counts as a secondary filter for having access to better armor.21.	Entering magic, you may start with the brotherhood and gain access pretty fast but limit to circle 4 from them, or wait to go with fire or water mages at old or new camp and go up to circle 5. Not sure what happens when the story drives you to the old camp and you may join the water mages. Again not sure about Xardas who only teaches circle 6, but I guess you can reach circle 6.22.	If you plan to be a mage don’t bother save all learning points. You better focus on gaining levels instead. But focus to a single other killing method, like melee with 1h or 2h or bows or crossbows. Save learning points, but not all. Learn what you see fit.23.	Learning to take furs and trophies early on is very rewarding. At some point cash is useless but learning this will bring that even closer. Combined with stealing from chest, especially from the inner building at the old camp, will solve your finance limit problem for the rest of the game.24.	Don’t kill humans unless they are attacking you. Early on you can’t kill anyone anyway, later on you don’t have to and at the late part of the game you have to kill some folks but it is obvious. 25.	You can talk to anyone, but only people with a name have an active role on quests.26.	Try to solve all quests possible, some will eventually fail because you solve others.27.	A quest may turn difficult, try an easier one.28.	On journal, except quests, you can find info about traders and teachers.29.	There is no map. You can buy one however. Still memorization of the world is necessary, more or less.30.	Be careful when climbing and double careful when going down.31.	Except from area exploring and quests especially early on, don’t try to exploit all in the game, do all correct and in the correct order. The game is very rewarding and fair give back for the casual, smart and careful player. There are many secrets and details. Try to satisfy all you may end unhappy and overwhelmed. 32.	Experiment a lot. With scrolls, combat strategies, people, other consumables, heights and anything you think of. There are plenty surprises for the smart player. "

												Note: I've finished this game several times, but not the Steam-Version. I also play with the ""PlayerKit"", and with this modification, the playing time doesn't count, so don't get confused about my ~1 hour of play time. :DThis is one of my most favourite games. I started playing this masterpiece around 2004/2005 and I still LOVE it! The Gothic-Series (except Part 3) has been the best RPG series ever existed. I also played Skyrim for around 300 hours (~100 with the account of my brother), I loved it, but the atmosphere and the fighting system isn't even near as good as in G1 and G2.+ Story!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+ FIghting system+ Athmosphere+ Character identification+ Cool armor, cool weapons (altough there could be more)+ Cool Fractions!- Not Designed for windows 7/8, I had some work to do to get it running (Nr.1: Delete the ""Read-Only"" parameter in the folderoptions of ""SteamLibrary"").- The graphics are really bad, but this doesn't matter for me (and there'd be some texturepacks out there!)- The fighting isn't as smooth as in gothic 2			"

												1. I want to emind you, that it´s ♥♥♥♥ing annoying to get the game working. I recommend to first try compatibility mode in windows and if that doesn´t work use the system patch. That should work!2. It´s definitively worth it! The game grabs you with it´s unique antmosphere and characters, who always act logical! The world itself is beautiful and you can discover enemys and chests in every corner, when you search for them. Although the world doesn´t look big in the beginning I never thought that I am missing something, because in fact you are in an ""prison"".All in all i´d say, this is one of the very best RPGs ever made!

												Alright... just played through Gothic 1 and got some impressions...It should be mentioned that this piece is over a dozen of years old and for me it's a game of my childhood. I couldn't beat it back then and after many years I bought it again to fulfill this part of my childhood. It was quiet different than I remembered, to be honest.I had some complications on getting this game to start, as it crashed whenever I tried to start a new game. A short problem, as there are many solutions when you google it.A bit annoyed but excited I started the game and met the first enemy: the controls! I was so confused that I had to switch back to google and get some explanation. But I don't consider this as a bad point, because the controls may be hard to learn, but easy to master. After an hour of active gameplay it already felt very natural to me and picking up items wasn't difficult anymore.There are some possibilities to build your character. You can pump your guy to a musclular sausage and focus on strengh, or pay attention to dexterity and use a bow instead. You don't have to stick to one stat though and combine! Magic is also an option and you can spend your skillpoints on max. mana or use better spells (which you can't learn, but buy them as runes).I've tried everything: Swordfighter, Archer and Mage, and I can tell that the battlesystem in Gothic 1 is terrible and great at the same time. For attacks you focus on one enemy with holding your click. With ranged attacks, such as arrows and spells, you can only hit the actionkey and let the focus aim. There's practically no skill needed and only stats count. Swordfighting on the other hand is a bit different. You keep your focus on one enemy and hit one of the movementkeys for attacks. What I absolutely like is that it really feels like you use the momentum of your weapon. You can use some little combos and it's satisfying when you hit your target. But what destroys the satisfaction is that sometimes the enemy won't take damage from hits. As a high level fighter it is possible to brutally let your rage go on a lizard for a minute even though you'd one-hit that thing, just because it doesn't take damage for some reason. I don't know if I just overlook something but it's an issue that's not only ruining the fun for me. It gets really frustrating when you face a horde of enemies and while you beat up one beast for nothing, the rest of the crew chews you for breakfast.But besides the battlesystem, Gothic gives a good first impression when it comes to atmophere. You start with empty pockets and the weakest stats possible. Even the easiest creatures are dangerous and you pick up everything you can, even unuseful garbage. Being on the lowest part of the foodchain, you try to gain some experience to have at least a chance to survive in a fight and you have nothing more than a rusty axe. Without armor it doesn't take much to fall unconcious. So what do you do? You increase your strengh, surprise someone with better weapons with some kisses from your axe and drain his inventory empty. After that, you knock someone else out who has a better weapon whan you and so on and so on... You climb from the bottom to the top and when you joined one of the three camps and get better armor, you can fight like a real man!But there's an enemy you can't fight with weapons... We call them bugs, and they are present in Gothic! Jammed winches are famous here and you should be happy when a gate opens on action! I counted! In my playthrough I had to pass 6 gates which you have to open via winch and 2 'were jammed' for unexplainable reasons. It's a common thing in Gothic 1 and the forums are full of this problems. The game would be unbeatable when you're stuck in that way, but luckily they included cheats in form of ""Marvin-Mode"" which lets you teleport to certain waypoints. Probably this Marvin-Mode was made for such situations, but it's annoying anyway when you have to tap out and open up the webbrowser. Oh, and the game doesn't like it when it doesn't have your full attention. You have a 50:50 chance for a crash after tapping out. But even mid-game crashes happen, so save your game every 5 minutes! In my lategame I encountered a crash because a soundfile was absent. It's awfully frustrating and a big minus for the game.An aspect I enjoyed in Gothic was the simplicity. The HUD consists of only a healthbar and sometimes your mana. There's no questionmarker, read/listen what your NPC has to say, damnit! No minimap in the corner or experiencebar. No textfield which constantly tells you obvious things like ""You obtained a Rusty Sword (1)!"" and the hotbar for weapons and spells is also hidden. Only the things that are needed right now is on the screen and you have your whole screen to look around the world. Normally you don't have more than 3 quests and because there's no questmarker to hold your hand, you have to think a little bit. I only got stuck because of bugs and I never had the urge to put myself into shame and dig up a walkthrough.Those crashes, bugs, strange battlesystem and sometimes stupid AI give me a bad view of this game, but it also has a lot of enjoyable things! If I could, I would put Gothic right inbetween good and evil, but because I can't do that I have to choose either ""Thumps Up"" or ""Thumbs Down"". And hey, I played many hours, so I had to be somehow entertained. Give this old piece of art a chance!			"

It's the best thing ever  Name Gothic 1   Release Date 15 Mar, 2001   Current Date 28 Sep, 2016   Graphics Creepy, in a weird way   Story Excellent   Choices Enough   Length [hours] 35   Achievements None Pros  Great Story  Interesting Combat system - As you advance your skill, animations and style change  Multiple factions, each with a different initiation and ideology (Old Camp - Fire Mages and Guards; New Camp - Water Mages and bandits; Swamp Camp - ""Gurus"" and junkies templars)  Open World  NPCs have their own schedules (They sleep, eat, drink, guard etc.)  Lots of skills (Alchemy, Magic, 1H/2H Swords, Bows, Crossbows, Sneaking, Lockpicking, Pickpocketing and more)Cons  You might have to manually do some stuff to get it to work  The AI is often just plain weird (in a funny way)Neutral  Some people might find it too difficult  Personal suggestion: Try to join the fire mages in the Old CampNote: I played this game years ago outside of STEAM for a long time, pay no attention to my playtime; If you can't start a new game with windows 7, go to your Steam location and delete ""GameOverlayRenderer.dll"".

												I played Gothic 1 for the first time in 2011, i had every reason in the world to find this game pathetic and disgusting in every way, but amazingly so, i didn't.Puting the graphics aside (which is not that difficult, trust me), you'll probably have one of the most deep RPGs out there, the character progression, combat, dialogues, history progression and freedom are insane, not to mention it takes forever to close this game, i've 30 hours and i did almost nothing compared to the almighty god you become at the endgame parts.And i really find it curious how the community ignores this game cuz i've played TES: Morrowind a long time ago (2004) when it was still relevant and i've no doubt how better Gothic 1 is comparing to Morrowind, my 2011 Gothic play was more refreshing and inspiring than my 2004 Morrowind play, and don't get me wrong Morrowind is a great game, the best TES after Skyrim, but everything in Gothic 1 is either the same (dialogues, combat, etc) or better (character progression, history progression, freedom, etc).Trivia: i love how you can stealth-kill some 'non-important' NPCs at the beginning of the game and skip character progression like hell cuz they give TONS of experience, it's like killing MissingNO in Pokemon Blue/Red 'till you evolve your Charmander to Charizard and then destroy Brock's Onix lv 14 with a level 40 Charizard, but i only recommend this in a second playthrough.

												This is simply one of the best RPGs ever created, it spawned a Series of 3 games and one abomination and has cult status in Germany. Everyone interested in RPGs should at least give it a try.The controls are something to get used to, but once you master it, you will certainly have a lot of fun and experience an epic story in a credible environment.Gothic is open world, but at the beginning it is simply impossible to reach most areas as the enemies are way to tough and will kill you in one blow. On the other hand, character progression feels very powerful and you will find yourself yearning each next level.Gothic 1 and 2 are, simply put, masterpieces of a rare kind and a must own for every loving gamer.

The review for Gothic 1What makes this game what it is: Ambient for this game is amazing and to me it is nostalgic too as i have already played this game before several years ago. Soundtrack is lovely and again nostalgic which makes it just better. When you start game controls will feel weird as they are different then most stuff you see in modern games or games in general however i personally got used to them quite fast( approx 20 mins), they are not bad just different. Combat is awesome, when you start game you are nothing and you know nothing including how to properly use weapons, every time you learn how to improve for example Two Handed sword fight style the NPC who teaches you this skill will explain how to use it, yes you heard me he will explain not just you went learned and that's that, no. Learning techniques in this game is something which every RPG should have but pretty much none has. Story is fun as it is set at quite unique place, it is jail but like none i have seen in any videogame, to me at start story felt week but when i joined one of three factions i will receive tasks which i should do and certain things will happen and then to me personally story begins, it is interesting, fun & well written.Few things/problems this game has: AI, when you have some quest in which someone accompanies you, AI is real pain. For example Lester can stuck on top of Table etc. When npcs follow or they go to somewhere like Stone to his workplace he can stop and not move and if you want to reinforce ore armor you have to reload. There are few occasional bugs and glitches but nothing really serious, only thing i personally had problem were 2 ladders on which when you get to top its pain to get on ground and most cases you fall down. This game may not work on modern systems, in such cases you should go to Guides and follow one of them, Sadly i had this issue but thankfully there were guides with which help i could fix and play this game once again.( You just have to install 2 or 3 files which will make it run and/or turn off overlay)Amazing game with few minor flaws, recommended to every RPG fan, pure and simple classic and must play if you don't care about how game looks.10 out of 10, even tho game suffers from few bugs and glitches it is one of those game which i loose track of time completely and i love it.

												Most RPGs have levels, numbers and stats. Gothic 1 has progression.Most RPGS have a questlog. Gothic 1 has a story.Most RPGs have combos, cooldowns and button smashing. Gothic 1 has combat.Most RPGs have scripted NPCs. Gothic 1 has a society.Most RPGs have autoscaling difficulty and hold your hand. Gothic 1 does not.Once light years ahead of its time Gothic 1 still beats most RPGs in terms of roleplaying, believability and immersion.			"

												It was an incredibly immersive experience back then. I was so scared to find myself alone in a dark wood outside the camps safe walls.The graphics aged poorly, but the story is just as good. There are mods out there that improve the game, fix bugs and enhanced graphics. Worth a shot!			"

												The game is pretty old, so expect compatibility issues with recent OS and hardware. Also, it's pretty buggy on its own, so SAVE OFTEN. If you can get past these inconveniences, Gothic is actually good: being an open world RPG, you can go everywhere from the start (with the risk of glitching the game) and do/be lots of things. You create your class as you play (warrior, ranger and wizard, or a mix between them), just  don't mess the skillpoints placement from the start.Early in the game the combat system may look clunky or even broken: that's because the main character sucks so hard he'll die with a sneeze, but once you'll get proper equipment and better training you'll be able to play genocide or destroyer of ecosystems. Few games gave me a sense of impotence at the start like Gothic, I liked this aspect of the game. The economy system, instead, was a big let down. It's really basic and easily exploitable.Good story and setting, easily replayable. You may want to install some mod/patch to restore contents cut from this version.Overall a really good game, if you got it with the Arcania bundle you got a really good deal.SAVE OFTEN.			"

												FIrst Off ! My ''Steam Hours'' are only the recorded time of my purchase of Gothic in digital copy. I have played OVER and OVER this game and still can not stop re-playing this CLASSIC once and a while. I have Passed this game numerous time and it never gets old. Of course the graphic is a bit OLD but what else would you expect from a game published in 2001 ''NA''. I STRONGLY recomand this game for fans of RETRO gaming or fan of the GOTHIC series since in my opinion this is the best of the serie. There are some gameplay issues and some bugs here and there but it does not ruin the game. I do not recomand if you are not familiar to the serie due to its ''HARD'' gameplay and CONTROL scheme, but once u get over the control you truely appreciate the MOTHER of RPG games. 10/10 when I was and kid and 11/10 now that I play this classic still more in depth. U CAN LITERALY BE GOD or be what ever you wnat to be and choose the faction in which you want to participate. POT heads out there !!! You shall find a home ;) Love this game and never gets old <3			"

												I just played through Gothic for the 13th time (I counted; first time on Steam though!) - because it's my absolute favourite game of all times.But I really wish I could give a ""thumbs sideways"" neutral review here on Steam. While I love this game so much I'd marry it, it's also broken in so many ways. I had to install some (fan) patches to actually get it to run sanely on Win 7, and thankfully I even could restore In Extremo's little scene in the second chapter.Yet so many things are kaput - either due to the original code, or introduced later thanks to new hardware - that it's hard to tell new people ""play it, it's cool"". You always had to explain five pages of things to a newbie (e.g., don't walk into a forest just like that - the controls are easy you just have to get used to them - do most quests before deciding for a camp - etc. pp.), but now you have to add ten pages of technical issues one might encounter.Climbing on higher ledges didn't work anymore (for me at least), which means I had to cheat my way up some hills. Sometimes a dialog with an NPC breaks completely and you have to kill the game's process. (Experienced this a lot of Lester and Xardas.) A lot of enemy react strangely now; I blame the patch which removed the 30fps restriction. Collision became more awkward, sometimes the player hangs forever on a slope, so you have to reload. And there is absolutely no working fix for the vanishing inventory items.My 13th playthrough probably is my last one because of these issues. I still do a ""recommendation"", because nostalgia.			"

												An important note about this game is that it isn't meant to run on Windows 7, 8, or even Vista. It was made back in 2001, and you'd better be prepared to jump through some hoops to get this thing working. I ran this game under 8-bit color mode with Windows XP Service Pack 3 as the Administrator, and even then I couldn't get the opening cutscene to play (the other cutscenes worked fine, though). I can't guarantee that you'll need to do as much as I did, nor can I guarantee that you'll need to do only what I did. Keep that in mind when looking at this game.Story:People don't play this genre for the story too often, but it's still there, and still worth mentioning. You play as the Nameless Hero (yes, that's his title), sent to The Colony, a magical island prison, to deliver a letter to the Magicians of Fire. You'll end up joining one of the prison's three camps, the Old Camp, the New Camp, or the Sect Camp, in the process. To say much else would be to delve into spoiler territory, so I'll just say that the story is a lot better than would be expected, but it's still no Dragon Age.Graphics:Graphics have come a long way since 2001, and Gothic is nothing if not proof of that. The game looks, to put it frankly, terrible. Models are blocky, the textures are blurry, characters look like they were barfed out of a Dreamcast, forests in the distance are replaced with a really crappy-looking forest picture...thing, and so on. I didn't have much of a problem with it, to be honest, but others most certainly might.Voices: Terrible, but laughably so. That's really all that can be said about this one.Combat: Normally, when you start off in an RPG you can swing a sword with ease, but the problem is that said sword is made of dirt and you do no damage. So, you buy an iron sword, put some points into strength, and start movin' on up in the world. In Gothic, however, The Nameless Hero starts off swinging his weapon so clumsily he might as well be on resident drug Swampweed. You overcome this by paying trainers to teach you how to more proficiently use items, but doing so means you're not putting points into Strength. This creates an interesting tossup; is it worth doing more damage if your character can't swing the sword at all? Is it good to flashily swing and spin your weapon if you do so little damage?Combat is simple, but effective. Block when the enemy attacks, attack when possible. However, the majority of enemies will kick your ♥♥♥ so hard it'll fly off to the Orc Lands until you level up a ton. It can be annoying, sure, but when you finally take that beast down you'll feel fantastic.Technicality: Oh god. This game has some horrific bugs. It occasionally crashed on me. Oh well, I saved a ton for reasons mentioned above. I can't climb certain ladders due to the geometry of the map. Oh well, there are ways around those ladders. The game repeatedly crashes in a certain late-game area unless you hack the game, turn off the sound, keep playing for about thirty seconds, hack the game again, and turn the sound back on....Conclusion:Did I sound like I hated this game? I don't. I actually quite like it. The thrill of powering up and taking on tougher foes can't be easily matched. The story is surprisingly pretty decent and I cared to see the end of it. The bugs were awful, the graphics were painful, and the compatibility was hard to get around, but despite all that, I can't help but wholeheartedly give this game a great thumbs up. You won't get it 'till you try it, but once you take it for a spin, you can't put it down  until you see the end.			"

 An epic journey begins! First off - I played  and finished Gothic 1 on a non-steambound copy, so my amount of played hours is inaccurate.As you can see by the pictures on the store page, Gothic is a pretty old game with old graphics so if you can't stand playing without more up-to-date graphics but still want to have a simular experience you should check out Risen - the spiritual successor to the Gothic series. Combat in Gothic is kind of clunky and you'll have to invest in teachers (with gold AND xp) to make it more viable - making every skill decision even more important since the spent gold wont come back to you unless you kill your teacher - which is a pretty stupid idea since there aren't many people around who can teach you and most of 'em require you to do 1 or 2 quests to gain their trust!Despite having outdated graphics the soundtrack and voice acting of Gothic good (at least the german voice acting - sadly I haven't heard the english one yet). The map is large and littered with monsters, trinkets and many rememberable locations - such as the old camp in the mine colony or the sect in the swamp.Another downer about Gothic are the bugs - but most of them can be fixed using the debugging console - so if you're willing to (maybe) go to the trouble of bugfixing once or twice you'll still have a great time – given the game runs on your computer (It has various issues with Windows 10 and 8, mainly random game crashes!)Now that those points are clearified: Let's talk about the RPG-legend that is Gothic! Gothic is the first installment of Piranha Bytes ""Gothic"" series. It's story begins with the nameless hero being thrown into the ""barrier"", a magical border around a colony of mines in the Gothic universe. This setup can be compared to Stephen Kings novel ""The Arena"" – making the whole approach very unique. A bunch of criminals, mainly male, is imprisoned in a large, rough and unforgiving area full of dangers and new social structures have established. Gothic manages to make the game feel extremely ""alive"" by clever chracter relations, item placement, location-setting and the overall development while progressing through Gothics story.Gothic will treat you like filth in the beginning - most of the combat will be extremely tough and you wont just stumble upon a viable weapon after 2 minutes of playtime. You'll long for new sets of equipment and will be happy for any piece of loot you can aquire! The game will not hold your hand and you'll have to figure out how you can reach your goals - making it even more rewarding if you solved a complicated quest or tricked a strong enemy into being killed by NPCs.After playing a while you'll be able to join one of three fraction - the old camp, the new camp or the sect of the sleeper. Each fraction has a unique realtion to the people of Gothic and you'll be treated in a different ways by NPCs depending on which fraction you chose. The questlines and sidequests of these paths differ a lot and are all genuinly well implemented - even in the late game, giving you a solid reason for replaying.Overall Gothic is (in my opinion) an extremely detailed game with plenty of hours of fun and immersive playtime to keep you busy - and if you don't mind the old graphics and genuinly enjoy RPGs you should grab it on sale and give it a try!

												DISCLAIMER: WITH MY INSTALLED PATCH STEAM WON'T REGISTER MY HOURS . THE ACTUAL GAME TOOK ME AROUND 60 HOURS.Ok now that I got that out of the way. I must say this: I don't think there is another game like Gothic out there. This game has a great atmosphere, like none you have encountered. You are a prisioner in a penal colony full of criminals traped under a barrier. You may not realise it but the barrier works with the fact that this game is pretty small for an open world and it feels right to be this way. Everyone will try to bully you in a way of another (remember these are criminals not fairies) and it will be very hard to get on your feet (the game dosen't hold your hand, you will try to squeeze every little resource you can get ) but when you get  to be someone , that hero in shining armor getting revenge on those who bullied him (oh yeah the revenge is coming belive me ) you will feel like a god, more so because you got there by yourself and you know how hard was for you at the begining.THIS IS NOT A GAME, THIS IS AN EXPERIENCE.I don't have what pros to point, this game speaks for himself, you have to try it, however  I will point some cons as a warning for those who want the game:-It is kinda hard to get this beast to work, search for some patches online .- The graphics are very old, you might want to look for a DX11 mod.-The controls are clunky but you will get used to it fast. The combat is kinda unforgiving as you will have to time every hit in order to work. I quess it's part of the challange.THAT'S IT GO AND PICK THIS GAME RIGHT NOW ! 10/10 (no joke and I am kinda harsh with games)			"

												I DON'T PLAY THROUGH STEAM BECAUSE IT CAUSES PROBLEM, SO I HAVE NO TIME ON RECORD.Best game I've ever played, first love, first RPG, first everything amazing.... I've played through the entire game multiple times throughout the years and this game truly has the most amazing story I've ever heard and it's so likeable. You truly take on the role of the hero and you connect with the world, story and players. This game to be played today would seem choppy and in poor graphics, but first of all, you can adjust the resolution plus download a texture pack from world of gothic .com, but for the time it was released, it was good. If you've never played this game, I would suggest you buy the whole gothic 1,2 and 3 pack. Play them in order.			"

												Best Gothic series game so far. It's old and maybe does not look this good but the story the original gameplay... Fantastic. It had some bugs which made me at some point to give up. But second time I played the game through I found a solution and got to finish the game. It had some sound bug when I tried to get past the last ancent orc shaman and crashed every time. Also  in the end there is a lack of mobs to kill. Eventually you want to use the most powerful items and lack some levels but have no way to obtain them, expect to summon mobs myself and then kill them. All in all the game was great and I recommend playing this for all rpg fans.			"

												Playtime: 30-40 hoursThis is one of my favourite RPGs of all time. The Steam version has a few issues though.You do need 3 fan patches to make it run on Win7 and you have to disable the Steam Overlay for this game in the options. And even then it might crash when certain magic effects are involved (had several crashes in the ffinal area of the game while trying to load my game when I was stunlocked by magic).Still this is a must play for fans of western RPGs.

												Disclaimer: Steam time seems to be bugged for this game - I actually played it till completion, but for some reason it didn't account it.I decided to try out this game out of nostalgia - it was THE rpg of my childhood :) It was quite bittersweet revisit, I'll try to summarise my experience with pros/cons list.Pros:The story is fun, and quite enjoyable. Camps have visible differences in their ideals, so the choice might be an interesting one. I also really liked the fact that character basically remain mysterious and nameless - quite an interesting take on RPG character. It's left to your imagination what he used to be like - whether it's a peaceful man or homicidal maniac. I think it was really clever idea for an RPG. At it's time, it felt really fresh. It's fun idea even now!Combat, while simplistic and sometimes dull is pretty fun.VA (at least in polish, not sure how it's in english) is really well done. One of the better RPG's VA I've heard.Cons:Game is really bugged. Probably it's the reason why the game is not sold separately. For examples: skipping Pyranha Bytes logo might lead to freeze. Game throws errors quite often as well. One time when I closed inventory my character teleported high up the sky and died due to fall damage. Another bug is that Inventory stucked opened and there was nothing I could do except restart. I even couldn't pass one bridge as well because it always crashed!  Had to turn off sound in ini file! If not for my nostalgia bias I wouldn't bother. I personally think it's modern OS fault - the game just doesn't work well on it. I don't remember it being that bugged in the past.Non-monster NPC AI is really dumb - for example you can enter a house of a person, lockpick a chest on his eyes while he's threatening you, and leave without consequences. The only exception I can think of was Lares' home.While story is fun, it's very linear. It lacks any meaningful choices. Camp choice is pretty meaningless - since Chapter 2 you just follow linear path. The only major impact of a camp is an armor which you're using in a given moment.Interaction with human NPCs is not really meaningful - you can kill an NPC, and still see him alive in the next game.To sum up, I enjoyed my time with the game. Had it not been for the bugs, I would easily give it to 9/10 and finish the review. Heck, I still think the game holds up pretty well despite bugs! And the mentionad score is personal one for me. But it's probably mine nostalgia bias. So if you want to try it out again to relive the experience, I wholeheartedly recommend to do so! On the other hand I wouldn't recommed it to people who never played the game in the past - it's not working properly on modern OS's, so one needs some extra motivation to look past severe technical problems. I must be fair and say that it's easily 4-5/10 and not recommended due to severe technical issues of this game. I played on W7 in compatibility mode and it's that bugged. I can't imagine how it's like on more modern OS's, such as W10.I still leave recommended for this game, as I throroughly enjoyed my time with it despite bugs and crashes :)			"

												The Gothic series is a gritty grim dark roleplaying masterpiece from Germany. It is the RPG ultra version of Dark Souls before there was any Dark Souls. It is clunky and didn't age well, but it has infinite amounts of soul and thought. It has been so many years since I first played this and I still remember all characters, as they are memorable. Quests are oldschool, complex and not always evident.A true masterpiece, which is only outshined by Gothic 2 together with it's expansion.			"

												This game really isn't for everyone. Here's why: The combat is really wonky, It reminds me of Ultima 8, I'm not sure how else to explain it. It's a real-time click to attack sort of thing, but it just feels off. The graphics don't hold up to well for most. (I personally love them) The voice acting can be bad. (I love it) The game is difficult, but not in a sense you need tactics or skill to win, but because of stats. It's full of bugs. (Most are not game ending, many are benefical exploits) It takes a specific kind of person to appreciate a game like this; my recommendation only goes to those who can put up with flawed games. Here's some of the reasons why I love it: I love starting out pathetically wimpy. Through exploring and learning the game you get stronger. It can be fun to try to find exploits to give your character slight advantages. Explore too deep, and die to beasts you stand no chance against.  There's often more than one way to solve a quest, there are no big yellow arrows to follow. I love the factions in the Gothic series, unlike in Bethesda games, factions are not some side quest, they are the main quest. Factions can change the story, your character, and how you end up playing the game. (Replay value!) The story and characters are pretty uniqueIf you're willing to give this game a shot, I recommend Gothic Universe Edition (with 1, 2, and 3). All 3 games are good for different reasons, and you can pretty much start with any of the games. The games do follow a linear story, but each game tells the story of the previous through interactions with characters.			"

												Gothic is an open world Action-RPG. You play a nameless hero who gets thrown into a mining colony in which a few mages casted a magical barrier to seal everyone inside but end up trapping themselves in it as well and thus after a short talk with Diego, you set off to accomplish a mission inside the barrier and the story evolves into much more, and it's a pretty good story which I don’t want to spoil.The game doesn't look all that amazing, it hasn't aged well but there's still a good bit of attention to detail at times. While the textures are pretty good, the modeling is a wee bit odd, animations are actually kind of funny and the voice acting is hilariously awful, with some dodgy translation from its original German release. Presentation wise, it's not all that great. But the gameplay is what's really important and it's something quite special. You are thrown into this vast open world, and right off the bat you can notice how awful the control and the UI are, they take a lot of time getting used to but it's worth adapting to, trust me. One of the first major choices you are given is to join one of three camps: The Old Camp, the New Camp and the Swamp Camp. And that sort of, in a way, determines the difficulty in the beginning of the game, with the Old Camp probably being the easiest to join, but the choice is up to you and choices in this game matter, because it's a roleplaying game.The combat system in the game takes a while to get used to but at the end of the day it’s a really good combat system, it’s very timed and skill based. At first I thought it was awful, but turns out I just didn’t understand it and I don’t want to go into too much depth because I’d like you to figure it out on your own like I did.The game has a fairly moderate sized open world and it's yours to explore freely. It makes sense to have an open world in this game, everything feels connected in a way and as you travel the colony it all feels really natural. It also helps that the game heavily rewards exploration, just don't get discouraged if you stumble across a really powerful beast that'll kill you in one hit, that's just kind of how the game is, if you stumble across something like that, it just means you aren't ready yet, but if you see a place being guarded well, you bet your ♥♥♥ there's something good there, you just need to come back at the right time when you're ready to take on the enemy and you feel great once that finally happens, but I'll get to that in a moment.After playing for a bit, you've probably have noticed that this game is brutally difficult. When you start this game, you're absolutely worthless, the game pushes you on the ground and laughs at you and you have to deal with it, but the more you play, the more you level up and train, the better you get at the game, you eventually get to the point where you can laugh back at the game, and, I'm not lying here, being able to get to that point is one of the most satisfying feelings I've had in all of gaming. You really get this feeling of character progression with the protagonist and you feel like an absolute badass by the end of the game once you finally figure out how the combat works, you get used to the controls, you're powerful enough to take down the strongest of enemies and it all feels fantastic.Sadly though, I have experienced some bugs in the game, some of which are game breaking, but after some research online, I managed to find a fix for the game breaking bug, so it's not completely hopeless.So if you can handle a game without any handholding, a game with a brutally unforgiving difficulty and rarely some annoying bugs which may require some tinkering around to fix, you're in for probably one of the greatest RPGs of all time.Also, I would highly suggest to get the game from GOG instead of Steam since the Steam version has quite a few problems. Also be sure to check PCGamingWiki for any issues you may be having.			"

												Let me start with some technical tips in order to fully enjoy this old gem.If you should encounter problems with starting the game I recommend you to visit worldofgothic.com, or search the game hub. I'm sure you will quickly find a solution for your problem. Furthermore, I recommend you to take a look at the widescreen patch and the FPS fix.It's a really well made (controls need getting used to it though) roleplaying game, where roleplaying is defined by actually playing a role, making decisions with eminent influence on the game's world and story, befriending and antagonizing with several NPCs and interacting with many little things, even if it is just to sit down on a bench, rather than having tons of loot and a skilltree.However, the lack of a skilltree doesn't mean that there is no character development. In fact, it will feel far more present than you are used to it by most of the games. Right at the beginning of the game you will discover a strict hierarchy in the game's world with you starting at the very bottom. Many players abandon this game, because the protagonist is so extremely weak in the beginning, but if you accept this fact and slowly but steady climb up the hierarchy you will encounter moments, which are extremely rewarding and make you realize that you made significant progress with your character. For example getting your first real armor.The game offers you to join one of three factions, which provides quite a different gameplay, depending on your choice. This also guarantees at least a second playthrough, if not even a third one.The world itself is lovely designed, surely the graphics are pretty much outdated by now, but just the arrangement of all the objects and the overall design is amazing. It's still one of my favourite worlds I would like to visit in real life.I know it can be quite rough to dive into an older game, if you have never taken a look at it before, but in this case it definitely deserves a chance and even a second one. Once you've overcome the quirky controls and prefer games, which aren't casualized you will love this game.			"

												It's a game I remember fondly from when I discovered it way back in the 2000's. The down vote is only for the steam version as it does not work here. As others recomended, either get it at a different place or seek community patches to get it to work.Good thing they added refunds, so nothing was wasted. Hopefully steam fixes their version eventually and I might buy it again.			"

												Gothic 1 is one of my favorite games! Why do i love such an old and not accurate game ? --> Well it's the cool and harsh atmosphere! As a criminal you are thrown into the barrier (A Magic dome that won't let u out any more), and have to live with the criminals in the barrier where are three faction:    - The old faction (the criminals took over the old Castle),    - The new faction (Bandits in the northwest) and the    - swamp faction (A bunch of sort of ""weed smoking"" crazy people praying for a deamon called Sleeper, they think should free them from the barrier)The atmosphere is really harsh! If somebody don't like you, he just punches you and takes your ""ERZ"" (the money in the game)... or u don't like him and need money ;) (don't get caught) xDAnd the cool thing is, that every job you get can be done in a few ways.Every decision you take will affect the game.You start as a very week person and increase in fighting skills every level you get.The skill points you get every level up, can be spent in Dextery,Strength,Mana or one of the Weapons-Skills.Theres also the possiblity to play as an very very mighty Wizzard.It all depends, what are you going to be: a close combat one hand, or two hand sort of knight, an Archer, or a Wizzard.I played the game 4 times ... In every game i tried to build another charakter, and it was really fun.I also tried to complete the quests in difficult ways.Graphic:    5 of 10   (old game but gold ;) )Music:       9 of 10   Story:      10 of 10replay:      9 of 10  <--- every faction is different And i really like the kind of ""badass"" main character ;)But i am not going to tell you the story ... Find it out yourself, you will love itIt's a very old but GOLD-Game !If you don't mind the little bit out of time graphics, and you are searching for a very good game, then give it a try there is also a veeeeery huge community!Just search for these two Websites:   --- worldofgothic ---   --- mondgesaenge --- (german)You will get every information needed for the whole game.The whole Gothic 1-3 Series is very great !Gothic 1 is the real original.Give it a try and buy ;)			"

												Where to start with this one? I don't think there has been a video game series that I've enjoyed more than Gothic. Steam will lie to you and it will say I played 0.3 hours of this fine game, but know that is complete bollox. I've played and finished this game at least 10 times, and another 20 where I stopped somewhere along the way for role-play reasons. It has good world building, albeit a lack of your or an NPCs personal backstory. Good enemy variety and, if you are playing it for the first time, a very good game difficulty. Not to mention the best progression system I have ever come across in an action RPG. Let's dive in deeper to see what this gem has to offer.As I mentioned before the world this game is set in is amazing. It takes place in a prison that serves as a mining colony for King Robhar. All the criminals of his realm are sent there, regradless their crime. Naturally, you will find all type of people in it. Those who haven't payed their taxes, thieves, some of the worst murderers in the kingdom and many, many more. Now to ensure that the prisoners do not try and escape, Robhar sent out his best mages to erect a magical barrier around the valley that welcomes all, but lets nobody out. The mages cocked it up and the barrier became a lot bigger than it should. While all the guards were looking at the pretty magic lights prisoners killed them and took control of the colony. Some stuff happens, ba da bing ba da boom, you show up. A convicted criminal ready to be chucked in there with the rest of the scum. This is the game's starting point.Now for what reason you are sent in there God only knows. You are terrible at literally everything. The game makes up for this by offering its amazing progression system. Every time you level up you gain learning points, or LPs. You use these LPs not magically in your character screen or a level up screen, but at a trainer who will demand LPs and possibly some gold for his services. It is not just that your stats will improve, but your animation will get better, at least for weapons training. At first you hold a one-handed weapon with both hands and are extremely incompetent. When you train your skills you will begin to hold it with one hand, offering faster animation and more critical chance. That makes character advancement in this game very rewarding, at least that is how I felt. Also if you get quite skilled at this game, you will notice you can do stuff you couldn't before. Like beat an Orc warrior at level 1 if you want. While stats matter, the most important thing is your ability.The world has a full day and night cycle that matters for both monsters and humans. Most monsters hunt during the day and are asleep during the night, which makes it prime time for hunting if you are not comfortable at fighting them off fair and square. Humans also behave according to the DnN cycle. They will gather at night near a campfire to drink, sing and eat, or they will go to sleep. At day they will be at their posts, trading, training or doing whatever. This is a thing games that came after Gothic touted about. In some respects like this, Gothic was ahead of its time.Its not all sunshine and rainbows in Gothic land. The game visually has not aged well. It sill has great visual features, like an amazing view distance. But the texture quality is outdated and it shows. Sound overall is great. Nice music, decent and recognizable sound effects, however to say that the English voice acting is lacking is like saying Pepsi is better than Coke. Don't lie to me, I know you like Coke better you hipster. To be fair, the German voice acting is, from what I've heard, great. Also the controls are weird, but you get used to them pretty quick.To put it bluntly. If you like action RPGs get this game. Do not be put off by outdated graphics and controls. Don't be that guy. Nobody likes that guy. If you spend and hour understanding this game, you could enjoy it for years to come.			"

												The first Gothic is one of the games of my childhood.I recently finished the latest 2 games with the ""Gothic"" subtitle(Arcania and the Fall of Setarrif),which shouldn't be called Gothic anymore and got back to this classic.And  15 years later it still feels good despite obsolete graphics,animantions etc. If you haven't had a pleasure to try this classic out then do it! You won't regret and you surely will buy Gothic II afterwards :)			"

												This game is like a piece of ore - it's very crude and hard, but if you can process it, you will have something valuable. In this case - experience of having played the game. Which is not easy to do. You probably won't be able to play this game without some patches and mods. Good thing the community surrounding this game has got you covered. Nevermind the obsolete software and hardware that is required to play this old gem, with a bit of tinkering i bet you'll run this. But the game itself is not really easy to play. It has probably the weirdest controls i've seen in my life. But they can be got used to, although the control scheme had stopped me from playing in the past. Some things are cryptic, some things are counter-intuitive and some are downright broken. The bugs are big parts of the game. And you need to save very frequently not only because the game is hard and unforgiving, but because some glitch can wreck your playing real hard. Overall feeling of the game is charmingly unpolished. Personally i love this intimate feeling of unrefinedness. You might not. For it's time it's really impressive what the creators were able to achieve.  But it can be obvious sometimes they were too ambitious. For example - the whole game's dialogue is voiced. But there were only a few people for hundred of characters, so the main hero were delegated to sound like a goof. I played with the guidance of my DEAR friend, so i did not fall for many of the game's traps and i finished it in about 26 hours. So it may be true that you can get the 100 hours of gameplay listed in the description, if you play thorough enough.			"

												Some memorable moments I had included:* Paid guards in Old Camp 10 ores (practically nothing) as a 'protection fee.' This allowed me to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of all of the residents who didn't pay the protection fee, loot their unconscious bodies, and rob any chest they had at their home while they could do nothing but stare in horror as they laid in their own blood soaked puddle. In only an hour or two I've robbed every dirty peasant in the camp. The ones who tried to run away from my thrashing left a bloody trail that I followed to deliver swift punishment.* Guard I have to pay 'protection fee' to every day ""falls off a ledge and dies"" ;). He didn't seem to think that a 10 foot fall was not fatal in Gothic. I no longer have to pay my protection fees.* A blacksmith offers a ton of crafting materials that I could sell for 50 ores when they're completed, he had something around 80 iron rods (~40 ores each) and then 40 half-crafted swords (~60 ores each). Obviously such a small profit margin is unnacceptable, so I beat up the blacksmith, took all of his crafting materials, and repeatedly robbed the smith every time I was back in town.* Guy offers me 100 ore to go buy him a sword. The merchant says the sword costs 110 ore, so I guy back to the guy and he gives me 10 more ore. I buy the sword, saw that it was better than the current one I had so I just kept it for myself. Later in the game he found me, was angry, and attacked me. I smited him with his own sword, looted his corpse and then claimed his house as mine.* Everyone in old camp is frightened of me. When I talk to them, their mouths shiver violontely, & their eyes gape open in horror. It's almost as if the game developers are trying to make me feel bad for being such an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but I only find it hilarious.* Deliver marijuana - I mean 'swamp weed' - to Old Camp king's right hand man, be told I can't talk to king. So instead I beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of one of his henchmen and steal the guy's sword (which was better than my current sword). Next time I go into the castle, the guy is still there and he yells something like ""Are you using my sword?!"" and tries to kill me unarmed. I promptly smite him with his own sword, and not even the king seems to give a ♥♥♥♥ that I killed his own henchmen in his own hall.* In a mine I found some guy, Slippy or something, and a guard is watching over him as apparently he tried to loot ♥♥♥♥ from the guard's chest. I convince the guard that he needs to be somewhere and he ♥♥♥♥s off for awhile, and in the meantime I talk to Slippy who sells me the key to the chest for 20 ore. I agree and fortunately the stuff in the chest was worth far more than 20 ores. I still feel robbed so I kill Slippy and take back my 20 ores. Later on I meet the guard again, and he says he lost the key to his chest, so I give it back to him for 10 ore, not knowing that I had already looted his ♥♥♥♥.* I'm just strolling across a bridge when I pass a guy who tells me some sob story about how he was some captain for a king, interestingly you can read about a skirmish he had won in some large war in a book elsewhere in the game. Anyways somebody killed the King's wife and blamed him for it, and he had only been exiled rather hanged because of his previous service to the King. I felt really bad for the guy, so I beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of him and stole his war axe, the strongest weapon in the game until the last chapter.* I am trying to get into orc territory, and some guards are guarding an entrance. I walk past them and one of them tells me ""If you're going in here, you might as well give me all your ore so it doesn't go to waste when the orcs rip you into pieces."" Sounds good, so I give him all my ore, went in to go kill some orcs, and when I came back to the entrance I knocked both guards unconscious and got my ore back. I had 10,000 ore that I had gave him, he had 20,000 on his body. Not sure why he doubled my ore, but I was so thankful that I didn't kill him until later in the game!* I entered a rice field with peasants farming throughout the entire day. Some rogue guy tells me I should go deliver some water to the peasants, so I agree and go get some water from the Rice Lord. He only gave me 12 water and told me I had to ""distribute it among the 24 peasants."" By this point in the game I had hundreds of everything from swords to cheese just sitting in my inventory so I gave all 24 peasants water. Rogue guy tells me I need to come back to the farm every day to give them more water, but I don't have time for that, so I killed him, and then killed the Rice Lord along with everyone else at the farm.* I've killed so many people that near the middle of the game, guards of Old Camp are supposed to show up in a certain location to guard a certain thing. Instead of a healthy troop of men, most of the guards were either corpses of people I had already killed, or unarmed guards of people who I had bullied for their weapons. They were frightened to see me with my sword pulled out as I killed them one by one while they yelled ♥♥♥♥ like ""I get it, no need to fight me!""* I envoked on a rather long quest to get an orc to make me some OLOOMOOLOO kind of thing that is kind of like a sign of friendship among orcs. Basically it's a sword that, when equipped, doesn't get orcs to try to kill me. It's necessary for an Orc Camp as there is like a hundred of orcs in that camp, so the game developers intended you to just walk past them with the sign. I found it quite silly though as I had already slain nearly all the orcs at that camp already, something I guess you weren't supposed to do. It was funny to see an exiled, friendly Orc Shaman talk about how he just watches his orc brothers at the orc camp, and reminds me that I need to hold the OLOOMOOLOO in my hand so the orcs don't kill me; the orcs I had just killed not so long ago.* Needless to say that at a later point in the game where I believe a ♥♥♥♥ton of people from Old Camp are supposed to be trying to kill me, as that's what I believed the game had planned to set up, they were all running for their life because they knew how much of a monster I was. I did not dissapoint them to say the least.* Almost everyone that isn't essential to the main storyline I have murdered. But, at the end of the game, I can act like the good guy who saved everyone (that I haven't yet murdered, saving them for Gothic II :]) from the barrier! Yea, I'm the good guy! Yay me! Sorry for constant first/third person switching.Oh, and the controls are great outside of combat. I bound movement to WASD, jump to space, action to J, and strafe to Q/E. Never touched my mouse. F (first person view) is a great key to use while running or climbing ladders. Bugs made me want to stab my eyes but I made it through.			"

												Gothic is a very immersive game with lots of exploration and hours of content. One of the things I liked about this game was the multiple choices that were game changing. I love the fantasy setting too and the different schools of magic. I recommend this game.			"

												Gothic is a really great and underrated game.The gameplay is different from other RPGs such as The Elder Scrolls, Not everyone may like it.The gameplay is better in the second In my opinion, the game like the other Gothic and Risen games, can be really confusing sometimes, the quests, the map and pretty much everything but the game itself is really awesome, It's different from the other RPGs, you may think it is bad because of that but it is not.Just 2 things I do not like which are the freeroam and the ending.Do not except  The Elder Scrolls or even a Fallout game, it's open world but at the same time it's linear.You cannot continue after the ending, not even a new game plus.Those are 2 big flaws that are common in the games made by Piranha – Bytes.For some, it could be positive but for a gamer like me, they are both flaws.It's pretty much the same for every Gothic and Risen games, just that some have a better story, gameplay, items etc than the others.If it was truly open world with unlimited freeroam and we would be able to continue playing after the end, I would probably give it a 9.5/10 but since it is not the case I'm giving it a 9/10My favorite list:1. Gothic II2. Gothic3. Risen4. Gothic III5. Risen 2: Dark Water6. Arcania: Gothic 4 (I wouldn't consider this one as a Gothic game though)They are all good In my opinion, but some are more worth than the others, of course, they all have their good and bad.If only they would have a true freeroam and no ending.9/10			"

												This game is what Ultima 9 should've been. I guess that doesn't hold much weight anymore though. You can manipulate almost every item in the world, you can smoke from a hooka, sit in chairs, sleep in beds, etc. People get mad at you for entering their house and pick fights with you if you steal from them. It's more fun than modern WRPGs because of how complex the NPC AI is. NPCs aren't just lifeless husks waiting patiently for you to solve their problems.On top of that it has a great story.			"

												Game doesn't run very well through Steam — there's a fatal error when loading a game that is supposedly resolved by turning off the overlay, but I had to just run the game straight from the folder to get around it. The result isn't really worth the effort. The game does a lot of interesting things and is cool to play as a predecessor to today's open-world fantasy games, but the controls are so horrifically bad that it makes combat nigh-impossible and everything else stupidly frustrating. Even remapping the controls doesn't help. To attack anything, you have to press a Ready Weapon button, then use the Use Item button to swing it. You can only target one enemy at a time. You will probably miss more often than you hit. To interact with things in the world, you have to have your weapon put away, select the correct item or person by holding the Use Item button, then press the ""forward"" control to initiate the interaction or pick up the item. It's ludicrously complex and not worth the time.			"

												The first part of the Gothic trilogy makes the best effort of making you feel like a underdog, you start with nothing and have to work your way up by gaining the trust of the 3 factions and learning skills. You can barely kill some giant chickens and some giant rats at the start, but after a few levels and some new equipment you can handle even bigger pray.One of the bigger complains is that you spend the great majority of time in Chapter 1 testing the limits of exploration, and all chapters after that are go to these specific locations and do quest, accelerating the speed of the game.Combat: all combat is auto-lock, making it difficult when fighting more than one enemy.melee combat is very odd, you have to enter in combat mode with space bar, and make a combination of Ctrl+WAD to attack in that direction or block Ctrl+S, you can get used to it.range combat depends on your skill to establish witch minimum range can actually cause damage.magic is hard to get going and op as usual, if you put the effort to get there.

												When i first started to play Gothic, i realize that the features we see in todays RPGs are taken from this game. It's made in 2001 and for me it's still better than most of the RPGs made nowadays.. Don't stick to the old graphics and think you will be bored while playing. Belive me if you dont mind the polygonal graphics and actually play it, you will find out that this game is a piece of art. Graphics are old but well designed. The world programmed amazingly especially if you consider this game is made in 2001. Techniques that developers use for story telling are still using today. Side quests are detailed and fun to do. Most characters are have their own personality and behaviours.Can't help but mentioning about the dialogues... They are hilarious !!   And of course, the story of this game (as you probably heard before) is like a very well written  movie story. ""This game is gold and everybody who interested in RPGs should play it.""  Short version : MUSTT FUKINNN PLAYY !!1!			"

												This game was very fun to play when I first got it around 2003 and 13 years later I find myself replaying it for every faction, just because it is fun. I played through the story start to finish 10+ times.  Being melee, archer, or mage is fun, provided you got used to the mechanics. The story is really fun, and if you keep in mind what year the game was released in, the end part is crafted amazingly well. Please do not spoil the game by looking at the guides, go in cold and figure out how it works by playing through it. If you finish it and go from the start knowing more about it, the second time around feels so much more rewarding. Explore the world of Gothic!			"

												WARNING: very glitchy.The game ran without glitches outside of steam, however the steam version is especially glitchy (using windows 10). Works best on windows xp. Running with xp compatibilty is perfectly playable.Really good RPG game - the big difference is that monsters do not spawn. It feels FAR from the other RPG where you just have a click-fest of 100000 buffs and farming the same monsters 1000000 times. You can only kill each monster ONCE and they never respawn, making each fight a pretty unique experience. The combat system is really simplistic and offers large room for the skilled players to show their skill, and still is very friendly with players who are not good with games. No respawn, once you die you have to load a saved game, but you can save anytime. You can kill almost any NPC, however I strongly suggest you don't, as you may find yourself unable to continue the storyline! It also gives you room to explore almost any area including near-end game areas, without affecting the main storyline much.Really unique game, really balanced, great story, great fighting system, inventory well done, you don't spend 1000 hours looking and comparing items, You can easily pick up and play. Great classic RPG/Adventure game			"

												Actual Playtime - 42 hrs 27 minutes - I thoroughly enjoyed this game - BUT, I only recommend it to those willing to jump through the glitch hoops to get it to run.On windows 10 you will need to make some adjustments...The reason my time only shows under two hours is because I had to set up the game to play from the desktop icon to avoid an access error... so steam didn't record my time.   and I had to resize the game screen because fullscreen didn't quite work... every single time I played, through 215 saves...and at some points you'll have to turn off the sound in the config to avoid some crashes in the later game, but I'm very glad I managed to deal with the glitches because I loved the game, and  I used Joytokey to set up a gamepad and it worked wonderfully.  Great Game, hope someone takes the time to fix up the glitches for future players, because its got a unique story that deserves a play.  Graphics are a bit dated, but I grew up on Ultima, so it looked pretty good to me.  All in all, a satisfying experience if you've got the abilty to and patience to work out the glitches.Completed game, now on to Gothic II.			"

												This game ate up 18 hours of my first playthrough, and I am yet to stop wanting to go into the world of Myrtana, whether it be here, Gothic II or Gothic 3.Pros-----* Good world-building* Cool magic spells* Forging a weapon early on* Requires you to go out and LEARN from people instead of putting points into stuff.* You're not an all-powerful savior* The uncensored patch. Just a single edited part.* Traders have legit amounts of money, meaning you can actually steal and they won't have any money leftCons-----* Even with the patch and changing controls to be mouse-based, controls are still a little weird* Some may not like being just some guy that happened to be in the right place at the right time* Some puzzles are confusing* Color was pretty dull throughout the game, although that was Pirahna Bytes' intentionThis game is really worth it if you get the Gothic Universe bundle on sale, along with getting Gothic II and Gothic 3.

Really fun game, has some glitched/bugs but you can use them to your advantage which makes it more interesting to me.  One of the best features is there are 3 factions you can choose from, so the game changes on the faction you choose to go with.  Highly recomend.			"

												This is an excellent game: but a quick note about by play time. To get this game to work on Steam I had to run community patches that ended up playing the game's .exe file outside of Steam so it seems to not have recorded my play time. I beat the game in about 30 hours, which is similar to my first playthrough years ago.Gothic is tough to get used to. You really have to get past the archaic control design to see the beauty of this RPG, but to anyone who loves open world RPGs that favor exploration, I urge you to get this series of games. You will be turned off by the control design, you will be turned off by the fact you have to do a multi step fan patch on a German website that feels overly complicated. Just do it. Then figure the game. Once you have it running, give yourself 90 minutes behind the barrier, and I bet you will come back for more.This game's world captures your imagination as you explore it. You venture off the road in the wrong direction and you die. You learn to save and you learn very quickly which ways to go. Leveling up means something. Quests mean something. Joining a group means something.Get this game! And prepare yourself for its even better sequel Gothic 2 Gold Edition.			"

												I have not completed this game due to the HELLISH control scheme, however, I loved the game so much that I suffered through trying to learn, and advanced fairly far in my opinion.That being said, this game is a masterpiece of its time, and a great immersive world DESPITE being aged badly.  All the npcs have a personality of their own, and that being said, they all seem to have different voice acting done for each one.  Now how many guards in Skyrim have a different sounding voice or way of phrasing their words?  It's mainly copy-pasted in todays games.  In this game it feels as if every character has their own seperate audio track, no matter how small a character or how mundane a role they play.  You just don't see this in games.Combat is intuitive, but, as said before, hellishly stupid control wise.  Everyone seems to have their own style, animals have different ways of combat, and every person has their prefered weapons, or style, or anything really.  Just, extremely in depth.The world is small, but you will never seem to see it that way.  You have your choice of which camp to belong to.  Whether you're a suicidal maniac just trying to explore the world or if you're trying to get into a camp and prosper there. (You can explore...  Just... Not fight, stick to the camps.)  Progression also can only happen after you train with people who know what they're doing.  You don't just magically learn how to use a sword.  In the beginning of the game, you can't even hold a sword correctly!This game just has so much depth, and this is coming from someone in 2016, who really never played it before now, and I still enjoy it as much as I would enjoy Skyrim, and probably even more, DESPITE the bad controls.

												Alright, so this my first time reviewing a game on Steam, and I felt I had to do it because this game is really awesome. It's huge in every sense of the word - long, hard (that's what she said :P) and has a level of freedom you wouldn't expect from a game more than ten years old. You can do pretty much everything you want - sleep, grill meat, forge weapons, make potions, skin animals and take their teeth  and even smoke pot and sell it for profit - and go anywhere you want in the game's world without a quest asking you to go there.The sun rises and sets, NPC sleep, wake up, work, gather to talk with each other, etc. etc.Being a RPG, the development of the character is always important in such a genre, and Gothic really shines in that department. You start as a poor weakling who gets beaten up by everyone and hardly can kick  harmless little creatures called meatbugs. Then, as you complete quests and defeat enemies, you gain XP which can be converted in strength, dexterity and mana points. You go all the way to a badass warrior, a lethal ranger or a supreme mage - you chose how you want to play it.As for the bad parts, I just can think of one: the game is VERY buggy, and that can totally ruin your game experience if you don't know how to avoid it.A few important considerations about the game if you want to play and enjoy it:- Steam doesn't provide a game manual for Gothic, and that truly sucks.  If there are some games which you can start playing without reading the manual first - most modern games carry in-game tutorials - this is NOT one of them. The controls are a bit akward and if you don't read about them first I guarantee you won't be able to play the game at all. Just visit the Steam community page and you'll easily find a link to download the official manual in PDF.- You can and you SHOULD run the game on Windows 7. My desktop computer is a Pentium IV with Windows XP, and I thought It would be better choice for this game to avoid system compatibility issues. Well, that was a mistake. The game kept crashing anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes of gameplay, especially when facing multiple foes, not to mention some inventory items didn't even show the picture. I googled it and updated all my Nvidia and sound card drivers, but the problems aforementioned remained unchanged. I was very close to quit playing the game at all, but I thought what the heck, let me try it on my laptop which runs on W 7. It got A LOT better. It only crashed about 10% of the time (ah ah), especially during the first visit to the Sleeper's temple (be sure to save a lot there) and the inventory issue got fixed. I don't know about Vista or 8, but the game seems to like Windows 7. Oh, and make sure to disable Steam interface during gameplay, or the game might not start at all.- The game allows you to save whenever you want, so make sure you take advantage of it. I suggest this not for cheating purposes, but to avoid losing your game progress due to a crash or even worse, some bug where a gate doesn't open when it was supposed to or you end up killing NPCs vital to the plot who shouldn't be allowed to die at that point of the game.- Get a walkthrough. I suggest the one by JemyM, which you can easily find online. Again, I recommend it not for cheating (you can even skip the walkthrough part per se) but for the unvaluable information it contains regarding gameplay and common bugs and how to avoid them.- Go to a place like worldofgothic.com and download the map pictures. Trust me, you will need them.- If you're more into action games, maybe this game is not for you. Through most part of the game (especially the first chapters), you keep running from place to place around the colony, doing chores for other people, looking for objects, etc. Sure, later you'll feel like an invencible killing machine - it felt VERY rewarding going back to the Old Camp and slaughtering all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who mugged me in the beginning :P - but it takes a while to get there. Play this game for the RPG experience and the story, and you will enjoy it. "

												Gothic is a open world, Action, RPG type of game which was made in 2001. It detail grathics arnt the best including it's akward controls and combat.The story is your trying to free yourself as your trapped inside a magic barrior. The choices you make are up to you along the way to join what guild, quest and adventure to do.When I first bought gothic I got it because of a sale. Shortly after playing a few minutes I got addicted and before I know it they turned into hours.If you don't like games that have bad grathics and controls I don't suggest you playing this. But if your like me who dosnt mind and enjoys Action RPG. I suggest you give this old game ago. You may get hooked like me.Note: There may be a part of the game that glitches and needs a patch than you can find on the gothic website. Not all copies have this but I thought I put this in just to keep it in mind.			"

												Oh the nostalgia... great game! If anyone's interested: I got it to run on a Mac with Wineskin (MacBook Pro with Mavericks). From what I read it should be possible with Linux as well.I basically followed this guide to set up steam with a Wine wrapper: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/how-to-create-a-fast-mac-wrapper-with-wineskin.84490/, then downloaded the game, and played it. Make sure to also install the directmusic Winetrick, turn off Steam overlay in the game's properties, and don't try to skip cutscenes or the intro. Can't speak for the whole game though, as I'm still in Act I.			"

												If you are no incompetent moron, you should be able to make this game run within 30 mins. Even I could do that in less time. So stop ♥♥♥♥ing crying that it doesn't run when you downloaded it. Or at least, stop giving the BEST RPG ever made a negative rating only because you are too stupid and/or too lazy to watch a god damn youtube tutorial about how to fix it! I am very grateful that I got it here. If you are not willing to spend some time to be enabled to play this game, you're not worth playing it. i mean, it took me more time to figure out how to eat food or equip a weapon in this game than making it run, so unpatient fools like you would never find a way into this game anyway. All I wanted to say is: If you can't do such an easy thing like using google to figure out how to make the game run, not the game sucks, but YOU suck. Thank you.			"

												From a nostalgic point of view this game gets a 10 out of 10 from a contemporary review it gets a 5/10 at best because it's outdated, yet i still give it a thumbs up because the atmosphere in Gothic is awesome. You're thrown into the barrier, somebody, a stranger, a loner, nobody cares about you, nobody wants to even know your name and you don't even know that the ♥♥♥♥ is going on when we get punched in the face and left in the dirt. Here tstarts the adventure of the nameless hero. That part really reminds me of Akira Kurosawas Yojimbo or the Western remake For a handful of Dollars by Sergio Leono, a nameless guy comes into a gritty world, only were Eastwood was quick to take advantage you start as a nobody with no skills and no knoledge about the land. Trapped under a magic barrier 3 camps want you to win you over while you have to deliver a message to a group of magicians who are trapped here. Gothic is a very old-school RPG, the makers constantly said that classics like Ultima 7 were influences when they started to make this game and you can tell it on evey corner. Quests are like ""Go there....somewhere....get me something"" and not how modern RPG works were an arrow leads you exactly to the point of interest as well as the game making sure that you never feel as a Hero. You're not the knight in shining armor, you're not the saviour of the world. In the beginning even 2 Scavengers can kill you, a group of Blood flies  kill you faster than you can say ""i wish i had a proper sword"", you're a nobody who has to learn everything, has to level up and find a role to play, wether it's a Swordfighter, a Archer or a Magician with specifications in between: 1 hand or 2 hand Sword? Bow or Crossbow? Magician of various arcance ways? Of course also the question which of the three camps you follow or if you play them all against each other like Eastwood did in the first Dollar movie. You can even do that though ultimately there's one way to Freedom. I'm old enough to remember when the game was previewed in german gaming magazines and the hype was build, though even back then there was bit of negativity toward the controls and while Piranha  Bytes went from Keyboard only to a more comfortable Keyboard + Mouse system it's still a far cry from todays fluid controls. Picking up items and fighting is uncomfortable and will take a while to get used to it. Also since this is a old-school RPG the difficult is considerably higher than what gamers today may know from the likes of the Bethesda games. A single enemy can kill you, you need to be more strategic in your fighting early on and use your learn points wisely to level up in the fields you desire (as mentioned: melee 1 hand, 2 hand, bow, crossbow, magic) you can't be a master eof everything like you can be in Skyrim. If you fight through, learn some skills and get used to the gritty world you will find a very atmospheric world that takes cues from medieval europe as well as being influenced from Lord of the Rings, A Song of Ice and Fire and german Fantasy works like Das schwarze Auge (The Dark Eye) with a dark realistic world and a great soundtrack with atmospheric music. I recommend it with a warning about the controls but if you can get over them as well as the outdated graphics you will find a really good RPG. Altough i guess the english voice acting and translation is a far cry from the german original. If you know some german play it in it's original form!			"

												One of my favorite games - of all time. Don't let my playtime played fool you, I have played the non-Steam version 1000+ hours with over 15 playthroughs.WARNING:Get the GOG version at https://www.gog.com/game/gothic . This game won't start because of the Steam overlay (GameOverlayRenderer.dll). This issue is unresolved for ages. Modding this game is also very annoying using Steam.Now, in short about the game itself:Good:+ Immersive world and atmosphere, each NPC has it's own daily routines.+ Music and ambient sounds.+ Great and unique story.+ Skill system works well and was ahead of it's time in my opinion.+ Glitches+ ModdingBad:- Bugs: in particular crash to desktop and the collision system (climbing ladders...).- The combat/animation can be slow and frustrating the first few levels. Fighting multiple enemies requires patience and some strategic workarounds.- Locked FPS.Tips:- If you've never played this game I can recommend to play melee as your first character.- To play widescreen set as command-line arguments: -zRes:1920,1200,32        (for 1920x1200 resolution).- Fix crash when starting a game: disable steam overlay. If that doesn't work rename GameOverlayRenderer.dll in your steam folder to _GameOverlayRenderer.dll.  "

												Having never played a Gothic game before, I thought this game was really good. I felt really weak and I was really bad at the controls early on. Yet, later in the game as my character leveled so did my skills with the controls. Very old school. I can see why its considered a classic.I was worried about purchasing the Gothic there game pack because of the reviews that said it was difficult to get working. I tried a few things out and came up with an easy English guide for getting it to work on newer machines (not windows 10 though):

												This game is a complete pain in the ♥♥♥. Where to begin...? 	I suppose I could start with the compatibility issues. My God. Having to install several patches to get rid of crashing, texture ♥♥♥♥ups, and crappy performance is one thing, but when some of these issues persist even after the fixes, all I can do is shrug and bear it.	The combat is just a mess. It's one of those games that tries to convince me that I'm fighting on the same terms as my opponents, though it quickly becomes apparent that it's designed to be simply unfair. The combat mechanics seem to favor one-on-one fighting, which is just brilliant, considering 99% of the game's enemies attack in groups, leading to the old tried-and-♥♥♥♥ tactic of luring these noisy sacks of ♥♥♥ away from their comrades one at a time. When the game does decide to spring a ""fair"" mano a mano battle on me, a new set of problems show. Thought that attack hit? Nah, it missed, even though I clearly heard the hit sound and the enemy dodged a full second too late. If that's the game's idea of a successful dodge, then I wish it applied to me. Then the controls get stuck for no reason and blocking or dodging becomes impossible. Raising skills and getting stronger weapons does help a bit, but for the most part, enemies can clean house in quick combos that are unfeasible for the player to perform and react to.	The quests are confusing. When clear instructions are given, it's fine, but occasionally there will be one that's a total ♥♥♥♥ing mystery, requiring the player to wander around until the objective is stumbled upon. The world isn't annoyingly big or small, but with a lack of options for getting to specific places quickly, getting from point A to point B gets old fast. Even starting a quest can be a ♥♥♥♥♥. They usually require exhausting most of the dialogue options for specific NPCs for the purposes of obtaining some object or allowing discussion of a certain topic with a different character, because usually the most obvious dialogue suggesting quest progression might not actually advance the quest, but the offhand, marginally related dialogue will. Several times, characters would tell me to go clear to the other side of the map, and I would, only to discover that my trip was pointless because the quest hadn't actually started, as I had not selected an additional piece of dialogue in the conversation I had 15 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes ago. Beyond that there is only one correct way to finish most quests, due to the constant scripted sequences, which are mandatory for the player to sit through, and even the slightest deviation from the intended path will screw up the game, from simply rendering the quest incompletable to crashing the application. If I'm going to crash a game, I prefer it to be not so easy to do.The strangeness of the quests is affected by the faction/guild system. Apart from my allies and comrades being hostile toward me for no reason, the actual effect of the guilds is limited to a few parts of the game. Several chapters in, the guilds might as well not even exist. Because of how closely intertwined the guilds are with the rather linear main story, the player is inevitably forced down the same path every new game regardless of guild choice, and the satisfaction of picking a side is short-lived.	Despite all of its shortcomings, there is one redeeming factor; One shining variable that not only saves its offerings from being buried under a tide of technical oversights, but catapults the game to an almost godly position amongst RPGs: You can deal weed in this game.Dude.Weed.Lmao.

												Great old school Role Playing Game and the first of it's Series.Gothic I is one of the best games within it's series along with Gothic II.Large open world game where you have 3 path's to take.-Templar (Sect Camp)- Fire Mage (Old Camp)- Mercenary (New Camp)Even though the game is old , and heavily outdated when it come's to Today's Graphical Appearance the gameplay it self is one of the Best in the RPG world.Listen to the Story Line , play all game's of it series and trust me , it's beating most RPG's today.The Series itself contains 6 titles where the total story line continues.Gothic I > Gothic II > Gothic III > Gothic III Forsaken Gods > Arcania Gothic IV > Gothic IV Fall of Satariff (not sure if the last one is a different game but as far as i know it is.)Gothic I & II are in my opinion the best gothic games of it series , but it was totally worth the entire package.Played Risen? Liked it? Play Gothic :)			"

												Quite an old game with some really wonky controls, some horrible core issues such as the Access Violation error that you receive upon playing the game, after you can get beyond the horrible controls and extremely unbalanced game-play against monsters that will easily be able to farm you for hours. You will find one of the greatest RPG games ever created an amazing story some amazing character details, This game requires you to actually use your brain to find stuff within the game. If you want to play this game i recommend you buy a notepad and a pencil to write down all the interesting information you find considering this game doesn't give you the slightest hint of where to go in any way. This game is totally awesome but can be pretty complicated at times, This is the game that will make you want to shank your eyes out after a lengthy encounter with a mole rat, If you want to use your mind and totally escape from the hell that is horrible game industry. The story is amazing and is much better than the average casual RPGs such as Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2. BE HARDCORE BE A MAN PLAY GOTHIC.10/10 would totally spend another 30 hours attempting to kill the same Mole Rat. Totally worth whatever you'd pay for it			"

												I played gothic when I was young, so I was optimistic to play it again after the years.. and I am not that optimistic anymore.At first I got a funny acces violation error.. so i run it as administrator, and ""enjoy""The first and second chapter seem to be quite good and inviting, but it is getting worse from there on.Somebody thought it would be bad to make it easy for u to change targets after killing one of 4 orcs rushing at you...Instead u will almost certainly keep slashing the dead orc (just releasing the key won't help, u will still target it)Game crushed 123123 times, many saves got destroyed, and basically bugged npc's, bugged enemies, bugged movement etc.The further u go into game, the less interesting the plot becames (less interactions and more running around EMPTY map to kill 4 enemies, just to repeat the process a milion of times) The only thing that saves gothic some credit, is that it has some turns of the action, but thats all. Not recommended, unless u are stubborn to play it, but it is not supposed to work this way, right ?			"

												Gothic 1 and 2 are two of the best RPGs ever created that still dwarf most modern games despite controls that are sometimes tiresome.But I can't recommend buying it on steam. On windows 7 you can't play it without disabling steam overlay alltogether by deleting the gameoverlayrenderer.dll in steam directory and language support is limited to English, Espaniol and German or was it Danish... Which is a pitty because Gothic 1 and 2 are pretty much the only two games that have a truelly amazing voiceacting in my native, Polish language aside of The Witcher maybe. Polish voiceacting is in fact far superior to the English version, and I'm honestly not going to play without it, which is a pitty and another $$$ wasted on steam.			"

												I honestly have no idea how people thing this game is good - the rosy-colored glasses of nostalgia that people have for this game must be solid opaque red, because as someone who didn't play this in their childhood, I can say this game is an absolute waste of time.Check it:First 10 hours of this game are full of fetch quests before you join a camp.  That's right, the first 10 hours are mindless boring fetch quests that don't advance the plot at all.Controls are bad - like, unredeemably bad.  I shouldn't have to press CTRL to select a chest, UP to open it, CTRL+SHIFT+RIGHT to take all the contents, JUMP to exit the chest menu, then DOWN to close the chest and regain control of my character.  That should be AT MOST a 2-button operation.You can only target one enemy at a time.You can only damage the enemy you have targeted.  If you're surrounded by enemies swinging your longsword left and right, and the enemy you have targeted is out of reach, you don't damage anyone.  Even if your sword is clipping through the enemies.You can't turn while blocking.  If you block and the enemy runs behind you, get ready to load a save.You can't switch weapons while walking backward.  What a joke.This game's idea of ""challenge"" is enemies that spam stun-locking spells that literally prevent you from doing anything.  I hope you like losing control of your character and watching him dance in place as an orc shamman keeps setting him on fire.The story is decent at best, but I got so fed up with all the BS in this game that I started cheating halfway through, and played the last half with God-Mode on.  Even then, I played it all the way through to the end waiting to see what all the hysteria was about, but there's nothing there.  People played this when they were kids so they think it's a masterpiece.Spoiler alert, it's not.  This game is a complete waste of your time.Don't buy this. "

												A pitchfork is an agricultural tool with a long handle and long, thick, widely separated pointed tines (also called prongs) used to lift and pitch (throw) loose material, such as hay, straw or leaves. Pitchforks typically have only two, three or four tines while dung forks have four or five, other types of fork even up to ten tines with different lengths and spacing depending on purpose. They are usually made of steel with a long wooden handle, but may also be made from wood, wrought iron, bamboo, alloy, etc. In some parts of England a pitchfork is known as a prong[1] and, in parts of Ireland, a sprong refers to a 4-pronged pitchfork.[2] The pitchfork is similar to the shorter and sturdier garden fork. Pitchforks and scythes have frequently been used as weapons by those who couldn't afford or didn't have access to more expensive weapons such as swords, or, later, guns.[3] As a result, pitchforks and scythes are stereotypically carried by angry mobs or gangs of enraged peasants. In Europe, the pitchfork was first used in the early Middle Ages[clarification needed], at about the same time as the harrow. The pitchfork was originally made entirely of wood; today, the tines are usually made of hard metal. A notable American artistic display of a three-pronged pitchfork is in American Gothic, the painting by Grant Wood. In this painting it symbolizes hand labor. There are other paintings by various artists which depict a wide variety of pitchforks and other tools in use and at rest. Political usage[edit] Because of its association with peasantry, the pitchfork is often a populist symbol and part of the nickname of populist leaders, thus: ""Pitchfork Ben"" (Benjamin Tillman) ""Pitchfork Pat"" (Pat Buchanan) The Gangster Disciples, a street gang in the midwestern United States, use a three-pointed pitchfork as one of their symbols.[citation needed] Religious symbolism[edit] The pitchfork is often used in satire of Christian demonology in popular media, especially in early humorous cartoons where a popular joke was a caricature of an angel and a pitchfork-wielding devil sitting on the shoulders of the protagonist.[citation needed] The Hellenistic deity Pluto wields a bident, a two-pronged weapon strikingly similar in form to a pitchfork.

												Gothic 1's steam release is plagued with a miandre of problems, none the least of which is an infamous glitch that makes it near impossible to play on later OS's like Windows 8.  While there are fixes available that can make it somewhat playable, I've been plagued with a large number of issues right out the get-go, biggest being the control scheme of the game; for reasons I cannot fathom, all of my actions are bound to my move keys, which means that I can't do anything without first pressing forward at the exact same time; which makes trying to be precise with things impossible.At the moment all I can say is that the game is currently unplayable.  If you do happen to see this game in a bundle with Gothic 3 (how I managed to get it, along with II) and want to buy it for nostalgia purposes because you were part of the fanbase that gave this game a try in your childhood and liked it, don't bother.  While this is exaggerated I'm fairly sure that this game won't work on anything higher than Windows 98 without causing you problems...I would attempt to refund this (in fact I have) but I purchased this game long before the refund system.  Had I have known that this was an issue I wouldn't have purchased it.Valve, seriously, warn us when you sell content like this; you did it with Fallout 3, I'm pretty sure you can do it for Gothic.  Unless you plan to somehow work with the devs in secret to try and get an update for this game (good luck with that) then there's really no reason why this needs to even be in your marketplace.  Please, do us a favor, let GoG handle the older games like this one; at least they try to make it playable for modern tech.			"

												I was going to write a review about the game, but i can't. Everytime I try to start a new game it crashes. Which is a shame because I hear this is a great RPG. So instead I'll give a review about the one part of the game I can use, the main menu.The font is nice, really gives it that gothic feel that I assume it was going for. The options are simple, sound, video, game. The stuff you'd expect. From what I can see the control scheme seems odd, but you can rebind them to your liking. There is no mouse support for the main menu however, meaning you have to navigate with the arrow keys, which I don't like. All in all, this is a good main menu simulator; I just wish whoever was in charge of the steam version of this game cared enough the put the ""video game"" part in.			"

												Pros:- Unique story- Large open world- Difficult- No hand holding- Unique weapons and armor- Easy to get into- Lengthy story (took me 31 hours to complete on my first playthrough)- Dynamic and interesting characters- Unique approach to magic and combatCons:- Combat is archaic- Voice acting is bad- Gets cliche towards the end- Sometimes quests can be unclear- Climbing ladders is difficult for some reason (you can fall off and die for no real reason)- Crashes a lot, even with the patch- Companions can be brokenOverall I give this game an 8/10			"

												Gothic, a dad of RPG, one of many dads and moms of course. One we will remember to the end. Lil' pipsquicks who play Call of duty or CSGO will not understand us, the old boys who eat their teeths on game like this. One of the best from the best games those times when PC have MHZ not GHZ. Hard, long with exelent for those times graphic. Funny and interesting, a new world we can feel on our own skin.			"

												Gothic is an open world action RPG published in 2001.You're character is basicly part of a big outdoor prison, so the atmosphere is grim and the characters displayed are mostly malicious tough guys. The acting and dialogue of these people in general is very comprehensible which helps the immersion a lot. There are no white knights here. And you're characters isn't either. The very intrudging atmosphere is also delivered by the fact that almost every being in this game has his own unique daily activity routine. Talking, sleeping, hunting, smoking and even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Though the controls seem very clunky at first one gets used to it quite quickly. The combat is very fast and much about landing your hits in the right time. It's skill demanding and can get quite frustrating if you're running into an enemy which is far too strong for your level. But because of the game's open nature you don't necessarily have to face those enemies at that time.Conclusion: Once you get along with the dated graphics and odd keyboard controls it's a very enjoyable experience.

												Its hard to get to work (same for its sequel) but once I got it up and running it was pretty good. Combat was not ""Great"" but it I liked it more then skyrims, I managed to be a decent 1H warrior but switched over to mage near chapter 3 (witch made me want to play as a wizzard in future games whitch was a mistake.) The game world isnt huge but if it was I think it would just be obnoxius, so its just the right size. And to my surprize I liked the supporting cast. (Which is rare in games)Mind the final boss is pretty easy compared to some of the enemys in his dungeon.Also if you plan on buying it the other reviews tell you which patches to get to make it work.

												It won't be obvious when you're looking at this game but there is a strong possibility it won't run on your machine.  Judging by multiple requests for help on a number of forums it seems both Gothic I & II suffer issues on newer pc's.  I run a Windows 7/64 box with a high-end nVidia graphics card and both crash when you try to start a game.  I can't get a Steam refund unless I want to drop Arcania and Gothic 3 since I got it in a bundle (and they're both fine) so........ BUYER BEWARE!!!!			"

												The combat system so horrendously awful that it makes this classic virtually unplayable. After getting used to the awkward controls (you have to click and then press forward to do any action), I was met with the most embarrassing excuse for an RPG combat system ever. It's similar to Risen's combat system in the sense that there are combos and different types of swings, but the controls are so clunky, the hitboxes so odd, and the movement of your character while fighting so painfully frustrating that this game just ruins itself. I wish I could enjoy this game, but I simply can't with its absolutely atrocious fighting system.			"

												You have to either be looking at this game through rose tinted nostalgia, or be autistic to enjoy Gothic 1.The game's controls are archiac and awkward.  A lot of people say ""you get used to them"" and sure, you do, but I could also get used to my uncle fingering my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ every night as a child.  That doesn't mean it's pleasant.  And it's not just the controls, it's the combat gameplay and design of the game.Gothic 1 is difficult for all the wrong reasons; the AI cheats.  As soon as your attack animation triggers, like, the milisecond it triggers, enemies will dodge your attacks.  Every creature from molerats to wolves seem to have gone through a lot of combat training because they all dodge in perfect synchronization.  Blocking rarely works, for example, when I tried to block a lizard my animation would instantly stop working as the lizard charged for no apparent reason.There is no key to switch the target you are locked on to, you can only look at what you want to attack with your mouse camera, which means you have to pray you can some how keep the enemy you want to fight locked onto.  Praying wont save you if you fight multiple opponents though, which as fun to play as it is to watch as a bunch of creatures dance awkwardly around each other.  And you better bet every living creature in this game travels in huge packs.But the AI isn't ""smart"", you can just jump on a piece of terrain and glitch all of them out as they try to grind the boulder you are standing on to dust by rapidly smearing their face against it.  Cheesing this way got me through some difficult encounters, but it's boring and the fact that I have to abuse glitchy AI should tell you a little bit about how much fun the combat is.Quests are locked behind a level gate, and while you get some XP off of quests you will need to grind your experience off of monsters.  As a low level character, this is stupidly difficult for several reasons.  First of all nothing ever tells you what combat skills are good, or the fact that you need to heavily invest in one combat skill and nothing else (there are even things to bait noobs like learning how to skin an animal, which costs the same skill points you'd use to train your combat skills).This game came out in a day and age where you had to actually read the game manual to know how to do anything, because the game literally tells you NOTHING about essential controls.  Not even checking the settings menu will show you essential key combinations you need to know.  This isn't ""challenging"", or an ""RPG that doesn't hold your hand!"", this is forcing me to google ♥♥♥♥ because the designers made an unintuitive control scheme and didn't include any indications in game.The english voice acting is totally misplaced for most characters, it sounds like they just got random people to do the voices.  It's a german game so it's forgivable, but when the leader of a religious cult sounds like a backwater american hick I can't help but laugh.The game crashes often.  I applied the community patch and the player patch and whatever, but the game still crashes often on Windows 7.There is no quick save/quick load button.  A minor quip, but all of these little things add up.  You can't walk backwards, you just skip backwards like an idiot.  There is a LOT of going back and forth and back and forth and backtracking between the same areas, with no fast travel, for really tedious quests that have you talking to an NPC, running all the way back, talking to another NPC, running back... a lot of your time will be spent just bunny hopping all over the map.All of this is a shame, because underneath all the grime is a gem of a classic RPG that could've been so much more.  There are some cool ideas here that show that, in some certain aspects at least, Gothic was ahead of the game when it came out. As it stands, I can see why this game is only really popular with a few people who are fond of it because they experienced it long ago or grew up with it or whatever; it's too rough around the edges and there are too many nuisances to justify the experience.  It felt like a chore trying to grind my way through chapters.  I made it to Chapter 3 and got sick of it.			"

												Great atmosphere and features a story based gameplay, but the game mechanics are horrendeus. I cannot recommend this to anyone but the most die hard RPG fans. It's a game that managed to overcomplicate simple things like picking up an item or talking to a stranger. I understand it's a 2001 game, however the game engine seems outdated for its time and personally I've had a lot more fun with even older games.			"

												I bought the Gothic after reading some of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, my experience with Gothic has been nothing but filled with installation and stability problems and today I decided for the first time to request a refund.-----The long explanation: I've got a typical Win10 i7(4th gen)/nvidia860 (upto date) setup and had no problems with any other games so far. But running Gothic (vanilla) froze my rig again and again (a first for me in over 18 months). I spent hours researching how to make Gothic work and downloaded community patch after patch (followed the excellent guide by Arc Gothic Fixed for Win 7/8/10 [18.12.2016]) without success. That's when the serious problems with Windows10 started, explorer freezing, right click taking over 5mins to show options, not being able to reboot etc etc After 2 days of snail pace investigation, I finally traced the problem to one of the community Gothic system packs, which messed up my system. In the end, once all the patches were removed, Win10 was back to order (but Gothic still freezes).-----TL;DR: I'm sure Gothic is a great game but after so much effort put into making it work on my Win10/i7/nvidia its just not worth it. If the developers are not bothered to release an official patch to make it work, then why should anyone buy it (unless you have an older rig) even on a steam sale? Not recommended. "

												For years I have been a huge fan of the Gothic franchaice... (Gothic 1 and 2 mostly)This steam version however has more bugs then the original that I played years ago.Gothic for me always gave me the addictive habbit of wanting to play just a little longer and thus forgetting to save my games, for this version that is extra important because a crash can be just arround the corner.In chapter 5 my game crashed at least 5 times per hour while I was in the Orc Temple, at one point I thought I could even reproduce the crash except after 5 tries it suddenly worked as intended.The worst part is... The ending is different from what I was used to... I remember the Orc Temple crashing in on itself leaving me as the unnamed hero trapped inside, but now I simply walk out of the temple having fun going from adventure to adventure????I will love the game forever with the original in mind, but due to the massive amounts of bugs and the changed ending I cannot recommend this version of the game.

												Before I begin, I just want to say that I tried to like this game and complete it. Lord knows the blood and sweat I invested in the grueling 21 hours I put into this game. With that out of the way, let us commence:I hate this game. I heard many a person say it was great, it was one of the best RPGs ever and that it rivaled Baldur's Gate, Morrowind and similar products. I decided to try it.First off, the controls are clunky and take some getting used to, due to the fact that this game was made with a ""Mouses aren't needed!"" mindset, so the intended way of play is with the keyboard only. Seems somewhat puzzling, but remember that the game is ""old"" and it isn't that hard to become accostumed with the keybinds (plus, you can use a control scheme that includes the mouse if you so desire). However, I was able to adjust and proceed.I won't speak of the graphics, because as I've said it's old so I won't judge that aspect. As far as the music goes, it's average. A mild soundtrack that didn't produce any awe inspiring moments in me or has any memorable tracks. It's just there.And now for the gameplay... Oh dear God, the gameplay, and more specifically the combat. Never have I experienced such a rage inducing, badly made, awkward combat. In case you're wondering, picture Morrowind's combat (or any modern TES game for that matter), but the weapon movements are handled in a horrendous rhythm game type move set. You have the left and right swings, the up command for combos and down command for blocking. Sounds simple, except that in practice, it's so poorly implemented and executed that it makes even one on one fights a daunting task (and don't even attempt to picture how fighting a group is done).As for the story, I won't speak of it due to spoilers and the fact that I didn't finish the game (I reached about half of chapter 4, when you  must collect the ingredients for the Ulu-Mulu ). From what I played, it was a slow crawl that remained uninteresting, albeit with a few good moments. However, as I've stated before, I didn't finish the game so I can't discuss the whole experience or evaluate any denouements.I'll say it again: I tried to like this game. I seriously did. But in end, it was too much for me, I had to uninstall and move on. If you still wish to play the game, go ahead as you may enjoy it and find it entertaining. I just wanted to provide people with a warning, lest the same occur to them.			"

Read anout 10 different support-forums, with different solutions (administrator mode, compatibility mode etc), and tried the simplest solutions. After 15 minutes with try and fail, I am uninstalling this. There are some third-party mods which requires downloading non-signed/non-verified executables. I will NOT risk installing malware or backdoors on my computer to get a legitimately bought piece of software to run on my Windows 10 computer. I read on these forums that Gothic II suffers the same launch problems on Windows 10. Steam should have the decency to write: ""WARNING! You will have to download home-made software and hack for 20 minutes to get this game to (possibly) work! Proceed at your own risk. And yeah: we still want our money!"".

												ATTENTION: Do not buy this game unless you are willing to spend a lot of time and effort getting it to work! I bought this game as part of a pack, and tried various times and spent hours to get the game to launch, unsuccessfully.There is a lot of patchwork and addon work to be done, and even if you follow directions that work for some people, there is no guarantee you will ever even see the title screen.Worse still, if you buy this game and are unable to get it to lauch you will not get a refund! Due to the amount of time it takes for some of us to work on the game in an effort to bring it into operation, you will rack up 'play time' which is actually the game idling in the background/processes menu while you work on it. Steam will count all the time you've spent trying to FIX the game as PLAYING the game, and will not give you a refund.Unless you are good at following directions and have more than a basic knowledge of running old games on a new computer, save your money for a game you will actually be able to play and enjoy.

												As with ""Gothic 2 Gold Edition"", it may be that the game does not work at all as sold on Steam unless you apply three widely advertized external community patches (gothic1-1.08k-patch.exe, gothic_playerkit-1.08k.exe, g1classic-systempack-1.6.exe). Afterwards, the game worked fine and hasn't crashed a single time.While I like ""Gothic 2 Gold Edition"" more because of its larger world, more important early faction choosing options, improved melee combat and extra features, Gothic 1 is also a well made game I've enjoyed playing. Switching on the alternative keyboard settings is highly recommended in my opinion. The defaults are just weird.The story and atmosphere are good. You are pulled in immediately. Eventually you will ignore the warnings and feel ready to explore dark forests inhabited by dangerous beasts. It is not a difficult game, however. The rules are simple and with a lower risk of making mistakes when levelling up than in Gothic 2 (with its various bonus options to discover throughout the game). There are enough experience points to get in order to master two weapon skills and even gain magic powers either early or late. There are a few riddles found in the game related to opening doors and avoiding traps. Nothing that would cause frustration. No need to read walkthroughs. This is game is more fun, if you try to explore everything yourself. As you can save and reload freely, albeit limited to 20 savegame slots, there are also enough options to return to an older point in case you've found something where you would like to decide differently.

Yes, I know that I have played less than 10 minutes, but that is because half way through the loading process when trying to start a new game, the game crashes. I have Windows 8.1 and a NVIDIA graphics card, don't know if the game conflicts with those (being as old as it is), but there is definetly a problem, as over 20 attempts to start a new game all end with the same message. As I got the whole franchise on sale, I'm not too dissapointed, but I really did feel that this game would be a great classic RPG. I did watch the intro from the title screen though, if the game doesn't totally break for you, try it out!			"

												Clearly the middle child of the series. In order:Gothic 3: Actually plays. Encountered first game breaking bug less than a half hour in. Not fun enough to re-play that half hour.Gothic: Crashes every time it's run, Could spend way too much time downloading patches, changing settings, making shortcuts to third party solutions then maybe it might run (or might not if the forums are to be believed). Gothic 2: Crashes as soon as you start it, disabling your mouse and refusing to respond to Task Manager commands to close it. Requires restart of whole machine.  Could spend considerable time modding it, changing settings and fiddling and maybe it works then, or like Gothic, maybe not.It's great that they offered a whole pack of games for one low price. Would be even better if even ONE of them actually ran without patching, setting files to run as admin, diasabling overlays, running steam as admin, running with third party exes, and other hassle that doesn't reliably work.

												This still doesn't work on Windows 7.Edit: So I caved and downloaded the fan files that make the game playable. I still do not recommend this game, though. Why would anyone sell a game that takes effort to even start?As far as the gameplay goes, the intro has a unique and exciting setup. But the controls seem to be terrible with no part of the game telling you what's what. From experimenting, to pick stuff up, you click the mouse and press forward. To climb a ladder, you hold the mouse and press forward. To equip a sword, you click the mouse and press forward. Compared to modern games, this is awkward and messy.Hopefully the game itself will rise above its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. I'll update more as I play.Walking around trying to get favor with the Old Camp, I run into a bug (bloodfly) that one shots me. That kind of gameplay is ludicrous. Nobody warned my character at all about these monsters.			"

												The game is surely a classic but controls are very bad. You have to press (action key + W) to pick up something. Even in combat you have to keep pressing action key(and sometimes release to adjust view) and press WASD to do some hitting. You will just have to get used to it.You have too much running back and forth. It gets really boring. There aren't many skills but you really can tell the difference when you learn how to swing a sword. "

												I am writing this review as someone whom has not eve played the first game successfully due to an error the game has with starting a New Game. I have Windows 7 and 2GB RAM so low res games such as these are a bit of a necessity for me at this point. The ""Gothic"" series seemed like a fun RPG series upon initial inspection, given that the top several reviews for this game are all positive. My thought was ""It's like playing the steel-clad knight games full of mythic beasts and monsters which I've dreamed of playing!"" And then, I bought the game. I downloaded the first one, naturally, and intended on playing when I came across the issue which caused the game to crash and tell me that some sort of error had ocurred. I had, obviously, changed around some settings, so I tried again. Upon clicking ""New Game"" the same issue ocurred and the game crashed. Given MY experience with the game, I cannot recommend it to anyone. However, if someone could tell me of any way to fix this issue I would greatly appreciate it.			"

												Can't honestly recommend this game to someone who is accustomed to today's RPGs. The game isn't bad, per se. The combat is ♥♥♥♥ though. Like frustratingly bad. The controls are ♥♥♥♥ as well. Like, wow whoever thought these controls were a good idea didn't know ♥♥♥♥ about games. Also, it came out in 2001, so there was already kind of a set standard for accepted controls. Like ""i"" for inventory and stuff like that. This game says ""♥♥♥♥ that, I'm gonna make every action a pain in the ♥♥♥ to do. Is there a mouse connected to your computer? ♥♥♥♥ that, I prefer Keyboard only."" You know those games that set ""c"" for crouch instead of left control? Yeah, this game is worse than that. Story is good, environments are cool, and the exploration is what intrigued me for as long as at did. 'However, this Steam port sucks. It's glitchy and it's just not stable on modern PCs. Back in the day, I loved this game. IMO it does not stand the test of time. 5/10			"

												Unfortunately this game is not only quite difficult to get running (i had to do a fair bit of work on it before it would on Win8) but it also suffers from a really poor control scheme! For some reason the Devs thought it was a good ideal to make all interactions be a combination of holding the first mouse button and pressing one of the direction buttons. You may have forgiven it for something like that at the time of it's release (we didn't know better back then... sort of) but these days when there's no lack of open world RPGs it's just too much to ask to put up with it unless you're a die hard Gothic fan.So that's my recommendation: Don't pick it up unless you're a die hard Gothic fan... in which case you'd own it already wouldn't you?

												Yes, I've read the reviews. Yes, I know it's been 13 years since this game was launched... but, I simply was not prepared enough for a disappointment like this. My problem with this game is not its graphics or visuals effects (I didn't came here looking for that) but the whole game mechanics... and I think that has nothing to do with the launching date.For the past 8 hours I've been trying, really hard, to play this game and the only thing I feel is frustration. For what I can see, the story seems pretty decent and attractive, but the absurdly hard to play combat system and controls, along with the lack of any help to understand how to do the most basic of things (from grabing an object on the floor, to trading, read a map or equip weapons) just prevents me to get into the story.Whenever I try to accomplish a small mission, I get killed again and again by the most small and dumb creatures just because of the difficult combat mechanics: it's not about the keyboard (you can just easily change it in order to use WASD instead of the default keypad arrows setting) but the complex use of the keyboard to hit a target, and above all that: the inability of the character to keep the target centered while fighting.Once I got somehow accustomed to this way to manage the keyboard, then I got into the world map: I've been running up and down the whole island trying to get to an specific point, but it seems impossible: I just can't remember the way I got to the point where my character it's supposed to be and now all possible roads appear to be full of really hard to kill beasts and enemies. Then, it's starting to get dark... and there's nothing you can do to put your character to sleep in the wilderness, so you just basically have to stand up there, waiting for the sunrise to come.I really don't understand how this game has so many high reviews. I respect the people that think that it's the best RPG they've ever played and frankly the story seems really nice. Don't hate me, I just can't get into it.One last piece of advice: I'm running this game on a Windows7-64 machine. The only way I managed to even start the game without crashing, was changing the gothic.exe file to run in Windows XP compatibility mode... and even like that, I can't watch the opening videos (does has sound, but screen is black).

												This game seemed really cool, at first. It gave a Morrowind meets Fallout vibe that really set the right mood for an old-school rpg. The only reason I stopped playing and am not reccomending it is instability of this version of the game. Took me forever to figure out how to get past the crash on startup error. Then, I find out that the trading system is damn near unusable due to the strange ""windowed-fullscreen"" hybrid bar cutting off the pricing tabs. Honestly, I'm disappointed. I really wanted to try this game. I leave Gothic with only one real memory: Mud not shutting the hell up.			"

												I can't speak for the game's actual quality due to how little time I was able to put into the game, but I can say I won't recommend this version of Gothic.Its a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get running. Straight installation and trying to play, the game probably won't work for anyone. While not everyone will have to fight a tiger and climb a mountain to get the game running, I did. I spent more time fiddling with this game trying to get it to run, and crashing, than playing it, and when I got it running it was running at a consistent 10-20 fps.If you know you actually want to buy this game and play it, go for the GoG version. GoG actually puts time into their releases of older games. I heard their version of Gothic 1 actually runs without having to do any outside BS.Either version you play, you're probably going to have some issues that come with playing an old game on a modern OS, but the Steam version kicks harder than the GoG version.

												If you want a copy you have any hope of getting to actually run you'll want to head to GoG and get it there, this version is completely broken prone to not letting owners start the game and the few fixes available aren't guarenteed to work.For me I can't get the thing to work no matter how many different fixes I try, GoG offers refunds if the game doesn't work so for the love of god try the version they offer first as it is a hell of a lot more likely to work and if not no loss since you can get the money back.

												.................WOW where do i begin. WELP i guess i will start by saying that i am a fan of alot of old school games particularly RPGs but there have been a couple i have not played yet including this one so this seemed like a great purchase..........or so i thought.I have found myself enjoying a lot of RPGs that by today would be considered ""outdated"" or even ""obsolete"" by many people today the most notable being Morrowind (i mention Morrowing for a good reason which you will find out shortly) ........ ♥♥♥♥ i an even one of THOSE people that say it is  the best Elder Scrolls ...yes even compared to Skyrim (although i still enjoy it).So when i saw the Gothic collection on sale and looked at the steam reviews being mostly positive  it seemed like a perfect fit and a great deal, i was genuinely excited ....... until i started playing.Now i am used to old games not really working with modern OS and computers so it did not really surprise me that it did not work right a way (although this DOES NOT EXCUSE steam for selling them as is).Regardless i looked in the forums and sure enough there was a friendly user giving instructions and links to mods that would fix all this and sure enough it did so all was well and i started the game.Now like most old games there is not a lot if any hand holding (which i prefer) so i had to figure out all the controls and mechanics...no problem....but here is where i learned of Gothic's .......uh.....""unique"" combat system.Now i am not going to sugar coat this..........the combat system is ATROCIOUS ......like just god awful. Now there will be people who defend this saying it is just different or it takes some getting used to...and while there is some truth.....it is mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, even some veterans admit it is bad. You can see what they were TRYING to do but......they failed...they failed spectacularly. I compare it to Morrowind's combat system as i feel it is the most fair comparison. Now while Morrowinds combat has it's flaws....there is no denying that it was mostly functional and a lot of the complaint against it was due to its DnD system as it hits (especially early on when you're weapon stat was ♥♥♥♥) would miss and felt unrealistic  as well as......well......admittedly kind of boring a lot of the time.Gothic's combat ......sigh.........holy ♥♥♥♥ .....its just a ♥♥♥♥ing chore.While some of this is mitigated with training (from trainers) and experience with the system it is mostly just hitting left and right with some rhythm. EVEN WORSE however is drawing weapons/spells which is just ♥♥♥♥ing horrible with you and you're character spazzing out just to try and DRAW A GODDAM WEAPON if you so as much have any MORE THAN 2 WEAPONS.........and god help you if you want multiple spells.....better hope you're enemy just patiently waits while you're character flails his arms around like he's in the weirdest rave in existence (pro tip....they don't). i could go on but......i would actually prefer not to.Now lets get on to some RPG elements starting with what some might deem the most important-the story. Well i can't really say to much on this to me it was kinda ""meh"" to me, some may disagree but as it is very subjective i am not going to get too much into it maybe it has an AMAZING ending...i wouldn't know as i quit at chapter 5 (close to the games end mind you) from all the cumulative ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of this game.More importantly i would like to discuss one of the reasons this game is praised it's - open endedness ...or lack there of. SURE the game makes it SEEM like you can do anything and go anywhere but it is ARTIFICIAL AS ♥♥♥♥...let me explain.First thing you will notice is that EVERYTHING can kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of you......fine you think after all this is an old school RPG and i am lv 1 i will just grind a little and gear up till i can reasonably explore.....NOPE see the way this game's ""open"" world works is if you are not at the right lv and story progression (which is really the ONLY way to get better gear namely armor) you will die...simple as that and i don't mean it might be a fair fight if it is 1 on1 and you were pretty good at fighting you could possibly win....no i mean you get ♥♥♥♥♥ .....savagely from things that are maybe 1 tier higher then the game's equivalent of rats of which might still beat you're ♥♥♥.It reminded me GREATLY of MMOS where you stumble into a high lv area only in the beginning this is LITERALLY EVERYWHERE BUT THE STARTING AREA. So you think fine it will lighten up a bit.......and it does......about halfway into the game when you can do something else then story quests and EVEN THEN god help you if you want to go somewhere the game does not want you to go (namely future story areas these ""MMO high lv areas"".And that's when you realize ....you have discovered most of the map..what seemed pretty big in the beginning is actually quite small and what you have discovered is pretty barren and boring with some packs of mobs here and there (again very reminiscent of an MMO only there is no random quest you can stumble upon or interesting structure with few exceptions).It is a very barren world where they only thing of ANY interest is the camps (starting areas/Hub/etc) and quest areas which you can only REALLY go to if you are at the right point in the story/quest...........................................how THE ♥♥♥♥ is this ""open-ended"".The only good thing in choice/variety is the 3 camps which you can choose to join in the beginning which adds SOME choice and replay value but after that.....pretty much the same.I could go on with this game but i do not want to make this even longer than it already is. Overall this game is mostly a chore and i barely had any fun with it aside from some glitches and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ A.I. So it just absolutely BAFFLES me how this is getting mostly positive reviews on Steam of which i can only attribute to nostalgia .Look i am sure this game was.....""OK"" at the time when it was new and unique. It has some interesting mechanics that COULD be good if it worked but..... they just ♥♥♥♥ing don't. I am sure it even introduced some new mechanics that would become standard but it has aged HORRIBLY and i can't imagine liking it even back then.For a good game in comparison i recommend Morrowind which blows this game out of the water (although that's not saying much). In summary the only people that i can imagine liking this game is people that have played it before and have nostalgia for it. If you have never played this series THEN STAY THE ♥♥♥♥ AWAY. Don't be fooled by these positive Steam reviews like i was. I used to think rather highly of them but i guess i learned my lesson.			"

												I had high hopes for this game because I love a good open world RPG, and this one had a Metacritic score around 80.  Having played it, I don't understand how it got a score that high.  The controls are clunky, the experience curve is steep (by which I mean you'll often run into enemies too strong for you to deal with), the graphics are dull, combat is dull, the characters are dull, and the plot is dull.  Everything is dull, dull, dull.  I wanted to like it, and gave it more than a fair shake (check my play time), but I just can't bring myself to finish it.			"

Actually, i wish there would be a HD remake or even full remake of this game...Gothic...oh boy, i played this game long long loooooong ago. I got a pack gifted by a friend now some days ago and actually i forgot about the Gothic-series actually exists. Now, i found it anew for me, playing it and enjoying it like i did before.......and this game was here in germany with the age-rating ""12+""?Gothic is a hard game. not hard in meaning the game is hard, no. Let me begin with some simple things:Image you are new to a ""ghetto city"" and youre the total loser there, the ""new one"". Thats what Gothic is. It let you feel from the very first moment that you are nothing more then dirt, not even dirt, you are ""nothing"". So you have to work really hard to come up from this status from a ""nobody"" to a ""somebody"" till youre really worth even people´s time in this game.Said that, thats what actually keeps you playing Gothic. You only progress ""slowly"", not coz of Exp. problems or unbalanced, its the way the game plays. It is pretty big (well at least for a Gothic game at this area and making) and acutally gives you at least ""some freedom"". So its not like the TES-series where you roam free around from the very beginning, you have to ""grow"" stronger first. There you feel again that youre a nothing again, farming some smaller enemys and doing the dirty jobs noone wants to do.""I just want to punch you in your ugly f**king face.""As i said already, Gothic 1 was in the age-rating of 12+ at least here in germany (and just to add this for german users: play it PLEASE in german, for real, you will enjoy it. It rarely gives such good german-game versions nowadays from other games but Gothic is sure GREAT if you play it in German) but its anyhow pretty ""brutal"" for this time, words like ""♥♥♥♥"" ""♥♥♥♥"" and other ""rude"" words are nearly everywhere in this game. That actually makes the game somehow charming which let you know again you have to work hard to be a ""somebody"".Progress makes perfectAs i said, the progress you make in Gothic is pretty slow but still not that slow that you stop playing. the Storyline and Quests keep you playing next to this, everyone jumps on you, threaten you and kicks your ♥♥♥ that you somehow build this deep feeling that you just want to, mildy said, ""kick their balls"" and want to show them whos ""the boss"". So you have to Level up, farm money and getting more and more better gear and levels. So after you level up a bit, getting your first good gear, weapons and skills you actually grain some respect, doing better quests and co. So thats how Gothic works. ""From Zero to Hero"", kinda.Still a classic (SOME PATCH HELPS AND UNCENSOR THE STEAM VERSION)I just want to add this here in my review that actually steam censored the Gothic version quite a bit. So if you wana change that or/and has some problems with this game, let me give you some helping patches which you should use if the game doesnt work or/and runs more smooth.--------------------------------------1. go here: http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1340357-Release-Gothic-%C2%BD-%C2%97-SystemPack-%28ENG-DEU%29Download the said packs for Gothic 1 (and 2 if you need) and install them in the right order.OPTIONAL (but you should so the textures look better in this game) you should also install ""Freddy´s Texturepatch"" which you can download here:http://www.worldofgothic.de/dl/download_247.htmthe textures will look more smooth and some of the armors will get a better texture ala Gothic 2.---------------------------------2. If you wana UNcensor Gothic 1, you have to do follow steps:Go to:\Steam\steamapps\common\gothic\Data\and delete the following file:textures_bikini.VDFAnd yeah, in case you want to spoil yourself the surprise of what it actually changes, I guess if you know what a ""bikini"" is, you will know what this will actually change~While you're at it you might want to open \gothic\system\GOTHIC.INI with your favorite text editor and change bloodDetail=2 to bloodDetail=3bloodDetail=2 is standard for every Gothic version. By changing it to 3 you actually add blood to the game (characters with low health will leave a blood trail).Gothic 2s default however is bloodDetail=3 (except the german version which stuck with 2). No idea about the steam version though. Didn't tried it out.Another tip for everyone who plays this game in german:Delete speech_babe_speech_engl.VDF.Otherwise the female characters will still speak english even if the game is set to german. Good job you did there (to whoever put this version together).Is it worth playing?Gothic is a great classic RPG of its own kind, it sure is a bit buggy and the grafic is not up-to-date next to games like Skyrim but it sure is worth playing. I already played it ones near the end as i got the game, right now i played it around 22 hours and im still in chapter 2 (remember as i said its slow progress~?). I recomment Gothic 1 for people who actually enjoy games coz of its story and gameplay and not of its look. As my title says, i acutally wish it would give a HD remake of this game, i sure would play it again only coz for this reason.			"

Once you come to terms with the unconventional controls(which are rather terrible to be completly honest) and keep playing whilst trying to overcome the difficulty which can be rather frustrating for beginners you will find one of the best atmospheres and stories in any RPG.

												Though it's a little hard to get into at first (mainly because it never tells you that you need to hold LMB and press W to interact with things and attack), Gothic is quite expansive and interesting.The main thing setting it apart from other early-2000's RPGs is its setting. It takes place in a prison camp surrounded by a malfunctioning magical barrier, out of which nothing can pass. The guards are all dead, killed by the inmates, who have formed three groups-- the Old Camp and New Camp, constantly at odds, and the Brotherhood, followers of the mysterious Sleeper.Early in the game, you're kind of a schmuck. You hold your longsword with two hands, you haven't any armor and so are punked out by a stiff wind, and you don't have any connections within the camps.Over the course of the game, you learn the elegantly wield a blade (or magic, or whatever), you find progessively better armor, and you rise to a position of respect and power among the other inmates.So, if you can get past the steep learning curve, it's definitely an experience worth having.

Что бы куда-то вступить, что-то получить нужно приложить не мало усилий. Броня в игре это вобще роскошь. Боевая система понравилась, разработчики попытались создать подобие фехтования. Много вариаций прокачки, можно охотником стать, вором мечником, по мере прокачки, прокачиваются и твои умению в бою.Из минусов могу выделить неприветливое управление, я минут 15 только разбирался что да как работает, долго не мог поднять предмет, а надо было зажать ctrl и вперед.Моя оценка 9 кор-галомов из 10 возможных.

Still to this day, a benchmark by which developers try to aspire one day.Very few come close.This game runs fine with the patch as mentioned in previous posts.If you call yourself a RPG enthusiast yet you have never played Gothic I and II, then you are worthless and your opinion does not matter to anyone.  Remember this game was released like 15 years ago.The story Arc's are crazy, the character development was meant to be hard at first, deal with it.  If you save often and allow yourself into the story, its a ride you will never forget.  Choose a side, Nameless Hero...for the fate of Khorinis is in your hands.			"

												Definitely my favorite open world, one-man-army style cRPG released so far. I don't tend to replay heavily story oriented games unless they're really good, and I've replayed this one twice since 2001. The story is simple, focused, and immediate. Gothic doesn't have you spend hours reading tome upon tome of useless irrelevant lore trying to legitimize the fantasy world you've been thrown into. Instead the world and story unfold quest by quest through characters all relevant to you and your place in the story, in a setting and with an atmosphere that really draws you in and has you believe the sense of desperation the characters are supposedly experiencing. If you're looking for immersion, this game does it damn good. Music is some of my favorite from any western RPG and helps further with the immersion. Gothic is no drama, just a good believable RPG. 10/10			"

												One of the best RPGs I've ever played.Its hard to convince people to jump back on old games like this but this game definitely stands up, even though its old, has dated graphics and clunky controls.It set some benchmarks, it really did. For people who are younger than 20, you dont understand what its like to first experience a true day/night cycle, and to experience actualy A-Life. A game that lives and breaths with or without you. NPCs who go around and do their daily things and live their lives and remember you and your actions.This was one of the first games to ever feature this.You probably played Skyrim right? Well the settlements in Gothic are just like that, the people live their lives, they do their daily things, they go to bed at night, they might pick fights with out, and they remember your actions.This was BIG back in 01 because no one else was doing it. NPCs around that time just stood there waiting to be talked to, or they may wander around in a room, thats about it, you would never see a NPC from one camp randomly decide to walk to another or patrol around the landscape or hunt.Another thing that made this game so great was how gritty and mature it was. This isnt a childs game. This is a game in a world full of Convicts. Everyone hates you, and you have to survive tooth and nail. You start out as a true weakling with no training, and really have to work your way up. You cant even take on the weakest of NPCs at the beginning of the game, you may have to resort to stealing and attacking them at night just go scrape your living. You have no idea how to fight, you can barely hold up a sword, and one swing and you're on your ♥♥♥, and guess what... they dont kill you, they loot all your money (ore) and take your weapon, and tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off. Yeah YOU yourself get LOOTED if you lose fights.And maybe you'll come back a few hours later when you're stronger, and take your revenge for that crude sword you worked so hard to get. It might not be very useful now, but its the principal of the thing, it was the best piece of equipment you could have ever owned at the time, and that ♥♥♥♥ stole it from you.Seriously, ground breaking game.

												I love Gothic 1 and 2. They certainly lack polish, look very dated today (they were pretty good upon release, but who cares...)They take quite a lot of getting used to them and are not by any standard easy games to pick up. The world is rather harsh, people aren't necessarily nice to each other, but that's always been part of Gothic's rough charm.I have no idea if the English or other foreign versions are any good, but the German versions are definitely worth it.

												Gothic 1 is a awesome PC game. The game takes place in a prison colony where you play as a nameless hero. You start off as a weak nothing, often getting mugged by stronger criminals. You can build up your character in various ways ranging from a weapon master, a marksman, or a wizard. Your main goal is to join one of the 3 camps in the game. Ranging from the crazy Sect Camp, a cult that believes their god will free them, the New Camp, filled with mercenaries and rogues who desire freedom, or the Old Camp, which wants to take advantage of their situation. Fight your way through giant ant monsters called Minecrawlers, orcs, demons and even golems and become the most powerful man in the colony!""SPOILER"" If you want to be a hardcore mage, do not join the Sect Camp. You can't learn all circles of magic with them. ""END SPOILER""			"

												Today, I got a quest to clear an old mine shaft full of nightmarish giant bugs from hell that could oneshot me. I cleared it and the guy who gave me the quest rewarded me with a 6-pack of beer.I smoked a huge joint of weed afterwards and gobbled the whole 6-pack. In-game.10/10.Also the steam version of the game WILL NOT LAUNCH with Windows 10 (and prior releases if the reviews are to be trusted) and that is why I cannot in good conscience recommend this version of the game. Here's how to launch it correctly :First, start the game like you would do normally. Nothing will happen but Steam will say that the game is running. you'll have to go to the Task Manager (ctrl+alt+del, or to open it directly, ctrl+l.shift+escape), then go to details, then right click on GOTHIC.EXE, then click on ""analyze wait chain"", then close whatever program's interfering.Then you'll have to download the 1.08k patch, then the player kit for Gothic 1, then the system pack. Once you've done all this, install them all, IN THIS ORDER : if you don't, the system pack won't be able to install.AND THEN you'll have to go to the root directory of Gothic 1, go in the System folder, right click on gothic.exe, select ""properties"", select the ""compatibility"" tab, and tick the ""run this program as an administrator"" box.If you're patient enough to do all this, then congrats, one of the best series of role-playing games of the early 00's awaits you, adventurer.If not, you're forgiven. just get the GoG release, I hear there aren't any bugs.FIX YOUR DAMN GAME, STEAM !PS : Don't trust the numbers you're seeing here, I put waaaaay more than enough hours into this game to be able to have an opinion on it. The system pack comes with a launcher that bypasses steam I believe, that's why I seem to have played only an hour when I really have played dozens.PPS : Also, beware of exploring TOO much. This can lead to bugs that can potentially break your game. For instance, in my first walkthrough, I explored the monastery north of the swamp waaaayyyy before the story tells me to go there. When I did, the game bugged and broke. I couldn't progress into the story anymore, no matter what I did, because I was supposed to open the gate leading to that place when AND ONLY WHEN a certain NPC was there. So yeah, be careful. Don't go to any remote place until the game specifically tells you to do so, or if you're willing to play through hours of content you've already done, back your main save file up by saving in a separate file AND THEN do it.

I can see where a lot of newer games have borrowed some of the better features.There are a few drawbacks however. The controls are just plain awkward. It can also be difficult to get it to play but there's lots of help and it's well worth the effort to get the needed patches. "

												Rating - 9.5/10Personaly i would recomend you buying this game even for full price , amazing story that makes you want to progress. Combat that doesent make you rip out your hair.

Allso dont look at the time i have played this game becouse i played it in offline.========================================Good things+amazing story+Many weapons and magic+Balanced Combat system+3 Big factions to choose on the begining of the game ...=====================================================Bad things- ...Although that doesent change the style of gameplay besides diffrent armor-Buggy mess (Might be becouse its old but it forced me to fix it my self , and that ruins the fun in few moments)=====================================================Ok things+Big world (colony) with many places to explore...-...Sadly becouse its big first 3 acts require you to round around without any way to teleport your self or just fastravel			"

												+ Great story+ Great characters+ Lots of items and skills+ monsters are challenging to fight+ 50 hours of gameplay (at least)+ swamp weedIt's a lot of fun because it's not one of those games you breeze through. I save the game every 5-10 minutes because...well...I die every 5-10 minutes. The quests are difficult to do. The monsters and your enemies are as strong as you are, and often stronger than you, requiring you to figure out other ways of attacking instead of just rushing in swinging your sword like a maniac.- some bugs: crusader in one quest does jack ♥♥♥♥ for you and lets you fight monsters meant to be fought by 2 characters alone; another quest character just went missing and I had to reload the save; in a later quest one companion started attacking my character out of no where; fell through a small gap between two wooden walkways and got stuck in midair, and because my character was stuck in midair, I couldn't pause to reload the save, so I had to reload the entire game. - combat isn't that fluidOverall, it's a great game and all I can really say about it is it has some bugs, though none of them are gamebreaking.

												The game design is formidable: no zones locked by plot advancement, just tougher monsters;3 really divergent factions to join;superb combat mechanics (for such an old game); the soundtrack, although dimished by a synthetic orchestra, is thematic and engaging;the character progression is delivered in such a cool way where you actually crave for an armor you see on someone and then after blood and tears you earn respect in your faction and you get it,which sounds nothing special but somehow it is. Just play and love it.			"

												One of my best experiences with a cRPG ever! An excellent told story where I as a player can choose my allegiance between three different factions full with memorable characters. It feels like your actions matters and has consequences, even though this may be imaginary at times. The game is full of action, but it's the exploration and interaction with the inhabitatns of the world that makes it such a great ride. The controls and combat is awkward at first, but after a couple of hours you're used to them and won't think about it anymore. As many before me have mentioned, this is a game that's challenging. You really have to be alert and careful in the beginning as all enemies are lethal, but as time goes by and you learn new abilities it gets quite easy in the end. For some this is off-turning, but for me it made the game even more exciting as danger was lurking around every corner and when the end game came you really felt mighty. Recommended to all of you looking for an rpg that's about story, exploration, characters and cheer adventure!			"

												There is one RPG series that perfectly encapsulates the rags to power archetype. I have yet to see any other RPG perform it as well. Developed by the German based studio Piranha Bytes, the first of the game in the Gothic series was released in November 2001. I remember it still, back in 2002, I was browsing Amazon, hungering for an RPG when I stumbled upon this game and it's rave customer reviews. I was not disappointed in the slightest.Gothic has you playing an unnamed convict that is about to be thrown into a prison-mining colony that is cut off from the outside world by a magical barrier that had backfired. While it is safe to enter the barrier, it is impossible for anything living to pass back through the barrier once inside. An uneasy agreement between the king and the convicts has resulted in an exchange of goods for the magical ore the convicts mine. Your character is plunged headlong into the situation when asked to contact the Mages trapped within the barrier.Your character has absolutely nothing at the start of his journey besides the clothes on his back. You must make your way through the prison colony, finding gear, gaining power, influence, and combat skills. The colony is a rough place mostly ran by former criminals and bandits, who mainly only respect strength of arms. As you progress, you will discover the colony is ran by three factions, one of which you must choose to side with. This decision determines what armor types, and combat training will be made available to you throughout the game.For the year 2002, Gothic was a marvel. While Morrowind was impressive in it's scope; being released later that year. Gothic provided a large open world with the freedom of choice that not many RPGs in that era could emulate. Plus the difficulty of the game was extreme, if I got a penny for every-time I had to reload my game, I'd be rich! These were the days before the Souls series, when video games were starting to curve into the more trivial side of the difficult spectrum.The best feeling about Gothic is the path of gradual power you gain throughout the game. When you first start, you'll be lucky enough if your puny self can defeat a mole rat. You'll wield a club as if it's a tree trunk; with both hands, flailing wildly and ineffectually. As you gain some combat training, your stance, and how well you wielded your chosen weapon type will improve. As you gain more combat experience you will become faster, and maneuver more smoothly into combos and parrying.In a colony full of former convicts, muggings are something you'll see often. They won't kill you, but they sure will shake you down. If you refuse to pay up, they'll find other ways to get your hard earned ore. (The currency of the cut-off colony) This is where the Gothic games got the silly moniker of being a 'mugging simulator'. Once you become more powerful, you can do the same to other characters, gathering wealth and equipment on the backs of others you are able to defeat. Or maybe getting back what was taken from you way back, when you couldn't defend yourself. Pay back always feels so sweet.If you become powerful enough, or skilled enough at the combat to take down a guard, you're really in business. Guards that you have previously beat up will remember you, and refuse to see you perform any crimes. They will even go as far as to turn away and exclaim that they saw nothing. Something about that simple sort of persistence really impressed me back then, and to this day still does. While the goal of mugging every character in the old camp isn't a story goal, it's a fun one to strive for in between odd jobs and quests.The three factions could be differentiated by the designs and colors of their faction specific armors. Once you decide on, and join a faction, you will be presented with the armor set corresponding to that faction and your rank. As you gain more prestige within your chosen faction, you will get better and cooler looking armor. This creates a fun curve that combines the acquiring of armor and an evolving character design, along with the game's story, which is a beautiful combination for any RPG gamer.To this day, every couple of years. I find myself playing through Gothic once again. To be terribly honest, the graphics have not held up that great. However, once I get back into the fantastic gameplay, I find myself hooked all over again. Working my way up to mugging those jerk-wad guards that always shake me down! This is always my ultimate goal when playing Gothic.You can find more of my ramblings about video games at www.chatswithrad.com "

												Still one good RPG theese days. (a bit glitchy... e.g.: if u block with a weapon while falling u take no fall damage and others)The gameplay will take more than 12 hours. (also because you have to kill everything in your sight to level up)Even for a 00's game , Gothic has a big variety of weapons , armors , spells , food , potions , other items , creatures and quests.The part I like the most is finding hidden items or looting the chests form everywhere. (don't judge me)The part I hate the most is that some characters do not take damage at all.The game of my childhood , but for the graphics nowadays and some errors which have to be fixed (steam access)     9.5/10I say 9.5 and not 9 just because there are too many well made features to give just a 9 (e.g.: you can choose your camp , play the game in al least 3 different ways and other stuff which makes Gothic epic)			"

												Просто лучшая рпг!В игру погружаешься с самого начала, хоть игра и старая, но виглядит она очень живо. В готике не дается все за так, вас даже в начале встречают ударом по ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, так вот в старом лагере с меня сразу стали трясти 10 руды тип за защиту, ну я отказался, а через пару часов попал в ловушку и получил ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ы и у меня отобрали всю руду, что была. Что бы куда-то вступить, что-то получить нужно приложить не мало усилий. Броня в игре это вобще роскошь. Боевая система понравилась, разработчики попытались создать подобие фехтования. Много вариаций прокачки, можно охотником стать, вором мечником, по мере прокачки, прокачиваются и твои умению в бою.Из минусов могу выделить неприветливое управление, я минут 15 только разбирался что да как работает, долго не мог поднять предмет, а надо было зажать ctrl и вперед.Моя оценка 9 кор-галомов из 10 возможных.

												Gothic was a pretty awesome experience. Had been hearing about it here and there from RPG fans, and I can see why it is considered a classic. After finally getting it to work (look up and download the Gothic 1/2 System Pack), the learning curve for the weird controls really messed me up for awhile, but while frustrated, I was at the same time intrigued with the atmosphere and other stuff being presented to ever think about quitting. Summing things up...Pros:+ Open world with a strong explorative element+ No hand holding (learn as you go, and save a lot!)+ Cool dark fantasy feel+ Creative terrain and environment design with what resources the company made use of+ High level of freedom, although the lack of direction may end up confusing some+ The feeling of steadily growing from a scrawny weakling to the baddest dude around is great! Just make sure you commit to a certain stat path to avoid mediocrityNeutrals:Voice acting was... okay. Not the worst I've ever heard, and occasionally ""bad"" in a way that was more funny than annoying. Music was limited with atmospheric tracks, which is fine, but would have personally appreciated more background emphasis at important partsCons:- Because it's so old, it was kind of a pain getting things running to start- Controls are archaic to match the setting!- Most characters were generic and flat, with few as memorable as the protagonist (being fully voiced), Diego, Xardas, and whatever crew you spend the most time with- Would've been nice to see more of an ending resolution to when that freaking barrier came down. Also more consequences to having joined a certain camp- Final confrontations with key antagonists were kind of anticlimactic, and could be easily cheesed using the environment and summon scrolls. Nitpicking? Probably.Overall:8.5 out of 10Despite the oldness, frustrating combat, and occasionally flickering textures requiring a reboot to get rid of, Gothic is definitely worth at least one play through. Looking forward to playing the sequels (once I get them to work!)			"

												If you are a diehard fan of real old times open world RPG`s, then this is the game for you. Captivating story, interesting quests, great gameplay. Too bad it`s too old and outdated for me but still, you can`t miss it if you wanna play the sequels, Gothic 2 Gold Edition, 3 and 3 Forsaken Gods. Don`t forget, the series continued under the name Risen.8/10			"

												I love Gothic 1 and 2. They certainly lack polish, look very dated today (they were pretty good upon release, but who cares...)They take quite a lot of getting used to them and are not by any standard easy games to pick up. The world is rather harsh, people aren't necessarily nice to each other, but that's always been part of Gothic's rough charm.I have no idea if the English or other foreign versions are any good, but the German versions are definitely worth it.

												If you can look past some rough edges and old-fashioned design, considering the game's age, you'll find a rather simple and charming game. Gothic 1 starts off with you being thrown into a prison colony and you'll have to decide which of the three factions causes suits you the best.The game is fully voiced with some pretty goofy voice-acting quality at times.The interface can be rather cumbersome but you can definitely get used to it. What might stick in your craw are the controls; movement often feels clumsy; combat is stiff but does require a bit of skill to time your attacking and blocking correctly. Get the rhythm right and you can take on some really tough customers and walk away with a kickass new weapon and a bunch of money.If you're willing to put up with Gothic 1's quirks then you will be pleased as peach when you move on to Gothic II, which follows up the story immediately; it's also an excellent upgrade in all technical aspects. Better progression, bigger map, higher stakes, vastly better interface and control..Certainly something to look forward to.just watch your ♥♥♥ on that third one its a little special >.>Good luck on your Gothic adventures.

												Gothic 1 is a awesome PC game. The game takes place in a prison colony where you play as a nameless hero. You start off as a weak nothing, often getting mugged by stronger criminals. You can build up your character in various ways ranging from a weapon master, a marksman, or a wizard. Your main goal is to join one of the 3 camps in the game. Ranging from the crazy Sect Camp, a cult that believes their god will free them, the New Camp, filled with mercenaries and rogues who desire freedom, or the Old Camp, which wants to take advantage of their situation. Fight your way through giant ant monsters called Minecrawlers, orcs, demons and even golems and become the most powerful man in the colony!""SPOILER"" If you want to be a hardcore mage, do not join the Sect Camp. You can't learn all circles of magic with them. ""END SPOILER""			"

												The controls are painful to learn compared to modern games. The mouse controls are minimal and awkward. After getting used to the controls it plays pretty well. The plot is pretty good and the mechanics are as well. It is often difficult to ascertain exactly where you are supposed to go or what you are supposed to do.

												Why Gothic 1 is worth every penny and why I nominated it for my custom ""LEGACY"" award:My first real forays into the RPG universe on pc's was back during the initial releases of Gothic 1 and Morrowind. While both are in the same genre...they couldnt be more different. But Gothic 1 always stood ahead, just barely, (and so far) is still my frontrunner for favorite 3d rpg of all time. The biggest flaw that will immediately ♥♥♥♥ off anyone born 1993 or later is the combat. Compared to what's seen today, Gothic's combat is borderline archaic. I played it with only keyboard. No mouse was needed. Essentially it's Quake 1-esque. I'm actually kinda chuckling to myself when I think about it and compare it. But having played, and beaten the game more than 5 times (and ALWAYS finding some new area or new hidden spot with a ring or sword I missed), I wouldnt change it.The story is original. To me at least. Though perhaps I wouldnt be surprised if it was already done on a Syfy channel series honestly. Regardless...The world was one of the first to truly feel alive in a game. Though basic, characters in the game had actual routines throughout the day. Hearing npc's in the old camp chit chat while next to a fire during the black of night still feels like home to me. And I still laugh at the very blatant drug-related abuse at the Swamp camp. The ""Nameless hero"" is likeable. His voice you hear all throughout the game isnt annoying...though not yout typical ""badass"" gruff character type of most of todays games...he's got a very Guybrush Threepwood likeability. Learning skills about hunting and what not is nice. And outfitting him with a new sword or heavy, fur adorned armor feels rewarding. Plus, if there's a chance...just a slight chance, a ledge looks reachable...try for it. Exploration is rewarded. ...If you can get past the combat's...let's say...""antiquated uniqueness"" and the dated graphics, Gothic 1 is very much worth the price of admission. It's hands down the best in the series that Piranha Bytes did, and I think it's due to the smaller world of the sequels. It doesnt try to stretch itself too thin unlike the others and thus, it has more life to it. Even though I did like 2 and 3, they never captured the essence and overall charm that 1 did. Still, I'm sad to see that PB still doesnt have the rights back to what should be theirs. Everything about the world/lore is their creation and that hand-holding mess of ""Arcania"" should never have the name ""GOTHIC"" above it.If you like good story telling, decent voice acting, and a world filled with it's own unique charm, get Gothic 1. You wont be sorry.			"

												Gothic 1. Remember when my friend was showing me this game and saying how amazing it is. At that time, I was used to different games. The controls were horrible for me and I just couldn't wrap myself around. Forward some time and I fell in love with Gothic 3. My love for it made me eventually buy every Gothic and I must say, it was worth it. The story is really good. And the fact you are just another prisoner in colony is making the game even better. It shows you more realism. Even after all these years, I will gladly come back to it. Controls will suck for you at first, but as you will start upgrading your character, so will you ability to control him.Highly recommend it for anyone given the unique story and small things you can do that immerse you more into the world of Gothic.

												Gothic 1 may have suffered a bit under the tooth of time but once you get past the slightly awkward controls and the graphics that may be considered subpar for todays standards but still have a certain rustic charm, one heck of an adventure awaits you. The world of Gothic is a harsh one so you may not get to see much of it at the beginning before even a common stray wolf murders the living daylights out of you but once you rise up in the ranks of one of 3 factions you will gain more power and the world will be yours to explore (you should still avoid fire lizards like the plague though). The world building and the npcs are quite believable and honestly among the best of all the rpgs I've played. A friendly face is a bit of a rarity, most of the people are either completely neutral towards you or only have their own profits in mind, a bunch are just unfriendly and some are just MASSIVE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S (seriously ♥♥♥♥ Bloodwyn, Bullit and some other guys). Oh right there's also Mud... it's probably best if you experience him for yourself. Honestly having the opportunity to beat up Mud alone is already reason enough to buy this game.			"

												Today, I got a quest to clear an old mine shaft full of nightmarish giant bugs from hell that could oneshot me. I cleared it and the guy who gave me the quest rewarded me with a 6-pack of beer.I smoked a huge joint of weed afterwards and gobbled the whole 6-pack. In-game.10/10.Also the steam version of the game WILL NOT LAUNCH with Windows 10 (and prior releases if the reviews are to be trusted) and that is why I cannot in good conscience recommend this version of the game. Here's how to launch it correctly :First, start the game like you would do normally. Nothing will happen but Steam will say that the game is running. you'll have to go to the Task Manager (ctrl+alt+del, or to open it directly, ctrl+l.shift+escape), then go to details, then right click on GOTHIC.EXE, then click on ""analyze wait chain"", then close whatever program's interfering.Then you'll have to download the 1.08k patch, then the player kit for Gothic 1, then the system pack. Once you've done all this, install them all, IN THIS ORDER : if you don't, the system pack won't be able to install.AND THEN you'll have to go to the root directory of Gothic 1, go in the System folder, right click on gothic.exe, select ""properties"", select the ""compatibility"" tab, and tick the ""run this program as an administrator"" box.If you're patient enough to do all this, then congrats, one of the best series of role-playing games of the early 00's awaits you, adventurer.If not, you're forgiven. just get the GoG release, I hear there aren't any bugs.FIX YOUR DAMN GAME, STEAM !PS : Don't trust the numbers you're seeing here, I put waaaaay more than enough hours into this game to be able to have an opinion on it. The system pack comes with a launcher that bypasses steam I believe, that's why I seem to have played only an hour when I really have played dozens.PPS : Also, beware of exploring TOO much. This can lead to bugs that can potentially break your game. For instance, in my first walkthrough, I explored the monastery north of the swamp waaaayyyy before the story tells me to go there. When I did, the game bugged and broke. I couldn't progress into the story anymore, no matter what I did, because I was supposed to open the gate leading to that place when AND ONLY WHEN a certain NPC was there. So yeah, be careful. Don't go to any remote place until the game specifically tells you to do so, or if you're willing to play through hours of content you've already done, back your main save file up by saving in a separate file AND THEN do it.

												I don't think there are any games that I could play a decade after and still enjoy them. Nonetheless, Gothic is such a pearl.The rags-to-riches kind of story, that leaves a lot of freedom of choice in your hands. Give it a try and enjoy specific humour, simple yet satisfying character development system, multitude of well-thought quests, quite a few factions to explore, and close calls with those bloody shadowbeasts.Forget about the graphics, honed visual side does not make a good game.Remember to change the controls to alternative mode to enjoy common WSAD model.Enjoy the game!
