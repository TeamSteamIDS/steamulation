												Update: 600 hours in, I stand by this review. There's been quite a few improvements to RE:IS since I wrote this, I really recommend both this game and its DLC.-------------------When I first heard of Renowned Explorers : International Society (henceforce known as RE:IS) my initial reaction was along the lines of ""what on earth is this?"". I purchased it on a whim, and having now played it for nearly 100 hours and all treasures collected, it has definitely turned out to be one of my wisest purchases (and heck, i'm actually writing a proper review for once, my first one on steam.)RE:IS is a roguelike in an Indiana Jones style - you and your crew will be having adventures all around the globe, from searching castles in the Scottish highlands to the tombs of  ancient pharoahs in Egypt in the hopes of finding treasures (and with over 100 treasures to find, there is plenty to see.) You'll run into a variety of characters such as bagpipe playing clansmen,  pirates suffering under a voodoo curse and a group of monkeys worshipping a giant fruit.The game keeps a fairly lighthearted and humourous theme throughout, which is aided by its bright and colourful art style. Don't let this fool you however - there is a surprising amount of depth to be found in the games combat and exploration systems. Battles have three different approaches: you can befriend your enemy, offering them things such as compliments and peace treatires. Or you can take a straight up physical approach - hacking and slashing your way through hordes of your opponents. If you prefer a more devious approach, you can play mind games with your opponents, hurling insults towards them in such number that they run away from the battlefield sobbing.Overall, RE:IS takes a refreshing approach to the turn-based rogue-like genre. The developers are very active within the community and listen to feedback and suggestions from players. The game is frequently updated with new content, and more has been promised down the line. I highly recommend purchasing this game.			"

												Renowned Explorer (RE) is one of the very best game that I have played for the last 10 years, period :).I have about 300 games, and haven't felt so excited about a new game for such a long time --- perhaps the last time that I felt so excited was  as long as Civilization 1 in 1991.I normally play RPGs, but Renowned Explorer is in a Genre all by itself. It's radically different from the typical RPG or strategy games that I am family with.  Because it is so different, it took me a while to grasp and learn the basics of the game. In the end, after learning about the game, I begin to have great fun... and hundreds of hours on the game. The nice thing about RE is that the entire game campaign consists of 5 expeditions, and you can play it over and over again with different team setups. Different team captains have different super powers, and so, each game with a different captain usually require different strategy and even different playstyle, making in intriguing and interesting.Another nice thing about RE is that the development team offered to add additional contents and updates on a regular basis. So far they have already added quite a bit of new content. Such a commitment from a developing team is really commendable. Even with 276 hours played, I will still be playing this game whenever they add anything new. I am sure I will get MORE than my money's worth and highly recommend this game. "

												In my very first encounter, I encountered a pack of wolves.  I impressed them with my great intelligence, then insulted them.  They were confused by my mixed signals and ran away.  My most successful run was ended when a ghost pirate and his voodoo cultists were friendly and invited me to sit down for tea, and my crew felt that their vengeance against the Spanish was entirely reasonable and I should stop fighting.  My current game is more direct and is full of dashing gentlemen and fisticuffs.This is absolutely amazing.  Yes, the overland map is a lot like FTL--random events that are influenced by your party skills.  Combat is your standard hex based tactics game (even though it's not really hex shaped, which is neat).  Physical attacks work like normal, but speech attacks are a major part of the game, and so is control of emotions and mood.  If your enemy is using devious speech attacks but you are being friendly (they all deplete Spirit just like physical attacks), then you get defense bonuses from being the good guys.  If both sides are friendly, then both sides get a bonus if they are the first ones to go to physical attacks, stuff like that.  Takes about an hour or two to really get used to it, but then it feels natural.This game is pretty polished.  Not perfect, but it hits its mark pretty darn well.  Difficulty seems pretty well tuned, the first couple missions are easy but surviving to the end seems like a real challenge, much like FTL.  You can sit down for a couple hours and play a game or two and have them end in one sitting which is great, honestly...replayability seems high, and unlockables are present but a very minimal part of the experience.  Bugs are very minor and hard to spot.  It's really damn cool to be able to build a party that fights like something out of Monkey Island.All in all, heavily recommended.			"

												Renowned Explorers is great game. I have played about 1.5 hour so far and enjoyed it a lot during this time. It is kept in nice lighthearted mood that will keep you smiling through most of a game. I enjoy tactical encounters a lot and the fact that i can resolve in different ways. It is no longer just a case of winning but winning in the way that will benefit our crew the most. Game keeps it short and composes of 5 expedition to finish one run. It is similar to FTL in that manner that it can be completed in one afternoon and then you go on pick a new crew and start new procedurally generated adventure. I think game has potential to give hours of fun. I also highly appreciate the tutorial in the game it teaches all the basics you need to know to complete first expedition. My greatest concern is the price FTL legend that started it all is on sale for $ 9.99 and as much as I appreciate beautiful graphics of Renown explorers and more work put into the build I would prefer it to be slightly cheaper. For me it’s still worth it but it’s up to you to decide. I also have a video featuring first procedurally generated expedition in which I show the gameplay, talk about mechanics, and teach you how to play feel free to check it out and let me know what you think. If you have any questions hit me up here or on my channel I’m happy to help.

												What you have to know abou this game BEFORE you buy it, is that it lacks a lengthy campaign.Instead, it has a very small and generic campaign, with a very simple and generic objective (be the best).You have to do a few explorations, each of, can be finished in 15 or 20 minutes, and then you hop to another for a total of 5. That means that the whole campaign can be finished in a couple of hours or more aaand thats it.Reanse and repeat.There is no grand expendition or campaign with many hours of gameplay and strategic desisions!To my dismay, there is no need for a masterplan, or any kind of real depth in the desision making!That doesnt meen that this is a bad game, though!The combat system is very original and funny and so are the dialogues in the game!Nice sounds and design and colourful characters are also a plus!My mistake is that i was hoping for something more,You just have take it for what it is!#EDIT 1:The game has a great replay value if you like to keep challenging yourself to achieve a better score and to compete in leaderboards...#EDIT 2: TOTAL RESPECT to the devs for their communication, for supporting their game, nurturing and caring both the game and the community around it.I do not regret buying this game and i will totaly support them and in their next project!

												This game was a big disappointment for me.  There's a lot to like about this game! The combat is clever, challenging and fun. The encounters are well-written and full of flavor. The art and character design are lovely.The problem is that this an RPG about collecting artifacts... in which there are no long-term benefits to character development or artifact collection. The game inexplicably adopts the neo-Roguelike model that has been popular since FTL, where each `playthrough' is short, brutal, and random. After a few hours, you'll have found a handful of artifacts, leveled your characters around max level, and (most likely) died at the hands of a sudden difficulty spike or a series of bad rolls. Then you are back at the main menu, with nothing to show for your trouble except a slightly better understanding of the (fundamentally random) nature of the game.I could make some other criticisms as well. The amount of content seemed fairly small (there may be less than a dozen campaign maps), and randomness was a bigger factor than I'd like. These could both be issues for anyone interested in undertaking the challenge of getting `good' at this game.You may enjoy this game! If the idea of a cute archeaological FTL appeals to you, go for it!  If you want a casual adventure with any sense of accomplishment, do not buy this game.			"

												This was definitely a good buy.  It has good replayability in the short term but once you've gone on every expedition three or four times it becomes a bit predictable.  Could do with some more randomization or better yet more content.  An extra handful of expeditions would be a welcome addition.Pros:-Upbeat, lighthearted tone.-Reminiscent of several fun cooperative board games I've played.-Good campaign length.  Not too long nor too short.-Good variety between characters.-Nice balance of intuitiveness for ease of play and complexity for challenge.Cons:-Loses replayibility in the long term.			"

For the first ten minutes you're thinking ""Oh this seems a bit humdrum"" ... and then you are insulted (or complimented) by a sheep, and everything goes a bit strange after that.Welcome to the wonderful world of Renowned Explorers : International Society, best described as a very warm and charming take on ""The Curious Expedition"" but do not confuse that for ""Simple or shallow"", no. Nonono. This game is, underneath the big fluffy cuddly exterior, much like a house cat, and like any house cat, it has paws made up of TEENY TINY KNIVES which will dig their way in and cause much horrible pain if you're not paying attention to the various mechanics at work.If you've never had the joy of living with a house cat, it's the most wonderful experience, and they'll slowly destroy everything you own, but you'll never be able to get upset with them, because they're made of fur, and wuv. Even when it comes to cleaning their ears and they rake nice red lines into your forearm so you look like you've been on a self harm trip.This game is very much like a house cat, you don't own it. It owns you. Often as a matter of fact. I've played the better end of hm, fifty attempts, often getting to 4* or 5* difficulty expeditions and then it all goes horribly horribly wrong. Oh it's call cute and cuddly in the beginning with nice scottish highlands and pirates treasure out in the carribean but just you wait, wait until you're knee deep in Transylvania, hungry wolves and digging into the legends of one Mr. Dracul who turns out to be a real charmer with the speech and can WRECK a diplomatically inclined team in seconds because as it turns out, your strength just became a phenomenal weakness.*AHEM* Back on topic Senor Hobbes?Okay, let's pull the camera back and do a breakdown of the game. It runs in three distinct ""beats"", first and foremost is the World Map, this serves as your transition between various adventures, it's where you kit out your explorers, spend insight and convert that into ""Useful materials"" for expeditions ahead, and then spend gold, status, and research on ""Things that will help"" such as equipment upgrades (armour helps a LOT, so do trinkets), your entourage (who acts as a force multiplier and offers special conditions in the case of the named entourage members), and unlocking areas of the research tree that yields additional supplies, and other useful benefits, again, making the ride through the game that much smoother. It's your HQ in effect, but there's a lot to do between adventures, and a lot of discrete choices to make as to how you want to ""build your team"", so it's not like a case of ""Click click done"".Doing the FTL dance in a very focussed way, and with more SheepSecond beat comes in the form of the ""local adventure"" map, which once you've selected WHERE you want to go, is then a zoomed up version of the location, say, an area of land or an island, part fogged in and part visible depending on how much terrain you've covered, each map has points of interest (think FTL) and the idea is you move around the points of interest, solving challenges. Most of these are ""Roll"" challenges where a % chance to succeed is based on the skills of the team, more skills mean more prizes, in some cases simply having ENOUGH skills in a specific tree will unlock whole new options, which are coloured in and take you down new routes with additional rewards. The limit on simply being able to clean the map is ""Supplies"", the cap is soft, you can go below zero, but each point that you do, imposes a very steep penalty on your ability to fight. You can get away with one or two points, but more than this is just -begging- for a game over.The stories for each area are well written and the narrative is cohesive, it's good enough that you'll be able to get a feel for what goes on in each area and you'll pay some attention to the choices presented (there's usually clues in the text as to what's a good choice and what's a bad one), sometimes you'll end up with a case of ""Best of the worst"" options which can be a tad irritating but that's RNG for you when you don't know what you're going to draw from the story deck for a given area.And then I got into a shouting match with a nun...Finally, there's the turn based fighting sequence, which kicks in on an encounter. This is not just a case of move and shoot. You have three options, one agressive, one devious, one friendly, the game KINDA works like rock paper scissors, however, there's more than just the fight atmosphere to consider, because if you want the optimal rewards you may have to finish a fight in a specific manner. In other cases you may face opponents who change their own approach when you munchkin the game mechanics (in other words, attempt to game the boss and the boss games YOU), and each of the RE:IS members have their own specific strengths and weaknesses meaning some just don't work out that well for a specific strategy in one way, but are great when used in a different approach. Using a one dimensional ""Oh I am gonna stack the board with speakers"" seems great in principle, but then Mr. Dracul comes along and ""OH GOD I'M GOING TO GET MY FACE TORN OFF"", so it's not always the greatest plan to put all the eggs in one basket.A wonderful cast of heroes and villainsIn fact you'll probably have so much fun with the various boss encounters and the foes like the Smuggler Boss (who you can reduce to tears) and Mr. Dracul that the real goal, beating the obnoxious champion of the International Society will take the back seat as the moment to moment stories you find yourself in matter more, Riveleaux can wait, I've a vampire to convince.Closing thoughtsSo here's the big question ""Curious Expedition"" or ""Renowned explorers"" - Me? I'd say both. They're wonderful games both of them, but if I had to make a choice? I'd take the house cat over the darker sibling, and ONLY JUST. Because it's the house cat, and it's ""Heartwarming"" (and yes, that's something you can DO to your foes in this game).I love my cats. I love this game so very dearly. Get it.Verdict : Essential "

												Renowned Explorers is, in many ways, reminiscent of FtL: Faster than Light. You lead a crew through a series of locations, some of which are just text-based choices, some of which are fighting encounters, many of which give you the opportunity to gather resources that you can later spend on upgrades and items that improve your crew. The game puts you in the shoes of a Dr. Livingstone-like explorer, going through the ruins of ancient civilizations looking for plunder. It's very good in this way. The art style is incredibly cute and a great asset to the game. Not only are the twenty different characters you can take on an expedition instantly recognisable, the character portraits in-game change when you affect their emotions, which is a lot of fun (making sheep sad is especially rewarding). The music is good as well, never distracting from the game, always adding to it.A game like this, however, lives and dies with its events. Such games throw a lot of text at you, and it needs to be enjoyable. This, the game succeeds at. There are quite a number of cute little unique responses that make you want to replay the game to see how different characters would interact (for example, a pair of Hungarian lumberjacks gave me some extra goods because they were impressed by my moustache). As such, the game is quite good. It falters a bit in the combat, though. You can use three types of attacks (friendly, devious, and aggressive) to solve encounters, and they affect what you get out of the encounter, but they do tend to play out the same way in an encounter. You can do some nice tricks with it, but it doesn't feel as deep as in FtL. Another negative in the comparison with FtL is that you never really feel pressured. You use up your supplies to move through the map, but there aren't a lot of events that mess with you, so you can usually plan your entire expedition and proceed unrushed. The events do seem to have a lot more variation than in FtL, and the perks that you can unlock for your characters throughout the game make for extra interactions and unique responses to events.All in all, Renowned Explorers is a very good game. It's enjoyable and its humour makes it very replayable. The humour, graphics, and sheer variety of events makes up for some of its shortcomings and makes it a game that I would be more likely to pick up again than FtL, where I have kind of already seen everything it has to offer. It could do, however, with some more depth in its combat system.Update: the More to Explore expansion has come out, and it has massively improved on many aspects of the game. A number of balance issues have been solved, the new expeditions showcase some of the best design the Abbey Games team has to offer, and by including new campfire stories, there is a new reason to keep coming back to this game and replaying it. I do wish the player would be able to customise his or her campfire stories at the start of an expedition, but the expansion improves this game on all aspects.			"

Renowned Explorers: International Society (RE:IS) has done it. It has captured my attention. From the very first run through of the game, to the second and third, I have been captivated, and rightfully so. The graphics, audio, and gameplay - all of it is absolutely stunning.When I first placed RE:IS on my wish list I knew I had discovered a gem. Turn-based strategy games were, however, never my forte and I was hesitant when I found out RE:IS was one. Plenty of other TBS games have sat in my Steam library - gone unnoticed - but somehow, this one screams for my attention.""Why?"", do you ask? Well... let me try and answer that.---------------------------------------------------------GameplayVery basic in that you try to gain the most treasure within 5 explorations in ordered to be known as 'The Most Renowned Explorer'. You achieve all of this through a turn-based system, working with either a friendly, aggressive, or deceptive approach. Bonuses can either bolster or hinder your team, and it is up to you to determine what is best. With over ten characters to choose from, the possibilities are endless.GraphicsDon't let RE:IS' graphics deter you from playing this game, although I'm not sure why it would in the first place. While comical, they are what make this game unique, fresh, and complete. You honestly can't go wrong with this type of art style.Every aspect has been paid attention to: from the facial expressions due to a failure or wealth of luck, or the different attack styles and use of abilities on opponents. I applaud the developer's for putting so much effort into this aspect.AudioThe sound effects for this game can be considered  ""cutesy"" and refreshing. There is a unique sound for everything and it all fits. From the whooshing of the ocean slapping the seashore, to the ""ca-ching!"" of coins being exchanged, RE:IS delivers quality sound effects and tracks.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ High replayability value+ Great use of audio and music+ Graphics are great and unique+ Ability to take down a bully, make them cry, and wipe the smug smile off their face+ The sheep are darn stinkin' cute. They love you and your cause (as long as you're friendly)+ Weekly challenges offer something to do all the time with the RE:IS community (goes hand in hand with this game having a very friendly fan base)+ This can go both ways, but I appreciate that this game actually takes skills to play. You will have to think ahead - plan ahead - and adapt accordingly+ For the amount of content that is offered, the price is spot on. While I got this from a bundle, I would gladly pay full price knowing that this title is very enjoyable+ Extra content is provided for free, no charge at all; shows that the developer's care for their creation more than the money going into their pockets. That type of dedication is hard to find, so another plus one to the developer's for love of their productNeutral± For the achievement hunters: the achievements are both easy yet difficult to obtain. On one hand they'll be pouring in, on the other, it takes skills and perseverance to get the rest± Can become repetitive over time, but there are new treasures to be uncovered, dialogue to be said, and areas of the map to be explored. This is enough to keep me coming back, but I can understand others may feel differentlyCons- There are not enough places to explore! Rest assured though, the developers are currently working on this- Credit to another gamer: a character voiceover option would be great for those who prefer that! I would very much enjoy listening to each character's individual voice myself---------------------------------------------------------There are few titles that really catch and hold my attention for this long. RE:IS has done just that, however, and I'm glad to have been blessed enough to come across this game. While I still actively play to this day, I dread the day the expansion comes out... I will be too busy becoming a Renowned Explorer once again to care for anything else!Perhaps it has something to do with the comical style. Maybe even a little dash of charm, or the dedication and attention to detail and style that makes RE:IS what it is. Whatever the case, this game has won my heart, and I hope it does yours too.Overall9.5/10---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report! I will keep it up to date with the games that I plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions.			"

												One of my favorite new games of the year. I've always been interested in all the Indiana Jones, old mythos, and 19th century history, so this, naturally was an easy fit. But seriously, the game would be great without it. You get pretty attached to the characters you choose and in a lot of ways it feels like old world XCOM  - and yet completely refreshing.There are two legit cons you hear more than anything else:1) The game is too difficult2) It should be longerPersonally I think the first one is a little dumb. Yes, there is RNG, but there is also, again, brutal RNG in XCOM, and it's no more crazy than that. I feel like the problem with the RNG is that too many people think that this game is like FTL, when it's really more like XCOM. The RNG isn't in the encounter, it's in the success. If your soldier misses a 85% shot on a mutalisk, he will probably, brutally die, I think the adventure wheel is in the same vein. Even more than the combat, which again, feels very XCOM. I read Abbey Games saying that they were implementing a difficulty feature, which will probably help.The second complaint I wholeheartedly agree with. I would love this game with more goofy characters (or maybe an option to make and name your own character?), more areas to explore, longer quests, more treasure, more leveling up and all of that. I don't know how feasible it is, but maybe even open the game to modders in the future, because the template is all there, I would just love more. But overall the answer is, yes! You should absolutely purchase this game. It's very fun, it's got a lot to offer, and from what I've read, it sounds like Abbey is planning on adding more to the game over time. If you're a little hesistant now, I understand - but at least put it on your wishlist. "

												If you want the review summarized in a few words at the beginning of it, so that you can spare yourself the trouble of reading, there it is: this game is the next THE NEXT FTL (Faster than Light, come on, if you don't know what it is and don't have it, just buy it and play it already), but JUST A TAD OVERPRICED. Easy as that.Renowned Explorers: International Society (REIS) is a game where you command a crew of 3 explorers on a quest to unravel as many treasures, gain as much renown and eventually rise to the top of the explorer society by beating you top rival... um... Rivaleux. Wowzers, very creative, I know :) So does the game deliver? Let's take a look at the good and the bad.The Good:1. Amazing replayability. No 2 groups are the same, they always yield different results in battle, and can be played in a plethora of ways.2. Good AI. NOTE: I mean good, not great. On classic, it will exploit some of your misakes and forgive you others.3. Unique locations with great art: the artwork of this game is great, the devs did am awesome job with it.4. Unique Characters: your Captain and your crew members all have unique capabilities, and you are free to mix and match them to your heart's content, discovering the best combos and finding out what works best for you.5. An innovative take on combat: combat can be won with friendship, deviousness, aggression and... guile. Why guile? Because you can mix and match all of those 3 combat approaches to achieve a combat status that best fits your next move at any given time, and thus win a battle more easily.6. A game over that barely feels like a game over. Your crew doesn't really die... they just have ""stuff"" happen to them. Like spend the remainder of their lives repenting in an all-nun monastery. Well, if that was a 3 man crew... they have their work cut out for them.7. Easy to roleplay: I am not a good roleplayer AT ALL. Yet I found myself putting lines in my toon's mouths. Say, my girl does an ew and shows some soiled undies to another female and I was like: ""Geez girl, when was the last time you changed your knickers?!"" - reaction: ""Saddened"". In another case she shows a snail and points at a guy and I was like ""Sheesh, mate, even she knows that you are slow to get it up"". And then I LOLED. And then I was happy.  And then I went to bed with a smile of my face. 'Bout that...8. This game easily puts a smile on your face through dialogues, the encounters (charming wolves and sheep FTW), and the combat. Yeah, even when you're losing...9. Tons of unlockables: the devs really went balls to the wall with this one. You have 20 unique characters, with every one of them available as a captain after you've played them a few times, over 100 achievements, treasures, and 4 difficulty levels with or without savescumming.10. Ironman if you want: many rogue-likes (Lites?) have an imposed ironman setting. Here you don't. All that the non-ironman game does is to lock you out are the achievements, and that is a small gripe, especially when it comes to a game as hard as this one. 'Bout that #2...11. The game is hard. It's brutal. It's so damn difficult to win. I love it. Even getting 2nd or 3rd place is an achievement. Hell, even surviving the whole ordeal is :D12. 12 procedurally generated maps with tons of stuff to unlock on them.13. Your experiences matter and the game teaches you as you go. I really like that about a game - it makes my subsequent playthroughs meaningful, and much more fun.14. Tooltips give you an idea what to expect and even let you turn back and back out of a possible challenge, encounter or opportunity, which is a rare thing in rogue-like (lite?) games. You just need to read, you know...15. The game gives you recommendations with your starting crew (every toon has 2 ""best fits"" so to speak), which saves you some trial and error time.16. Once you get the hang of the entire system, just like in FTL, the game feels great to play.And now, the bad:1. Only a limited number of maps. 12 is ultimately too little if you want to play this game over and over.2. The game is HARD. It will take you a good amount of hours to find a decent crew composition and make it work. And then you need to get used to the bosses... and then you need to get used to the levels... and then you need to learn which toons does what ability... and then you need to pick the proper maps to do it... and finally, you need to make it work. Yeah... that's a lot of info.3. You can lose missions through no fault of your own. The map can screw you, the RNG can screw you, the enemies can screw you, etc. I had runs where I was consistently losing high % rolls... not a pretty sight.4. Very high learning curve. Learning how every character, every enemy, every mood combo, every attack and so on and so forth works is a daunting challenge.5. Overpriced. While the game is good, 20€ is too much. I personally bought it on HumbleBundle for the US equivalent of Euro and even had a % of it donated some to charity, so I feel good about myself. On steam, however, 20€ is a lot.The conclusion:This game gets an easy recommendation from me, especially to the gamers of the rogue-like (lite?) genre. The game allows you to do pretty much everything with it - explore safely, savescum, challenge yourself, find tresures, go achievement crazy and so on and so forth. It never makes you feel bad about losing too. Your guys don't perish - they just get to live a different life or flee. This makes it a great game for people who are generally sensitive or don't like to lose their in-game crew. All of this is a grat selling point to this game. Its setbacks comprise of a high learning curve, limited maps and TIME. Yes, you need time, and you really need to take the game in and let it teach you. Not everyone is ready to do that.Any price reduction of 33% or more makes the game an easy purchase. It needs love in my opinion, because it does so much right, and it is a breath of fresh air to the genre, by letting you do whatever you feel like it with it. I have a ton of fun with it, and I will keep on doing so. 8.7 hours in, just a tad less than my play time in FTL, and this game still isn't getting old, and that is saying something.			"

												This game has great presentation. Pleasant artstyle, good music, very simple to get into. On the other had there is way too little content. It felt slightly repetitive on the third run (one run takes just a couple of hours) and at around fifth run I just couldn't find a reason to keep on playing. Combat system has an interesting twist to it, but didn't carry the game on it's own for me.Maybe on sale.			"

Renowned Explorers: International Society is a turn-based strategy adventure game made by Abbey Games.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You are a leader of an expedition and you try to be the most famous explorer of them all. The world is randomly generated and there are always numerous strategies and paths you can take to try to be in the best position possible.Pros: Graphics | This game is really colourful and this is one of the biggest advantages of this game. The characters and the items look good and all the animations are amazing as well. I also like how well this game depicts different environments and attracts the player to the game with it. Replayability | Expeditions are randomly generated, which means that your journey and your experience will be different every time you start a new game. Obviously, this contributes enormously to the replayability value of this game. It's not as replayable as The Binding of Isaac, for example, but it does get pretty close. Above all, you even unlock new things with each go, which means that the replayability even grows. Characters | There are a lot of characters you can use on your journeys. They all have unique characteristics and they are all interesting to play with. Depending on your preferred style of playing (aggressive, peaceful ...), you can choose different characters that fit you the most. After playing a certain number of rounds with each character, you may also pick they as the captain of your expedition crew. Exploring | Exploring is so fun in this game! There are always interesting decisions to make and uncovering secrets is always super fun. Friendliness | This game is extremely friendly to new players. When you start playing, you are served with a lot of tutorials, in-depth explanations and as soon as you're done with those, there are rarely any things left that you wouldn't understand. You don't need to spend multiple hours learning what on Earth should you even be doing, instead, you can just enjoy the game itself. Support | This game is still receiving a lot of support from the developer, including patches, added content and much more. SteamOS + MacOS Support | You can explore and reach fame on all three major operating systems. You can't run it on your ironing board, though.Cons: Luck-based Gameplay | How most actions end depends on your luck. You can help you chances by using characters with best skills for certain actions, but I think that luck still plays too big of a role. Sure, it's exciting to see the wheel spinning and waiting to see if you're in luck or not, but I guess more things should depend on player's skill. Difficulty | I sometimes feel like some battles are a bit too hard, but I guess that improves later on when you get better. It's not a big issue.The final verdict:Overall, this game is extremely fun and good-looking. It has a lot of replayability value and, so you should be good for many hours. It's quite easy to start in this game as it has an excellent tutorial that teaches you everything you need to know to get started. Although I think that luck is too influential, it's not a major problem.If you're looking for a fun exploration game, this is most certainly the game for you. If not for the full price, definitely consider buying it when it's discounted.With love,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.---No drama, Just Reviews. "

 Target Audience:   Strategy fnas. Also, those wanting to be strategy fans. Summary: Board game lovers and traditional strategy game lovers will find enjoyment out of Renowned Explorers: International Society in more ways then one. Good balance and variety will allow for gameplay that has surprising depth despite it being very simple on the surface with its Rock, Paper, Scissors mechanics. The presentation works to a certain extent and the ability to customize your party and create different adventures is fun, especially if you get into your own immersion of giving the characters backstories on what has happened. Reasonable writing combined with gameplay you'll want to come back to makes a game that I really wish had a multiplayer element to it, but still works never the less.

			Board game lovers and traditional strategy game lovers will find enjoyment out of Renowned Explorers: International Society in more ways then one.		

 Lists: +: Addictive Strategy gameplay that's simple on the surface, but very complicated under the surface. Risk/Reward system is straight forward but makes you interested in those risks enough to go after them, but not overly powerful to give you too much of a boost. Like the twist on RPS mechanics with the mood system that can flip it on its head. Emotion system adds to the game and strategy and is easy enough for beginners to learn, but takes a while to master.  Emotions system is awesome. Adds a lot of depth in battle. RPG mechanics allows for a lot of paths and a lot of replayability.  Character designs are neat, and constructing a team of an old lady, a luchadora, and a magician was always appreciated.  Presentation on the surface works in terms of creating a world that you truly feel like an explorer in.  Straight forward choices with luck mechanics feels fair, balanced, and doesn't frustrate.  Developers kept on adding content over time. Dedicated. -: Really wish there was a multiplayer element, because I felt like it would have really taken it to the next level in terms of a purchase. Trailer characterization of in-game characters doesn't play off in game like that, which is disappointing, as that's what drove me to it. I recognize that may have been hard to really do, but it is still disappointing in the end. Some more information could be more easily accessible when it comes down to it. "

												A fantastic rogue-lite strategy game that's oozing with polish and charm.  To top it all off, the post-launch support for the game has been fantastic and there's even free content on the way.  I'm a huge fan of rogue-lites in general, and this is one of the best I've played in a while. Highly recommended to anyone who's a fan of FTL or similar style games.			"

Posted: February 14
												Renowned Explorers (RE) is my kind of game:  quirky, unique, slow-paced, easy to snack on, and just variable enough to motivate repeated plays.  Which is not to say it's without some flaws.RE defies categorization.  You'll see it described as a ""rogue-like"" but I think that's a misnomer.  It certainly doesn't feel like one to me.  There's greater characterization and better narrative, and you have a distinct goal (win-condition) beyond just surviving for as long as possible.  Rather, it reminds me of big, theme-heavy adventure-RPG boardgames like Arkham/Eldritch Horror, Runebound, Fortune & Glory, etc.  Collect a party of heroes with different skill-sets, send them to unique locales where they will face challenges (i.e., skill checks) and gain experience & loot.  Then, level them up, buy better equipment, and set out for a tougher but more rewarding expedition.  GIven that I love boardgames, it's perhaps not surprising that I quite like RE.  For brevity's sake, here's my quick list of pros and cons...Pros:1.  The length of a single ""campaign"" feels just right to me.  In order to win, you need to complete 5 expeditions - with the additional goal of accruing enough Renown to rank higher than all your competitors.  In actual playtime, this can take you around 1-3 hours (depending on how leisurely you are about shopping).  That's perfect for a relaxing Saturday morning with a cup of coffee.2.  There's a nice ebb and flow to RE.  You go on an expedition, which will involve ~7-15 ""encounters"" - some of which are battles and some of which are skill-checks.  You'll win most of your skill checks, but there's enough chance for failure that it's still tense when the RNG kicks in.  Combat is interesting and maybe a little muddled (more on that below), but you'll have only a few battles per expedition and, again, that feels just right.  Once the expedition is over, you fly back to London to spend research points, buy better equipment for your crew, and gather an entourage (which boost your ability to collect resources).  The back and forth between exploring and leveling feels great.3.  There's a fantastic selection of characters to choose from, and it's here where a lot of the replayability in RE comes from.  There are different classes that comes with different starting skills (scientists, scouts, etc.).  There are glass cannons and tanks and everything in between.  You'll want to try another run-through with an entirely different cast.  And these crews will largely determine how you approach combat:  with friendly diplomacy, devious emotional manipulation, or outright violence.  Once you learn the systems of the game, you can start seeing synergies and possible strategies (e.g., choose 3 characters with the ability to terrify and unlock the research tree that enhances the power of terror). 4.  The difficulty seems tuned just right.  It's tough to win a campaign, but not so tough that you're discouraged and wondering if the designers are sadists.  It took me 3 play-throughs to win my first campaign on the ""classic"" (hard) difficulty.  It felt good winning and I thought that I had made a lot of solid decisions that helped me get that far.  After 15 hours of play, you'll be able to win most of the time unless you take big risks to try and max your renown.Cons:1. There's maybe not enough variability in the expeditions themselves.  I'm already a little tired of seeing the same locations and fighting the same bosses.  This game will really benefit from DLC and mini-content updates.2.  There's definitely not enough variability in the equipment.  I was disappointed to discover that shops always carry the same stuff, and it never varies between games.  That seems like a missed opportunity to make every run-through feel different.  As it is, I'm already finding myself gravitating towards the same items/build-order on each playthrough.3.  The combat is opaque at first - and once you discover how it works, I'm not sure if the added complexity is worth the price of admission.  It all depends on whether you're looking for another position-based tactical game (X-COM, etc.) or whether you're willing to try something new.  There's less emphasis on positioning and % hit-rate, and much more emphasis on trying to maximize damage output via manipulation of the innovative emotion system.  On your first couple playthroughs, you'll be largely confused about the variety of effects and modifiers - but if you persist, the tactical layers reveal themselves in a very satisfying fashion.Overall, I strongly recommend the game.  A great mix of adventure-RPG-tactical gameplay.  One of my favorite gaming experiences of the year so far.			"

												Renowned Explorers: International Society is one of the most innovative turn based tactical game that I have ever played. You create a team of three explorers from an impressive roster of twenty. With that team, you go on semi-randomized expeditions to explore. The rewards you get depends on your team's talents.Combat in this game is fantastic. At first glance, it deceives you into thinking it's another tactical hex grid turn based combat. As you learn more, you will realize the combat involves multiple layers of strategy. It rewards skills and forward thinking. If you plan your moves ahead, you can put yourself into great positions. However, one fatal mistake can immediately punish you.After each expedition, using the rewards you recieved from your adventures, you can upgrade your team's equipments, research to gain bonuses, or hire an entourage of people to increase rewards for the future.All of these intricate mechanics are tied together wonderfully with a storytelling process that fits naturally. Your journey is presented with brilliant artworks, animations, along with clever writings to bring the world and characters to life.If you are interested in adventures, rogue-lite RPGs, turn based tactics or management simulations, this game should be right in your radar for your next purchase.

												Ok guys and gals, masterpiece !This is one of the best game you'll find out there : many ways to play, rogue-like/rpg elements, Indiana Jones atmosphere and many archeology/ crypto-archeology themes. So many things to do and to discover !Not two playthroughts are the same, and the events are really fun. The combats are GREAT and possess a very unique gameplay (attacks can altere the mood of your crew/opponents, and damages can be as much physical than psychological, as you can play from a ""friendly"" crew which will be friends with vampires to cruel one killing sheeps).If you love that kind of game, you will love it. There is many difficulties and the game is really challenging. There is a free DLC coming this month. The admins are nice and listening to the players...What do you want more ? :o			"

 Almost, but not quite.I really wanted to like this game...Roguelight? CheckNice visual style? CheckInteresting theme? CheckSounds promising right? Unfortunately I feel like Renowned Explorers is a case of almost but not quite, all of the elements of a great roguelike are here but it falls short in a number of different areas that ultimately resulted in the game leaving a sour taste in my mouth.I think my biggest issue with the game is the severe lack of content available to play with at the moment, in one playthrough you can visit the vast majority of explorable areas in one playthrough. The areas themselves are basically the same each playthrough except for a few minor RNG differnces. Seeing as one playthrough lasts for at most just under three hours there really isn't a lot to keep you coming back for more.If the game was in early access or in open beta this might be excusable but with only one new piece of DLC available since it's ""full release"" I could never reccomened this game at full price and would do so cautiously when it is on sale.My second issue with the game is that I feel it's a little to RNG heavy. I like a little randomness in my games as the next person but this game turns it up to eleven... the vast majority of your overworld interactions are going to be decided on the roll of a dice, and even the combat has fixed %chance to hit for some abilities. It's incredibly frustating to be completing the final expedition only for a 5% dice role to take away two resolve (basically life in this game) and end your playthrough.Renowned explorers does have a few interesting and well executed ideas though, for one thing whenever you click on a decision on the map with a percentage chance instead of just resolving, it brings up a spinner wheel. The simple addition of this spinner wheel adds a lot of tension into what is usually quite a mundane part of rougelikes. Another thing I thought was relatively well executed was the emotion combat system, which basically gave stat buffs or debuffs depending on how you chose to handle the encounter wether it be peacefully, deviously or agressively. This had it's own problems however, as to min-max in this game you basically have to optimise your encounters to one particular mood to get consistent benefits. I enjoyed my first couple of playthroughs of this game, but after I started to understand the game more and progress I became increasingly frustrated with the amount of luck compared to skill especially for someone not amasingly skilled at roguelikes. Overall I guess that's my overall opinion of this game, if you like the theme of this game and are really good at roguelikes and don't mind heavy RNG elements, great. For everyone else, go back to FTL or Dungeons of Dreadmore.			"

												Part strategy, part adventure, part hex grid turn-based combat Renowned Explorers gives you control of three adventures of your choosing as you tackle expeditions around the world trying to be recognized as the best explorer in the International Society.The aforementioned mix of genres works quite well and makes Renowned Explorers a good game with lots to offer despite its lacking tutorial and somewhat repetitive nature.PROS:-nice comic book graphics-it's a pretty lighthearted game with funny encounters and dialogues-a good selection of different explorers with specializations and skills-light RPG elements (level up bonuses, equipment slots) help you develop your group as you see fit-procedurally generated levels help replay value-simple to learn but hard to master gameplay mechanics-several difficulty levels to choose from can give you a more relaxed or truly roguelike experience-if you like the genre and trying new adventuring groups you'll find a good amount of replay valueCONS:-the tutorial is ok when explaining the basic mechanics but fails to explain others properly leaving you trying to learn how some things work by trial and error-while they are procedurally generated there isn't a huge amount of different expeditions to choose from, so it can feel repetitive after a while-some difficulty spikes, especially around bosses

A Screenshot of Renowned Explorers: International Society
By: stranger1982




Renowned Explorers was a bit hard for me at the beginning, the tutorial leaves you a bit stranded and it took a bit to properly understand how the various moods/ actions worked during combat, its rock paper scissors take on strategic fights can feel overwhelming at first and you'll either need to try (and fail) a few times or read some guides before you're comfortable with it: the same goes for its somewhat intricate token system that represents the resources gathered from each expedition and how it interacts with your entourage choices.Once you're comfortable with it the game is truly fun and provides a good challenge, the fact you can choose a balanced team or one leaning more towards a certain interaction style ( aggressive, devious or friendly) will let you try different explorers to see how they do when faced with certain challenges and bosses: all things considered Renowned Explorers feels like a solo boardgame with somewhat complex but well oiled mechanics, one that rewards a deep knowledge of its design while giving you a good amount of freedom in how you decide to face its challenges.You can expect a few difficult encounters though, some bosses can especially be a bit aggravating due to their abilities or a constant stream of reinforcements, and if your team is weak against a certain opponent's attacks you'll have an even worse chance of winning: the other problem I see in the game is that the number of expeditions is somewhat limited, while the levels are randomly generated the enemies within and final bosses will largely stay the same so things can feel a bit too same-ish after a few playthroughs. I'd also point out that there's no persistent bonuses or character growth so each playthrough starts as a clean slate, this will be ok for some but others will be disappointed you have nothing to show or gain from your past adventures.All things considered Renowned Explorers is a very good game and an easy recommendation for lovers of the genre that don't mind taking the time to learn its mechanics and its reliance on repeated playthroughs.

												I can't believe I'm saying it.But Renowed Explorers: International Society has been the game I've had the most joy of playing since Fallout: New Vegas, Skyrim, and Civilization V.It is tied for my favorite turn-based game with Civ 5.And is tied for my favorite strategy game with Civ 5 and FTL.There's so much charm.There's so many easy understandable mechanics.There's so much replayability.There's so much good content in general.It's a pleasure to play.The vanilla game falls only a SMALL bit short of perfection for me, but More to Explore fixes it.This is one of my favorite games in my Steam library.I have over 70 games.And this is in my top 5.I sold my buds in TF2 and 2 csgo skins for this game and it was 100% worth it.

												I find Renowned Explorers a fun and charming little game.  I reccomend it with reservations.The animation is well done.  The world is also fleshed out nicely and each level has a unique character.  It should be enjoyable for anyone who wants to lead their own ""league of extraordinary gentlemen"" on a treasure hunt.Now the reservations.  There are far too few levels.  I think that will harm the replay value of the game.  Also, there should be a manual or something, because there are many in game perks that are not defined.As of the first release, there are a few very minor bugs regarding the interface that will no doubt be fixed in the patch.

												This is a very charming game. The somewhat simplistic graphics lend themselves very well in representing a colourful world in which the characters and enemies don't face off only with brute force, but also by expressing and manipulating emotions and moods. If you've already heard about Renowned Explorers, you surely know about its peculiar fighting system, which is definitely one of the strong suits of the game.The exploration consists of a pleasant ""beacon based"" map similar to FTL, in which you can respond to the myriad of different events according to your personal preference, the abilities and perks of your characters, and even their personality and your previous choices earlier in the playthrough.The longevity is also very decent: the combinations of team composition and the ways you can choose to approach the playthrough are various and all valid and different enough to not bore you even after multiple tries.It's a very unique experience that I recommend to both entry-level and dedicated RPG/tactics games players. Don't let the simple-looking graphics deceive you.			"

												A very fun game, good to waste some time on but there are some caveats.The game is well built and the ui is easy to navigate for the most part, I myself only ran into some troubles when trying to pick new skills for characters but once figured out there are no issues. The Tutorial is simply great and allows you to get to know the game and explains everything extremely well. Gameplay is solid and certainly different than other games, which is a big plus. See it as a bit of settlers of catan, where you need to earn resources in order to win the game. Tie this in with a bit of D&D and you get this game.I PERSONALLY got tired of the game pretty quickly, this is because I am not a completionist, once I have seen something once I have little desire to visit it again, so if you are like me consider waiting for a sale as the full price might not be worth it. The game CAN be completed in as little as an hour to a couple of hours depending on the difficulty you set it on. There are about 8 ""Maps"" that you can play on and without the DLC that adds 2 more there is not a lot of variance in the game. The only variance is the different runs you do on the same maps over and over by only changing characters, this is what I didnt enjoy myself. If you are someone that likes to collect achievements, unlock all of the characters or visist 100% of evey map I can easily tell you that over 100 hours of fun await you in this game.TLDR:In the end I would definately recommend this game, If you are someone that doesnt like replaying games wait for a sale, are you a completionist this game is an absolute steal even for its current price.

												The game has so much good (and potential) in it, that it almost hurts to not recommend it. But basically the game falls down in one crucial area: The combat. The combat that was supposed to be the one thing that gives the game it's edge. Despite all the hype, the combat isn't as complicated as one would think at first. Whenever I see an incoming combat on the map, my first reaction is the save and quit. The combat is too sluggish and takes too long, not to mention several other things I personally disliked, but are irrelevant here. And the system of different attack types isn't as good as advertised.And the maps are always the same. Period. ""Procedurally generated"" IS a straight out lie. The maps are always the same, that always have the same key places in them. Some less meaningful places change places and content, but those things are too irrelevant to matter.Character customisation is almost non-existent. You may be able to buy a few items for your team here and there, but they really don't seem to matter all that much. Buying items for the tank is pointless, since all the enemies (almost) always spawns around your team and they always ignore the tank completely and run straight at your glasscannons. And buying more dmg for these glasscannons is pointless, because then bosses will one hit them.The game has one of the best, if not the best in-game manuals that I ever rememeber seeing (which is awesome, since I hate browsing through wikis to be able to play a game). And as I originally said, the game has so much good things going in it, but they all become irrelevant when the combat takes all the fun out of it.The negative tone here is probably due to me not being the correct audience for the game, at least considering the amount of positive reviews it has (I bought this after playing FTL, I'm guessing I was expecting a bit too much).

												This is a really solid game. When I first started playing, I thought it was going to be a pretty simple experience but was proven wrong pretty quickly.Combat has several levels of depth and I discovered that not paying attention to the mood of the combat will quickly turn things against you as you progress.  This is a good game.  You should buy it.			"

												Update after 50+ hours: Everything's perfect now! 10/10---------------------------Renowned Explorers (short: RE)Genre: adventure, exploration, board game, resource management, survival..._________________________I have to start the review with this disclaimer: I started gaming in the 1980s and I was utterly repelled by the graphics of RE. It has this nasty tablet game vibe and feels like it's catering to stupid kids, not even smart kids but plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children. Oh boy, can looks be deceiving! This game is so incredibly mature and deep while still being highly accessible.--------------Gameplay:RE is a rare genre-mix and feels like an Indiana Jones movie. You select a team with 1 leader and 2 sidekicks out of 20 unique characters from four categories (scientist, scout, fighter, speaker).This gives you the total number of possible combinations: (20!) / ((20-17)! * 3!) = 1140 party combinations!Then you pick between normal mode and the much better ""iron man"" mode. It's how every game of this kind should be played, no reloading. Once you're dead, you're dead. One playthrough only lasts a few hours anyways. In iron man mode it's much more tense and fun! Then you pick one out of 4 difficulty modes. Hint: always play iron man, just pick a lower difficulty setting if you want!Once you have assembled your party, you will have 5 expeditions for your claim to fame. Every expedition takes you to a beautiful place around the globe. This is where the board game aspect kicks in. You move across the map from node to node with limited supplies (each node costs 1 supply). Each node offers different benefits. Sometimes you will get encounters. An encounter plays out on a hex based battle field. This is where the game becomes really complex.Encounters can be resolved in three ways: peaceful, devious, aggressive.There is a rock-paper-scissor element to it, but it goes much deeper. Based on your team's skills and the opponent, there are many possible ways to solve an encounter. You can pistol-whip everything, you can charm your opponent or you can backstab them. Really cool stuff and really clever. Each expedition ends with a boss fight. Once that is mastered you return to the world map where the resource management unfolds. You can invest in research, items, entourage... again numerous choices, again very complex.At the end of 5 expeditions (if you're still alive by then!) you get your final score. The devs are planning an online highscore list. The current limitation to 5 expeditions has been critiziced by some people, but let me say two things about that:1. the devs already announced longer game modes for future patches2. the idea behind the game is that each playthrough lasts only a few hours and the emphasis is on replay value with different teams (remember: 1140 different combinations!). After all you're unlocking new captains by playing the game. This is exactly what made FTL (Faster Than Light) such a modern classic. Quick playthroughs and a lot of incentive to start over.-------------Technical aspect:Graphics are very good, but annoyingly childish (fake Disney-look). I don't like the over-the-top comical style, but objectively they are executed flawlessly.Sound is okay, but nothing special. I turned off the music quickly, but I do that in every game.The real beauty is the programming. So many Indie games suffer from poor to mediocre programming and you can tell immediately. Be it CTDs, clumsy interfaces and plain poor controls... RE truly shines here. This game is a smooth as any 200 million dollar production can be. Wonderful design and implementation. It's just a pleasure to play. __________________Summary:Very complex, yet easily accessible game. The looks are deceiving. It's a true PC game that looks like tablet garbage.Highly recommended for everyone... I can't think of a single person who wouldn't enjoy this one.My biggest gripe (the cartoonish look) isn't even a real con. If you hate that like me, first thing you should do: turn off the action camera.Rating: 9.5/10---------------------------------------Update: 23.09.201511 hours and 5 campaigns (iron man, normal difficulty) thus far. I won 3 and lost 2 campaigns.Still extremely high fun factor. The replay value is enormous thanks to the sheer endless possible combinations of characters. I lost my first campaign with an all-out scientist crew. That emphasizes how important a versatile crew is.One issue is beginning to bother me now. The number of expeditions is too low. It should take more than 11 hours to have seen everything. The devs announced 1 more free expedition and more to come via DLC. Depending on the price that can be good or bad.I would recommend to deliver 1-2 more free expeditions before moving on to DLC. The lack of content has been a major negative point in many reviews I've read and I have to agree with that.For a $20+ game you should expect a bit more content.This leads to a slight devaluation of my rating.Rating: 9.0/10---------------------------------Update: 15.10.2015A brand new free DLC-expedition set in Mali will be released next week. This kind of post-launch support is highly commendable!Rating: 9.5/10--------------------------------------------Update: 12.11.2015Picked up the game after a long time. The devs have been extraordinarily active constantly improving the game. You can tell how much they love their product. Some characters used to be weak, they found perfect solutions for that. Every minor gripe I had is solved by now. Hell, I even love the graphics now. The tablet look put my old 1980s gamer genes off for quite a while, but I got used to it and finally see beauty in those loveable characters.This game is absolutely fabulous now. I doubled my total playing time in this week alone. I'm hopelessly addicted now. For the first time ever I will rate a game with the highest possible score.Rating: 10/10			"

												Ancient Mayan ruins, dark mysterious caves, hidden holy relics, buried treasure, what do all these have in common? Adventure! If you are fan of Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider, then Renowned Explorers is a game you're going to love. You will form a crew of dashing and clever adventurers and set out on a journey to become internationally famous. All that stands in your way is pirates, mummies, forgotten horrors, and other explorers. The game itself is broken up into three phases, planning, adventure, and occasional combat. Planning is where you gather your resources and research. Adventure is where you will face all sorts of random challenges and possible dangers. Combat itself is a battle of wits, brawn or hugs. Yes, I said hugs. You can be so friendly that they die. Renowned Explorers does quite a bit of genre blending, incorporation turned based strategy with RPG/adventure elements. The entire game has a wonderful style and theme. Making you feel like your adventuring throughout the world. This is what drew me in and I wanted more of. One thing that is important to note though is that the game is based on replay. You only have 5 adventures before you either win or lose, and start over again with a new crew of adventurers. So don't go getting too attached to your precious loot. So get your whip and fedora ready, it's time for an adventure!I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												I have been keeping an eye of for this game and immediately got my hands on it at launch, and I'm definitely impressed by and really enjoying the game so far.This game is a worthy spiritual successor towards cult classics XCOM and FTL. Beautiful trademark hand-drawn graphics, surprisingly deep tactical gameplay, rich and thoughtful strategic decisions to make, and a fantastic setting and story really sets this apart from other similar games in this genre. What makes RE:IS amazing is how creatively and seamlessly it combines different elements into one smooth gameplay.Easily an indie strategy Game of the Year serious contender!			"

												Like this studio's earlier game Reus, Renowned Explorers is a very unique design that isn't quite like any other game out there. Connoisseurs might detect a dash of XCom and Civ 5, but RE deftly incorporates these ""flavours"" into its own without the effect feeling derivative. Highly attractive and charming presentation, smart design, deep game systems, challenging encounters that reward mastery of these systems, put together with roguelike characteristics like map randomization and an Ironman save structure, and you've got a winner on your hands.Edit: I would like to briefly add that recent updates have smoothed out the previously mentioned difficulty spikes in a very satisfactory way. The game is now a true gem I would not hesitate to warmly recommend to anyone interested in turn-based tactical games or adventure roguelikes. Pick this one up!There are currently some issues with game balance in the boss encounters, but the developers have communicated they're aware of them, and plan to support and expand the game in the future. So yes, even with this cloud in an otherwise clear sky, I would venture to warmly recommend this game. "

 a must have  for adventurers!Very interesting game, that offers quite decent replayability. Everytime you start you can choose different locations and even if you go to the same place, there is still much to be discovered. I think it was designed on purpose in a very elegant way, to keep players engaged and interested.Before I bought the game I've heard it's way too hard. Because I like challenges I was glad. My first explorers team managed to get to the last expedition, so I thought it's easy. It's not. I was just lucky. My next 4 expeditions failed quickly.Mood system is very clever and cracking how it works feels very rewarding.  Graphics and OST come together well, creating happy-go-lucky atmosphere. It also creates an elusive feeling that playing the game is like plain sailing. My only concern is no color blind support, cause sometimes i get confused. What is more, there should be a quick REDO button, like available only 5 seconds after you move, because it happens too often that you click not on purpose and move your char.I really enjoy RE:IS,  and I am looking forward to some expanding patches/dlcs with more stories and locations. Who knows mby sort of a multiplayer experience? "

I love the writing, the quality of the gameplay, and scope for replay.The mood encounter system is innovative and I'm excited about learning more about the game.How many games let you beat the devious mobsters by being friendly (effectively persuading them that your cause is better) before finding a dinosaur fossil?Highly recommended!

												I'm not here to say much, just give my fullest recommendation to the game. Everything has been said so far, you can read up on that elsewhere or watch the according videos. I had a blast playing and I hope there's going to be more DLC, more achievements, more depth because the 70 hours I've played id and dryed it out for content in the meantime doesn't feel like enough. Worth the asking price by far and I hope this doesn't get bundled too soon (or ever)Also, for additional challenges, over 1 year after relese the community and devs keep the game alive with challenges, fan-fiction and new content on the way.

												This game was the gem of the previous Steam Sale for me. You know, that game you take a chance on and end up playing more than anything else you bought?Part boardgame, part party management RPG, part tactical strategy, part (optional) roguelike, and all of these elements (which mesh extremely well) wrapped in a charming and effective artstyle with clever writing. Your combat and adventure approaches will be dictated by your party makeup, which is chosen prior to the start of the game from a variety of options. Depending on the skills of each, your approach will differ each game, making for a highly replayable game. Want to seduce every enemy that comes your way instead of shooting/ clubbing them? There are options for that. This game also has a large and diverse set of achievements, which I personally like.I also recommend the expansion, but if you want to test the base game first you can always add it for an additional playthrough (which you will want to have several of just to see the additional content.) This one is worth taking a risk on, even at full price.			"

The player takes on the role of intrepid explorers and go on adventures all over the world from Scottish isles to Shambala. The game combines semi-random stories and addictive turn based strategy. Each expedition has quite a few interesting story lines and the random mechanics change the game play quite a bit every time you play it. Lots of replay value.			"

Posted: September 9, 2015
												I've gone through a whole range of emotions with this game. Started out loving it; it's charming, quirky and deeply engaging. Then I got wiped out several times by seemingly impossibly encounters, and became disheartened. Yes, boss fights can be horrible, and the RNG can be your worst enemy. But I stuck with it, and gradually learned how to be better at it. I've had a lot of fun trying different combinations of crew members and figuring out when to take risks, when to play safe, how to prepare the crew in between adventures and plan ahead, and how to be more effective in encounters.There was a time that I found level 3 expeditions impossible, but I improved. There was a time I thought Shangri-la - the level 5 expedition - was literally impossible. It didn't matter; you can play the game to its conclusion and even 'win' without going there. But I finally beat it for the first time tonight - with a little luck along the way to be sure, but also because after 40+ hours of play I eventually had a fair idea of what I was doing. That moment when I beat the final boss after systematically defeating each of his annoying lieutenants was one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I've had for a very long time.The game isn't perfect, there are a few minor bugs (mainly missing or incorrect text in a few places), some things that could be better explained, and I'd like some of the randomness to be toned down a little. Though, not too much, as it helps make each playthrough unique and not too predictable. But for the most part I love this game. It's a great idea, immersive and fun, and rewards putting in the effort to really learn how it works. I can't wait for new expedition maps to be released, however even without them I feel as though there's still a lot to do. There are plenty of treasures I haven't yet found, different crew combinations to try out, and I'm looking forward to many more playthroughs to come.Definitely recommended.			"

												Renowned Explorers: International Society is a humorous choose your own adventure style strategy game with rogue-like and RPG elements such as inventory management, turn based combat, dialogue choices, and unique character upgrades/skill trees. The game is set in a vibrant and quirky version of the late 19th century where both magic and quasi-steampunk technology abound, making for an incredibly colorful and interesting world full of weird and wonderful people and places to discover. It is well written, thoroughly enjoyable to play, and suitable for all ages.The goal of the game is to achieve the title of ""Most Renowned Explorer"" by assembling a team of intrepid adventurers for the purpose of collecting treasures from various exotic locations around the globe. Each location has its own set of mysteries and treasures to uncover, and every character has his or her own individual backstory and unique personality that can affect their synergy with other characters, your interactions with the environment, and thus your overall chances of success. The team you choose and the decisions you make along the way will determine whether or not you rise to unprecendented heights of fame and glory, or fade into total obscurity... or worse.The game also features an innovative turn-based combat system that incorporates emotion and mood into the tactical gameplay, allowing for battles to be resolved peacefully as well as by the usual violent means. The result is a 'rock, paper, scissors' style element to fighting that adds quite a lot more depth to combat than the standard RPG fare of merely switching between physical attacks and magic attacks. Choosing to resolve certain conflicts with a particular method can even unlock new dialogue and treasure-hunting opportunities, which makes having to choose between a well rounded team and a highly specialized one all the more compelling.In conclusion, I highly recommend this title to anyone looking for a truly one of a kind, lighthearted, and endlessly replayable adventure/resource management/strategy game in the spirit of FTL: Faster Than Light or Reus. An instant classic, in my opinion, and one made even better with the addition of the DLC. 10/10 P.S. If you do purchase the game, be sure to check out the weekly challenges hosted on the RE:IS Steam forum for fun stories, friendly competition and lots of extra replay value! :)			"

												An amazing combination of RPG, tactical, and rogue-like elements all spun together with a unique and completely unexpected charm. Instead of writing a giant essay of a review, I'll just tell you that if the gameplay from the store page looks even a little interesting, then buy it. If not now, then at the next Steam Sale; you won't regret giving it a chance.My one complaint would be the low location count. The number in at the time of this review (8 choices) is perfectly fine for several playthroughs, but there are so many things that I want to try in this game that as I explore those other aspects, these maps start to feel too familiar. Hopefully there is DLC coming to fix this - I would buy it in a heartbeat.			"

												This game is a rogue-lite/strategy/tactics/choose-your-own-adventure game. You pretty much pick a group of 3 explorers ( They give you like 25 to choose from ), then you go exploring on a map with many locations on it. You make a lot of choices during your exploration and you occasionally will fight things. It has a pretty cool and unique battle system and the battles don't ever drag on for too long. You also don't have to play this game as a rogue-lite if you don't want to, as there are ways to lose and continue on if you so desire. However, if you are looking for a long one time playthrough type of game, this isn't one. This game is meant to be played multiple times.			"

												I seduced a nun, got spat on by a llama, fought Charles Darwin riding a dinosaur, and made grown men cry. 1000/10But if you need more of a reason to buy this game, here's the breakdown: you play as a group of explorers, traveling the world, earning status and money while doing research, collecting treasures, and all around making a nuisance of yourself. It's a turn-based strategy game with a really interesting mechanic: moods and attitudes. Each side of the battle (you vs. them) each have one of three attitudes (friendly, devious and aggressive), and the combination of your attitude and the enemy's creates an overall mood (ex. hostile = both parties aggressive or persuasive = you friendly and them devious). Each mood has bonuses or penalties, and there's a rock-paper-scissors system so you know which way to shift your attitude to get the bonuses and avoid the penalties. (Friendly beats devious, devious beats aggressive, aggressive beats friendly.) You win battles with your built-in powers. There is some overlap between characters on the powers, but not a lot. There are area attacks, line attacks, and single-target attacks, and by default every character has one attack from each attitude, plus some bonus ones that fit their own personal strengths and personalities. (Yes, seduce is an attack you can actually use, and no, it's not gender specific). It's good for all kinds of different playstyles.But that's just the battles! The other main part of the game is exploring. You have 5 expeditions to a campaign (you can do more after that, but most of the achievements are turned off for anything past 5). Each expedition puts you on an island with tons of people to interact with, and depending on which three characters you have in your party, the outcomes can change. Ex. If you don't have a character with a high enough level in archaeology you won't find a really cool thingamajig, or there is one boss I didn't even realize I hadn't actually faced because I couldn't get past the skill checks to fight him. The options are basically things like ""This person needs food. Help this person out (Lose 1 supplies. Reward: Gain status)"" or ""Help them out, but for a price (Lose 1 supplies. Reward: Gain 1 Collect)"" or ""Don't help them and move on."" You can also do things like punch people in the face and start a fight, decide which people to send on supply runs, whether to skip a fight at the cost of supplies, etc. Your choices often require a spin of a chance wheel, with your various applicable skills increasing your percentage chance. Certain islands/areas that you travel to will have research, money, or status collectibles, each of which will help your party gain renown and come out on top in the eyes of the Renowned Explorer: International Society and beat your rival. There are also treasures you collect, which have special one-time or permanent bonuses (if you get the DLC you get to choose the bonuses from a list), which add to your renown.There are also a ton of difficulty levels: easy, normal, classic, and impossible. Easy might make the battles easier, but I've still died plenty of times, and after 100 hours of play (including the DLC), I still haven't found all the treasures. In addition to the difficulty, there are two ways to play: Discovery mode (where you can restart a battle if you kill your party or run out of ""resolve,"" which you can also collect), and Adventure mode, which makes it more like a Roguelike with no restarts. There are also TONS of achievements for both modes, and there are 20 achievement for winning the game with each of 20 characters in any mode and then 20 more for doing it with each of them in adventure mode, so there's going to be a lot of replays if you want to go to 100%.Overall:Pros:+Great art.+Adaptive music. Much of the music repeats, but it's adaptive, and will become more aggressive when the mood changes or more laid back when the mood drops back to more friendly terms.+ TONS of depth. Playing with just one different character in your party can open up new avenues for the same interaction. Finishing a battle with a different attitude can give you different treasures, or open up new avenues of exploration like hints to hidden treasure.+ Skill upgrades. Each character comes with a few built-in skills, which you can upgrade. Your character can be super amazing at one skill, or multi-talented in a bunch.+ Items to purchase! Items give attack bonuses, defense, or additional skills. You have to upgrade shops with money to get better items, but items come with really good bonuses or tons of extra skills.+ Entourages. You can spend status points to gain helpers and specialists who give you bonuses in research, collect, and status.+ Research trees! Spend research points to collect renown faster, get bonuses for ending battles with a certain attitude, get extra skills, etc.+ Unique characters! 4 classes, 5 different characters in each class, all with different weapons, behaviors, skills, homelands, an designs. No photocopied characters here. There's even more background to them in the DLC. Personality traits even affect your choices in interactions. Ex. A greedy character in your party will, in one case, go back for more treasure and decrease your chance to escape through a closing tomb door in time.+ Your choices matter! You can only go on 5 expeditions. The first one is chosen at random, then you have your choice of 2-3 new expeditions, then after that one you have 2-3 additional choices, etc. So although there are a limited number of choices, you can decide whether to play it safe and explore only easy islands, or go for the big rewards and go for the hardest ones. Some of the expeditions are suited to different types of parties or attitudes (aggressive, devious or aggressive), or they may be tempting because they are high in money, or research, or status. Once you're on an island, you have a limited amount of supplies, so you can't search everywhere for treasure without getting serious penalties for the boss battle. Luckily, each spot is labeled with all the possible types of events that could happen there, so you have a hint of what may come, and can plan your route accordingly.+ DLC is great. There should be another one coming out eventually, but the current one has two new expeditions (with tons of treasures and new mechanics, plus Charles Darwin riding a raptor). There are also collectible campfire stories to get more bonuses, skills, and backstory for your crew. These campfire stories do make it easier to beat the game without dying quite so much.+ Great sound design. Characters don't talk, but they do make Sims-esque, barely intelligble noises during battle that are great.+ TONS of achievements.+ Interesting fight mechanics (see earlier)Neutral:~ Great variety of difficulty settings, but even easy is not free of death or total party death.~ Some people might get bored by the lack of a long campaign. Just 5 expeditions and the game is *basically* over and you have to restart, and there aren't a ton of different exhibitions. I've played 117 hours thus far, so it doesn't bother me.~ A lot of reading. It's nice that you can cycle through it really fast, and it has great flavor to it, and sometimes hints as to what choice to make for which outcome, but I skip it most of the time and just look at the choices. It often means missing vital information.Cons:- You can't move after you attack? What the hell?You will collect a metric sh*t-ton of stuff. You will murder friendly sheep. You will slap people. Dinosaurs will wiggle their butts at you in taunting. Scotsmen will punch you. You can die via friendly thumbs-up. Just play this game. It is fun. It will make you smile. If it doesn't, you are dead inside.			"

												I'm no star at writing reviews, so I'll keep it fairly short.This game is fun.Too short?Okay.This game is lots of fun.But seriously. I really enjoy(ed) this game. The aim is to become the Most Renowned Explorer...well duh.You do this by collecting treasures, gaining Fame, Fortune, or Scientific discoveries, and kicking bottom.You travel across a map that is slowly uncovered as you go along, and fight in turnbased battles, or beat the odds by spinning a wheel, until you reach the final destination. Once you have conquered whatever it is that waits at the end of every expedition you get to spend what you found, improve your character, add helpers to your team, and get ready for the next expedition.Slowly you'll become stronger, and you might just become...duh.I love the style of the game, it's nice and crisp and colorful.The battles don't take too long, and the map will have you thinking where to go next instead of just blazing through.There's plenty of gear and stuff to fiddle with if you want to micro-manage everything, or just click, click, click and go!So is there anything bad I have to say about the game?Sure!My friends all have higher scores than me...but they had the game long before me, I think the scoring changed so I'll have a hard time beating them...or I just suck...Highly recommended game, you don't need me to tell you that, but hey, you read all my ""nonsense"" anyway.Cheers!

												One of my favorite Steam Games. What is it?Renowned Explorers is a glorified board game. There are plenty of BoardGames that currently have a large amount of these mechanics, that this game has. The only difference is the computer tracks all the information, no 1+ hour worth of setting up the game, no need to do a ton of math to determine your end game score. How much is this game like a board game?(1) The combat (2) The traveling(3) The random encounters(4) The skill tree character building(5) The limited type of currencies(6) The end game scoring system And More.All of these and more are almost the exact same mechanics I have found in board games that I have played. You essentially pick/create a team & you explorer. You have random encounters, random events, obtain random currency, of course your options are limited as to what you can & cannot do. There is a small learning curve to the game. The game isn't fast, it is a nice pace.The action turn based.			"

This isn't the case with Renowned Explorers, so I'm going to tell you why it seems to be a perfect game for me and why you will love it, at least if our gaming preferences are similar.It's easy to learn. You can get started right away, the tutorial blends in nicely with the campaign and is not too long. Also, if you don't play for a few weeks you won't have forgotten how to play or where you were in your campaign. The combat system is very creative and cute, easy enough to learn but you can play it the hard way if you want to. Replayability is high because of the many different ways you can build your team and the different approaches you can take. Since the expeditions are slightly randomized you can visit them again and again, with different teams and different approaches. It comes as a cute clicking game, but has actual depth and demands you have a plan and some tactics. The graphics are absolutely cute, I love all the explorers, the other characters and the little animations of their attacks. It's varied and funny. This one time I insulted a nun and she got really sad. This game fulfiils my childhood dream of becoming a celebrated explorer and my adulthood dream of insulting random people.The first DLC did not only bring new expeditions, but new mechanics as well, it's definitely worth the price. I hope the developers will continue to enrich this great game.			"

												This game is actually incredible. Reus, the previous game from the same developers, was one of my favourites despite finding god games in general to be hit and miss. I loved the intricate systems of Reus, with a ton of different resources, strategy, depth and complexity, because it was handled in an intuitive way through tooltips and fun tutorials that never dragged the game to a screeching halt. Unlike some strategy games where you have no idea what resources go where to build whatever while advisors badger you incessantly, Reus gave you the notes and tips you needed to understand every system, but never shoved it into your face. Really, it was the pinnacle god game for me.RE:IS is like Reus, but instead of being a perfect game in a so-so genre for me, it's a perfect game that's also a mashup of my favourite mechanics, genres and themes. It's like this game was tailor made for me.Renowned Explorers: International Society is sort of a roguelike, but there's a lot more to it. It has the overland mechanics of a good old fashioned D&D hexcrawl, the battle systems and trinities of a Fire Emblem, random written events and challenges a la Eighty Days or Tales of the Arabian Nights (the best board game ever), Civ-like research trees, time management, RPG loot. Throw in a steampunky Indiana Jones aesthetic, and I'm so very very sold. It's so good.Better yet, like Reus there are a ton of different systems. A elemental trinity of physical, diplomatic and taunting attacks. Status effects based on how cranky or cocky you are. Twenty unique characters to pull from. Tons and tons of traits and subtraits. A dozen tokens and currencies, each with a different purpose. But also like Reus, the intricate web of synergy is completely demystified by the tooltops and the UI. Forget what a Discovery token does? Highlight over it, and it will break down the numbers based on your current stats and upgrades. Need a referesher on status effects in battle? Hover over the icon and get informed. Forget what to do between expeditions? The concise in game manual is only a click away. Combined with tutorials that a) don't treat you like a moron and b) are done within five minutes, RE:IS strikes the perfect balance between providing information and beating you over the head with it.One great example is the way unlocks are done. In Sunless Sea, which is a fairly similar texty roguelike mashup I quite enjoy, you get thrown in the deep end with a ton of traits and unlocks and places to go and stats to pick from before you have any idea what they do. RE:IS purposely keeps your pool of captains small; every other character is unlocked, but only as a secondary assistant. They explain abilities, they suggest synergies, they outline strategies your captain excel at. But as you play, you get a better grasp on the rules, and your most used secondary characters are soon unlocked as new captains complete with their own traits and strategies.And despite all the tooltips and synergy help, it's still a challenge. I've yet to win on the classic difficulty, but it's never felt unfair when I've died. There are setbacks from dice rolls, sure, but I'm always in control and they always give me the odds, so it's up to me to build a better team and make better investments next time. And a complete game is five expeditions, which only takes two or three hours, so it's closer to a short game of Civ than, say, a long haul XCOM campaign.One last point: when rolling percentile chances, your characters spin a giant Price is Right wheel. I don't know why I find this so deeply satisfying, but it blows the hell out of simulated dice rolls.			"

												Wow!!!!This is a fun little game which I enjoy a lot. It is fun, witty, challenging sometimes ( most of the time in later stages though :P ) . Each character has their own unique ablilities, strength and weakness etc. I find them all of them to be different and charming.Fortune wheel always gets me praying for the landing on the good ones and random encounters are fun fun fun.All of the good things make this little game worth to play and I don't know why I feel happy when achievement notifactions show up at the end of expecations lol . So much achievements to unlock and I find it pretty cool.All in all, I love this game but I experience some laggings from here and there. Other than that, I think this game is cute, funny and enjoyable !! ^_^			"

												This game is fantastic.Set in a cartoonish world of gentlemen explorers, Renowned Explorers plays like a wacky mix between Faster Than Light and Arkham Horror. You assemble a trio of explorers from a range of options (scientists, scouts, fighters or diplomats) who all have different personalities (aggressive, deceptive or peaceful), animations, and a ton of different skills and talents. You then travel the globe going on adventures, encountering treasures and bizarre situations at every turn. You're constantly pushing your luck in the hope that your specialisations will lead to better results - leading to a really engaging risk/reward system, tense dilemmas, and hilarious deaths. Between explorations you can spend your gold, research, influence and renown on an in-depth party-wide upgrade system.On top of all this, Renowned Explorers features a fully-fledged turn-based tactical 'combat' system...which doesn't always involve actual combat. Sure, sometimes you might be shooting nuns in the hopes of stealing their treasure, but more often than not, you're humiliating Scottish farmers or placating angry sheep. It's weird, it's wonderful, and it's very very stylish.With a ton of achievements and unlockables, many random scenarios to explore, and a challenging leaderboard to top, I could see this one giving a *lot* of fun playtime. Highly recommended!			"

												Excellent game!Funny.Character classes with characters who all have different personalities.Strategic:  combine the best characters for your quest style.Explore:  the maps are never quite the same.  It's always fun to find quests and challenges!Combat: innovative and funny; physical, verbal/emo and magical attacks - does require strategyDifficulty:  choose your difficulty (laid-back or challenge and in between)This is a casual game for somebody who likes to do some adventuring with a bit of RPG and a bit of strategy and a bit of exploring.  Also, the achievements make it fun to go try different things.Cons:  after quite a while it can get slightly repetitive; and items seem very expensive when you start outWell worth the price.  8.5/10 for overall but 10/10 for the type of game (I didn't put it down for quite a while after purchasing!!)

												Renowned Explorers is a unique rogue like experience. It's deceptive in that it starts off fairly simple like all games but then ramps up the difficultly so you're always thinking of the best strategy to approach conflicts with. At the core of most battles you engage in is a rock, paper, scissors type game.First off you choose your adventurers. There's many to choose from, all having various strengths and weaknesses. I wish I could choose more than 3. But that's part of the challenge of rouge types. You gotta make the most of the hand you're dealt or in this case deal yourself. So now that you have your 3 explorers your goal is to discover the most artifacts and become the most famous explorer IN THE WORLD!!  Naturally you have a rival who will do anything to become more famous than you. So you play the game by going on expeditions to different parts of the world. The more difficult the journey the better the reward. You and your team get put in some random spot on the map you chose and you have a limited number of moves like a game board to reach your goal.There's so many aspects to this game because each trip is it's own story and things happen along the way that you have to choose to the best option for your skills. There's also many ways you can approach situations and customize your characters skills. Using brute force alone won't get you far. I've tried, playing aggressively is the hardest way to beat this game. You have to kill your enemies with kindness and sometimes put the fear of god into them. This game is really challenging and it's hard finding the right balance of powers and skills given the limited number of moves. However, even if you don't beat your rival at the end you can still win the game by maximizing your expeditions and finding more stuff. In the end you win by playing smarter rather than harder and it's a great approach that really makes this game stand out for me.			"

												Just... one more.... expedition!Sid Meier said a game is a ''series of interesting decisions''. Never has this been more true than for Renowned Explorers. Assemble a team, weigh up their pros and cons, and start making meaningful, important choices. I feel like some may bounce off Renowned Explorers due to its unusual and unique ''combat'' system. It's really more of an ''encounter'' system, where you're looking at the emotional mood of the encounter and weighing up how to approach it advantageously.  These african villagers are being friendly? Let's be aggressive and exploit their weaknesses! These Caribbean pirates have us at gunpoint? A devious approach will disarm them! You get the idea.With a choice of 16 playable characters, I'm still discovering new combinations to exploit, new configurations of teams that work well in certain situations. Each character has their own unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses. It's up to you to decide which combination fits your play style. This play style extends to the ''overworld'' where your expedition stakes a path across whatever far-flung wilderness you've found yourself in. Supplies are limited, so the choice lies with you as to how to proceed. The game is generous with information, and makes clear the risks you might be getting yourself into. A 98% chance is still a chance. And sometimes everything will go south on you. Wonderfully though, it never feels unfair. You knew the risks!I can't wait to play again.  "

												This game is a small yet charming game about Explores searching the world for treasure! From the Caribbean to Transylvania each area offering it's own challenge. There are 3 fighting styles in this game Aggressive beating your foes by punching them, Friendly and making then Excited, Impressed or Confident that your Crew is the best and Devious making them to Sad, Angry or Scared to fight...

												This game is a delight! It manages to tickle my imagination in the way that a good children's book can while capturing the pleasure of a well designed board game.The gameplay and mechanics are simple enough that a novice can complete the game easily within their first half-dozen attempts. But the high-end challenges nested within the game are enough to occupy any hardcore table top strategy gamer. The pacing at which these challenges unfold and reveal themselves to the player masterfully handled. And the Steam acheivements are well designed in that they help guide a gamer towards these challenges over time.Even more enjoyable than the gameplay is Renowned Explorers sense of narrative. Character specific and skill specific narratives have been woven throughout the game. These are so much fun to discover and follow through to completion.My only beef with the game related to the default settings. My first few playthroughs had the long combat animations turned on. I found these dragged out battles, making the game insufferably slow. Thankfully, the developers have made it so you can toggle these off. Once switched off, I find a full game, if successful, lasts about 1.5-2 hours. Considering the number of short indie titles & sometimes overly long civ-like strategy games in my library, I find that Renowned Explorers occupies a unique category and sweet spot in terms of the time commitment required versus the depth of play available.I absolutely recommend this title and its expansion, More to Explore, to anyone.One final note for families, this game is very wide in age appropriateness, offering good stuff for players aged 8 and plenty of fun stuff for any adults who enjoy good old fashioned adventure serials.

												Are you a fan of the Indiana Jones Trilogy? Ever wanted to scurry ruins for ancient treasures?Then stop right there, I have to show you a piece that belongs in a MuseumRenowed Explorers is a Roguelike-ish mix of Strategy RPG, Choose your own Adventure Book and planning sim from the Makers of Reus, a definitely wonderful god-Sim. But thats a different review for a different Day.You pick a team of three archeologists from a roster of 24 people in 4 classes (Fighter, Scientist, Scout and Talker (Diplomat)) with yiur captian being limited to only a few people, but you unlock more as you play Expeditions with them.The story is simple - Make it Big! Be the most renown Explorer in the Renown Explorers Guild, but you only have 5 months (say: expeditions) to do so! the gameplay is pretty simple - When you start an expedition you are dropped on a fixed map of knots, like in for example FTL. Travelling between nodes takes provisions of which you start with a limit, which you cant surpass with restocks. As you traverse the map towards your goal you will see that some Nodes have Markers ""There is Knowledge/Fame/Gold to be found here!"",""There might be an encounter here!"", ""There might be a XXX Challenge here. A YYY would be helpful"". those nodes hold short events that will on success gain you some tokens or more information or on fail may cost you provisions, give your team debuffs or end up costing you Resolve (say: Lives). When you reach your destination, you will enter a bigger chain of events to ultimately resolve what you came for and finish the mission.Upon finishing any tokens you gained through events and battles will be converted into your 4 base resources: Fame, Knowledge, Money, Renown and a mission specific shop will open.On the world map you can spend your resources as you wish - Knowledge to write thesises (say: give your team various buffs), Money to buy more and better equipment and Fame to either get better Items in Stores or to hire an enourage, that will boost the amount of resources you gain from tokens.Renown is your actal score, and you have to pass the renown of the Lists 1st to ""win"" the game.As it was in Reus - the Graphics are beautiful, the characters and their animations are just gorgeousMusic and sound is nice to listen too and get you an an adventuring moodGameplaywise this game throws a few balls out there and manages to juggle them well. the combat system actually goes pretty deep with its Mood System - every character has Speech (say Magic) abilities that give certain buffs or debuffs (for example a flattered character will take more damage from Speech attacks while a confident character wil deal more physical damage) and based on the overall mood of your approach and the enemies approach (forceful, Devious or Friendly - yes, you can complement your enemies to ""death"") your team will get a global buff/debuff based on a rock-Paper-Scissors system. A Forceful approach against a peaceful enemy will leave you at an advantage while a devious enemy will have you gasping for air quicklyI have a little beef with this game, since it is mostly luck based. the Skill checks require your explorers to have certain perks to better their odds, but most of the time you will be staring into 30 to 40% chances top if your perks dont match up well.There also seem to be a few bugs still around, like a memory leak on long sessions or that a certainBosses healthbar was imprinted on every space he stopped.Also if you dont immeadiately invest a few points into the first skill tree (thesises) you will find yourself short on supplies quickly. And if they run out you will get arandom until-the-end-of-the-exploration debuff that will stack and might cost your head.with that the shortage of Resources might end up leaving you dry during the end if you splurge too much in the beginning.The replayability is very high due to the many different possible combinations of teams.A Definite Must play for fans of Reus or the old Adventuring days in general			"

												Summary: This game is an absolute gem. If I had an awards show this game would win the category of ""Best Strategy Game I didn't Even Know I Wanted"". As a rogue-lite experience, the playthroughs run 2-4 hours depending on how I choose to play. There are many different areas to explore and many different ways to solve nearly every encounter. Lists make things easier to digest, so instead of continuing to ramble, here's what I've experienced so far:+ MANY different ways to play through the game: Combinations of locations and heroes and different strategies allow some serious replayability, espeically considering the amount of outcomes and side-adventures possible for each location.+ A deep and highly interactive 'combat' system: The way you fight in this game is truly unique: Very similar to a regular tactics RPG in some respects, but completely different in others. Difficult to describe in a short review, but very fun and very satisfying to say the least.+ This game positivley leaks charm out of every orifice: The settings are diverse and well themed. The members of your crew and the enemies you fight are all fantastically animated and characterized. Encounters are often clever and always well written.+ THE DEV TEAM is very active and involved in the community, organising weekly challenge events and maintaining scoreboards, listening and providing feedback to the community.+ Game is priced affordably. Content rich expansion 10 months after release is priced very reasonably, and really adds some goodness.This game has insane value, and it's absolutely worth full price. Got in about 10 hours in the base game, but after the expansion pack I've seriously been digging in, which is why I felt like I should write this review. Basically, the Xpac turned this game up to 11 for me. 100% reccomend the base game, it appears to be getting continually updated along with the Xpac, which is pretty nice. If you like the base game after a playthrough or five, I 1000% Reccomend the Xpac. Thanks for reading,TunaSammich			"

												Renowned Explorers is a unique blend of exploration and turn based/hexagonal combat. The game is designed to be replayed multiple times, offering 2 game modes and 4 difficulties. The goal is to be the top explorer and beat the present #1 - a task that I couldn’t achieve even on normal difficulty. To be at the top you have 5 expeditions to rack up more Renown than the top explorer (2500). Expeditions get harder towards the end with the last one being super hard to beat. Expedition maps are procedurally generated so every replay is different, and so can be your approach since there are multiple ways you can choose to take your playthrough. Focusing mostly on Research, Status or Gold or choosing a combination of heroes that focus on different playstyles.But the combat is where it’s at. It takes a different approach than any other turn based game out there. There are 3 ways to beat your opponents - Aggressive, Devious or Friendly. You choose your approach based on your opponents mood since one mood is advantageous to the other.So becoming a top explorer is not an easy task when you have all of these things to worry about and find the perfect blend. I personally enjoyed the first 2 playthroughs but then got bored of it. I would still recommend it for the fans of the genre since the game is unique in some aspects.			"

												Compelling, entertaining, challenging game. Masterpiece.Prior to Renowned Explorers the most recent game that I played to completion was the original Dead Space. I buy and play many games and always stop playing them as soon as they cease being fun. I like progression, I like achievement, narrative, chrome, story-telling, choices and consequences, but if I stop having fun I will quit. I do not have a lot of gaming time, and this is just how I manage it.I have completed Renowned Explorers about half a dozen times and if ever there is DLC or expansion or a sequel or spin-off I will buy it without thinking. The theme, characters and challenge absolutely shine and the gameplay nails the elusive simple to learn and challenging to master template. In particular the turn-based tactical game is superb, with meaningful choices to be made prior to expeditions, before each fight and throughout each fight, usually every single turn.I also almost never leave ""reviews"" of games. This one deserves all the praise it can get.			"

												Not an overly complicated game, but a good one to pick up and have fun with for a little while. The skill system is well set up, allowing you to become good in a few areas (recommended) or okay in a number of them. Different playthroughs allow you to focus on different sets.Lots of character variety and the ability to unlock more expedition leaders as you go makes it feel like you are progressing towards something playthrough after playthrough. Also, the ability to unlock campfire cards from game to game gives more of the same feeling.Combat is unique in that you can defeat enemies by hitting them, insulting them, or complimenting them. Your characters have different strengths in each and the enemies are more or less vulnerable to different approaches. You also get different rewards in each fight depending upon how you win.The setting and characters are amusing. The game is involved enough to be fun, but not so much as to bog you down. A full playthrough wraps up in a few hours and will often leave you wanting to give another go at it.			"

Their latest expansion which improved character depth is evidence of that. It has a great assortment of memorable characters and interesting locations. I've played the game extensively and have yet to get bored with it. Each crew of characters offers a new way to win. Whether that be exploring West Africa and Egyptian ruins for great wealth or the Pacific Islands for scientific research. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys strategy and roguelike RPG games.

												SUMMARY:  This is a pretty good casual game if that's what you want and if you don't pay full price.  (Luckily I got it on sale, but even at half off retail I think I paid too much and am disappointed.)This game has a lot going for it, but it's terribly important to know certain things about it before spending money on it.  With that in mind, I'm putting the CONS list first.CONS:  ... Staggeringly short.  I tend to take my time, but in less than 10 hours I've started four playthroughs and beaten the game twice on the standard difficulty (classic difficulty, no saves, permadeath).  You get to go on 5 expeditions, most of which are limited by supplies to about 10-12 moves.  (I'm generalizing; there are ways to make individual expeditions last SLIGHTLY longer.)  The first of the five is chosen for you, and is also shorter than the rest (about 7 moves).   ... Repetitive.  There are very few expedition options.  They prompt you what sort of things you can expect to face and find, and it frequently happens that there are no good options for a party's strengths or an expedition's needs.  Also, while each one is partially randomized, the draw pool is small and I got the same ""random"" scenarios multiple times.  The network of possible moves changes, the rewards change, but the bulk of each expedition stays the same each playthrough.  ... Limited.  You pick three explorers from the provided 20.  There's a degree of diversity between them, but most of it is in hidden features that may or may not even matter.  (My wrestler was devout, which mattered in exactly one conversation option.)  My friendly gold obsessed party with the Scout captain was functionally identical to my aggressive research obsessed party with the Scientist captain.  There are obvious gaps, like characters who are glass cannons and fit in a certain sort of party, but without sturdy characters to defend them who also fit in that sort of party.  Each character has a couple of options in encounters, but it's pretty common for disimilar characters to have exactly the same attacks, so everyone plays pretty close to the same.  Each character can also be upgraded slightly (you get one of two options at each level, and I commonly finished with character at level 4), but a lot of the options are minor and there's no way to level up in the field.  There's a research tree with six small branches, but you can only choose from two of them at first, so most of the ""options"" won't have time to affect much, assuming you devote enough time to Research to unlock any of them at all.  There's equipment to buy, and its very important, but there aren't real choices about it, so gold is mostly the illusion of a mechanic.  There are followers to hire, but they do minor things that you may not even notice unless you invest a lot in them, at which point they only provide their marginal effect on your last expedition.  In short, so much of the game felt like discovering that a lake is really a puddle.  It's broad and looks refreshing, but it's too shallow to do much in.  ...Vague.  A lot of information could be useful, but isn't available anywhere.  Monster attacks are the most typical example of this.  Fights involve a lot of splashy (and whimsical) pictures that mean nearly nothing, combined with wildly unpredictable attack strength and a bevy of ignorably irrelevant status effects.  Perks are similar.  It isn't uncommon that you'll get to choose new perks, not knowing if or how those perks will help you.  My favorite is choosing between two perks of the same type, each with a stylish but vapid name.  How are they different?  They probably aren't.PROS:  ... Interesting concept implemented well.  I really liked the entire exploration idea, and the game is built on it from top to bottom.  Everything works together to point back to that central conceit: stepping out on adventures into the mysterious unknown.  ... Interesting mechanics.  The game has some really unique combat mechanics--(attack types, approach types, moods, feelings)--which are challenging but rewarding to manage.  The best of these is the encounter outcomes, trying to resolve an encounter in a friendly, devious, or aggressive manner to achieve different rewards.  ... Solid platform.  I haven't encountered a single bug.  ... Whimsical atmosphere.  Everything from the art design to the quests is pretty lighthearted. "

												Awesome game, and the surprise purchase of the month for me.At first I wasn't sure what to think of the game, but it looked interesting, so I went with ""let's try it out, if it isn't ok, I got steam refunding"". I am happy I did, since I got a full weekend of hardcore exploring out of it. ^^At first it was all fun and exciting, because of the  cute representation .The graphics in comic look are just lovely, having very authentic animations for your characters and the enemies alike. You got a very diverse set of explorers to choose from, and often their personality also matters. Even the headshot pictures react to the moods characters get during the battles, and many of them were very amusing.Moods in battle? Yes, you read it well. The game has an authentic mix of simplicity and complexity, taking a basic stone-paper-scissors gameplay, and adding a lot of complexity to it by introducing battlefield moods. If you are peaceful, you will get a large bonus against devious opponents, while aggressive opponents will give you trouble. Those opponents however will have problems, if your party decides to react devious!During the battles, you will be able to change the battlefield mood of your party with your actions, but be aware, some  enemies will do the same!The difficulty in Renowned Explorers is one of the most polarizing things in the discussion boards these days.I consider myself very happy with the difficulty settings, as they gave a real feeling of excitedness to the overall game. You always have to consider carefully if you want to move on, even though you ran out of food and your expedition is starving. It might give you more ressources, but adds very negative conditions to your party members, which might do a big impact on the challenging bosses.The bosses are challenging. You will have to understand the game mechanics and change the battlefield moods carefully, if you want to stand a chance. Sometimes you will want to avoid a mood alltogether, or will have to plan ahead to change the mood fast, if it happens to go bad. Also you will have to use the positive friendly buffs, and the negative (mostly) devious debuffs well. If you want to go with aggressive physical combat, you might want to enrage your enemies to take additional damage, and your party might want to become excited for an increase in attack power. If your enemies dish out too much physical damage, you will also find a mood to weaken them.Checking the discussion boards, it seems like the creators are working on an easy mode for those which do not enjoy these well made and challenging boss battles. But until then, you may expect some real try and error puzzle solving on how to get through all the expeditions. Moreso if you play the (Ironman) Adventuring mode.The last expedition is hardly beatable, if you didn't master the game and take some really well equipped explorer party with good Synergy with you. But thats absolutely allright, since you are never forced to beat those missions, to win the game! Just consider it an added challenge!Whenever you finish a Journey, you will get two new journeys to choose from, which have added difficulty. So after beating the initial Rank 1 journey, you will get 2 more Rank 2 journeys to choose from, and so on.For your first games, you might want to skip on the Rank 4 and 5 journeys though, and might want to go 1-2-2-3-3. It is possible to get a high enough score for the score victory with it. But if you tackle the rank 4 journeys, you might want to expect a tough challenge, with the rank 5 journey checking your mastery of the game.If you aren't battling, you are exploring semi-random journey maps, while trying to conserve your food, to get as many of the 3 ressources science, fame and wealth as possible. You might also find some treasure for additional game effects and to increase your Renown, basicaly your score. To win the game, you will want to gather a Renown of at least 2000, but the real challenge is to get the biggest Highscore and find the best hidden Treasures.You also got the two secondary Ressources Insight and Resolve, where Insight is tradeable for more basic ressources in various ways during the game and Resolve basicaly resembles your life count.While collecting these ressources, you deal with well written and often funny  story situations , in which you decide to alter the outcome or if you want to take a risk, using the ""adventure wheel"". Basicaly it's a represantation of the dice rolls for your percentualy based chances on event outcomes. How much percent you got to get a certain result is based on which Adventurers you picked, and which perks you make avaiable for them.So, will your risk one Resolve, to take a chance for some additional ressources at 63%?The game is full of such decisions, and sometimes mean situations you might want to be prepared for or avoid, as you grow to know the game. But it's what creates a lot of the charm and replayability!The game rewards getting to know it better, it rewards dealing with difficult situations, it rewards careful decisions ... it rewards Exploring!Not by throwing increasing amounts of goodies at you, but by making the experience authentic.

												I rather enjoy a good story game then just repetitive shooting and killing. However, with story games the replay value is sometimes questionable. HOWEVER, this game has great stories and awesome replay value. Every time I start a new expedition I learn new strategies and ways to go about problems while exploring different stories.Just awesome, really recommended for strategists and story lovers with amazing complexity!

												ATTENTION: This review has been written for the game together with its expansion - More To Explore.Renowned Explorers is proof that looks can be deceiving. At first glance, this is a cute but simple tactics game about launching expeditions, hunting for treasure and exploring the world. This was my initial impression. However, as soon as I hit the start button, I began to notice, that the game has way more depth than I thought. Decisions in Renowned Explorers require quite a lot of thinking through or you might end up losing horribly. Think Darkest Dungeons levels of complexity.The basic  premise of the game is that you pick up three characters out of a pool of 20, with one being team captain. Each character has a set of skills, perks, hidden traits and captain bonuses. Your goal is to become the world's most Renowned Explorers (d'oh!). You do that by launching expeditions (5 per game), which give you artifacts, status, gold, research and - most importatnly - renown, of which more than 2500 is needed to win the game. After each expedition, the player has a chance to spend the resources aquired to improve the party. Do it wisely - spending resources haphazardly almost always ends in utter failure. And you will fail. At the start of the game, you get 2 points of Resolve. Lose them all and it is game over.The Good:+ Adorable graphics. Each character is distinct and easily recognisable. Animations for every character do a lot to show off that character's personality.+ Interesting combat system based on attitudes. There are three: aggressive, friendly and devious, and they work similarly to rock - paper - scissors (aggressive beats friendly beats devious beats aggressive). Switching between attitudes at just the right moment is key to survival and may net you different rewards depending on which of the attitudes is dominant.+ Sense of humor. The whole game is tongue in cheek. Many dialogues are genuinely funny, over the top or absurd. Enemies are amusing - from sheep, through posh Brits to easily scared vampires. Plus, some of the things the player can do are simply hilarious. At one point I was able to body slam a T-Rex. A bloody T-Rex.+ Lots of depth and replayability. Due to the complexity of the various systems and stark differences in playstyles, the game can be played many times over without the risk of getting bored.+ Surprises at every corner. I have finished this game more than 10 times and I still discover new events, character interactions and hilarious encounter results.+ Difficulty level variety. The game has 4 difficulty levels and two modes - one of which involves permadeath. So, if you are not a fan of dying and losing all of your progress, you can go with adventure mode, with save games.The Mediocre:~ The number of possible expedition locations is limited. Even with all the DLC, there are only 13 of them. Seems like a lot, but after a few games you will learn them all by heart. Still, the differences between expeditions are huge, and each of them has a couple of hidden surprises, so i can't complain much.~ The tutorials could use some work. I feel that the tokens expecially aren't explained all that well. Keep in mind though that this is really a game you learn more as you play than from reading any tutorial.~ Even though characters are distinct, their attack skills aren't. Many characters have the same combat skills, though with different animations.The Bad:- Lots of graphical glitches. They are not gamebraking in any way, yet annoying still.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time. You make an adventure party of three people and go on five missions around the world. You collect gold, treasure, science and other stats and aim to become the most well renown adventure group of all time. You level up your characters, purchase items for them, send them on jobs and recruit supportive charcaters such as journalists or students. Combat has a rock paper scissor element ad you can choose to become friends over violence. Your choices and skills matter for what interactions succeed on your adventures and you can unlock secrets.Love this game and Reus by the same developers, both are one of the best designed games I've ever seen!

												This game took me completely by surprise. I like roguelike and roguelite games a lot, but lately many of them have felt too shallow. Skyshine's Bedlam had an amazing setting, but it soon became repetitive and boring, and you couldn't prepare for encounters because they were all based on luck. Same problem lies with other similar games: Sunless Sea, where the world was AMAZING, but the advancement and replay value was really low. Banner Saga's combat became a snorefest after a few times, the list goes on and on...But NOT RE:IS. This game has everything you'd want in a good roguelite: interesting combat that has depth to its mechanics, interesting artstyle and aesthetic, character development, customization, various ways of advancement, loads of MEANINGFUL choices... All in all, it's my Best Roguelite 2015. It's a hidden gem from a studio that needs recognition and love, so please show it to them and go have fun.Just one more expedition... <3			"

												First time I saw this in the store, I immediately dismissed it. The graphical style makes it look like a cheap iPad game, the combat grid system looked completely average and generic. I forgot about it, and it was only when I saw a favourable review did I decide to try it.Turns out, I'm an idiot for not picking it up sooner. Buy this game.The exploration aspect is very FTL-like, but the complexity in the combat and the crew setups is what makes this game shine. The addition of moods and emotions (and its continuation to the exploration map) really adds a whole new dimension to combat. Yes, it appears at first to have a steep (almost unfair?) difficulty curve. Yes, you can be on a roll and be entirely screwed over from bad luck. But yes, yes and yes, you will want to play this again and again.A few minor points - would be nice to have the tools button more obviously shown for beginners. Would be nice to have little reminders to level up before continuing. Would be nice to be able to see characters' attacks while in a shop, without having to close it and switch pages. And I'm still not a fan of the graphics. But all that is minor.			"

												I had to cook it over a while to decide exactly why I love Renowned Explorers so much. It boils down to two things.1 - Many roguelike experiences are built around the question, ""Will you live to cross the finish line?"" It can get really depressing to die and fail over and over again. RE:IS (on its standard difficulties anyway) asks, ""How cool will your adventuring career be?"" I rarely straight up lose a run, but it isn't about winning or losing. It's about the first time you finish with 2500 Renown. Then 3000. Then 3500. You'll get a little better at squeezing more efficiency out of your runs each time you play, and you won't need an unbreakable spirit to want to keep trying.2 - Another factor hampering many roguelike experiences is that there's only one paradigm for interaction. The whole game is dungeon crawling. No single gameplay system can entertain you forever. RE:IS has three different types of play: Roleplaying as you travel from node to node and decide how to handle incidents, Combat on a turn based grid with a handful of subsystems that don't overwhelm, and Resource Management as you spend your hard earned gains on things that synergize with your strengths and shore up your weaknesses. You'll constantly rotate between these 3 activities, so none of them ever overstay their welcome.RE:IS is amazing. I eagerly await and will gladly pay for more DLC.			"

												Renowned Explorers: International Society (Or RE:IS) is a game which is about, unsuprisingly, exploration, with you taking control of a captain, each with their own unique command buffs, and two other team members. These are split into four classes: Scientist, Scout, Fighter and Speaker, each bringing different skills and abilities to your team. Each of these crew members can level up, gaining new abilities and allowing you to choose between two different upgrades to the character.The gameplay itself is very narrative with special encounters to complete or things to find by moving between tiles on the map, with your goal in each expedition to find a special treasure. However there are also many smaller treasures to find . At the time I am writing this there are nine expeditions to complete, my time to complete these averages out to about 15-20 minutes, depending on the difficulty level. This may seem like a small potential playtime but there is huge amounts of replayability, each playthrough being different.Outside of expeditions you can give your crew new items to make them better individually, as well as doing research to upgrade many different things, as well as unlock stuff.I think this game is well worth the asking price and is a good game for casually blowing off some steam.

												A wonderful, refreshingly-adorable game with tons of replayability and a great balance between strategy and the perils of the unknown. Great characters and great mechanics that aren't too streamlined or too obtuse. It encourages getting to know the whole cast, both to unlock new captain status and to understand the synergies between explorers more... which is needed because the difficulty is no joke (in a good way.) Bosses can seem cheap if your party isn't optimized just for THAT encounter, but that's the beauty of it for me... there is no ""i win"" formula that applies to everything (that I have found,) and it makes completing the expeditions that much more satisfying and makes replaying that much more worthwhile.Can't stop playing and hope for more expeditions and explorers in future updates (which I would happily support.)What a great little gem of a surprise.

												This is a unique game in many ways, and also very enjoyable. It's not the kind of game where fast clicking or amazing eye hand coordination is much help at all, and for me, that's fantastic. It's a strategy game with some story and a lot of humor, and I find I get very attached to the characters in my party very fast.(such as screaming 'No Vlad, you can't have Ivan!!!')The game is set up so you can select a party of three explorers of varying strengths, and you can choose throughout the game how they'll develop.One of my favorite aspects is that you can choose to be very different explorers from game to game in how you 'battle' those who you encounter. You can be friendly, devious, or outright aggressive, meaning that talking is not a free action anymore and can in fact defeat an opponent, whether through messing with their head or convincing them that you're awesome and they should help you.I highly recommend this game for its unique approach, its humor, and its art. Also, it's not 'America-centric' in its choices for your explorers, as they come from every continent and many different backgrounds, from a tiny Austrian magician to an Argentine diplomat's daughter to a wild Australian (and of course a loveable Russian giant).Personally, my favorite explorers are Bia, Daisy, and Anna, but I haven't even gotten to playing all of them yet, so who knows if it'll stay that way.

												(Wrote lenghty review earlier, then it got eaten by this amazing steam tool, oh well... maybe I'll expand this later)RE:IS is a unique blend of genres, a game by abbey games, where you lead your team of explorers to fame and glory.The game features map exploration, where you navigate a randomized location searching for treasures and using up your party member skills to weigh risks in your favour, tactical encounters with a unique twist (I didn't call it ""combat"" because you can negotiate your way through) and inbetween expeditions you get to spend your resources to further improove your odds in the next adventure. The main advantages  of the game are the theme (not many games out there that let you be the explorer in the age of discovery), the interconnected web of features and systems that create a complex gameplay experience and the unique, cartoony art direction that fits the tone of the game. I also like the challenge and the overall cheerful tone, even though I can see why people may complain about RNG or the game not being serious. The only real complaint I have is the lack of variety when it comes locations to explore (10 overall I think, you pick 5 each campaign). They are randomized, and you encounter different things each time, but after several playthroughs they feel samey, which hurts the overall feel of exploration and venturing into unknown. (That said the devs acknowledged this issue and more content is on the way).RE:IS is rather unique, but if you need to compare it to something, think Darkest Dungeon, but with totally opposite tone and gameplay split into short campaigns. Both are difficult games about weighing risk and reward, with unique art style, both I feel deliver what they try to achieve.All in all, good game, worthy of your attention.			"

												A charming, innovative and polished game. The encounter system, featuring the turn-based tactical 'combat' of the game, is the weak point, being perhaps too challenging for casual players and too simple for TBS lovers (contrast to FTL, which is somewhat similar, though FTL has more entertaining combat and rather lifeless events). Still, Abbey games has produced a gem here, setting an example that I hope more games follow.			"

Posted: October 27, 2015
												Renowned Explorers: International Society (RE:IS) is a nice mix of FTL-style exploration and classic hex-field turn-based strategy (such as Heroes of Might and Magic). The game really shines as a complex system of resources and synergies; it's a lot of fun to try out different ways of generating the ultimate ressource in the game - renown. Another element standing out is the combat mood system. Based on your actions and your opponents' actions, the encounters have a different mood, which gives your units certain buffs and debuffs. This really encourages you to use all abilities of your explorers, rather than just using the 'strongest' or 'juicest' (which you can also do and is a challenge of its own). I think in this sense, RE:IS is a great developmental step from REUS, the studio's previous game. REUS had bautiful synergistic mechanics, but the game played more like a simulation. In RE:IS, the devs managed to forge the synergies into a great interdependent game system that is very enjoyable and rewarding - especially if you're into building systems/resource engines.In general, I think that the game is also a bit too short (many others have mentioned that as well). You're done after a handful of explorations; to compare it with a card game: it feels a bit like playing Race for the Galaxy -- you're taking some turns building a great resource engine, but there's not much time to actually see it run. This being said: The replay value is great, but I think some additional campaigns, or some sort of ongoing exploration with limited lives (""resolve"") could be a great addition. (The good news is that the devs are still working on some additional content and modes.) As much as I do like the mechanics and the complex resource system, I do think that the representations of different cultures and individuals are reinforcing problematic stereotypes. I do believe that 'exploration' type games do have a tendency to reinforce hegemonic world-views; in the case of RE:IS, I believe that the  ""explorer"" setting is indeed strongly reinforcing a eurocentric idea of exploration, and in fact, of cultural exploitation (and more than that: it refers to a style of colonialist exploration that actually did happen, and it romanticizes it). Many encounters involve helpless or fumbling natives that need the help of the explorers. In my opinion this does have an undertone of cultural inequality, and contains an imlicit message that suggests a cultural inferiority in the cultures we explore in the game. It is also important to note that  all of the places we explore are depicted as technologically, and culturally less advanced.On one side, the game gives me the choice to resolve encounters agressively or via persuasion. But even if I use persuasion, or 'friendly' tactics, I am still taking something away from the culture (e.g. artifacts). In fact, there is no way to progress in the game without taking artifacts away from their originating culture.  For example, I talk myself into a monastery and convince the nuns to give me one of their relics. Cultural exchange is great - but in RE:IS, a classic colonialist (one-sided, and hegemonic) way of exploration is a constitutional part of the game setting, and game play. In conclusion: The irony in RE:IS is that the game mechanics are so bautifully synergistic - but the setting is colonialist. Overall I think that this is a game worth playing, set in a game setting worth problematizing and talking about. "

												Renowned Explorers: International Society is my favourite game I played this year.It's charming, it's exciting, it's unique and it's addictive. Here's why:You start your game by picking a group of three explorers from a colorful and diverse cast of characters. Some of them are archetypes that you might have seen before, but they truly come to life in the fun and colorful designs, distinct and amusing animations and unique traits which influence your adventures with them.Once you've selected your team, you'll be thrown right into the game. You're in a previously unexplored location, and your team is going to get famous exploring it. Each map features a main goal you'll need to get to within a set amount of turns. You'll be using up your supplies and need to plan your route carefully - if you run out, it's not an immediate game over, but your explorers will be weakened significantly, making it much harder for them to succeed in the final challenge awaiting you. On the road there, you'll have plenty of encounters, which can either play out as a turn-based combat or a Choose Your Own Adventure-like story, forcing you to make choices based on your team's individual strengths.The turn-based combat will feel instantly familiar to anyone who has played any other game featuring it. However, where RE:IS manages to put a completely unique spin on it is in the stories it tells through the combat. See, instead of differentiating between your characters' attacks through using swords or guns or magic, here all your attacks and abilites are neatly slotted into three categories: Friendly, Devious or Aggressive. This means that when you encounter some enemies, instead of beating them into submission, you can also get them excited about how cool your group of explorers is! Or you can seduce them (even if your enemies are a group of llamas). Or you can insult them and tell them that they stink like rotten fish. No matter which option you choose, the game still plays out like a typical combat situation. The enemies lose ""spirit"" rather than health, but in terms of gameplay mechanics it's exactly the same. Thankfully, Abbey Games managed to still make the system interesting and distinct by letting the Friendly, Devious, Aggressive element work out like Rock, Paper, Scissors. How many actions of one type you take influences the overall mood the two parties of the encounter have. Different moods are weaker and stronger to others, and give you buffs or expose you to specific attacks. It'll be a while until you actually pick up on the intricacies of the system and learn when exactly in a turn to use a specific kind of ability, which strategy works best against a specific enemy or how to compose a team to suit a specific playstyle you might want to go for (there's certainly a very strong RPG element to the game, especially in how you compose your team, and the interactions and backstories you imagine for the characters having been put together in specific combinations).The story encounters meanwhile, give you little well-written flavor texts about your explorers discovering an ancient crypt or a well-hidden forest grove. They can be a funny showcase for your team's personality to shine, as well as intriguing mysteries you'll be excited to uncover. You're often given choices on what to do, but the focus here isn't morality, it's your character's individual strengths and abilities. An Archeologist character may be able to decipher some glyphs, whereas an Athlete may be able to quickly make a run for it and escape traps in case the aforementioned Archeologist didn't manage to decipher those glyphs quite right after all. You're always given a percentage for how high your character's chance of success in a challenge will be (based on their skill level), which helps you make an informed choice. Then, you'll see that chance of success or failure play out on the Adventure Wheel. Which is awesome. It's so awesome. Much like in a game show, you're watching and waiting for a wheel to land on the spot that ensures your characters success. And sometimes, it ends up being so, so close. It really is a genius addition to the game and makes the story encounters that much more exciting, as you wait with bated breath, hoping your character won't fail and possibly risk the success your entire expedition.After you've made it to the end of an expedition, you'll be taken to a world map. Here, you can track your overall progress on the quest to become the most Renowned Explorer (which is your endgame goal, as well as a highscore you climb) and select which expedition to take upon next, but also spend the resources you've gained on your previous trips. At the University, you can research papers, which give you various buffs and traits, such as having more supplies available. You can also gather up an Entourage that will teach your explorers various skills or give them certain rewards for exploring specific areas or completing encounters in a specific way. Finally, you can buy items that your characters can equip and gain various stats or skills from.It sounds like a lot. And it is, but the game never felt overwhelming to me. It eases you in and you slowly get to discover how all the pieces of the game fall together, learning more and more with each playthrough. Yeah, in case you missed it on the store page, the game features permadeath and the maps you explore are randomly generated in typical roguelite fashion. But you totally can play the game without permadeath, if you prefer that. I found that it adds to the game. It encourages you to try out new team combinations, and having characters of different skill sets means you get different options to choose from in encounters, leading to new stories and discoveries. Also, with each expedition you take a character on, you work towards unlocking them as a team captain, giving you unique advantages. Yeah, if you get far into the game and your expedition fails, it's disappointing. But having that threat there also makes the expeditions all that more exciting. Plus, despite its many layers, the game plays very quick and fast, once you've gotten used to it. It's a great game to hop into and just play for a few minutes, taking only a couple of turns (although you'll want to keep playing for longer). I played the game on my Surface while riding the bus! That's how easy it is to jump in and out and how addictive and engrossing it is.Definitely pick up the DLC though. Eventually you will get to a point where you'll have already seen a bunch of the encounters, and so having two new expedition locations as well as new event types to spice up your adventures really adds a lot to the game (and I'm super excited for whatever DLC the developers will put out next). Even if yeah, the game moves fast enough that going through things you've seen before does not feel tedious (unlike, say, moving between the opening missions in Sunless Sea).To sum it all up, Renowned Explorers: International Society is fantastic. It's incredibly charming, thanks to some lovely artwork and funny writing, but also the unique setting and ideas. It's quick to learn and hard to master, and incredibly addictive and enjoyable to play. My playtime in the game kept going up and up, and it always left me with a smile, because it's simply one of the most engaging and joyful games I've played. I love it, and I can only highly recommend it to anyone interested in the setting or gameplay.One final anecdote: One of the characters you can play in the game is a child magician. Another character is an old teacher. If you pick the child magician as your team's leader and put that teacher on the team, you'll discover that oh hey, she now has -1 Spirit because, ""Ugh, I can't believe I'm being led by a child. I'm a teacher, not a babysitter."" It made me laugh out loud when I first saw it, and it's the perfect example of the game's humor and charm to me.			"

												This was definitely one of the best games I’ve bought last year. It’s a strategy game with turn-based combat and resource management, great replayability and an active developer to boot, who’s working on a big update at the moment (January 2016).The gameYou assemble a team of three explorers that you send on five expeditions in the quest of becoming the most renowned explorers. To become “renown” you need to find treasures but also resources that enable you to attract an entourage, conduct research, and buy equipment in between the expeditions. And of course, you also need to survive the encounters.You can play in two modes; one lets you make saves, the other ends with your death. The latter is the way it is meant to be played and, in my opinion, the only way to play it. If you want to ruin the game for you, use save-scumming. Your team: The first step is to assemble your team. You can choose between 20 diverse characters with very unique skills and perks that belong to one of four classes (scientist, scout, fighter, speaker). The combination of classes, skills and perks that you have in your team can greatly influence your success in the game. There isn’t one character that is just better than the rest, one character can do great in one team and be a bit useless in the next, and depending on the strategy you want to follow during the main part of the game, you might need a different combination of classes anyway. Trying out new teams is a big part of what makes this game so much fun and adds a lot of replayability.The expeditions: You can choose between a few destinations that all have their unique styles, events, treasures to find, and requirements. The destinations are procedurally generated, you move FTL-style from node to node, using supplies as “fuel”, and are confronted with different events or encounters. There is a big variety of events that are also influenced by which classes and perks you have in your team and the choices you’ve made, so it doesn’t get boring fast. I’ve played over 75 hours by now and I still get events I haven’t seen before and I’ve only found half of the unique treasures in the game, so there is a lot to keep you interested. Some events require luck, where you have a certain percentage to succeed based on the skills and perks of your characters. There’s also luck involved in the events that you get, some of the rare ones can be great if you find them, although they usually also involve a severe penalty if you fail. The encounters: Turn-based combat that reminded me of X-Com. There’s a lot of depth to the combat system, much more than immediately obvious. Your characters and your enemies have three main classes of attacks, friendly, devious and aggressive. The type of attack you and your enemies use influence the overall mood during the fight, e.g. if you are both devious, the mood is tense, if they are friendly and you are aggressive, the mood is brutal. Some of these moods can be beneficial to you, e.g. give you more defence, while others can be negative. So, manipulating the mood by the attack-types you choose is very important. Equally important is mood management of your characters. A friendly attack can leave your character in an impressed mood, which lowers your defence against speech attacks. So you might need to use a friendly attack on your own team member to heal them and change their mood to confident, which adds 25% to their aggressive attack. Obviously, you can use the same principle against your enemies, by using attacks that put them in moods which provide debuffs. And finally, sometimes you want to end the fight in a specific mood because you’ll get a bonus if you do. All of these effects are explained in excellent tooltips that you can access during the encounter, there are no hidden effects, very little luck is involved and a lot of strategy. Great! You might “win” the game by just doing your thing and ignoring all these details but on higher difficulty and during the more difficult expeditions you will have a very hard time if you don’t use the moods to your advantage. In-between expeditions: During an expedition you earn collect, campaign, and science tokens that you can exchange for gold, status and research points after the expedition and use to upgrade your equipment, conduct research and hire an entourage. Equipment can give you more perks and/or add defence or offence stats. Research lets you get more of the resource that you want to focus on, can give you more supplies, can give you extra bonuses if you end fights in a specific mood, etc. Status lets you hire an entourage which will let you get more out of your tokens and can also provide you with more perks. The success of your overall strategy (which destinations do you want to visit, do you want to focus on a specific resource, ...) will be very much influenced by the choices you make here.Conclusion: Fun game that requires a lot of strategy and a bit of luck (although it is very rare that you’re getting completely screwed over by RNG), with more depth to it than you’d think. You can easily finish one game in one evening, although if you’re like me you’ll likely want to start a new one immediately. The only drawback is that there could be more destinations, but as the developers are already working on a big update, I'm hopeful that this will be fixed soon. And as I still haven't seen everything there is to see after 75 hours of gameplay, I can't really complain too much, anyway.I wholeheartedly recommend this game.If you like this game, there is a DLC available:Renowned Explorers: More To Explore			"

												Renowned explorers is simply a FTL-like with the option to save (if you choose at the beginning).There are several similar games, Skyshine's Bedlam is a postapocalyptic version, and Curious Explorers is the same theme with different combat.I give Renowned Explorers a 6 out of 10. I think it's worth playing but only after the others.Pros:+ Excellent graphics & art.+ Decent writeup.+ Good interface.+ Very good atmosphere.+ The non-exploration management screen works very well.Cons:- The original challenge system with befriending or demoralizing enemies isn't as interesting as a simple combat. I just hope they just scratch it in the future and add interesting combat abilities.- The characters aren't as varied as they look.- The ability checks are just dumb.			"

												Once you get past the seemingly torturous tutorial which tries to convince you that this is a game of depth and intrigue, you find you that it is, actually, very deep and full of intrigue. While the screenshots might make you think that this is another 4X like Civilization (which is actually why I bought it), it is in fact more like the critically acclaimed XCOM series. If you like rougelikes and XCOM, this is your game.There are various nuances to figure out and you'll easily find yourself immersed in the world. The graphics might be a bit amateur but don't let that put you off. This is a highly replayable game with a lot of content and thankfully not too much RNG outside of exploration. Combat is very consistent and once you understand the different variables, it becomes predictable whist still challenging.			"

												I've binged this for the past few days and dont regret a thing. It's a lot of fun, really funny and best of all it's challenging in a way that DOESNT leave you frustrated like some other challenging games do. Every failure feels like a step in the right direction and every success feels well earned. This is of course talking about ""Adventure"" mode which has a one save one life sort of deal (and is the recommended method of play) but having played Discovery mode as well, which is much easier and somewhat more forgiving, I'd say it's a game for anyone.One of my top recommendations <3			"

												Wonderful game, a joy to play.Hand pick your team of 3 from 20 colorful fighters, scientists, diplomats, and scouts with a wide variety of backgrounds and abilities.  Explore mysterious maps and overcome both text-based skill check challenges and turn-based combat.  Use charm, guile, sheer brute force, or any combination to win over, scare off, or pulverize your enemies as you search for treasure, gather resources and, most importantly, work to uncover the mysteries of the lost world.  But be ready for anything - relying too much on a single strategy will leave you wide open against its ""rock, paper, scissors"" vulnerability.Did you play FTL?  Of course you did.  Renowned Explorers has a very similar structure, in which each expedition is like a ""sector"".  There are numerous points of interest and limited supplies, forcing you to carefully manage where your explorations take you.A new addition to the formula is the downtime between expeditions.  Return to London, write research papers, shop for better equipment, gain an entourage, share your findings with prestigious universities.  Fine tune your team to optimize for your particular goals.  (Example: my first team was led by a scientist, and geared towards collecting research, gathering followers and unlocking buffs to magnify the rewards from scientific challenges.)RPG elements are not fantastically deep, but satisfy quite well enough in context.  Like FTL, this is a game made to buzz through half a dozen adventures, build up to a final tough confrontation, roll credits and start again with a new team and/or on a higher difficulty.Just about worth it full price, a no-brainer on sale.  Play it!			"

												This is a great fun game with possibly the best and most innovative turn-based combat I have ever played. Ever had the feeling you are just pressing the same attacks in the same order? Well not in Renowned Explorers. The unique combination of categories of attacks (attack, deceitful, friendly) + the overall mood of the combat which alters the effetiveness of attacks + the mood of the individual targets makes for an ever changing experience. The strategic placement on the map of zones that buff your characters plus obstacles adds another layer. Seriously there is nothing else like it.The game is presented in a fun cartoon style that keeps it light and fresh with skill challenges being clearly labelled and then resolved via a spinning wheel of randomisation. I highly recommend Renowned Explorers: International Society and the DLC More to Explore. Well worth your time. Fun but with depth, it is a cracking combination.			"

												The first thing you notice about the game is that it's gorgeous.  Everything from environments to characters to animations are lovingly and wonderfully designed.Gameplaywise, it's also engaging.  Watching the map unfold as you trot from location to location is always a treat.  There's a huge variety of events as well.  I'm still finding new events, and get excite when I find a new treasure.  If you don't normally like roguelikes, don't worry!  You can play the whole game on ""Explorer"" mode, and restart any expedition you fail, with no loss.  This is great for finding all of the treasures in the game, some of which are deviously hidden and going after them can completely change the way you perform your expedition.Enconters/battles are awesome as well,  Not only do you get to admire the characters close-up, but there's a surprising amount of tactical depth, using emotions to buff, debuff, and exploit weaknesses.  in fact, how you battle a boss can affect the boss's behavior and even the outcome of the event.

												Funny characters, a challenging game-world and just the right amount of RNG make RE:IS an amazing game to decompress and have a nice time. Choose your team of explorers and try to become the most renowned explorer in the world. The Battle-System is unique, in a sense that you can choose to attack by compliment, insult or violence. Depending on that the mood changes and certain attacks are more or less effective. Gather bonuses that help you, or don't. Live through hilarious camp-fire-stories. Achievements are so diverse, that trying to accomplish them all will keep you busy for a while. Treasures are as diverse, allowing you to play the same map over and over again, finding new treasures and outcomes of situations. All in all, it's a complex game with funny characters and a good storyline. It's fun to play and replay. Updates have been frequent and there has been free content added since I started playing. Definitely one of the games I do not regret buying.			"

												This was a surprising one.Found this game in my feed, and was immediately interested by its colorful art and the promise of travelling (as a country-bound American, I fix my travelling bug by books or other media). With a Fire Emblem-like combat system, if a bit more complicated, it is reminiscent of that series if you're a fan, with a rock-paper-scissors combat mechanic and turn-based combat; however, it operated on hexagons as opposed to squares.Renowned Explorers is extremely quirky and sets out a number of different ways to resolve any conflict, and it's entirely possible to do so without spilling blood (tears are still a distinct possibility however.) There is one boss fight where my crew complemented and hugged their way from the grips of a vengeful ghost pirate and convinced him to abandon his vendetta. At the same time, there were instances when poor Tibetan demons that just wanted to tease and blow raspberries at you got their fair share of mutilation from my crew, which had low speech defense and needed to get rid of them ASAP. This game is also surprisingly deep, with an intricate combat system with an aforementioned rock-paper-scissors mechanic that can be buff or debuff your team depending on how you behave during the fight by ""Moods"", which will give you different opportunities or force you to rethink strategy. For example, it could give you -25 speech defense, or it could make physical attacks +50% more effective. To beat the game you have to learn how to manipulate these moods. It has art style that is pleasing to the eye, is surprisingly esoteric, a bit of history thrown in, and best of all, your arch nemesis is a pompous, cheating Frenchman which you must best to beat the game in time.This game is a hidden gem, I highly recommend.

												At the moment I'm writing this, a day after release, there are 22 positive reviews and 0 negative of Renowned Explorers. I won't break the streak. This game is pure, unadulterated awesome. It's fun, interesting, challenging, amusing and very pretty.... Let's back up a bit. Renowned Explorers is a roguelike, clearly inspired by FTL. It has a similar ""decide where to go, solve text-based encounters, fight occassionaly"" structure, but it is so much better. If you got discouraged by FTL or couldn't get into it (like me: I bought FTL ages ago, but it just lost my interest each time I tried to play), RE:IS might just be the game for you. Why is it better than FTL?- It is breathtakingly beautiful. The crew members and the opponents they encounter are wonderfully designed, well-animated and also exceedingly funny.- Your crew (three explorers) have so much personality. IT is coveyed by art (how much personality can there be in a simply attack animation) and by their reactions in an encounter. Say, if you have a very greedy crew member, they may just refuse to leave a treasure, even if it is risky.- The plot is much more fun, at least for me - I really feel annoyance at our heroes' opponents.- The encounter/fighting system is really interesting. It occurs on a tactical, hex based map, with varying terrain (e.g., some terrain heals characters standing on it) and interesting mood system. Every ability you use influences the mood of your team, and so does every opponent's action. The interplay between your mood and the opponent's mood can strengthen you or weaken, and furthermore most bosses have interesting reactions to a type of ability. For example, a Big Important Nun gets into her Condemn the Heretics mode if you try to use Aggression on her.- You can play it in hardcore (here: adventure) mode, without retrying failed ancounters, or you can choose a casual approach, with free saving and retrying failed encounters. - Very varied content: every expedition our explorers can go on is different.- Very funny writing.- Cheerful and happy. Even when you loose, you laugh.All in all, 10/10, great impulsive purchase, can I get an expansion or two?			"

												Well I just suffered my first crash after playing for about 5 hrs straight. And thats likely due to me getting cocky and clicking along faster then the game could count all my treasures! Might as well take a moment to rate this game up and tell evereyone I know to go get it. A hilarious take on turnbased/rpg. This game gives you a great tutorial and helps lay out the intricacies, of which there are many. This title bring a variety of upgradeable or unlockable traits for the 20 some odd characters you can unlock and upgrade. I really think this IndianaJones type of take on the Xcom type of game genre knocks the ball out of the park. You can fight your way through enemies, insult them and hurt theuir feelings so they give up the will to resist you, or you can just tell them how great they are so they give you the treasures. I keep upgrading my squad for aspecific type of attack, then the game gives me the option to sing to the enemy or tickle attack them and I can't help but click that option. It's still on a discount if you have Reus so i think you should consider adding this title.  Excelsior!Still cannot get over how much this ridiculous game makes me crack up!			"

												    I have just finished my first playthrough but I can't wait to start another. There are just so many choices you need to make and more importantly, you have no ways back. Each choice will make a difference more or less and it's the combination of multiple choices that makes this game fairly compelling.    The graphics is okay, as well as the music. I mean, they can be improved in some way but it doen't matter very much for a strategy game like this. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the lack of an detailed guidance, for instance, which careers can gain an advantage in certain challenges and how much the advantage is, what the attributes of different equipments are. In that case, I'll have something that I can refer to when I'm about to make a choice rather than waste my time on restarting a game to figure them out.    Overall, this is a decent game. It's not gorgeous in terms of graphics but it's definitely absorbing and addictive in gameplay. I just like it.			"

Plenty of treasures and achievements to chase that would take you dozens of wins to get. Hoping there will eventually be an expansion or DLC with more expeditions.			"

												RE:IS is excellent at what it tries to do, but might not be right for everyone.RE:IS is highly polished, runs flawlessly on Win10 and is a refreshing take on D&D style games where you send a group of explorers into dungeons/wilderness in search of treasure. With cartoonish charm, they have reduced death and violence and substituted  manipulation, charm and seduction instead. A welcome change to killing everybody all day all night! Violence is one of 3 options. Instead of Hit Points, the battle is won when Resolve (the will to go on) is reduced to 0.With four classes to choose from, you create a team of 3 exlorers and send them on 5 expeditions, returning to town in between. In town, you improve your gear and skills and level up your toons. After 5 expeditions, the game is over. There are a few maps to choose from but not a huge number, but you can replay them with a different team, skills and gear later. There is some randomness to how the maps are generated and play, but each map is a story, and the bullet points of the story are the same each time. Each time you play the Hungarian Fort map, you are seeking The Alchemist, for example.As an older gamer, I find some of the graphics and sound effects a bit childish but simultaneously charming. And the ability to use speech instead of violence is totally overdue in this kind of game - VERY refreshing. This game will not be a life-replacement game for most people, but it is fun, solid and without any bugs that I could find. None. Very easy to get 50 hours of fun. I will probably get 200 out of it utlimately. Some people complain about the RNG, but I did not find that to be a problem. Yes, if you chose a boss fight, you might get swatted hard, but if you prepared properly and chose wisely beforehand, you will probably be OK.			"

												This game has overtaken FTL as the best roguelike in my library. That should be the only recommendation you need before buying the game, really.The combat mechanics are surprisingly deep, the 'choose-your-own-adventure-storybook' vibe is a welcome breath of fresh air and the overworld phase adds a juicy layer of long term strategy. While the amount of maps and encounters is somewhat limited, I thoroughly admire how different the encounters play out based on your party composition and prior choices. Plus, there's oodles of unique 'epic' enounters which lure you into trying them when they show up, even though you might not be fully ready for them yet. You get a *real* sense of story here, you get to know your party members in such a way that you don't skip over the text of every encounter, like you would in FTL after a couple of playthoughs.Don't get me wrong, while the story element is great this is still an unforgiving roguelike if you play it on that difficulty setting. Your first few games should probably not be played on that difficulty setting. But after two games, when you have a feel for the combat, dive into the richest, most colorful and most tactical roguelike of recent years.The only criticisms I could make against this game are a slightly clunky overworld map and a poor optimization of the graphic engine (a 2D game should be 100% smooth and polished, not 98%). But those  are such minor complaints that I feel petty for mentioning them. This is an expertly crafted game worth every penny of its low cost.			"

												Renowned Explorers is incredibly quirky and unique in its execution. This game is a hell of a lot of fun. While it could use a lot of polish, the game is fundamentally a blast to play, with the random element and number of explorers, the game has an incredible amount of replayability. I did a full review of it on my channel, here

												I didn't really know what I was getting into when I bought this. I saw it was made by the creators of Reus and was immediately in. I wasn't disappointed.I've played two games so far: strictly devious, strictly friendly - chose the same areas and had a different experience both times (albeit with minor overlap). Anna didn't have time for shenanigans and punched a monkey in the face, and Yvonne became the unintentional leader of a flock of sheep. Combat is interesting and lethal if you aren't careful with your choices. Pay attention to the battlefield moods. Still learning how to use the emotions in my favour (excited is great for speech!). Would like more carry-over benefits (other than campfire stories), but understand it could hinder replayability.			"

												Good game if you like something different other than the same ol same ol. Uses some unique combat mechanics that adds a fresh take on the genre. Dev is actively supporting the game in the forums and by more updates. (Also made the game Rues).Give it a try and you will be surprised. Just take the time to learn the mechanics and then have a good time.			"

												I don't write many reviews, but I'll heartily recommend this game.I've been playing it a lot since I got it as part of the Humble Bundle. 12 hours played so far and I'll be back at it shortly.This is part board game and part old Sid Meier style honestly. It's addictive and fun, and definitely has a one more turn feel to it. Replayability is huge. The turn based strategic combat is familiar enough to be accessible, quirky enough to be different and deep enough to stay interesting.This is definitely a game worth checking out.			"

												Ivan was an all-beard mountain of a man who only wanted to make friends. Sadly, fists were Ivan's strong suit, no matter how much he thumbed through his translation book, the captain would always eventually just get fed up and order him to Smash. Then, one night on expedition a beguiling young count took a liking to Ivan.One thing lead to another and now Ivan's a vampire, otherworldly charms making up for his tenuous grasp of the English language.You'll see a lot of stories like these in the reviews section because this game does an excellent job of creating them in a way that feels fun and unique. You can RE:IS to FTL without the spaceships, but that ignores all the wit and charm put into this game's world, mechanics and storytelling. Solid writing, intriguing combat system, and an excellent gameplay loop packed into trim chunks easily playable on a lunch break.			"

												Honestly, this is a beautifully made rougelite game. Before buying it, I was apprehensive as to how fun or engaging the combat would be. I was proven wrong thankfully, the combat is a wonderful blend of humour, turn-based strategy and tactics. The mood system is incredibly fun to utilize, and the game creates wonderful tension with it's semi-random elements. The treasure system in the game is rich and rewarding, encouraging an addictive 'Just one more time...' play. Overall, this game is brilliant for it's genre, and I would personally give it a 9.5/10...(Mainly because I shy away from 10/10 scores)You should vote for this one as 'Just 5 more minutes' award			"

												This is very good...like a more balanced and cartoony FTL. Not as brutal as your average rogue-like, with difficulty levels and even (gasp!) the option to enable normal saving, REIS seems more interested in entertaining than frustrating. Not that you can't make the game brutally hard, it just isn't required.Combat is rock-paper-scissors with an intriguing emotional system overlaid. You can kill enemies with kindness, deviousness, or just...you know...kill them. Depending on the enemy, the scenario, and your captain/crew, each approach can lead to a variety of outcomes.The world map and island map both recall board games, in a positive way. Potential for strategic combinations and tactics is high. The animations, characters, and UI are well designed and appealing. Good stuff, dev!I bought it on sale, however, had I known what I was getting, I would have prolly paid full price. This is a real indie gem, and I recommend buying it.			"

												Renowned Explorers: International Society is an interesting blend of the rogue-like and strategy genres that sees you controling a team of three explorers going around the world collecting treasures in the hopes of becoming the World's Most Renowned Explorer. Likes:- a very unique combat system. You can choose to either aggressively dominate your enemies, insult them into despair, or become best friends with them. however, diffrent attiudes can easily wipeout your whole team. e.g, if you try to be friendly with an enemy who is aggressive towards you, you will suffer a armour debuff, making it more likely for them to hit you for high damage.-The characters. With 20 playable characters who each have their own playstyle, strengths and weakness, every run is different -Traits. each character has a trait/s that determine your chances in certain situations, for example, if there is a gaint boulder blocking your way, a character who has an athlete trait has a greater chance of succeding in that situation than someone who does not. in addition to that, characters can learn more traits through leveling,allowing you to customize your team to what you think will suit you best.-The Challenge.  By moving throughout your expeditions, you use up your supplies. once they are all gone, your team will start getting debuffs like ""-40% attack power"". This will mean you have to think ahead of time if you should go straight to the final destination of the expdetition or explore some more to earn treasure at the cost of stats.-Skill will win the battle. almost every attack in the game will hit at hundred percent, this includes enemy attacks aswell. even though it is a rogue-like game, a good strategy and equipment layout will always beat out sheer luckDislikes:-Frame rate problems. Throughout playing RE:IS, frame rate seems to vary everywhere. you could be fighting at sixty frames one moment and have it drop to 30 the next. while this doesnt bother me to much, i can see how others who play   might find this irratating.-The expeditions. Overall, there are 9 different expdeitions to go on, 12 if you count the first three starting expeditons that you dont get to chose from. while that seems like a quite a bit, some are very similar, for instance,  the Carribean expdetition mainly features pirates and monkeys and ""The Emerged Island"" offers voodoo pirates and voodoo monkeys, bascially reskinned pirates and monkeys.Overall, I Highly recommend this game if your into rouge-like and strategy games. It has enough skill based combat, varity, and challenge to make it a game that deserves a spot in your steam library			"

												Review for this, I won't be afraid to use the word ""Masterpiece"", is long overdue. It is an amazingly competent and enjoyable game, on many levels. In this day and age this is very refreshing. And yes, I didn't repeat myself here. It is a game both extremely enjoyable overall, yet also beautifully designed both for the casual players and for the die hard fans of such games. Truly, this is one of the hidden gems and one of the top games that came in 2015.But enough baseless praising. This game is essentially rogue-lite done right. There is no outgame progression, aside from opening new possible ""captains"" for your team of three. Which means you have as good of a chance of finishing it on your first try, as in any other attempt, if we disregard your accumulating personal experience with the game's mechanics. Captain roles can be opened in any order player desires and all characters can be used from the start as simple companions. While it may be argued that some of the locked captains are very strong, starting choices are good enough, desired captain can be unlocked in as much as one playthrough and mostly captains provide strong yet diverse bonuses to your party. Those bonuses, together with the choice of other two members and your playstyle form noticeable diversity in possible ways of playing.There is some imbalance between usability of skills, but even that is kept in check with the ability of the player to choose his own adventures after the random starting one. You get a perfect basic description of each adventure, stating what playstyle and skills are perfered for its completion. And if something is going horribly wrong - you can always choose simpler expeditions after the second one, if you feel that your luck isn't as shining as you expected it to be. I can't emphasize enough how ingenious the gamedesign is in this diamond of a game, which tries to contain possible randomness and imbalance on every step, ultimately giving player every tool he needs to finish the game, bar exceptionally bad luck.The gameplay revolves around series of expeditions both with Turn Based ""overworld map"" and Turn Based combat. Your endgame mission is to become, as the title suggests, the most Renowned Explorer in your club. And yet in another ingenious move, the ""club"" isn't some sort of faceless entity, leaderboard with only you as an existing figure. You do meet other explorers ocasionally, and may interact with them. You have different resources to both make use of and take note of. Three basic resources (Status, Research and Gold) both provide points for the end game and are spent between expeditions on enhancing your resource gathering, recieving different upgrades from a Scientific tree or buying equipment for your team. There are also Supplies and Resolve. First is usually spent while moving during expedition on the overworld map. Should you run out of supplies, you start incurring drastic debuffs, though you still can try to get few last items before facing the boss of this particular expedition. Resolve is lost if you fail certain events, take unnecessary risks or lose all HP on one of the teammates during combat. Should you squander all of your Resolve - you lose this game.The game is using simple but well thought out system of ""Friendly-Devious-Aggressive"" playstyle, with most characters being addept at combination of the two out of three. WIth this comes the only real gripe I can possibly muster with this game - the Attack/Defence stats for Friendly/Devious are the same, yet for Aggressive are different. Basically that means, that in many cases you are attacked by Speeches and are attacking by Speeches, shadowing the necessity of Aggressive builds. Developers try, admirably I must say, to provide decent balance between those, but ultimately I must admit - it is nigh impossible to tackle this issue properly. Still, this system works extremely well most of the time, providing noticeable differences in playstiles even with the same party members used differently.Overworld map of expedition is abundant with events and challenges, of which the turn based combat is anything but prevalent (except for expeditions specifically designed for aggressive parties). In many cases, combat can be circumvented. In other cases, you often can gain an advantage before important battles if you have certain non-combat skills at your disposal. But that is not to say that combat isn't important. Boss of each expedition will still be in your way, and each battle won provides a hefty combat bonus to one of the party members until the end of the expedition. Still, you can gain big advantages before quite a few boss battles using the non-combat skills, usually in different ways. And the game usually allows you to see the chances of success for each possible choice before making the ultimate decision. It might not be too far stretched to say that the Overworld experience on its own is worth the money this game asks.But there is also a turn based combat. One would assume that it would be a mere add-on, poorly executed and without any time invested in it. Far from it, turn based combat makes full use of ""Friendly-Devious-Aggressive"" trio, making it a simple yet very important core mechanic. The battlefield is reigned by ""mood"". Mood being a combination of most used attitude of your party and that of the enemies. Depending on the combination, it provides different bonuses. For example, being Devious against Aggressive opponent provides you with +Dodge chance, while double Aggressive leads to a bonus Devious damage for whoever uses it. As you can tell from it, certain combinations are beneficial, and the mirrored ones are detrimental to your party. Not only that, but using Attitude attacks (majority of the attacks are those) can quickly shift the Mood towards different combination, especially when finishing off an opponent. That leads to an interesting tense combat, especially if you're getting the best reward from finishing the battle with the Attitude that would put the battle in a detrimental to you Mood. Many bosses shift their behaviour, if not all of their attacks, based on the Attitude you may use. And do not fear, most enemies contain a simple yet sufficient explanation of their strong points, weaknesses and possible big changes should you use particular Attitude attacks against them.What else is there to praise? Art style is somewhat simplistic, yet vivid and pleasing. Animations are hilarious at times, which greatly helps with slight repetitiveness of the gameplay. Music and sound effects are much the same - simplistic at times, yet immerse you greately into the overall experience. The game oozes of love and passion that was put into it by the developers.Not only that, but noticeable update to gameplay came out a while ago, completely free of charge. In this update they made some very drastic changes to certain aspects, like Research tree, Mood bonuses, various debuffs and characters. And you know what? The game became all the better. Developer that are both brave enough to change a lot, yet competent enough to make it ultimately worthwhile? On top of that, humble enough to provide it free of charge, when many others would make it a DLC (and do note, it would be worth money in my book)? I am baffled. People who made this game deserve all the praise and spotlight they can get, and even more on top of  that.===================================================================Verdict: I can give only one recommendation here. Watch the video of the game. If you enjoy what you see - the game is exactly that, if not much more. It is worth every penny in its price. Damn, its worth even more than that for the sheer competence the developer displayed. I am extremely saddened, that it somewhat went under the radar. It deserves much more attention than what it has.			"

												Definately worth buying. The game is funny, entertaining, sometimes frustrating and demanding but most of all it presents a brand new concept. Have you ever want to be an explorer? To discover forgotten treasures and artifacts? To fight mummies and... nuns? If yes (or if nuns made you confused) do not think twice! The Renowned Explorers is a turn-based strategy game with a role-play style and well written droll story. You need to think about your next movement, about your opponents' strengths and weaknesses, you need to consider the bonuses and sometimes you just need to be lucky.  Do not let the graphics trick you. This is a decent and complex strategy game and you will  need 30+ hours to learn its mechanics for sure. Developers work hard on this game, they are in touch with the players and they make a lot of challenges and additional events. This game brings something fresh I have not played before. Worth taking a go. 10/10 would slap nun again			"

												Let me start by saying I love the theme and idea of this game, where you are tasked with becoming a 19th century explorer in a cartoony world full of angry nuns, pirates, ghosts, wolves, etc., who love to bring your expeditions to an early end. With that being said, however, there is a lot to bother the would-be explorer. For starters, don't be fooled by the cartoony, zany exterior, this game plays hard, even for a rogue-like. I don't mind permadeath, per se, as long as it feels fair. On normal to classic difficulty in adventure mode this game will whip your♥♥♥♥♥ I found that playing on normal in discovery mode (more forgiving) was much more fun over all. The gamemakers love to tout that you have to master the mechanics, but honestly the game isn't really that deep over all. Attacks only fall in three categories and there are only a handful of emotions. The deepness of the game is questionable, the cheapness of it at times is not. Now, after getting that big huge dump on the game out of the way, what is good about it? Is it worth buying? I say it is worth buying, but only at a discount of 50% or more. There is fun to be had in this one, especially in exploring the different lands. Still exploration only runs so deep, you can see all the areas in a 2-3 hours, probably even less time if you're real good. For most, discovery will stop there. A couple of things that may keep folks coming back is the plethora of different characters and all the treasures to find. The game is only really randomized to a certain extent, so for many I would guess that a playthrough or two is going to be where folks check out. Warts and all, I have a lot of respect for this scrappy game company. I would love to see how they might improve on a next iteration of this game, because like I said I really enjoyed the theme.			"

												Renowned Explorers is a game about the golden days of scientific research and exploration in the late 19th century, when all you needed to get funded was a willingness to travel to the Scottish Highlands and hurl insults at sheep until their will was broken.Renowned Explorers: International Society is difficult to pin down into a single genre, though in very broad strokes it's half resource management, half turn based strategy.  The premise of the game is that you belong to a group of scientists and explorers, and each game sees you setting out with a group of three explorers of your choice to travel the globe, visiting exotic locales and collecting treasures.  You've been sleighted by another member of the society, and over the course of 5 expeditions you have to collect more Renown than him in order to win.  During expeditions, you manage your resources as you travel from node to node, dealing with events and occasionally finding yourself battling strange locals and/or wildlife.Each game begins with you assembling your party, selecting 3 explorers from 20 available and electing one to be your Captain (Which provides a unique perk for the game).  Characters are broken up into 4 classes, and each character come with a unique mix of actions, skills, and upgrades.  The crew select screen is where the feel of each run will be decided, and there's a wide variety of party types available.  You want to befriend enemies to death while accumulating prodigious amounts of reasearch?  There's a crew for that.  Do you desire to do nothing more than smack your enemies until gold pops out?  There's a crew for that, too.From there, you're taken to the expedition.  On the expedition map, you travel from node to node to collect as many resources as possible, keeping an eye out for potential treasure.  The majority of nodes with resources available usually feature a challenge that you can choose to have an explorer attempt.  Challenges have percent chance to succeed/fail, often modified by the traits and class of the explorer chosen.  As you would expect, challenges offer greater rewards if successful, though often carry some sort of penalty if you fail (Anything from a minor stat loss for the rest of the expedition to losing resource tokens). You obviously want to maximize your resources gained by hitting many nodes, but your ability to do so is limited by supplies, so it's important to exercise judgment and figure out the optimal way to travel through an expedition (if you do run out, you being to incur rather large stat penalties).  Not all nodes have challenges, however. Some are empty, and some feature encounters.Encounters are where the meat of the game lies, and probably the most time consuming part of any run.  The overlying battle system is turn based, with each encounter utilizing a procedurally generated hex-based map.  You move your three units, and then the enemy moves theirs, etc. etc.   You obviously want to be as efficient as possible when dispatching the opponents (Who often outnumber you), and the best way to do this is through EMOTIONS!This is the hook: the mood system.  You and your opponent each have a certain attitude in an encounter, which generates a mood that can be advantageous (or not) for you.  The three attitudes are Aggressive, Friendly, and Devious, and they exist in a rock-paper-scissors relationship.  For example, Aggressive beats Friendly but is weak to Devious.  So, if you are against a Friendly opponent, it is in your best to interest to generate and maintain an Aggressive attitude since it provides bonus Speech Defense.  However, if you generate a Devious attitude in contrast to their Friendly one, you'll take a Speech Defense penalty (which is bad).  You can generate a better attitude by utilizing attacks of that attitude, contributing points until it rolls over.  So in the case of a Friendly enemy, you want to use Friendly or Aggressive attacks until you switch to that attitude, generating a less disadvantageous attitude.Friendly/Devious attacks also have an emotion component to them, which can provide buffs or debuffs to a target enemy depending on their ""state of mind"", which is essentially a meter that goes up with Friendly attacks and down with Devious attacks.  There's a lot to manage and it's a ton of fun, and there's a surprising depth that doesn't come through in screenshots.I'm skipping over a lot in the interest of brevity, though I hope I've communicated the core mechanics.  I haven't even touched on the preparation stage, or how resources work, or skills.  This is very board game-like in the sense that the rules and mechanics are simple, but the way everything interacts creates a good amount of depth that never feels clunky or counter-intuitive.  While the game rewards good decision making and tactical acumen, the most important thing is developing mastery over the game.  You never fail because the game was unfair to you, or because you got unlucky.  Every failure will be your fault, even if you don't know it at that time, and the best way to improve is to learn something from your failures and carry it with you into the future.While the core mechanics are sound and fun, the package it comes in is incredibly charming.  The art is great and fits the overall feel of the game, the writing is funny through and through, and the music is enjoyable.  It look like a fun, light-hearted game about being an explorer in the late 19th century, and it certainly feels like it.  I love this game, and for me it scratches an itch that only FTL has ever been able to.  Each run takes about 2-3 hours from start to finish, and it's incredibly easy to drop in, form a crew, and set out if you have a bit of time to kill.  I'd also like to give props to the dev team, who are active on the forum and communicate with the fans.  They're constantly tweaking and balancing stuff even now, which is massively appreciated.  The game is better than it was when I first bought it because of their efforts, and it was incredibly enjoyable even then.I suspect that people who enjoy board game sensibilities or solid turn based strategy will get the most out of this title, though I suspect anyone who just enjoys resource management games would find it enjoyable.WHAT I PAID FOR IT: $20.00WHAT I WOULD PAY FOR IT: $20.00All these opinions were developed playing on Classic Adventure difficulty			"

												Renowned Explorers: International Society is one of the biggest time vampires I've come across on steam. I have owned it for a little over 24 hours at the time of writing this review and I've got about 12 or so hours logged already, and I fully anticipate to log many more.Lots of possible party combinations in tandem with the uniqueness of every character and the roguelike exploration elements make for something that I just can't get tired of playing. I like to experiment and try out various combinations and and see how they turn out with different playstyles. The combat is refreshingly unique - it isn't too far removed from the type of turn based combat you'd normally see in these kinds of videogames, but it does a lot to distinguish itself from the normal with the use of moods and approach tactics and you can get rewarded for following certain tactics and moods for battles. You can write various research papers, which act as this game's tech tree, and further these rewards.There's also over 100 different treasures to find in the game's state at the time I write this review, and it sounds like they will be adding more in due time.I would like to see more expeditions, though, because the current con I have for this game is that, being a roguelike, I come across the same events too often. While there are plenty of events in each expedition, all of which are unique, this game would greatly benefit from having a wider variety of expeditions to choose from due to its nature. There are enough expeditions in the current game to keep me satisfied for a good while, though.This game is tragically overlooked and I would rate it as a must buy. There's something here for everybody.			"

												Come for the adventure, stay for the high scores, and then discover that there's still more adventure to be had.REIS is a fantastic game that takes Faster Than Light's node-based randomized exploration, adds in an Indiana Jones-esque theme of 19th century explorers and a nice cartoony artstyle, and tops it all off with some great attention for detail and design.Highly recommended if you enjoy turn-based strategy, chasing high scores and rolling dice.Not recommended if you don't like fun.

												I like this game. It's very relaxed, humorously written, and has a fun turn-based ""combat"" system which has quite a bit of depth, once you get the hang of it. The word combat is in quotes because it could be that you're all hurling compliments at each other, or taunts, rather than bullets. Or usually some mixture of the three. I liked the game right off the bat, but after a little experience, when I got the hang of how everything relates, I like it even more.The depth mainly comes from your crew, which come from a pool of available adventurers (you choose three out of I think 20), all with their own strengths and weaknesses. As they gain experience, you level them up with permanent perks and bonuses. It's a lot of fun to put together a crew, and I think it'll just get more fun as I play more (I'm only at around four hours right now), and learn more about the various crew members and level them up.

												You can see that my previous post is 2-3 days ago regarding a crash I was encountering, since my laptop is quite old. The devs helped me out on how to resolve the problem and I haven't had the time to say thanks because the game is just fantastic. It is a very niche game, combining the light-heartedness of indie games and the strategy elements of games like civ5 and Heroes, yet the result is fascinating when combined with the explorers theme. The fun thing is that you can choose to play any mode, depending on your level of concentration and time available. I even played it with my girlfriend, who hasn't any experience in turn-based strategies (or almost any games), and she enjoyed it a lot. We are doing ironman mode (no saves) on hard together now and it is going great.The game is certainly in my top3 games I would recommend to anyone due to its vast spectrum of opportunities and possibilities. Another thing of note is that it very accessible by players with zero experience in the field, yet a lot of fun for players with experience in heavy games (EU4, CK2, Victoria2, Civ~).			"

												Tactical RPG with Rogue-like elements. The combat is fun and whimsical. It was a little confusing at first, but the game really gets very interesting once you get a handle on the mechanics. Definitely worth purchasing. My only real complaint is that it could use a bit more polish, and I've run into the occasional bug (but they aren't game ending and are easily fixed)Edit:I've seen a couple reviews complain about RNG in the overworld aspect of the game. I had trouble with that at first, but if you're having significant trouble with RNG, you probably built a lousy group, or made poor character advancement decisions. on my last playthrough, about 3/4 of the time I had an option for 100% success because my group were well developed in diverse areas of expertise. Most of the time you are also given the opportunity to not take the risk also, there may be 3 options, then a 4th that basically says walk away with no reward (and no penalty).			"

You'll do pretty poorly at first as you learn the quirks of encounters, but the payoff for figuring it out is really great!  I give this game a perfect 5/7!			"

												I LOVE this game! It's fun and engaging and I keep coming back for more. It's a game about exploration, treasure hunting and beating your stupid rival to prove you are the very best. I can't beleive I didn't know about this sooner! I really like that there is more than one way to fight. I can beat the pants off my opponents, I can make snide remarks or I can be their best friend. It's a very unique way to play a turn based, and I find that it's perfect for this game. I still wish there was a run away option so I'd have a chance to come back later or not at all. I don't like that one of the modes is literally, you die, you loose forever. I'd be ok with it if there was an option to try and run away, but there's not so it feels devastating. But maybe that's how it's meant to be. Anyway, this game is full of panache and personality. 2 thumbs and a high recommendation from me.			"

												REIS is a great strategy rogue-like with lots of heart poured into the gameplay and writing. This game caters for all types, but I feel gamers who enjoy chasing high scores will particularly enjoy it. Although the game does have a slightly steep learning curve, the multiple difficulty settings and varied playable characters let players set their own difficulty. Do note the plot is window dressing for the game, so people out there who play for story might be disappointed. Having said that, each location you visit feels unique and matches thematically with the events which occur there. I'd also like to point out that the devs at Abbey Games are wonderfully active. They want to continue expanding the game through 2016 and have pushed out regular updates (both balance and content) since launch. They have community challenges on the game's Steam discussion boards which encourage fans to try different combinations of characters and scoring conditions. They also listen and discuss suggestions made by players to continue improving what's already a strong base package. REIS is a fantastic game made by fantastic devs. It is worth your time and money and I encourage anyone who is at all interested in tactical games and rogue-likes to give it a go.			"

												I didn't really know what I was getting into when I bought this. I saw it was made by the creators of Reus and was immediately in. I wasn't disappointed.I've played two games so far: strictly devious, strictly friendly - chose the same areas and had a different experience both times (albeit with minor overlap). Anna didn't have time for shenanigans and punched a monkey in the face, and Yvonne became the unintentional leader of a flock of sheep. Combat is interesting and lethal if you aren't careful with your choices. Pay attention to the battlefield moods. Still learning how to use the emotions in my favour (excited is great for speech!). Would like more carry-over benefits (other than campfire stories), but understand it could hinder replayability.			"

												Writing my very first review in support of this awesome game.9/10, best game I've played in a long while.The graphics and art are great. There are so many animations and so much work put into it. For example, every character you come across, down to the sheep have 9-10 different facial expressions depending on their mood.The music and sound effects are varied and interesting. Some of the songs I've found myself humming to after stopping playing.The controls are great. I love games that you can play solely with the mouse.The atmosphere and story is lighthearted and fun. You play a group of explorers searching the globe for rare artifacts. Think Indiana Jones. The characters (there are 20 of them) are each so unique. Rare in a roguelite game, you actually feel like they have character.The gameplay, which is the core of any gaming experience, is some of the most original I've seen in years. You have 3/4 different things going on. First you have your character selection. You choose from 3 among 20 characters. There are so many combinations and synergies here it's ridiculous. Then you have the preparation for expeditions, which is akin to X-Com. You manage your crew, giving them jobs, hiring supporters and specialists, outfitting your explorers, then sending them on expeditions. Expeditions follow an FTL-like system of branches, but unlike FTL there's more strategy involved in how you make progress. Each path costs a different amount of supplies, and you have a better idea of what your headed into. Planning your trip becomes a major strategy factor in itself. Most places you go will have branching multiple choice paths. Some of these are very in depth with numerous paths. Depending on your explorers' skills, more opportunities are available to you, making each game very different. Finally, there's the combat which is imo the best part. It's a highly original turn based tactics game where you have a rock paper scissors dynamic of friendly persuasion, devious demoralization, and of course, outright beating the crap out of the enemy. Every character has one basic skill in each of these three, with most being best at one. Then two unique moves. Usually these are very complex with multiple ways to use them. Then 1-2 unique passive moves. Oh yeah, then the passive abilities that the equipment gives you. Oh, I almost forgot, and every character, including enemies, will have different moods which influence their stats. All this combines into a tactical combat system with more depth and variety than just about any other. It's fun as hell.The only con I would give this game is that I wish there were more expeditions to go on (there's about 10 right now). But this is mitigated by the variety within each one, being randomized each playthrough. This fault is being remedied though, in that even in the short time the game's been out they've added a free one, and have more DLC planned. This is why I'm writing this review, please support this game, I want to see it thrive and expand. It's definitely worth the 20 bucks			"

												Renowned Explorers: International Society (RE:IS) is a turn-based strategy adventure roguelike. Boy is that a mouthful! I have never seen quite a game like this. RE:IS draws aspects from each of its genres and combines them into a unique experience. Upon first glance at this game it can be somewhat puzzling or appear glaring simple even. You take a team of three explorers, making one of them your captain who gets an extra perk to help you along the way, and conduct 5 expeditions across various regions around the world. Each playthrough will have its own ups and downs and no two will every be alike. At first glance the game doesnt appear to have much content. But the replayability is so high that after ~80 hours of gameplay I am still finding new treasure or trying out different strategies. There are 20 different characters to choose from. Thats 6,840 different combinations! With over a hundred treasure to collect you will find yourself sinking countless hours and playthrough into this game to master every detail. Plus the devs are constantly improving the game and adding more content!There is more than one way to play. Combat is its own unique formula utilizing a rock-paper-scissors weakness chart creating different moods that effect your team. But even this gives way to more depth after you master the basics. Perhaps that boss that is easy to defeat deviously gives a different reward if you are friendly, but becareful because friendly abilities only do half damage to him. The art and the story are both fantastic and the events continue to be amusing even after you've gone through them before. With an active community and weekly challenges there is always more strategies to try and scores to improve.If you like turn-based strategy and roguelikes this is a game for you.It quickly became one of my favorite games to play and I am still learning more and more about the secrets of hidden treasures.

It's just great to see such a good game using those kinds of game development techniques amidst endless "" PROCEDURAL OPEN WORLD SANDBOX GAME DESING"" that has been flooding the indie genre as an excuse for poor game design and balancing, you can see that the developers care by simply playing and witnessing a entertaining plot with countless subplots based on characters skills/interests, and the fact that the combat is a enjoyable ""rock paper sissors"" tatics that is very engaging.Besides i've made a mexican wrestler become a science genious while being my best fighter. 10/10.

												Visually it is great. Music is nice, and the game is original. Problem I have is that after every ""game"" (set of expeditions), you lose all progress - research, treasures found, experience gained by crew, etc. The only form of progress is the number of expeditions you complete - used to unlock more explorers as your lead team member (in future games).  Some of that makes sense, but it makes the game much more into a grind because every new game starts over from scratch. I'd at least like to see the treasure benefits persist between games. Right now - they only persist in a gallery.  I'd give it a thumbs sideways, but that isn't a choice.   If you can get it cheap, it might be worth your time, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price. Nice try, but ultimately unsatisfying.			"

												8/10! It's like...Monkey Island meets Fire Emblem meets XCOM. I am so happy this actually happened.Great example of excellent difficulty scaling, needed information is there when you mouse over them. Key information is presented very simply and neatly.Deceptively simple, but as it goes along it becomes harder than what you originally thought it would be. Lovable characters, deep and entertaining combat, and a ton of replay value because of the various characters among the 4 archetypes. Only downside I can think of is it's music which is pretty poor, it could do with a LOT more voices to achieve it's comedic approach to a turn based strategy... aaand the post expedition things to do, it could've been more interesting but it doesn't really hamper the overall experience.All that said, I really really recommend it to turn based strategy fans and other people who like the Iron Man table top roguelike style. Give these guys your support because this world need more products like this and not your tried and true rinse and repeat formulas of violence vs violence in turn based strategy.Post DLC Rating : 9/10.

												A while back there were thoughts thrown around in the games media about why a lot of games are combat based; The thoughts went into the subject of applying combat mechanics to non-combat activities -- such as dialogue, or other ways to solve a problem.This game does a fantastic job of proving that those concepts can and will work if approached right.The game really excells at just about everything. The art is great. The writing is great. The sounds and the music are great. The gameplay is great. I honestly can't think of anything major I'd even consider a downside. Even the RNG is great, and I usually hate games that rely on random dice rolls!If you think you'd enjoy well-written, witty, funny adventures with a bit of a rogue-like element and a really in-depth (yet also really simple) combat -- what're you waiting for!?

												Don't let the cutesy vibe of this title decieve you.  There... is a surprising amount of depth in this game.  Crew have 4 basic stats (phsyical/speech offense and defense) as well favoring one-two of the three combat styles (Aggressive, Friendly, Devious).  Its an important choice to either stack all of these up or keep them well balance, as using abilities will change the mood of an encounter.  Both you and your opponent have a combat ""stance/attitude,"" and the combination of them affects the fight.  If you are both friendly, then the first aggressive attack gets +50% damage! This will immediately change the mood giving you extra speec defense (agains their pansy words!), however they will often swap to aggressive themselves creating an attitude that favors devious damage... which continues the dance.  As moods flip, enemies will react differently and use different attacks/change moods themselves.  Bosses are particularly bad about gaining bonus stats when you flip to a mood that they are hte most vulnerable too.  Even worse, some ecounters are scripted to offer better rewards for completing them in a different mood.  If you aggressively defeat the bandits, you get more rewards.  If you aggressively beat up the crazed abbess, your conscientious members get wracked with guilt and suffer permament penalties!  So even if your party really sucks at deviously, you have to consider weighing the extra challenge of a predominantly devious fight against what you would give up ending it on your prefered attitude... You also normally build up ""Extra ____ when ending a fight ___!"" bonuses.  So is giving up your standard +3 coin tokens on an aggressive victory worth giving up the information/treasure/incuring the curse of ending it that way instead of another? Can you even finish this tough boss battle the ""right"" way? Again, this cutesy game has a mountain of depth!  And that is just one half of the game! While all expeditions end in a boss ""fight,"" that might be the only fight you actually perform on the entire hike.  The rest of the map has various loot and challenges that check against your parties ""abilities.""  However, even if you don't have the right ability (like beguiling or archeology), if a character has high enough stats and is the right class... the can ""brute force"" the check.  My last play through had a speaker class with ranks in beguiling and a -very- high speech score.  She was my main attacker, however she lacked any ranks in diplomacy.  When going through a latter expedition with several diplomacy checks, I found that her sky-high speech stat coupled with a natural bonus of being a ""speaker"" was enough to push those diplomacy checks into the 60-70+ range! Everyone else was easily below 20.  This is another level of balancing your party... you need to have a good spread of abilities.  Each of hte locations you can choose to embark on also favors certain abilities and resources.  Embarking into the carribean will grant a ton of research, mostly found through survivalist, naturalist, athletic challenges.  Don't expect to get much use out of an engineer or beguiler! Tactician will be of limited use... but you might find the odd ruined village to excavate.  In the transylvanian countryside, you'll need a skilled diplomat to talk down the superstitious natives and a sharp tactian to deal with all the ambushes by cultists, bandits, and wolves.  So if you lack a diplomat, you'll have to choose.  Do you go to the carribean and enjoy the easy challenges, or do you tough it out in Hungary because you need the renown it offers more than the science? On top of all of this... each cleared expedition unlocks places to spend resources.  Exploring the carribean opens up a shop in New Orleans that sells +speaking element books (extra terrify damage, extra impress damage, etc).  So again, even if you don't want that science or don't have abilities to easily traverse the place... do you still go to unlock those sweet, sweet, books? There is definitely a steep learning curve here... the creators graciously added different difficulty modes to help beginners get into the game and learn how to properly balance a party to dance between moods in combat and navigate the world map better.  In no time you'll be unlocking new captains and finding new treasures to suit different play styles! I really can't recommend the game enough.  If you are willing to put up with the difficulty curve, there is a mountain of depth and replayability here.  Each ""session"" only lasts 5 expeditions that each last maybe 30 minutes? You'll often finish off in just a few hours (or less if you die XD) before going back to the drawing board, so its not like each campaign is a mammoth 10 hour ordeal.			"

												Possibly the best choose-your-own adventure game I've ever played.Lots of text and static art, but its all really good text and art. In ""combat"" there are very simple animations and each character has their own sounds they make, most of them really funny and/or cute. But that's about as far as it goes, there's a lotta reading to be done. Not as much as say Sunless Sea, or really a large number of other similar games, but still a lot if you don't often do this kinda thing.The mood-combat mechanic is funny, interesting, and different approaches often yield different outcomes. Other times, they simply flavor the same outcome, but if you can get into a game like this then that's really just as good as dsitinctly different outcomes.It gets compared to FTL apparently, I KINDA see it but ehhhhh honestly I think its better not to have such a pre-conceived notion about a game like this before playing it, since so much of the game is about how YOU play it; it does share some DNA with FTL, but they're more like distant cousins than brother and sister. For example, if you get totally destroyed in an encounter, you don't necessarily lose the game, you lose what is essentially a life, which is by far your most limited resource (and I call it a resource because it can be traded as though its a real thing for other things in some encounters).  Sometimes your capacity for supplies - essentially your ""fuel"" - imposes a really harsh limitation on you, but there are ways of dealing with that, particularly after finishing a couple expeditions.Also, as an aside, I love Anna. I want to marry her, and after I kiss the bride, I want her to let out that awesome mad scientist laugh <3 <3 <3 (she's also incredibly useful in almost any group). Each character, while some abilities are shared, are unique in fun ways and often a specific character's mere presence will open up unique options (usually to bypass what amount to skill checks in this game).I love it.

												A truly amazing game that is very addicting and has a huge replay value. I'm usually one to save & reload when something doesn't work out the way I had planned, but this game taught me to just go with the flow and enjoy the ride. There is always something new to explore, a new character to get to know and a new experience to be had. I cannot recommend this game enough, you just have to try it!			"

												My friend recommended me this game. At first, the game did not look that appealing as based on screenshots it was rather simple looking. However, after I started to play the game with my boyfriend, we are completely hooked. Renowned Explorers is challenging as you can set the difficulty according to your skills and expectations. Also, there is a lot of strategy involved in build your team, moving across the expedition map and using your resources. So far we have completed successfully a few games and simply love the game. We can't get enough of kicking Riveleux (I hope I wrote his name correctly)♥♥♥♥♥ Definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes board or strategic games.			"

It hits a sweet spot between FTL and XCOM for me.  It's warm, nuanced, and endlessly replayable.  It's also anything but predictable-- I love how many nooks and crannies the developers have added to each expedition.  Definitely worth your time!			"

												This is a good game and it seems to be coded well. It works well on Linux Ubuntu 14.04 in fullscreen on widescreen TV. It's easy to see and read the text from the armchair.Good bit of RNG here, so beware if you don't like that sort of thing. The strategy that you pick does matter. I think it has a good balance. The game is deeper than it looks too. The meat of it is in the tactical battles, which at first, will seem easy, but they are not. WIth good tactics you can alter the outcome of the battles, to a point. I noticed other reviewers complaining about the art. It is cartoony but I think it looks good and everything is cohesive. Lot of replay value also. Highly recommended.			"

												Friends of well designed strategy games / digital board games should definitely check out ""Renowned Explorers: International Society"". Nice 19th century explorer setting, roguelike structure, map exploration + round-based encounters with a great emotion-based system (you can use friendly, devious or aggressive moves, thereby shifting the mood of the encounter and affecting all kinds of things). Items, skills, research trees ... I just would love to have a wider selection of expeditions (this game is designed to be played through several times, each playthrough consisting of 5 expeditions), but because of the way you have limited (but fluctuating) supplies (one of the BEST mechanics), you cannot cover all of the map, so you always miss a lot of surprises for next time. Think: Try to reach the goal without running out of supplies, but at the same time try to uncover as much as you can of the map. Also, great characters, with hidden details ... I really can't bring myself to change the team anymore. A definite 10/10			"

												How do you want to defeat your opponant? Here are some options: Slice them with your knife, tell them that their underwear is dirty, or get them excited about peace. More options: Terrify them with a lecture, whip them with your whip, or seduce them.Turn-based combat where you can win by dancing with your fighter and then your fighter tells the opponant that they smell like cheese. This happens in this game. And it's glorious.Lots to love in this game. Something for rogue-like lovers and fans of turn-based combat and hard-core strategists and people that love good characters and stories of adventure. Highly recommended.			"

												This is a game which features randomly generated maps (but the encounters are mostly the same on the same type of map), a hub world and RPG elements, The jewel of this game is the interesting combat system which features 3 types of attack types which counter one another (friendly>aggressive>devious>friendly) and special modifiers that apply on the whole battlefield depending on you and your enemy's mood. I would really enjoy seeing this system adapted into different games as it is quite tactical, forcing you to choose your actions carefully and make compromises.The encounters require you selecting different options which might have a different impact on your current adventure, or pretty much rolling the dice using your best characters in order to pass your current obstacle.The hub world is mostly a place where you upgrade your items, stats and resource gain, not much is really to be said about it. I suppose it is a nice addition that offers a bit more strategy in your games.You will probably end up going trough most of the content in about 10-15 hours. Personally, after I  went trough all the encounters I do not feel to try out different character combinations or am I willing to play the game again. Yes, small variations will happen now and then but the incentive isnt all that big after you've been trough the encounter a couple of times already.Overall this is a great game, and I would definetely recommend it if it were in the 10 eur price range.Please excuse any grammar or spelling mistakes in my review, I am not an native english speaker.

												Abbey Games created a great creative gem with this game; however, there are some flaws that might bother some. * There is a lot of replayability in the game, with a whole bunch of caveats.  Different teams with different skills and approaches means many encoutners and events will play out differently in multiple playthroughs.  And I don't mean easier versus harder.  I mean the difference of storming an abbey full of gun-toting nuns to having a charm off with them.  This all leads to quirky humor which is all good and fun.* That said, I am a bit disappointed in the amount of content.  I know there is a lot of content in that encounters and events are actually just one of many possible events because each event has to be coded differently depending on initial mood etc.  However, I felt my expectations were set high since there was three different tutorial islands, but after that the areas are the same.  I really expected maybe two of three possible expeditions opening for each star level.  I guess that is what expansions are for.* There has been a lot of comparison to FTL, but it is not as hard or as unforgiving as FTL.  You are not forced to press on to harder expeditions because you can win the game (2000 pts) by just doing lower level expeditions.  However, there really should be a scoreboard to track your points to keep you going after those high-point high-risk options.* There are a few bugs still. Nothing game breaking, just immersion breaking.* Different shops unlock after each expedition.  However, they are rewarded in a counter intuitive way and have the same things every play through.  I really wish there was more randomized variety in the gold/item shops versus knowing where the machete is every play through. * Boss battles can also be too rough because of endlessly spawning minions, but in gereanl a coutner strategy of nuking the boss ASAP works.I might have harped on some of the weaknesses of this game, but in reality when you put it all together it is still a great game and lots of fun.  Even though each play through is only 5 expeditions, you do learn about your crew and random events can even lead to character development.  Character development in the story sense not in the game stats sense.  Even though I have dinged the game on lack of content, I am still surprised by what situations my crew will find themselves in.  In reality, my critique is really picking the wings off a beautiful butterfly.  Sure one can do it but in the end you are just destroying something that should be appreciated on its own terms.  That said I am going back to play some more by beating up sheep and hugging mummies!			"

												I will write a more thorough and thoughtful review for this game in the future, but seeing as it is having a sale, I wanted to write a quick review to any one I know considering getting it.This is definitely one of the most fun strategy roguelike games I have played. Imagine the same consideration and thoughtfulness of FTL's roguelike strategy and throw it into a 19th century world of exploration and treasure hunting. You lead 3 person bands of explorers as they try to make their mark on history by getting as much fame, fortune, or even scientific discovery as possible. It is a ton of fun, with a combat system that is both deep and amusing.I highly recommend this game and the expansion. It has been one of the best new indie games I have had the pleasure of discovering.			"

												Abbey Games delivers another refreshing game (and if you don't own Reus, their previous game, you should take a look at it !).Renowned Explorer is about exploration and fame ! Pick a crew (you have several unique characters to choose from) and prepare yourself to explore different locations and find treasures that needs to be in a museum.A bit of Exploration, a bit of RPG mecanics, lots of adventures, fun characters, lovely musics and graphics, fun story and events, and tactical combats. Abbey Games delivers again a very unique game (as they did with Reus).This game features unique tactical combat mecanics with moods and emotions. Each combat skill gives an emotion to your target, playing with emotions and moods can totally change the outcome of a combat  (for better or worse). You can try to befriend your enemies instead of poking them. It's just brilliant... I love it :)Every character begin with different perks and you'll be able to learn new ones during your expeditions. Those perks will make each expedition unique as most of the event will have to pass a check on those perks.EDIT :Abbey Games added difficulty mode and it's a welcome addition to the game.The game has a rough learning curve and being able to play at a lower difficulty at first will help to grasp the mecanics before trying a harder difficulty.RE:IS is cute, funny, hard, and addictive. You should totally try it out !			"

												Oh man. I'm not even wuite sure where to begin with this game. This game is great, from it's charming, quirky characters to it's amazing replayability, or even the fun crew stories. the closest thing I can compare it to is a choose-your-own-adventure book, but so much more. Each time you play you find new treasures, new events, sometimes even new enemies. But don't get me wrong, it's still challenging at times, when you're not sure whether to head to the main ruin or explore for some of the minor ones, and you've only got so many supplies left. it takes anywhere from 2-5 hours to beat a game, depending on if you beeline straight for the main ruin or if you traverse the whole map, but it's easy to just hop into a new game  because you're so excited to see what you'll find on your next adventure. I would reccomend this game to anyone, it's a game that's great for young kids or people who aren't as experienced with video games, and even people who consider themselves proffessional gamers will enjoy this.

Posted: April 19
												A game about 19th-century globetrotting exploration (""rogue-like"" in the sense that it has procedural content and optional permadeath, but it's not particularly hard to survive to the end). There's three main facets to this game:First, there's a series of text-based events describing the people, places, and artifacts you encounter on your expeditions. You can make choices about how to respond, with the skills and personality traits of your crew unlocking extra options or providing bonuses.Second, there's grid-based tactical combat. They've got a medium-weight combat system where each character has 3 basic moves and learns more specialized techniques as they level up. You can defeat opponents by beating them up, or by breaking their spirit with taunts and insults, or by winning them over with compliments and friendly banter. The moves you choose to use change your party's overall attitude, which can provide combat bonuses or penalties, influence enemy tactics, and change your rewards for the encounter.Third, there's a resource management system. As you journey, you collect gold, fame, and research that can be used to upgrade your equipment, recruit an encourage, and research new abilities. Many of the things you can buy feed back into resource generation for future expeditions, so it's got a growth-optimization angle that reminds me a little of Civilization and similar games (though the actual mechanics are thoroughly different).The skill system is notable: characters have skill ratings in general categories like Archaeologist, Diplomat, or Athlete, but your rating is simply a count of how many individual skills you have within that category (for instance, the Diplomat category has things like Languages, Customs, and Politics), which are sometimes individually important and also influence how you can rank up (there's no benefit to getting Diplomat: Languages from 2 different sources, but there is a benefit to getting both Diplomat: Languages and Diplomat: Customs).

This little gem is a quirky adventure game (with option for rougelike). You're goal is to gather the most reknown that you possibly can in four separate missions into the unknown. And it is fun to just complete it as quickly as possible. But the real fun is in the RPG elements thrown in, and the fun style of comedy that is on display.It's very neat to be able to assemble a tough, aggressive group only to have them battle a flock of sheep, and beat them with love.I would say this is worth the asking price. IF you missed out on the humble bundle and your curious what this is all about, give it a go. It's everything. Management, simulation, RPG, rougelike, fantasy, adventure.It has so many hidden little features and ways to play it that replay is a must.			"

												As of writing this review, I have something like 40 hours (yes, 40) into this game, and still haven't beaten it. Admittedly, I didn't go for any of those wimpy copout lower difficulties and modes - I went straight for Adventure; Classic.Here's the thing though, time after time, I may have lost, but I've never really felt like it was unfair, and I've always learned something new about how the game works. I've heard the FTL: Faster Than Light comparison - and there's a lot of similarities - you'll never feel like you've got QUITE enough resources to tackle the curveballs the game sends your way. You'll lose far more often than you win. Still, where I found FTL to be frustrating, RE:IS is rewarding. Every set of skills is valuable, and will open up paths you never even guessed were going to be there. Most importantly though, this game had me grinning like an idiot even as a crotchety priestess from Scotland whooped my professional hit squad's collective behind. A good purchase.			"

												I bought this game cause i owned reus, was wondering if this would be just as much fun! its atleast 100X more fun! why fight when you can insult your enemy into a hissy fit and making them run off, or praise them with compliments to the point they just dont wanna fight you any more.And then all the stories while doing some exploring.Any person who likes adventure games would love this it has so much more to offer then most, and im sure there will be more expansions in the future			"

A newfound classic!Gotta say, I'm REALLY glad I pciked this up. I liked the art style, but the mechanics looked a little confusing, different currencies, lots of stats ect. For those like me who are easily put off by more indepth RPG elements, I must encourage you to try this out! The stat management hits the right level of depth, interesting without requireing crazy micromanagement. What's more, the design and setting is wonderful! This should've gotten more attention: here's hoping one more review helps it out.			"

The Good: Plenty to love here! Engaging gameplay. A fun mix of exploration (of course!), stat-based challenges (that roulette wheel mechanic is GREAT alternative to dice rolling), X-COM style tactical combat, balanced with resource management, party-building, and skill tree advancement. Well-crafted world-building. Just the right mix of borrowed historical elements, genre tropes, imperial archetypes, and self-aware humor, all presented with genuine love for the setting.  Impressive pan-global character designs. The devs take advantage of the gleeful anachronism to present a more diverse cast, with the bad♥♥♥♥♥female luchadore and distaff Greek resistance fighter being just as credible and important as the grizzled sea captain and stiff-upper-lipped aristocrat. For a game where the fluff is so closely integrated with the mechanics, that's a big deal.The BadFor a game that doesn't seem particularly complex, it sure is buggy. I can't run it on my personal laptop, most likely because of chronic problems with MS Visual C++To be fair, there's a vibrant and responsive support community on the forums here, but I just want a game that runs glitch-free from installation.(Fortunately, it runs without a hitch on my work computer.)The UglyAll that effort to choose theme-appropriate character designs, names, adventures, maps, and yet none of the fonts and typefaces match the setting. Especially that awfully bland logo! "

												The game is quite fun, and replayable. I wouldn't call it very casual, there is a lot of depth to the strategy of the game, particularly if you want to earn the high scores. It also isn't very forgiving. If you aren't paying attention to the mood during fights (using your best aggressive attacks while enemies are being devious), you can find yourself getting double damage and lose the game quickly. I've died on beginner island a number of times due to poor attack planning. Still, all in all, quite fun!			"

												Renowned Explorers has it all; exploration, treasure hunting, gorgeous graphics and an in-depth battle system that is miles away one of the most unique and wonderful in it's genre. Balancing between the three approaches of Deception, Aggrestion and Frendliness is a deep and highly customizable system that is just awe-inspiring in it's seeming simplicity and actual depth. You can decide to play a friendly but devious crew, an aggresively friendly bunch of adventurers, or a dastardly bunch of rogues intent on decieving and destroying their enemies. There are so many different choices, the replayability within this game is astounding. I literally just sunk an entire day of my life into this thing, and I'm sure I'll plunge once more into the cutthroat world of Renowned Explorers as soon as I regain some resolve.  "

												Excellent.  The game is really outstanding.  Funny, exciting, challenging... it's great.  With tech decisions similar to Civ 5 and some different directions to go for character development, there is plenty of planning involved.  Combat is wonderful.  Some have complained that it is too difficult or confusing, and I really hope for their sakes that is not actually the case.  The system is certainly different, but if you have the patience to read a few tool tips, you will do fine.  I wish we were told about what the gold sections of the map do during combat (they regenerate health for those who stand in them) but other than that, I think the player is given plenty of information for how to achieve success in the game.I hope there is more content planned for this game in the future!  Not that there is currently a real lack of new, discoverable content, but just that it's all so good!			"

												My favorite surprise of 2015. Best described as FTL meets X-com meets Undertale, with a great setting and theme that still feels underrepresented in gaming despite big franchises like Tomb Raider and Uncharted. Playthroughs do get a bit repetitive, as the number of events and locations feels limited, but dedicated dev support thus far leaves me pretty optimistic in terms of future content. Tons of collectibles and playable characters further enhance the replay value, but good luck getting everything considering the inherent randomness - but hey, that's why i love the genre.Go berate some sheep til they run away crying, then feel real bad about it. Play this game.			"

												Interesting exploration themed strategy game which treats befriending and verbally insulting as equal in combat to physical attacks. Though really its kind of a rocks paper scissors type mechanic between the three. The exploration is fun, limited by supplies, exploring got better the more I played it as several playthrough are required usually to understand how to get the most out of the various expeditions. Equipment buffs your team members who also level up and learn new skills which help in encounters. The music is not my favorite, art style is fun and cartooney. I recommend this game. It's a lot of fun. Good for kids too.			"

												Very good FTL like game. By that I mean it's a node based exploration game with limited time (supply in this case), each node being an event. Could be a series naratively driven stats rolls or an encounter. Encounters use a turn based tactical system with a strange and interesting emotion component. There is also a solid gameplay layer between expeditions where you can spend your various resources.There is a good amount of replayability, especially if you want to unlock all the captains. With a total of 20 characters for a party of 3, I have yet to try them all. The game is also pretty hard so that's another replayability aspect. I've kinda beaten the game after about 10-12 hours of gameplay (I'm not sure how many playthrough, probably 5+) but by ""kinda"" I mean that I only survived all 5 expeditions, I didn't succeed the real goal of beating the top explorer. Doing that took another 2-3 tries.This is definitely one of the underated gems of 2015, I would highly recommend it to anyone who liked the FTL system.			"

												This game is a must buy if you like strategy games or roguelikes. I seduced a tribesman for a magic mask, I beat sheep to death for science, and I captured King Kong and sold him to the zoo because that's what Renowned Explorers do. It's all fair game on the way to fame and fortune.  This is the first time I've written a review on Steam.That should give you some idea of how much of an impression Renowned Explorers has left me with in such a short amount of time. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anybody who is a fan of King of Dragon Pass, Faster Than Light, or roguelike games. It's hard to describe because this game really is a breath of fresh air for any gamer that's played pretty much everything over the years.It's not really like most other games. The combat system is easily the most interesting mechanic I've seen in years. The last time I was this impressed by a new idea like this was probably when I first played Civilization because it was that different and new ideas in games don't seem to come around all that often anymore. It all feels like more of the same, except for this game.You pick your leader, recruit your crew, and set out on an adventure. You can build a party up of different characters, and there's a lot to choose from. You unlock them as leaders to lead your party later.The super deep ""combat"" system. I can't rave about this enough. You can resolve encounters through skill checks before they happen sometimes, or by using aggression, devious, or friendly moves during them. Or, you can walk around the areas where you know they'll happen if you want. I mean, there's probably even more ways to handle a single encounter than that, but that's off the top of my head. That doesn't even get into the numerous strategies you can use while you're in combat. You don't have to stick with an aggressive approach for an entire encounter. You can switch halfway through to resolve it in a friendly or devious manner.It's hard to explain. You just have to play it.You MUST play it. The game really gives you the feeling that you're exploring the world like Indiana Jones, Nathan Drake, or Lara Croft. You have your crew members, and everybody has their own strengths and weaknesses.The art style is Adorable!If you ever felt like all the wonder was gone in the world. Or like most games are too damn oppressively moody, then you'll really love the tone of the writing, the refreshing art style, and the humorous events that just seem to happen through the stupid decisions you make.The cons:I'm not sure I've found any yet. One bug that resolved when I exited the game. There was an enemy that kept running around my screen like he was on crack after he died. It was more funny than anything.I solved it by saving and exiting the game. "

												Defeated an Abbey full of Nuns by seducing them with an Argentinian bombshell. Hows that for an attention grabbing headline? Of course a sword swinging Greek 'Michonne' and an unhinged scientist obsessed with electricity helped. Renowned Explorers is what would happen if you filmed the next Indiana Jones movie with a cartoon effect camera and then made a video game based off that movie using FTL, (Faster then light) Austin Powers and X-Com as inspiration. One minute you will be befriending Sheep, launching daring hostage rescue missions in the bowels of a pirate ship, fighting ghosts, cracking safes in a tree house or writing research papers. And the next you will be trying to convince a group of villages that you came to their island riding a giant flying fish and because you are so awesome they should give you all their treasure and food. Just like in just about every game, ever, there are times where your expedition of explorers will be attacked by slavering wolves, the horror!How do you deal with these brutes? Well shooting, stabbing, punching, laser beams and odd chemical concoctions do the trick. As does throwing the canines a party, hurling insults about how they smell like fish or the age old art of seduction. All valid, depending on the skills and capabilities of your party.The game is outrageous, fun, challenging, fresh and just like X-com, sometimes 95% chances just aren't good enough.There is a huge amount of depth and customisation in how you approach the game, with the sole aim of first earning more fame than a certain Frenchman, and then trying to beat your previous scores and find new treasures!Do I recommend it? Indeed I do, it's worth grabbing even when not on sale.			"

												Delightful exploration game, somewhat similar to FTL, where you take a party of three on expeditions around the world to find treasures/artifacts. Turn-based movement during expeditions with text-based events and/or encounters on each tile where the outcome can vary greatly depending on the skills of your party members. Be friendly and persuade the locals you meet of your cause, scare them, or beat them to a pulp. In between expeditions you can spend resources like research points and status points  to do various things like writing research papers, give lectures, gather an entourage of e.g. traders and students for various bonuses during expeditions. A very enjoyable and pretty unique game overall that gets its replayability mainly from a large cast of characters with different perks and abilities to choose for your party at the start of the game.

												A whimsical adventure exploring locations packed with character. Feels like a choose your own adventure game, remember those books when you where a kid?The turn based battle system / emotion system is very interesting and a unique take on just reducing all your enemies hit points to zero. The character skills and abilities overlap in ways that give rise to interesting tactical approaches. Comparison to FTL are fair, but I feel like I have more control when playing this game based on information about each node, overviews of the adventures ahead etc. At this stage I feel more locations and captains would be a good addition, which I assume is being added in the coming expansion. Also a global leaderboard would be great!I find it hard to believe this game isn't more popular, because it is an absolute class act (with plenty of moustache references, excellent)! Highly recommended!!			"

												Oh man. I'm not even wuite sure where to begin with this game. This game is great, from it's charming, quirky characters to it's amazing replayability, or even the fun crew stories. the closest thing I can compare it to is a choose-your-own-adventure book, but so much more. Each time you play you find new treasures, new events, sometimes even new enemies. But don't get me wrong, it's still challenging at times, when you're not sure whether to head to the main ruin or explore for some of the minor ones, and you've only got so many supplies left. it takes anywhere from 2-5 hours to beat a game, depending on if you beeline straight for the main ruin or if you traverse the whole map, but it's easy to just hop into a new game  because you're so excited to see what you'll find on your next adventure. I would reccomend this game to anyone, it's a game that's great for young kids or people who aren't as experienced with video games, and even people who consider themselves proffessional gamers will enjoy this.

It goes a lot deeper than I expected on the surface (Which was a suprisingly great thing) as far as leveling up the explorers by choosing perks such. I had to replay the game about 30 times before I noticed [hopfully] all the modifiers and tricks that are going on as far as Moods vs Moods and such.

												A game about 19th-century globetrotting exploration (""rogue-like"" in the sense that it has procedural content and optional permadeath, but it's not particularly hard to survive to the end). There's three main facets to this game:First, there's a series of text-based events describing the people, places, and artifacts you encounter on your expeditions. You can make choices about how to respond, with the skills and personality traits of your crew unlocking extra options or providing bonuses.Second, there's grid-based tactical combat. They've got a medium-weight combat system where each character has 3 basic moves and learns more specialized techniques as they level up. You can defeat opponents by beating them up, or by breaking their spirit with taunts and insults, or by winning them over with compliments and friendly banter. The moves you choose to use change your party's overall attitude, which can provide combat bonuses or penalties, influence enemy tactics, and change your rewards for the encounter.Third, there's a resource management system. As you journey, you collect gold, fame, and research that can be used to upgrade your equipment, recruit an encourage, and research new abilities. Many of the things you can buy feed back into resource generation for future expeditions, so it's got a growth-optimization angle that reminds me a little of Civilization and similar games (though the actual mechanics are thoroughly different).The skill system is notable: characters have skill ratings in general categories like Archaeologist, Diplomat, or Athlete, but your rating is simply a count of how many individual skills you have within that category (for instance, the Diplomat category has things like Languages, Customs, and Politics), which are sometimes individually important and also influence how you can rank up (there's no benefit to getting Diplomat: Languages from 2 different sources, but there is a benefit to getting both Diplomat: Languages and Diplomat: Customs).

												If FTL and XCOM had a baby with a fairly complex combat system that let you choose between attacking, tricking, or befriending your enemies, that baby would be Renowned Explorers: International Society.  Every game is like a ridiculous story.  You explore with an FTL-like map.  You manage resources over an expedition, which can include multiple combats.  Then you go up to the strategic level to spend, spend, spend those glorious resources.  I love this game.  Combat is a little tricky to get the hang of, but it's definitely worth your time and money.			"

												Edit...First Update: Ok...I'm getting kind of addicted now. My first run was my best and now I am kind of getting owned. It's an even deeper game than I thought at first blush. Lol...Now that I actually know what I am doing and what I have to do to win, I find the game a lot more challenging. I love this game and I would highly recommend it to almost anyone.I'll update this once I have put more time into the game, but I wanted to get a review in early. I really had no idea what to expect when I purchased this game...It was an impulse buy. I loved Reus, so I decided I wanted to support the devs. So far I'm really happy I did. The game is charming and I love the art style, but what surprised me was the depth of the systems and mechanics. I really shouldn't be surprised...Reus was an incredibly deep game, so it's easy to see Abbey Games has chops.My only real complaint so far is the same one I had about Reus...the mechanics can be a bit overwhelming and there isn't quite enough tutorial material to help you learn. That being said, once you put in a bit of time and figure everything out it's a ton of fun. Truth be told, learning on the fly was probably more fun than a lengthy tutorial, but folks that don't usually play this sort of game may get a bit frustrated. Though I am still in the early going, I highly recommend this game.			"

												This game is pretty awesome!I believe mid-game and late game encounters get a bit of a cluster (your party, a maximum of 3, against some 10/15 enemies) and those 20 bucks are a bit rough on the price, some 12/14€ would be way more valuable. Still...You get to go on amazing adventures with 3 explorers, with 4 classes to choose from, each one unique. The maps are random generated under a theme (like, Pirate Den, Ancient Castle, so on) and the combat system is EXTREMELY friendly. I love the sense of exploration.PCGamer compared this game with FTL, since it's a roguelike with time limits, but other than that, this game is on a place of it's own. I love the victorian ""Exploration Era"" vibe it exudes and the gameplay helps keepin up with it.Cheers.			"

												This game is one of the more unique games I've seen in awhile so I'm going to leave a review and recommend it.  Anyone who likes turn based strategy games should give it a go in my opinion.  It's quite fun trying to unlock new characters and places, building up your characters, entourage, teams, inventory, etc.  Deciding how to mix and match your captains (once you unlock them) versus which crew.Combat is unique in that it's not just hack and slash.  You have to pay attention to mood and how to manage your crew's mood versus your opponent's mood to be successful otherwise you'll quickly lose or be overwhelmed.That said, it can get a bit repetitive as far as places and encounters go (especially encounters).So, I'm looking forward to what they do when they give us some expansion packs and so forth.  I really hope they do because I really like what they've given us here.  My advice to the developers here is..you've got something here.  Now run with it and give us more in the same unique vein you've started with.			"

												This game is real fun. The discover mode can be easily cheated using your save/load function, so it's most fun to play without cheating that way.The game gives you a wide variety of characters to choose from, each having different kind of abilities. Luckily, in the game, when selecting characters, it shows you which of the explorers are best compatible with eachother. This helps beginners a lot, since the game is tougher than you might think.It's really addictive when you start playing, due the the countless choices you can make in the game.I do wish you could go on more expeditions than just the few you get every playthrough. But overall, I really recommend the game for people who love strategy games or just want to kill time.			"

												I saw this game through Total Biscuit's WTF is... episode (see it here if you are interested: 


YouTube™ Video:  

			Views: 0		



 and bought it instantly. I regret nothing.It is a very entertaining rougelite experience, with tactical turn based combat. There are similar games out there, but RE:IS has some features that make it stand out from the crowd.Firstly theme and aesthetics. Game is set in XIXth century from the pulp novels of the era. It is the world of high adventure, voodoo pirates, mummies rising from their sarcophagi, travels around the world and exploration. Characters are embodiments of the tropes associated with that genre and they are given decent personality through simple things like their visual design and animation, despite almost complete lack of dialogue.Secondly, combat. It is relatively simple, but uses a ""mood"" system to create interesting variations with each encounter. Video linked above explains it in more detail, but in short - each move in battle fits one of three moods: Friendly, Devious, Aggresive. Depending in each side's mood, party is affected by buffs or debufss. Add to it the fact, that ending encounter in certain ways may give different rewards and it creates a set of decisions going far past spamming the strongest available attacks.Thirdly, the charming narrative. It strongly connects with the first point. Each encounter (in verty FTL-esque) manner has a short description (or set of descriptions) which capture the adventureous feeling of the whole thing.There is one problem with the game, namely number of different adventures available. Within few hours it is possible to see every one of them (but not to see everything they offer - supplies acting as a time limit make it difficult to see everything on any map within one play). This is however prone to change since devs promised to keep content patches coming through the 2015 and in 2016, provided they can afford it.So here's the selfish part - go buy and play RE:IS. You'll have fun and I'll get chance for more content :P.			"

The greatest example is the free DLC, Mali Mystery, which I found to be an incredibly fun little excursion. Definitely my favorite purchase of the year, and that includes Grand Theft Auto V.- Note:  If you're reading this, guys, I would totally not be averse to purchasing some extra DLC.			"

The balance between stategic decisions such as team composition, hiring helpers etc., tactical decisions, mostly encounters, and RNG is just close to perfect.

												This is a definitely a strange game to describe since it has a lot going on with it. On it's most basic level it's not entirely unfair to compare it to FTL in some ways ie branching path progression, limited supplies for upgrades, skills that allow random interactions to have various outcomes. But ultimately it's a lot more than just an FTL like, a better description might be if FTL and a board game had a baby. 1 full play through takes 2-3 hours roughly (assuming you make it through all the adventures that make up 1 play through). Though it has a ton of replay-ability via different team configurations and strategies (gold/research/status). At it's core it's a pretty simple system of trade offs between resources and fights/encounters but it's got some hidden depth that makes it stay fresh (emotional combat states/character skill progressions/etc)It's quite a bit of fun and frankly a pretty decent value at it's base price due to amount of content/replay that's included. Not to mention the developer seems pretty committed to continuing to release content/support the for the game and seems pretty responsive.			"

												I am in love with this game. Its level of abstraction remains constant over all of its mechanics (except for shops, which are very simple mechanically, compared to the rest of the game's depth and breadth.) The art is done fantastically. Everything about this game oozes polish and makes the game more enjoyable. If you share my aesthetic biases, and you want to immerse yourself in a world slightly brighter and more fantastic than our own, with your own adventuring party, with each possible explorer being full of character and incredibly enjoyable to observe and interact with, and with every step along the way seeping with immersive little details, buy and play this game. It's obviously a labor of love.And if you do choose to buy the game and share my aesthetic biases, I reccomend Classic difficulty, on Adventurer mode. It adds a great deal of tension to your early games, and really gets you invested in the incredibly fragile lives and careers of these wonderfully simple and unique characters. It also makes you (variably) as happy as your party would be when they manage not to run into trouble.I give it a resounding 9.8/10. Close to my heart, near perfect.			"

												-------------------------------------------Presentation Review-------------------------------------------First of all, I am getting this out of the way. RE:IS is a very compelling , Refined , Well-paced and simply epic way of telling story using every mechanic to support the idea of upbeat adventure. Which might be praised  for a hundreds of time already.So I am going to focus on presentation this game has to offer instead. First of all, I am pretty much a sucker for anything that has a strong theme. whatever it might sound weird , serious , stupid or unrealistic it is, If the game living in it's own world and take advantage on it's own theme then it's doing presentation right (example : Darkest Dungeon , Hunnie Pop, Don't Starve , Recettear)For limited budget game like REIS to shine out,  It has to need every aspect of the game to help represent the theme of the game and gladly they did almost everything right. the visual is bright and colorful in pop up book style , this might just look too simple on screenshots but when you playing it yourself it feel a hundred times more impressive. This is one of the game that design everything to support the theme itself. Characters design is vivid , a little goofy but they can be mixed together not just for create an efficient party but to change the story telling itself too. Also , to support the idea of combat system that based on ""Friendly"" , ""Devious"" and ""Aggressive"" ways, Every character has their own traits and personality fitting what they are. A small but important details like how they gain buffs or making facial expression on dialogue encounters helping a lot!  So even not in combat this game still keep getting interesting by well made story telling (which you have part of writing it too). It's not hard to find an epic funny story along the way and still this is not the end of how smart they using this system, Because the way they keep changing how encounters and event approach you. Eventually , You will find  most of them but it will hardly goes stale because you will still get different vibe with different party anyway. Even Combat system is created to compliment the theme , battle can be resolved in ways and it's really funny that you can even bully a giant monster until he cry and run away! (and that is A F**KING Brilliant way to make this game appealing).The weakest point of presentation might be the soundtracks of the game, However it's not actually bad but comparing with all amazing aspect of this game, music in this game got a little off feeling (feel like it should be more upbeat and epic than this), And While it has a good feedback interface that giving most information you need to know. some of them are still lacking (like no tool-tips of unlock buildings in world map and some unclear combat tiles connection). Anyway these are just very tiny dot in this masterpiece.Bottom line. Just shove money into this game as hard as you can! this game deserve more sale and attention than it is!(I don't know if pricing in USD maybe a bit higher but in Thailand it's about $10 which is a very good deal)			"

												10/10 would recommend this game.It's a roguelike. There's so much content. SO MUCH REPLAYABILITY.The writing in this game is funny, the soundtrack is pretty nice. The art, while looking cartoonish, is charming and definitely betrays what this game essentially is. This is a game full of risk vs reward and planning. After your first couple of playthroughs, you might want to go for normal mode. Which isn't easy. Every decision you make heavily impacts what happens in the down line. Maybe not all the way, but definitely for some time.Choose how you want to play this game. Be friendly, devious or aggressive, and focus on either research, money or fame.This is definitely a complex and tight game. Which makes for the subsequent playthroughs even more interesting.There are over 20 characters each with their own little backstory blurb, movesets and perks. Making the most out of them is what you want to focus on here. Everyone of them is uniquely designed too.Just try it. It's fun.			"

												Renowned Explorers is a bit like heroin. it seems like♥♥♥♥♥♥in the beginning, but once you get hooked it's over :DThis is a seriously well done roguelike with pulp fiction elements and one amazing cast of characters.Pros: - Characters, there's plenty of diverse explorers, each neatly designed       from the Luchadora to the Russian 'bear' to street orphans, all the cliches of a good adventure are here - combat system. it is based around emotions, giving you 3 'basic' ways of solving an encounter (Friendly, Devious and  Aggressive). and it's more complex than one might think - great soundtrack - beautiful artwork - fun storylines and expeditions, Transylvania, Mali and even Shangrila. there's lots to do - plenty of discoveries to be made. 15 hours in I have half of the trophies one can find - atmosphere, can easily swing from light and funny to heavy and dramatic - it's really hard to beat if you do not start on the lower difficultiesCons: - no. no and no. Verdict:Renowned Explorers is one hell of a roguelike. I spent days upon days on FTL, and until now none came close to that experience.RE lets you build the adventure by throwing appropriate chunks of story and exposition and combat at you. The characters are all crafted with love and a keen eye for 1930s/1940s pulp stories.Fans of Atomic Robo, Hellboy, The Spirit or Quartermain, will definitely find this pleasing and vastly entertaining.Ontop it offers a fresh and sometimes hilarious combat system, and enough loot and characters for the collectors among usIt poses a decend challenge, even for the more experienced of us, but can equally be enjoyed casually in the exploration mode.No doubt, get it.

												This game turned out to be a lot more than I was expecting. Its cheerful and cartoony, but has very tactically fulfilling and difficult gameplay. The more I play the game, the more depth I discover in manipulating the emotion systems. The larger strategic elements- the planning and preparation between expeditions, and the actual exploration- also do not disappoint.The adventure mode ends after five expeditions, which is just at that sweet spot where its not so short I feel like I only just started to get rolling, and not so long that I'm discouraged from replaying or restarting after mistakes wipe out my expedition. Theres a good variety in the expeditions, but obviously I'm hoping they continue to release more support or DLC for the game.Speaking of which, I whole-heartedly endorse the More to Explore expansion. The campfire element, which reminds me of Darkest Dungeon, and the character stories add a lot more narrative and strategic depth. The additional two expeditions (Andes and Lost Island) are also some of the most entertaining with multiple ways to complete them. Finally, I really like that the game presents options other than violence for achieving your goals. I mean, you can still stab and shoot your way to riches if you really want to, but you don't have to. Friendliness is just as (if not sometimes more) effective. I picked this up on a whim, and its quickly become one of my favorite games!			"

												Overall a very fun game in that it mashes together two concepts: Score grinding and RPG/Tactical elements.  This is great especially if you like playing games that have a strategic flair, but do not necessarily have the time to throw down to learn the ins and outs of the game.  Losing does not feel like ""losing,"" as you can just pick yourself up and try again.  Would recommend to anyone that just needs a time burner for 30 to an hour.			"

												Recommended for anyone who fancies turn-based combat (not very deep yet challenging and fun), resource management, mild rpg and strategy, positive vibes, charming atmosphere of expeditions, and a very fresh approach (throw insults instead of fireballs!). Beware though, game involves a prevalent RNG mechanism to solve map events and includes a non-counterable evade chance in combat. It also suffers slightly from lack of variety - while maps for locations are unique each time there are just seven expeditions (plus tutorial) and they are unlocked in a fixed manner. Completing them rewards the same unlocks every time and generally the entire resource management phase is fixed (always the same items in shops, same specialists to hire).			"

												I will start this review by saying do not start playing this game if you have something important to do in the next two days. This is because a single runthrough of the game might only take 1-2 hours depending on how fast you are going, but if you are like me you will have played ten times to make sure that you unlocked charachters, played on every difficulty, tried every strategy (of which all can yeild a positive outcome and a very different playthrough), and visited every map. The most important thing in this games favor to me is that you do not have to be a stereotypical murderhobo. While it is possible to kill locals, it is probably more viable to befriend the locals in many maps. The second amazing thing about this game is the style and the sense of humor. This is the best roguelike I have ever played, and I hope you give it a try.			"

												Edit 3: They have made SO MANY improvements for this game that basically every minor complaint I had with it is now irrelevant.  There are more places to explore, tech is now no longer based on your team build, there are more events in locations and more interesting decisions to be made there along with tons of balancing patches.  You heard right BALANCE PATCHES IN A SINGLEPLAYER GAME to improve the play experience.  The Dev team is fan-freaking-tastic.  If you like rogue-likes, buy it, if you like turn based strategy, buy it, if you like adventure games buy it!  The only feature that might put people off is the learning curve.  You really do need to figure out the strategy elements in this game, which are a little weird at first, but after that the difficulty settings let you make this anything from hardcore score-attack to casual lunch-breaker game.  It's really flexible that way.This game is great.  It has an awesome choose-your-own adventure style and a lot of replayability.  The mood and combat system is a bit confusing at first but it's not too hard to learn and it really makes things interesting.  There's a big FTL or Binding of Isaac kind of feel where it's a short experience that can turn out in different ways.  My only problem is that is simply doesn't have the unpredictability that those games do.  There are 10 different levels, 5 of which you explore in each playthrough, with their own strategies and secrets which are randomly placed on the map, but always present and always the same.  The characters abilities are slightly customizable over the course of the game but not a ton, this isn't much of a problem though as each 30 minute playthrough will use 3 out of the 20 characters.  However besides character selection there's little deviation between playthroughs.  In FTL or BoI finding the right weapon at the right time can swap your whole strategy, not so much here.  Your strategy is set by the characters and missions you chose, there's no evolution.  It may sound like I dislike the game here with this rant but really it's just that I love it so much and I see so clearly what it could be with more levels and more evolution.  If this gets steam workshop support or an expansion it could easily match the hundreds of hours Xcom, Isaac and FTL have gotten from me.  As it is now it's about 10-20 hours of great content, which was worth it to me but I can understand wanting more for your money.Edit: Based on their latest patch I am now completely sold on this game.  Abbey has demonstrated that they are interested in making their game better on a consistent basis and ensuring it doesn't turn into a stagnant, formulaic experience despite being singleplayer.  This is more than I can say for Binding of Isaac and FTL, who recieved only spotty support from developers.  This pushes me from 7/10 to 9/10.  If they release a few more levels I'll send it straight to 11/10.Edit 2: Well they released a new map.  I can think of no reason whatsoever not to recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based strategy.  My minor complaints and nitpicks have been blown into a fine red mist by the rocket launcher of amazing that Abbey is wielding.  They comboed their Impress with some follow up excite attacks and now I have become excited about their cause and stopped resisting.  I rate this game 11/10.  What are you waiting for?  Just buy it already!			"

												Much like Reus, enjoying this game quite a bit.  They are innovating and putting out quality content at reasonable prices and is a company well worth supporting.Gameplay is daunting at first, as there is a lot of icons and unfamiliar terms, but the basis is fairly simple, and UI tooltips are informative and useful in most cases.You are essentially making educated choices as to where to apply your limited resources and what challenges you want to face.  While I haven't played it too long yet, the randomness does seem like it'll keep things fresh and interesting.Writing is well-done and enjoyable, and the core mechanics are fairly addictive (I want to find all the treasure!).Link to my Youtube video showing some gameplay:

												Its fun and challenging. I encountered some bugs and incoherent text but nothing gamebreaking yet.game is roughly three parts:1. exploring Maps: move tactically on the map to gather ressource tokens, encounter challenges and enemies (so many choices to make... you read alot) and ultimately get to the main treasure, which ends the map.2. encounters: on certain spots or after certain choices of you, you do round based isometrical \""battles\"". Here is a unique battle system in place, with a rock-paper-scissors scheme and quite some twists. Theres a helpful tutorial, go watch on youtube if you want to see it first.3. preparing between adventures in towns: make scientific discoveries, buy items, get followers. basically manage your ressources to maximize effectivity of the party.Probably for you when all 3 parts appeal to you and you like FTL and similar games			"

												SPOILER: This game is fab!So, this is my kind of game - exploration with strategy and RPG elements. The gameplay is quite unique (we rarely saw it before, only something similar in Curious Expedition but this one feels less 'indie'): you gather a party of three advanturers from 4 main casts, and you try to survive 5 advanture, find treasures of all kind - in the meantime you need to improve your brave party and buff them with various things like items, companions and new technologies.The theme is lighthearted ; but I mean no wrong, the level of humour is absolutely acceptable, the game will makes you smile for sure.Also, there is a great depth here and however I still do not understand the encounters (fights) fully it still fun. You will loose your first runs because it's pretty challenging stuff. If you like FTL, Curious Expedition and/or boardgames it's a must have for you then.			"

												Love the game alot but I wish you could continue to play once you beat it, also it would be cool if you did another campaign after winning instead of trying to beat the guy again, you should have to beat your previous crew. "

Its a little tedious in the beginning due to not being able to turn off tutorial tips but nothing to really complain about.  Found the game challanging and fun to play again and again.			"

I have been addicted for the past month trying to collect all the treasures I can get my grubby hands on and who knew beating up nuns, pirates, scots and monkeys could be so enjoyable. This game has a ton of replay value depending on the crew you select, the difficulty and the path you take to the end of the game. For 20$ this game is well worth it!!!			"

												Due to health issues I didn't get to play this game as much as I'd like, but if I could have I probably would have gotten 50+ hours into it playing it on the hardest mode with Ironman enabled, Even more considering since I last got to play the game they added free DLC adding even more fun times, for a game of this price that's a lot of value!I really love the art, characters, feel and just in general the design of the game, the developers seem to have put a lot of work, attention, love and creativity into the whole thing that this feels like an overlooked gem to me. If you have any love for this kind of game, you really should consider giving it a try!One thing I haven't mentioned, the fights in this game. They can be both really challenging and really fun to master.An example of mastering the fights is picking a crew that complents each other, then mid game end in a fight where you face 4 enemies from the start with 3 of your own guys and you blast that enemy away in your first turn by using an area of effect taunt, which changes the ""mood"" in such a way that from then on peaceful abilities are more powerful, followed by an area of effect peaceful move which changes the ""mood"" instantly to a backstabby ""mood"" wherein your aggressive attacks are much more powerful for one attack, using your fighter who can do one and a half aggresive attack combined in one attack to finish of the toughest enemy left standing with help of the major one time attack boost.The same kind of mood juggling is what keeps the game interesting during other fights as well, as you'll be struggling to finish the fight with one dominant ""mood"" so you get sweet bonuses while avoiding getting stomped because the enemy might have the advantage over you if you stay in that ""mood"" for too long.

												Renowned Explorers is brilliant game design. It combines a relatively short playthrough (a full game of five expeditions takes about 2-4 hours) with large replayability through unexpected encounters and the variety of playable characters. And it uses simple but clever animation style with clever writing, being an an adventure that is for a considerable part text-based, giving it a lot of flavor, and yet has some good graphic context to help you be drawn into the stories. The environments of the various expeditions are varied, and yet the whole game has a clear consistent style.My only negative point would be how this game is basically making colonialism fun. Yes, it does it with a wink, but also rewriting it in such a way that it somehow becomes ethnically inclusive. However, it makes it SO much fun, this is really just a minor complaint. Come on and hunt those treasures!			"

												Its fun and challenging. I encountered some bugs and incoherent text but nothing gamebreaking yet.game is roughly three parts:1. exploring Maps: move tactically on the map to gather ressource tokens, encounter challenges and enemies (so many choices to make... you read alot) and ultimately get to the main treasure, which ends the map.2. encounters: on certain spots or after certain choices of you, you do round based isometrical \""battles\"". Here is a unique battle system in place, with a rock-paper-scissors scheme and quite some twists. Theres a helpful tutorial, go watch on youtube if you want to see it first.3. preparing between adventures in towns: make scientific discoveries, buy items, get followers. basically manage your ressources to maximize effectivity of the party.Probably for you when all 3 parts appeal to you and you like FTL and similar games			"

												I normally play strategy, simulation and RPG games. But sometimes a change of pace is nice.This game is the PERFECT change of pace. It's does the Victorian Exploration/Adventure ""vibe"" perfectly. The developers may not have been born when the boardgame ""Source of the Nile"" was first published (in 1977-78), but they have perfectly captured the spirit of late 19th Century adventuring, including a multi-expedition campaign system. More importantly, the design, the writing style and the art all perfectly compliment each other. I especially admire their mostly-non-combat ""fight"" system. I love how you can fast-talk your way through most encounters, but are periodically rewarded if you're nice, or (horrors!) actually wave around a sword or machete.I've thoroughly enjoyed my expeditions so far, and hope you will too. Bravo for a job well done.			"

The locations and people are charming and fun. The mechanics are deeper than they seem from first glance and does take some work to figure out.

												I reccomend this game despite my issues with it. It's a fairly fun tactics game that has a unique twist on your turn-based battle system. I think the aspect of non-violent victories is interesting, and I love the diverse cast of characters to choose from. Mechanics are enjoyable, although a bit chance based. I actually rather enjoyed the gambling aspect of encounters and also being able to mitigate luck through skills.However, the issues I've found is that for a game designed around multiple playthroughs, and from having different win possibilities, the gameplay starts to feel a bit repetitive. There big plot points remain identical through playthroughs without new dialogue or different outcomes. I will admit that there are a variety of locations to pick from, and plenty of perhaps unexpelored encounters i did not see that do add variety, but it all funnels back to the same ending for that respective location. Still, overall, a fun game, but if you're like me and bad at these sorts of games despite loving them, you will find yourself dying and starting campaigns over fairly consistently which can be a bit tedious due to the repetition.One other note I'd make is this game is not optimized well for Mac. I'm on a brand new macbook pro with graphics card and memory both fully upgraded and I still had graphical issues in the skirmishes. I've researched the issue and it seems the general answer from the developer to mac users is to run it through bootcamp with Windows OS. For a game that is not as graphically intense as other games I've played successfully, I was disappointed to see it having such issues.7/10, buy it through a steam sale! "

												***Edit***A representative from Abbey Games has told me that they are hard at work to flesh out the campaign and make it so that you feel like you finished a game rather than got a tiny little taste of it at the end screen. Because of that I'm reommending the game to everyone. Once that happens, the game will truly be great. The premature end was really the only thing holding it back in my book. Everything else was fantastic.***End Edit***This game has a lot going for it. Nice sense of humor, fun art style, it does not take itself too seriously. I really like the combat system as well, where the player has to pay attention to the mood of the battlefield and use it to their advantage. I really want to recomend it, I really do, but I just can't.The main reason for this is because I went in expecting to put together a team of loveable misfits and go on a great epic adventure, and the game does allow that to a certian extent. The problem is that it just ends so abruptly. You only get to go on five adventures and then you are forced to go back to the main menu and put together a new crew and start all over again. As soon as you grow attached to your crew, the game ends. I just wish it was a bit more like X-com where it really does feel like you are taking part in a great story, but instead this game ends right at the moment I go ""man, I can't wait to upgrade my crew and explore even more of the world.""

												So, basically, it\'s like XCOM and Civilization had a baby and then sent it off to the Undertale school of combat.It\'s a resource-management-heavy (Civ) game of missions that frequently put you in turn-based tactical combat that gets extremely tense at moments (XCOM) in which you can choose to beat your enemies by showing them cool magic tricks until they\'re so enamored with you that they just can\'t bring themselves to hurt you (Undertale). If that sounds interesting, then you\'ll probably enjoy this game. If you dislike XCOM or Civ for pretty much any reason, stay away. The Firaxis influence is dripping off this game, which, if you\'re like me, is anything but a bad thing.Also, look at that tenth screenshot on this page. Look at it. It\'s literally just the culture screen from Civ V with the word \""Research\"" on top.			"

I had absolutely no intention of purchasing anything, and I ended up with the Renowned Explorers: International Society.And boy... am I happy to have bought it :). Cute little game, with almost infinite replayability, available for both mac and windows (which is important for me, as I tend to travel with my MacBook Air, so it's cool to have engaging, interesting games on it).I have just played for 1 hour now, but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. My hope is that the game will be further developed, to maybe include more treasures, or additional adventurers. So far - it's been a blast! :)			"

												There is alot of polish in this game, the characters are all unique and the stories are cool.There are some people who are comparing this to curious expedition, and I think the only real similarity is the overworld map. Combat in this game is very different, using a sort of triangle system where one style is better than another. It is also grid turn based combat.And after a mission is complete there is alot of interesting things to do. Such as using tokens to upgrade shops, hire an entourage to help you in missions.All and all I recommend this to anyone who wants a fun, clean, non-punishing rouge-like adventure game with a great aesthetic.

That said its a pretty integral part of the game, and I have no problems with it. You can tacticly put together a crew that can handle most situations or ultra specialize. If you like games like FTL or similar mini-rpg exploration rouge-likes Id say go for it. I got the game pretty much the first day it came out because I loved the dev's other title Reus, quite a lot.

												I really wanted to like this game...  All the reviews seemed so positive and the previews look right up my alley.  I played my first game last night and at the end of it wasn't sure if I really enjoyed it or not.  I tried it again this morning and confirmed that I'm really not a fan and likely won't be giving it another shot.Overall the game seems very polished and there are a lot of options for different charaters and expeditions.  The ""combat"" is what really irks me though.  Killing people with kindness seems odd and maybe I'm just not getting how to properly influence the moods of people in combat.  Positioning doesn't really seem to matter and I'm confused why I can attack aggressively while the opposing side just keeps being friendly towards me.  I'm sure you get more and better powers later on with which to come up with more advanced strategies but I'm not really motivated by anything in the game to make me play further to unlock those things.I'm sure this game will be very fun for some people - as it already has based on most of the other reviews - but I'm going to spend what little free time I have playing something else.

												Turn-Based Strategy is one of my favorite game genres, dating back to the original Age of Mythology and Age of Wonders.  (I like a bit more of a fantastical edge to my strategy games).  I'm also a fan of old school RPG's like Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate that require you to work with the strength and weaknesses of a team to be successful.  That being said, Renowned Explorers has elements of these games, but also somehow presents a concept I've never really seen before.  And they do it well.  The game is high in replayability, mental strategy, and unique gameplay.  It offers a range of difficulty settings, but even the lowest offering presents enough of a challenge to make it not seem like just a point-and-click.  I particularly enjoy the multitude of offerings to enhance your team at the end of each campaign, with the ability to spend the spoils of your exploration not just on items, but also on helpful followers, researched enhancements and paid jobs.  The only thing I've disliked so far is how they keep the goal of becoming the top explorer in a short amount of campaigns as part of the gameplay even after the tutorial, making continuation after that achievement seem a little less important, even though there are plenty of campaigns available at that time.  They also cap the growth of the group members to five  new skills, which is generally reached right at or soon after becoming ""Top Explorer"".  I haven't played the Adventure Mode, nor have I looked at what the DLC has to offer, so maybe some of this is remedied there.All in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new, enjoyable twist on turn-based strategy.

												An excellent character-driven game, in whose world I've invested a huge amount of time.It has a fun, casual game feel to it - but this is just the surface of it. A clever encounter system allows your crew of explorers to approach each problem with options towards Friendly, Devious or Aggressive attitudes - and the different opponents you meet will react better to some than others, impacting both your play style and the replayability of the game with shifting moods overlaying the whole encounter and influencing your methods tremendously.Each single game is comparitively short, easily possible (with a bit of practice) to finish within an hour or two; but mastering the game will take far longer = a fact easily seen in the steam forums with a full range of players, from full-time experts to casual one-off gamers - which also hosts the most friendly and helpful forums and users I've ever seen.This is also where the (now Community-run) Weekly Challenges take place, giving all players a chance to try new techniques or play with characters they haven't tried before - as well as seek advice anytime they have difficulty. I would recommend taking a look at the forums as well if considering this game; as you will quickly see why I feel it is a point worth mentioning.I'd also like to add that the developers are extremely devoted to the game, regular updates coming frequently, both introducing new content and resolving issues players have raised. Indeed, the 50th weekly challenge occured just recently, which the developers ran as a communal challenge, where additional content would be created for each point threshold the community met as a team.Summary: Whether you want a quick, enjoyable romp through the Egyptian desert or if you prefer a deep, tactical and long-term planning challenge, or even just a chat with others who enjoy Renowned Explorers, this game can suit you either way - just set the difficulty as you prefer and enjoy! (Be warned, the 'Impossible' difficulty is not one I would recommend until you are well-versed in both the game's strategic and tactical layers!)My comparitively low hours played on Steam is due to the fact that I originally purchased and regularly play the game on GoG, where I have more than 1600 hours clocked up.

												The reason this game will always hold a dear place in my heart is, most of all, the sheer level of over-arching strategy. It may not seem it at first, but this game is very well balanced in such a way that you will *always* be making compromises of some sort, and what matters when it comes right down to it, is your grand scheme - how you play to whatever specialisations you take, how you sidestep or cope with your shortcomings, and how you take all the various decisions flung at you from various sources and grab whichever ones you are able to afford and lash them together into a raft thatll take you to shangri'la The strength of this game lies in its sheer replayability. This game is for you if you are the sort who enjoys picking a detailed game in attempt to learn its every nuance and aspect. Every playthrough will play out differently, amongst the choice in captain and team, the choice specialisations, your expedition plan, papers researched. You can only ever hope where you have all of these variables so thoroughly mastered that you might change one of them, and intuitively be able to bend the rest to compensate the only shortcoming is the combat, which is by no means terrible			"

												I played this game for one day and got over 50 achievements. This game is nuts.So I wrote a review for Abbey Games last project Reus and gave it a negative review. It wasn't a bad game but it was underwhelming and I found it boring. This game however, gets my hearty reccomendation.Reus and Renowned Explorers actually have some similarities, altough it may not appear that way. The setting, concept and aesthetics for each game is very different but both games are based on fairly simple systems and concepts, and the gameplay is centered around the player exploring the variations and nuances in those systems.The thing is in Reus, I had no desire to explore those variations, because I found it incredibly boring, but in Renowned Explorers I love it.The concept of Renowned Explorers is a Saturday Morning Cartoons-looking bunch of people are part of a society of explorers and adventurers in the age before colonialism stopped being fashionable.You lead this band of explorers across various landscapes looking for treasure, fame, and science.The game is played in two phases, the world map phase and the expedition phase. The world map is where you can manage resources, supplies, build up your team and perform odd jobs. It is also from the world map that you can select where to adventure next.While you're in the expedition phase you lead your party across a map in a specific region, like Mali, Hungary, The Andes, etc. You have a specific goal in each region but there's also a fair bit of random encounters and treasure to gather and explore. You can't always find everything because you're limited by the amount of supplies you have but that in itself encourages replayability.The game is fairly rogue-like, in the sense that you are not meant to do everything in a single playthrough, and when you do fail or reach a certain point, you are encouraged to just start over with different characters and a different approach.The game is also interesting because although ""battles"" happen in a turn-based tactical layout, the game gives you the option to solve these encounters with diplomacy or manipulation as well as straight-up combat.I've been seeing trends like this a lot lately. I wonder if the influence of Undertale is to blame.I liked the idea of having options to my battles, but the thing is, the most successful I've been so far, is with a team of explorers focused on a friendly diplomatic playstyle. In my opinion the game seems to push somewhat towards that sort of playstyle, which I find a bit annoying, as my aggressive playthroughs have been the least successful so far.Overall, if you're in for a rogue-lite experience and like the aesthetics and concept, this game is a lot of fun.One of the things that I hope more developers realize in the future, is that story can act as a reward for the player. The reason why exploring this game's depths and variations, even if they're relatively minute, is because I was always excited to see how the game rewarded me with the story elements involved. I wanted to know about the places I was visiting and the characters I was playing as or meeting.This is a really fun game, and although I think Abbey Games has stopped support on it, I would love it if more content was released for it down the line, or perhaps if they expand on the concept in a sequel.

												The reason this game will always hold a dear place in my heart is, most of all, the sheer level of over-arching strategy. It may not seem it at first, but this game is very well balanced in such a way that you will *always* be making compromises of some sort, and what matters when it comes right down to it, is your grand scheme - how you play to whatever specialisations you take, how you sidestep or cope with your shortcomings, and how you take all the various decisions flung at you from various sources and grab whichever ones you are able to afford and lash them together into a raft thatll take you to shangri'la The strength of this game lies in its sheer replayability. This game is for you if you are the sort who enjoys picking a detailed game in attempt to learn its every nuance and aspect. Every playthrough will play out differently, amongst the choice in captain and team, the choice specialisations, your expedition plan, papers researched. You can only ever hope where you have all of these variables so thoroughly mastered that you might change one of them, and intuitively be able to bend the rest to compensate the only shortcoming is the combat, which is by no means terrible			"

												Explore the world and bring its treasures back to England! This is a game of joyous imperialism, a roguelike without the usual BS or difficulty cliff. The game has a tutorial and explains its mechanics! The mechanics are simple (sets of rock-paper-scissors) that have interesting interactions. Build your team, develop them with synergy, discover lands that change each game, and bring home treasures and stories.Note that each game is fairly short. An expedition takes 30-60 minutes, five expeditions are your whole game, and you start over. There is no extended campaign or advancement across games. Each game stands on its own.Read an extended review at Kill Ten Rats[www.killtenrats.com] "

												Renowned Explorers: International Society immediately became one of my favorite games as soon as I started playing. It is a turn based exploration and tactics game. You choose your captain and crew from a large array of lovable and unique characters, and lead them on epic expeditions to become the most renowned explorer.  PROS +Beautiful art style and animation+Many different and interesting characters+Many locations to explore+Cant do everything in one playthrough. Great replayability+Quite challenging+Multiple intuitive solutions+Unique effective mechanics+Heaps of fun+New experiences every time you playYou could say the game is too short, but with the immense variation and replayability, different playthroughs can feel entirely different.I 100% recommend this game, Its funny, charming, beautiful, and you can tell by the amount of times i've said something along the lines of ""unique"", I havent seen anything like it before.I was trying to include more negative points but i couldnt think of any, so if you are interested in having some fun give this a try. 10/10			"

												After thoroughly enjoying myself it's definitely time to write a review for everyone to see! (I hope)... what are you waiting for? Get this game. If you seem the least bit interested in it I can assure you it's amazing.What's that? You want a review first? Oh... Well okay then, I guess I could do that.Except then I'd be here for a very long time - and I really wanna keep playing this game  - so please bear with me here.It's a good game, there's WAY too much to explain, if anything about it seems interesting to you, do yourself a favour and get it. It's just great and all the chance and possibilities involved make it so replayable, it won't be boring EVER.Note that I've been playing in Adventure Mode on Classic Difficulty only, and I can also recommend that, it's just the right amount of challenging. I'd give this TWO thumbs up but one will have to do. Cheers.			"

												This is a good game that played based on chance. It's not feel unfair because we can increase chance by managing resource to build good team. Every adventure need different approach so it's very replayable. Battle system is also a good turn based tactic that play around rock-paper-scissor formula, look simple at first sight but actually it's have good depth to explore.			"

												Funny game, it reminds me a lot of FTL. Maybe the fights are more repetitive than FTL. Maybe because they are easier (I've beat the game 2 of my 3 playthroughs). I like the perks and RNG system for the events, makes it interesting to try and equilibrate your team and cover all your bases. Also that you can choose your team, so it makes me want to play more times with different teams, but maybe let some time pass between playtroughs to avoid getting bored.			"

												Turn based roguelike with many interesting ideas. I dont remember a game before that let you 'defeat' enemies by exciting them, complimenting them or making them sad!Looks simple to play but there is a lot of hidden depth aswell as replayability. The adventure map reminds me a bit of old rpg books where you can skip to a page if you have a specific item or skill.I was surprised at how much i enjoyed and kept going back to this game. 10/10 here.

												Renowned Explorers is a roguelike with turn-based combat, that hardly sounds revolutionary but I've had more fun with this game than with many of the AAA titles I've played this year. The adventure theme is great, the characters are charming,many of it's events are down right hilarious and the idea to be able to resolve combat with a variety of attitudes (Friendly/Devious/Aggressive) is very satisfying and can make big changes to your play through.In short it's a game with real soul where the passion of the developers has really come through.

												I can not stop playing this game. I adore it. If Indiana Jones designed a strategy game, this would be it. I'm normally a point and click / puzzle / story type of game person, but this one just has me hooked. I love that you don't have to be violent to win, and in fact, to unlock achievement you have to play nice once in a while. Every time I play I get a little more out of it: a new treasure, a new campfire story, or new team leader wins. Play time is short enough to not be frustrating and long enough to keep you occupied for an evening if you like.And as a beginning gamer, this game levels up with me. It doesn't punish you for taking it easy, as so many do. So when I'm in the mood for a challenge, I can have one. But when I just want to explore and unwind, I can too. I've also just recently discovered its active community, with the game designers playing a large role. They put out weekly challenges for you to solve, which, again, keep the game new. This is by far my favourite game in the world right now. Please please please keep expanding it. I wish there were more like it!			"

												This game is truly amazing, although I may be saying that due to my love of exploration and collectables. Nevertheless, I almost cannot fault Renowned Explorers in any way - the gameplay for example is intense but rewarding, the combat being different to what you might expect in a very good way, utilising a peculiarly mini-Civilization style of game progression.RE:IS has more going for it than just the gameplay, though - the artwork in particular is incredible, and can honestly I am in love with the gorgeous art style and humurous atmosphere, as well as the color scheme and everything you can see on screen; it's all beautiful. As previously said I find it difficult to fault any part of the game, although as a warning to those not aware:Renowned Explorers is set up to engage you in multiple playthroughs, and so each completion of a new game (with the DLC) adds more content during your 5 expeditions per game, and by the fourth or fifth playthrough you will have a much better understanding of the game and its mechanics. If this puts you off, for example if you prefer a larger campaign in your games, then maybe this is simply not the game for you. However if this excites you then go ahead and buy Renowned Explorers: International Society ASAP; it might just be up your alley.			"

												This game has not sold enough copies!It's a great little tactics game in which you gather a band of 3 explorers to travel to different countries and find riches and fame. In each place, you'll progress by going from one encounter to the next (similar to FTL) until you reach the final encounter in which you can gain the main treasure of the place. During all this you have to manage your resources (food) and the progression of your characters to get strong enough for the specific encounters. If it comes to a fight, you'll be thrown into a turn-based tactics game with pretty strong mechanics (despite the harmless look). One playthrough takes only about 1-2 hours and you are encouraged to try different locations or a different set of adventurers. That said, all in all, I'd like to see a bit more variety and more options, especially when it comes to the locations. All this is set in a lovely and fun scenery with a great art style and a cute sense of humour. I can only heartily recommend this little gem of a game.			"

												This game is great! One of my favourites that I've stumbled upon in Steam.I dabbled in rogue-like/turn-based rpgs before (FTL, XCOM, etc.) but Renown Explorers really cemented my love of that style of game. It takes an already pretty established motif and takes it in different directions. ""Encounters"" can be solved with violence or diplomatically in a constant juggling act of moods and emotions (enrage your opponent to cause them to be less effective at dealing damage, or excite your allies to make them greater speakers, etc.); be aggressive, devious, or friendly and reap the benefits of each play style. Each character plays differently (with different strengths and weaknesses, abilities, and interests) but they also play differently WITH other characters in your party too (especially thanks to some of the new dlc available to the game that increases the interactions between characters); maybe one character doesn't like another, or maybe they really admire them, or maybe one person wants to teach another what they've learned (skills, etc.), and so on. Bosses, battles, and scenarios are tough and challenging (especially at tougher difficulties like Adventure Mode) but I never felt like the game was impossible. There is a lot of variety and a lot of replay value here. I've played about 60+ hours and will properly sink much more than that into it before I'm done. I've geared each of my play throughs around gaining certain Steam achievements (mostly to help narrow my team selection, etc.) which has forced me to learn and adapt each play through (I sit at about 70-75% completion right now).Buy this game and get out there and EXPLORE!10/10			"

												Essentially a rogue-lite strategy RPG with a hefty dose of Civilization and Oregon Trail thrown in for good measure. Combat takes a little getting used to but once you know what you're doing (and you disable animations) it's quick and fun and has a few pretty unique mechanics that add a bit of strategic depth. Out of combat (which is more of the game) you'll try to maximize you're score, and try to figure out just how to best use your characters and what areas and treasures you can take advantage of.Also while I was a bit put off by the graphics at first they fit the game rather well and haven't bothered me since (though it helps that I find the gameplay as enjoyable as it is).Definitely an underrated gem.

												This game was an unexpected surprise. Its charms didn't grab me  on the first play through, but upon giving it another go, it became rapidly apparent that this is a full-blown tactical turn-based affair with light RPG elements as well as plenty of resource management.The interlocking game systems are surprisingly deep as you utilize knowledge, social skills and the (more than) occasional thwack on the head to become the world's most Renowned Explorer.  You'll definitely have to consider a path ahead of time if you want to maximize your victory against your dastardly nemesis Rivaleux.This game is witty, diverse, and has solid art design. A lot of thought went in to it, and it is a lot of fun to play.			"

												When I started to play, I fell in love with this game right from the start. Here is why:1) gameplay mechanics. Simple to understand, yet different from any other games I have played. You can approach every fight the way you want - be friendly about it, scare them off or fight them directly. Mix in emotions and moods, and you have a hell of a fight.2) art style. It is cartoonish, but in a good way.3) great replay value, even if some playthroughs take away from you only 2 - 4 hours (you may want to increase difficulity or switch modes where the game takes longer time to complete and there are no chance of saving as well). 4) While some games give u the feeling of Deja Vu (the feeling - you have been there and done that), this game is a complete opposite - it gave me this unique experience.Overall an A+ game. I would recommend this product to everyone who likes the thrill of excitement exploring and discovering new worlds.			"

												Very highly recommended for anyone looking for a story driven adventure/rpg/rogue-like with an endless variety of strategies and challenges. Progression through the game is very reminiscent of FTL, but the game has a unique personality and incredible depth that sets it apart from FTL and its clones. RE:IS has enormous replay value-- Every expedition will yield something new no matter how many hours you play.			"

												Renowned Explorers is a real fresh game.I like the new and impressive Fight in this game where you have to think every turn through.The games' replayability is massive. I still haven't finished unlocking all characters as Captains.When to buy this game?If you like Roguelike games,go for it. The game offers 4 Difficulties with 2 Game types.1 Game type is more forgiving,the other isn't. There is some luck involved in this game. After when you know more about the mechanics and systems, the luck component goes down a lot. There will always be a little Luck in this game(Or bad luck).But depending on your knowledge and choices,you can avoid getting in bad situations.I rate this game a good 9/10.They give you many possibilites what other games don't.Continuiung after you completed your run.Difficulties!Different set upsHave fun playing this gem. It'S worth the price (Estimated game time until it get boring: 25-30 hours)			"

												Tags : Tactical - Exploration RPG*Hall of Fame Sub-Category*This is a very polished game with a nice blend of casual and tactical - you get different loadouts of crew abilities and items and you have to ressource manage to make the most out of expeditions. UI is very well designed, writing is alright, game is family friendly. Mechanics further improve on the familiar, psychic attack/regular attack, psychic defense/regular defense formula, by making it a triangle where weakenesses and strenghts rotate based on who uses what. It is a very elegant design. Game seems like it would have a very nice amount of replayability.I would highly recommend this game, and I am adding it to my shortlist of all time favorites.			"

												I just can't stop playing this. A very nice mix of tactics and strategy with an interesting battle system with some wild mechanic interactions (which I'm not sure I fully understand).   A run through from first expedition to the award ceremony lasts an hour or so; assuming you don't die too quickly.  Tons of characters to open up as Captains with a lot of variety for party make up; each can have a significant different feel.  A game that makes it fun to try different strategies, combinations and paths.  Loads of achievements and replay value.   I've expect to play this one for a long time to come.  (NOTE - I am playing with the paid DLC (hopefully first of many DLCs!).  I haven't played without it so I don't know how different that might make a play through.  Big Thumbs up on this one.(I also recommend Curious Expedition!)			"

												This game took me by surprise- I thought I would hate it, but I LOVE IT. The strategy involved in planning your moves (on maps and in encounters) is way more in-depth than I anticipated. Being able to choose various moods (actions) that affect the gameplay, gathering resources like ""research"" and treasure is really rewarding to me. I've gotten burnt out on running around shooting raiders/aliens/orcs, this game is slow-paced in a good way. There's kind of a steep learning curve for the emotions but it's not too complicated. As a plus, it's safe to play if my daughter (3.5 yo) is in the room.			"

Posted: July 4, 2016
												In RE:IS, you take a trio of intrepid explorers, chosen from a set of 25 characters across 4 classes with varied skills, on an adventure to seek glory and renown. It's fun and whimsical, with attractive, colourful, cartoonish graphics. It's simple to learn, difficult to master, and endlessly replayable. Four main factors ensure that no two adventures are ever the same:- Goals: Do you seek fame and glory, untold riches, or scientific advancement?- Attitudes: How does your team handle conflict? Friendly, winning foes over with your charms? Devious, playing with their heads and breaking their spirits? Or Aggressive, shooting first and (maybe) asking questions later?- Classes: There are Scientists, Scouts, Fighters, and Speakers. Each class brings something unique to the table, and the 5 characters within each class are all wildly different from each other.- Areas: There are 11 in all (plus an additional 2 in the More to Explore expansion), but you can only explore 5 in a single run-through. Different characters will be better equipped to deal with different challenges, and each map will also be slightly different every time you go through it.I only have a couple of complaints, and they are very minor ones. First, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to proofread such an immense, complex, branching script thoroughly, but I have found quite a number of typos and grammatical errors throughout. None have yet affected clarity, though.Second, there are a few sidequests in each area, with clues peppered about the map to help you solve them. However, because the maps are generated in a mostly random fashion, it is entirely possible (and often not especially difficult) to solve a sidequest before encountering its associated clues. When this happens, the script/NPCs will still give you the clue, not acknowledging that you don't really need it anymore. If the developers had found a way to acknowledge when a player has completed events out of sequence, and adjust the script accordingly, it would make the game seem that much more polished. It isn't game-breaking, nor even really a problem at all, just a missed opportunity.Bottom line, if you like lighthearted RPG/strategy/adventure games, I highly recommend Renowned Explorers. I've probably done 8 or 10 run-throughs as of this writing, and I still don't think I've uncovered even half of what there is to see in this game. Every campaign leaves me wanting more, and thinking about what I'll do differently next time. I have not yet played the More to Explore expansion, but I just downloaded it and I'm excited to try it. I may update this review after playing it a bit.			"

												Don't let the bright visuals and Rock, Paper, Scissors battle mechanic fool you in to thinking this game is simple, it has remarkable tactical depth and a fairly sizeable ramp up in difficulty once you reach the mid point. Once you have a few failures under your belt (there WILL be failures) and get to grips with the system you can really start to appreciate the sheer level of content and replayability on offer. After 70+ hours of play there are still events i haven't seen, treasures i have never obtained and partry interactions i've never witnessed. If you like turn based strategy and risk management i can't see how you could fail to enjoy Renowned Explorers.			"

												Very fun and well-fleshed out rogue-lite game, it feels like it has tons of stuff to discover and unlock, and also has a wide variety of difficulties from casual to punishing. Lots of stuff to pay attention to during battles, because every move has some effect over the status of the fight as a whole, in addition the immediate damage/healing you do. It feels manageable yet also complex at the same time, very similar to FTL and games of that type but more lighthearted and humorous. Normally roguelites tend to be either somber (FTL, BoI, Sunless Sea) or mystical (Rogue Legacy, Ziggurat), this one on the other hand is colorful, fun and full of personality and amusing moments. Very much recommended if you like the whole rogue-lite thing but you find the genre to be a bit dry sometimes.			"

												Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play a game that is a fusion of game mechanics/traits from isometric strategy games ( A la XCOM) , RPG elements (skill leveling, roles), roguelike replayability, collectible searching, and resource management (kind of like the Civilization series or other simulation games)? Probably not, that is quite a specific niche of a game but if so (or if that sounds interesting) then I would point you towards Renowned Explorers: International Society. A game that has so many events, character combinations, and challenges that its bound to give you at least 8 hours of gameplay just in trying to finish each mission alone. There is even more replaybility in choosing different crews to take on the expedition and challenging each mission with a different disposition. The dispositions are made up of Friendly, Agressive, and Devious which create a Rock-Paper-Scissors style of strengths and weaknesses and different crew members have different abilities that affect a certain disposition. Even deeper into the encounters is a mood system which gives debuffs or buffs based on the person's mood and also affect a general positive negative balance. This is barely scraping the surface of the encounters and not all events lead to encounters and most tend to rely on percentage chances based on crew skills and stats. Inbetween missions you get to allocate resources towards improvement of your crew and your ability to gain more resources. The goal is to collect treasures (i.e. the collectibles) in an attempt to beat your rival in popularity but you must carefully balance this with crew resolve and supplies to avoid a game over.  The game is a great pick-up if you are a fan of XCOM or Banner Saga style games but also provides a bit of everything to satisfy anyone			"

												I got this game from the Humble Monthly.And im so glad i did. This game is AWESOME!This is an absolute GEM!PROs:+ Very good gameplay. The combat, RPG and management systems are very nice. Simple to use yet hard to master. My 1st campaign was good but once i reached end game it was not enough. Which pushed me to think harder and plan more on my next one. (recommend doing the tutorial 1st time)+ Great Cartoon Art+ Tons of characters and team combinations. Which lets you experiment and try different styles of play.+ Very interesting emotion (rock-paper-sccisor) combat.+ REPLAYABILITY! Not only do you have different styles and many characters but the randomized maps and expeditions allow for tons of replayability. Theres hundreds of treasures to uncover so you can safely play the game many times and enjoy it.+ The random generation of levels keeps each map fresh.+ Alot of achievements if you wanna challenge yourself more.+ As far as i can tell developer working on more content <3 <3 <3Cons- A bit overwhelming at the begining. I was lucky to decide and do the tutorial. Took me 1 campaign to get my head around things.-Too early to tell but i feel like the base locations are too few. Ive done 2 campaigns and my early and mid game expeditions were the same i just chose different places to go. But as i said earlier the developers are working on new content so i think this game will keep getting bigger and better. And to be fair even though im listing this as a con by the time all the current expeditions start to feel boring i think i would have easily clocked about 40/50 hours and thats AMAZING value for $$$.End Verdict:9/10 Its almost perfect in my opinion. This is an absolute gem of an rogue-like RPG.Buy it you wont regret it <3 have fun exploring! "

												There are already many reviews that explain the game mechanics. My review, rather focuses on what is important to me, which is replay value. For the lazy who don't like to read, I have condensed all my points below (Pros, Cons and Warnings). My final verdict is that I love the game. It's a must try if you like turn based strategy, rogue-likes, high score games and high replayability.-Pros-+Wonderful Artwork+Deceptively deep and challenging turn based combat system+Strong replay value due to treasure collection system, a large amount of characters and good variety of different strategies you can employ to win the game+Developer is active on the message board, talking to and getting ideas from the fanbase. Free patches and content are constantly released to improve the game.+Very easy to pick up and play. ""One more turn syndrome"" is very easy to catch.-Cons-+Game is constantly being rebalanced which may alienate people who hate change. Some characters are overpowered and some are underpowered. At a high level of play, players may discover a lack of choice because of the balancing. There is little reason to go on certain expeditions because they don't offer as much score as the ""meta"" ones.+Most of the replay value comes from the wealth of different character combinations and strategies. The expeditions, after playing them a few times become predictable despite the fact that they are randomly generated as you'll see the same events often. -Warnings-+Stubborn players may become disillusioned with the difficulty of the game. On the default settings, the turn based combat becomes difficult in the late game unless you learn the deep combat system. This can easily be solved by lowering the difficulty but this will not matter to prideful gamers who refuse to lower it.+Like any rogue-like, there is a healthy amount of RNG (your success is around 40% luck). If this bothers you, this may not be the genre for you.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game consists of choosing a three person team of explorers and going on 5 expeditions (you get to choose different locations around the world) in a bid to survive, find treasure and ultimately beat your rival by outscoring him by the end of the game. The amount of treasures and resources you gain during a playthrough are converted into a overall score called Renown.During an expeditions, there are nodes that you move along that have random events on them. A resource called Supplies is reduced by 1-2 everytime you move with heavy penalties if you run out forcing you to make strategic decisions on how much loot you want to collect before you go to the final node which results in a boss fight and ends the expedition. Combat is surprisingly deep with a rock, paper, scissors system where you can defeat your opponents with aggression, friendliness or deviousness. Massive buffs or debuffs can be applied to the entire battlefield depending on whether you are winning or losing the rock, paper, system system, making combat challenging. Simply rushing in and attacking will not go well in the later expeditions and boss fights.Outside of expeditions, you can use resources you gained to purchase items to improve the stats of your party, buy items and followers with perks and more.This game was a giant hidden gem to me. I was randomly browsing Steam for roguelikes and found it deep within the dark depths of Gaben's labyrinth. I purchased it just to try it and next thing you know, I had nearly 25 hours of gameplay in a few days. There are a ton of different carrots to keep you playing for dozens of hours. Unlocking all the captains, beating the game, beating the two secret endings and finding every single one of the treasure hidden in the game.The game feels very rewarding with many layers to master. ""My run is average and I'm not sure I'm going to get enough score to beat my rival. Do I go to a 4 or 5 star difficulty expedition which has great rewards but risk dying? Or do I just do another 3 star expedition which is easy but I may not get enough score to win the game?""""This boss is weak to aggression so I could physically attack it to do massive damage. But it also has a perk that causes it to transform into a more powerful form if it gets physically attacked which will put my party at risk.""""One of my party members has a greedy personality. Do I risk visiting a ruins where I know there is alot of treasure? It'll drastically increase my score but my party members who has a greedy personality may grab all the treasure and set off a nasty trap risking the run"".If these sorts of scenarios and choices excite you, then I think you'll enjoy the game alot.

												This is a great, though short game.  Buy it if you want a complex, but casual game.It has as much replay value as you can stomach.  Really, how much you replay is up to you, because a single play through is 1-3 hours (maybe longer if you read the story elements, I didn't).  You can play it over, but:   shoot for fame this time; play aggressively instead of deviously; play with a new captain you just unlocked; play on a higher difficulty; play a different mode; play with an all scout group; play it as a drinking game where you drink everytime you lose a roll; or just play without the combat animations on (lol).Oh, and as of writing this, they are making an expansion!!  Maybe you're reading this in the future... now look up, see that expansion DLC??  Whaaaaaaaaaat?  I know, I am awesome, you are too.  Buy this game.			"

The constant allure of what treasure (or peril) will be on the next stop, the thrill of winning the damned wheel spin challenge every once in a while, and the adorable ""adventurer"" music make for a wonderful experience. Huge replayability factor, with 16 characters to unlock as your captain, and mix and match for wacky results. It is worth the money10/10			"

												Renowned Explorers: International Society is one of those rogue-lite games that have come into vogue recently, but this game stands out among them due to it's unique design, concepts, and combat mechanics. The art design and premise of the story is akin to a choose your own adventure book--and that means if you dislike reading or are prone to skipping dialogue, this game may not be for you. That being said, I was super into these books in my childhood, so as I played through the game it often time made me feel as if each choice mattered dearly making the game that much more immersive to me.So, if you dislike the theme of the game is there any other reason to buy it? Yes, the combat system of the game is not just shooting and killing your opponents. This game has a mood system, both for the characters and for the entire battle. The three moods, aggressive, devious, and friendly are absolutely vital to your success on any particular adventure. That being said, on the higher difficulties event the most mundane encounters can threaten your entire expedition, so learning to master moods and the various ways to influence it is vital to winning the game.An average playthrough takes around 2-4 hours on classic difficulty, but this doesn't mean that the game lacks replayability, in fact there are well over 16 explorers to chose from all with unique abilities and traits. There are also 6-7 expeditions in the game, and as others have pointed out, the lack of variety in that sense can make the game rather dull to run through after you've sunk in around 10 hours.Despite all of this, as the game currently stands I absolutely recommend buying the game at full price or otherwise!

												To all of my other strategy game fanatics out there i cannot reccomend this game highly enough. When you first start playing it does seem like RNG plays a large roll in this game, but if you have any skill at strategy games you will soon realise that the RNG is in fact very beatable. This game includes aspects of grand strategy, every treasure you find, every item you buy and every skill your crew learns has an enormous effect on what expeditions you can and cannot do, recognising this is one of the key aspects to the strategy. As well is this there is an excellent combat system, that rewards forward planning and tactical plays. Furthermore the humor and art style of this game is absuloutely excellent. And with twenty different characters to choose from to make up your team, as well as a massive amount of hidden secrets this game has massive replay value. Although the price may seem a little steep it is 100% worth it, i cannot reccomend it enough and if you any sort of skill with strategy games you will have a blast with it.			"

												I caught this game passing through my queue on the store page. I was bored, my birthday was coming up, and I figured adding things to my wishlist would skip the middleman since some of my friends like to treat me. What I saw intrigued me, and at only $13, a deal running at the time, I figured it wouldn't hurt. I have been slowly turning into an addict and masochist, trying to push a little farther each time, often failing gloriously. Do not let the cutesy look of this game fool you, it has depth in it's gameplay, and it is hard. There is also tons of replayability, as each expedition is a bit different each time. This is good, because you are going to fail a lot, but do not be discouraged, as that is partly the point; It can be cruel, but very fair. To try those combinations, those different strategies, to find what works. It's an amazing feeling when you see that smug Rivaleux sitting in 2nd place after all of your efforts.There are two downsides to the title, both of which are minor gripes. First, while very replayable, once you start running in to the same situations more than once, the dialogue becomes stale, and makes me wish I had more expeditions to choose from, which the expansion will hopefully remedy. Second, when you begin play, you do not get to choose your starting expedition, and since all of them offer more of a specific currency for gameplay, it has a lot of long-term ramifications on the rest of your run unless you constantly restart to get the one you want. Either having there be a choice in the beginning, or a change to make the islands more even in their resources, would be a marked improvement.I'm glad I found it, and I hope others share a similar experience, it's been a lot of fun.

												It's FTL, but way sillier and with hex grid SRPG combat. If you like either of those things, I highly recommend it. The good:- Transparent dice rolls. You're given your exact change to succeed and a breakdown of why you have that chance, along with (most of) the consequences of success or failure. - Depth discovery. The tutorial does a good job of introducing you to the main mechanics, but doesn't attempt to give you strategies for winning. You'll understand how to play immediately, but winning strategies will take a few games to really understand on the suggested difficulty. - Progression. 4 different resource currencies to spend after every expedition on at least a dozen options each and 5 levels per character with two choices each. There are a massive number of different ways to play even with the same crew. - Choices. Most characters can play two of the three styles well, and there are 20 characters across four classes. You get three per game, and while not all combinations are viable, hundreds are. You'll also make meaningful choices at almost every exploration node. The bad:- Could use more skills. Most of the combat skills are shared with other characters, which somewhat takes away from their uniqueness. - Massive final boss difficulty spike. Like FTL, the final area is exponentially harder than anything preceeding it. Unlike FTL, you can win (but not the best way) without going there. I'd still like to see a smoother transition. - Typos and grammar mistakes galore. English is clearly not the devs first language, and it really could've used a pass from a native speaker to fix some of the mistakes. You'll always know what they meant, but it can be distracting. Overall recommended at full price or otherwise. I got my first ""win"" after 17 hours, but I did it without fighting the final boss and still have half the treasures to find and several captains to unlock. There's way more than $20 of entertainment here.			"

Posted: April 17, 2016
												In Brief:  An interesting take on turn-based tactics with rogue-lite elements.Renowned Explorers is one of those titles I picked up during the holidays because I needed something fun and light to do during the massively gray Wisconsin winters.  I was happy to find that the board game elements that you see in the trailer video are not just window dressing for the game, but evidence of some definite knowledge by the designers of some of the best trends in current hobby tabletop games.If you are a board gamer like me, then think of this as a ""Solo Co-Op Adventure Game"", the kind that is in the vein of Pandemic.  If you are not the sort of person that goes really old school and game at a table with dice/cards/pieces, then this game is best thought of as a cousin to games like FTL.Play focuses on managing supplies as you explore a random mixed map, with conflicts mostly taking place in turn based combat where you position yourselves and attack with character qualities like ""Friendly Compliments"", ""Ranged Combat"", or ""Personal Insults"".  Characters have different strengths and weaknesses in combat, as well as areas of expertise that help you gain advantage from non-combat encounters.  Make your way to the designated goal on the map and try and use any accumulated bonuses from the search to complete the final challenge.The adventuring is broken up by periods of downtime where you can spend money, research, and prestige for new advantages and abilities.  All of this is framed in a theme of an idealized early 20th/late 19th century where diversity is celebrated and the baddies are easily recognized.So, who would like this sort of game?  It's the kind of title I think would be good for a parent looking to have something to play with a child who is already into games like Minecraft or reading Jules Vern or Harry Potter.  It's also a solid game for anyone who likes to play for 2-3 hours and then be done to do something else.I wouldn't recommend it for tactics gamers who focus on the 4X style games or military tactics exclusively, as the combat is focused most on relatively quick resolutions and a lot of elements are abstracted for the sake of flow.  Also if you get turned off by the idea of winning through the forging of friendships or pulling sneaky Scooby-Doo style tricks to fool your opponents, then the tone and theme here will not be for you.In the end, I enjoy it because it has a lot in common with board games I enjoy with my friends, it's a good break when I just need something different, and there's legitimate challenge in winning a game without feeling like I can only get to the end by finding every exploit possible or just because of a few lucky rolls of the virtual dice.

												The game is refreshing both lore/theme-wise and also combat mechanics. The idea of playing different adventurers is so refreshing, isntead of the typical monte-cristo-revenge, evil empire, etc, tropes. As for the mechanics, it's certainly new to me, but I wouldn't call revolutionary or anything. It's basically a tactical hexagonal, turn based (like Final Fantasy Tactics). But witha rock-papers-scissors twist and some other rather deeper game mechanics that take awhile to learn (mostly because of how new the game is and poorly documented it is on the net).It's not a great game or any kind of must-buy, but it's nifty and cool. I don't think you will be dissappointed and at best you might really like it a lot, I can see where others would. I would only buy it on sale for about $10 or so. I don't think it's quite worth a whole $20, especially since it still has a few bugs and is still in development. For example, random attitude changes at the START of a battle just completly ruins the entire game that took hours to progress through on ""Adventure mode"".			"

												This game can either be played as a light hearted story of fun adventures or a more serious game of planning and strategy. There are three main aspects to the game, exploration and skill based challenges (test your luck), a turn based combat system where you can blow rasperies at your enemies or shock them with a cattle prod, and the investment of your hard earned rewards to boost your future expeditions. The game needs a bit more content but the developers seem to be adding more all the time.			"

												The systems are deep. The pace is near perfection. The cast is fun, and finding the best combinations is a blast.Seriously, if you're a fan of turn based strategy, do yourself a favor and pick this up!Also, unlocking new characters to be leaders rewards experimentation with your team, as well as different approaches to combat and exploration! Its a blast, and each session lasts long enough to provide fun without overstaying its welcome. The loot system could use some work, but overall, you'll have fun.			"

												An adorable and well-constructed game which is paced excellently and has quite a bit of replayability. The balance is out of whack in a few places (the Abbess fight in particular seems rather difficult with the characters I'm likely to try to take on that adventure) and it could use a few more locations, but every trip to a place thus far has been considerably different thanks to a new crew and the random generation. A definite recommendation to anyone who likes roguelites or (light) turn-based strategies.			"

It is all around pretty grreat and has pretty solid replay value. Besides I am always on board with a game where I can make a ghost Captain give me evrything he has and run away crying because I called him names. The combat system is very unique in this game due to outcomes like that. Everything about this ghame is amazing buy it, play it, love it, thank me later.			"

												This game is a lot of fun, until you realize that your skill will never beat the RNG. Min-maxing your team seems to be the name of the game; making creative team combinations is asking for an early loss. For the first 15 or so hours I enjoyed the heck out of this game, even when I lost, because I learned what team comps and builds didn't work. But after I had a couple of teams make it through the whole game easily, I wanted to make less optimal compositions using the characters that are less overpowered. Unfortunately most of the roster does not team well for late game victories.By all means, try it. The full price tag is a good bargain for how much fun I had with it. And the balance is being retooled slowly over time, which means my gripes might fade away.			"

												This is one of those games that comes along and makes you rethink everything you thought you knew about a genre. It's a rogue-lite strategy story telling exploration game where you can endless mock the enemies tatse in fashion to win a fight. Or do magic tricks for them, or have a big old party. It has a great party system that makes every playthrough unqiue just in how your party interacts with each other. Not only do they have interesting reactions in combat, they react to each other outside of combat as well. The exploration is great, and it feels good, things are resolved with a simple % chance, but nothing is drawn out and unnecessary feeling. The world map seems a little barren at times (here's hoping we get more places to explore), but other than that I really love this game. If you like any kind of adventure, strategy, RPG, or rogue-lite style games you should enjoy this.			"

			Views: 238		

			Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL14p1fPgxfv__5AKnmAqveLER8eaW_Qx2 Let's play Renowned Explorers where we gather up a team of three dudes and dudettes and search for ancient treasures...		

Renowned Explorers is a very fun and addicting turn based strategy game with VERY unique RPG mechanics. You can win encounters through aggressiveness, friendliness or deviousness, sometimes your sword isn't the best way to solve conflicts! There are tons of treasures to find on each expedition, loads of decisions to make, gear to buy and lots of different teams to create. There are even multiple difficulty settings, wether you want rogue-like/hardcore play or easy going/exploration.I love, love, love the cartoonish humor in this game and even though I still haven't become the top dog in the International Society yet I still want to keep trying and trying! Do I recommend this game? YES, YES!			"

												RE is a great game which combines procedurally generated expeditions with a node based exploration system and an unexpectedly deep turn-based combat system dominated by mood. Between expeditions you can earn resources by lecturing, gain various entourages, research papers for various improvements and buy gear in shops.1)	The team – you pick 3 explorers (scientist, scout, fighter or speaker) each with various perks (engineering, diplomacy, survivalist etc.) that have an effect on your chance for success during expeditions. As you level them up they gain more perks and their stats increase2)	The expedition – every place (Mali, Hungary, Egypt etc.) has specific challenges and treasures to be discovered, and certain perks are more beneficial than others depending where you go as are certain styles of combat. There are 5 expeditions per game, so you won’t see them all during one playthrough (2-3 hours).3)	Combat – there are 3 moods of attack (friendly, devious and aggressive), and each mood has 3 emotions (friendly – you can impress, encourage or excite an enemy or your own unit). There are many types of attack (cone area dmg, ranged etc.) but most inflict dmg and one of those emotions. Furthermore those attacks have an effect on the general combat mood which can give you major buffs/debuffs. So if you are Devious and your enemy is Aggressive you get a big evasion boost and so on. The more you play the game, the more fun it gets.This game is immediately fun when you start playing. It has a great atmosphere (think Indy 3), is very ‘cheeky’,  many big encounters have unexpected resolutions and it gives many nods and winks along the way. But the sheer number of possible outcomes, expedition combinations, the fact there are even individual (not class based) choices for many of the 20 characters and the great combat system is what keeps you coming back over and over again.The developers are very active and new content is still being added. There is more to the game I didn’t put in my review and hopefully modding support is on the way. This game is perfect for mods.Anyway 60 hours in and I like the game so much I wrote my first review. Hope you like it as well.			"

												;If you're looking for a short(ish) game that allows you to play through one set of adventures in a few hours, this is perfect.  There are a lot of parallels to FTL, from the semi randomly generated maps, to the resources collected, to the semi random upgrades, but I feel that RE:IS has a lot more depth than FTL does - both are enjoyable in their own way, and both will take a while to master the tactics, but RE:IS just feels like there's more there.  The different combat powers, the way you can affect your crew and the enemy based on mood and how you 'attack' is very nice.  I like the different options you've got for upgrading between expeditions and how there are plenty of different paths to follow.  The game isn't perfect, but it's got plenty of enjoyment in it, and I'm definitely looking forward to more content.If you're looking for a nice, gentle difficulty curve, it seems like it might be there, if you pick the right crew and know the right order to take the expeditions in, but it seems to win, you're going to have to hit some of those nasty, RNG difficulty spikes and let fate have a big hand in the final decision.  I like the fact that you can 'finish' the game without winning, but there are also situations where you end up in a fight where you very quickly realize you're over your head, and unlike FTL, there's no way to run away and have the chance to lick your wounds, your game is over (assuming you play adventure mode).  This does seem a little harsh, even in a roguelike with permadeath, being locked in a fight where you know you can't win, which will end the game, but you still have plenty of resources if you could run away and try something else is more than a little frustrating.  I wish there was a 'run away!' option from encounters, but that's pretty minor.If I have any complaints about RE:IS it's that there's very little map content - there only seem to be a few of each 'difficulty' map, and within those maps, the variability is somewhat limited, so you're going to be playing the same mini adventures over and over again.  FTL has so many different encounters, this seems to be less of an issue there.Additionally, the only ongoing 'unlocks' that you can obtain in RE:IS are getting crew members to the point they can be captains - though this is similar to FTL's unlocking of new ship layouts and new ships, since you start with all the crew, this somehow, to me anyway, feels less like an accomplishment, but it doesn't take anything away from the enjoyability of the game.

												I played this game for one day and got over 50 achievements. This game is nuts.So I wrote a review for Abbey Games last project Reus and gave it a negative review. It wasn't a bad game but it was underwhelming and I found it boring. This game however, gets my hearty reccomendation.Reus and Renowned Explorers actually have some similarities, altough it may not appear that way. The setting, concept and aesthetics for each game is very different but both games are based on fairly simple systems and concepts, and the gameplay is centered around the player exploring the variations and nuances in those systems.The thing is in Reus, I had no desire to explore those variations, because I found it incredibly boring, but in Renowned Explorers I love it.The concept of Renowned Explorers is a Saturday Morning Cartoons-looking bunch of people are part of a society of explorers and adventurers in the age before colonialism stopped being fashionable.You lead this band of explorers across various landscapes looking for treasure, fame, and science.The game is played in two phases, the world map phase and the expedition phase. The world map is where you can manage resources, supplies, build up your team and perform odd jobs. It is also from the world map that you can select where to adventure next.While you're in the expedition phase you lead your party across a map in a specific region, like Mali, Hungary, The Andes, etc. You have a specific goal in each region but there's also a fair bit of random encounters and treasure to gather and explore. You can't always find everything because you're limited by the amount of supplies you have but that in itself encourages replayability.The game is fairly rogue-like, in the sense that you are not meant to do everything in a single playthrough, and when you do fail or reach a certain point, you are encouraged to just start over with different characters and a different approach.The game is also interesting because although ""battles"" happen in a turn-based tactical layout, the game gives you the option to solve these encounters with diplomacy or manipulation as well as straight-up combat.I've been seeing trends like this a lot lately. I wonder if the influence of Undertale is to blame.I liked the idea of having options to my battles, but the thing is, the most successful I've been so far, is with a team of explorers focused on a friendly diplomatic playstyle. In my opinion the game seems to push somewhat towards that sort of playstyle, which I find a bit annoying, as my aggressive playthroughs have been the least successful so far.Overall, if you're in for a rogue-lite experience and like the aesthetics and concept, this game is a lot of fun.One of the things that I hope more developers realize in the future, is that story can act as a reward for the player. The reason why exploring this game's depths and variations, even if they're relatively minute, is because I was always excited to see how the game rewarded me with the story elements involved. I wanted to know about the places I was visiting and the characters I was playing as or meeting.This is a really fun game, and although I think Abbey Games has stopped support on it, I would love it if more content was released for it down the line, or perhaps if they expand on the concept in a sequel.

												This game is great! One of my favourites that I've stumbled upon in Steam.I dabbled in rogue-like/turn-based rpgs before (FTL, XCOM, etc.) but Renown Explorers really cemented my love of that style of game. It takes an already pretty established motif and takes it in different directions. ""Encounters"" can be solved with violence or diplomatically in a constant juggling act of moods and emotions (enrage your opponent to cause them to be less effective at dealing damage, or excite your allies to make them greater speakers, etc.); be aggressive, devious, or friendly and reap the benefits of each play style. Each character plays differently (with different strengths and weaknesses, abilities, and interests) but they also play differently WITH other characters in your party too (especially thanks to some of the new dlc available to the game that increases the interactions between characters); maybe one character doesn't like another, or maybe they really admire them, or maybe one person wants to teach another what they've learned (skills, etc.), and so on. Bosses, battles, and scenarios are tough and challenging (especially at tougher difficulties like Adventure Mode) but I never felt like the game was impossible. There is a lot of variety and a lot of replay value here. I've played about 60+ hours and will properly sink much more than that into it before I'm done. I've geared each of my play throughs around gaining certain Steam achievements (mostly to help narrow my team selection, etc.) which has forced me to learn and adapt each play through (I sit at about 70-75% completion right now).Buy this game and get out there and EXPLORE!10/10			"

												Tags : Tactical - Exploration RPG*Hall of Fame Sub-Category*This is a very polished game with a nice blend of casual and tactical - you get different loadouts of crew abilities and items and you have to ressource manage to make the most out of expeditions. UI is very well designed, writing is alright, game is family friendly. Mechanics further improve on the familiar, psychic attack/regular attack, psychic defense/regular defense formula, by making it a triangle where weakenesses and strenghts rotate based on who uses what. It is a very elegant design. Game seems like it would have a very nice amount of replayability.I would highly recommend this game, and I am adding it to my shortlist of all time favorites.			"

												I just can't stop playing this. A very nice mix of tactics and strategy with an interesting battle system with some wild mechanic interactions (which I'm not sure I fully understand).   A run through from first expedition to the award ceremony lasts an hour or so; assuming you don't die too quickly.  Tons of characters to open up as Captains with a lot of variety for party make up; each can have a significant different feel.  A game that makes it fun to try different strategies, combinations and paths.  Loads of achievements and replay value.   I've expect to play this one for a long time to come.  (NOTE - I am playing with the paid DLC (hopefully first of many DLCs!).  I haven't played without it so I don't know how different that might make a play through.  Big Thumbs up on this one.(I also recommend Curious Expedition!)			"

												This game is truly amazing, although I may be saying that due to my love of exploration and collectables. Nevertheless, I almost cannot fault Renowned Explorers in any way - the gameplay for example is intense but rewarding, the combat being different to what you might expect in a very good way, utilising a peculiarly mini-Civilization style of game progression.RE:IS has more going for it than just the gameplay, though - the artwork in particular is incredible, and can honestly I am in love with the gorgeous art style and humurous atmosphere, as well as the color scheme and everything you can see on screen; it's all beautiful. As previously said I find it difficult to fault any part of the game, although as a warning to those not aware:Renowned Explorers is set up to engage you in multiple playthroughs, and so each completion of a new game (with the DLC) adds more content during your 5 expeditions per game, and by the fourth or fifth playthrough you will have a much better understanding of the game and its mechanics. If this puts you off, for example if you prefer a larger campaign in your games, then maybe this is simply not the game for you. However if this excites you then go ahead and buy Renowned Explorers: International Society ASAP; it might just be up your alley.			"

												This game took me by surprise- I thought I would hate it, but I LOVE IT. The strategy involved in planning your moves (on maps and in encounters) is way more in-depth than I anticipated. Being able to choose various moods (actions) that affect the gameplay, gathering resources like ""research"" and treasure is really rewarding to me. I've gotten burnt out on running around shooting raiders/aliens/orcs, this game is slow-paced in a good way. There's kind of a steep learning curve for the emotions but it's not too complicated. As a plus, it's safe to play if my daughter (3.5 yo) is in the room.			"

												I can not stop playing this game. I adore it. If Indiana Jones designed a strategy game, this would be it. I'm normally a point and click / puzzle / story type of game person, but this one just has me hooked. I love that you don't have to be violent to win, and in fact, to unlock achievement you have to play nice once in a while. Every time I play I get a little more out of it: a new treasure, a new campfire story, or new team leader wins. Play time is short enough to not be frustrating and long enough to keep you occupied for an evening if you like.And as a beginning gamer, this game levels up with me. It doesn't punish you for taking it easy, as so many do. So when I'm in the mood for a challenge, I can have one. But when I just want to explore and unwind, I can too. I've also just recently discovered its active community, with the game designers playing a large role. They put out weekly challenges for you to solve, which, again, keep the game new. This is by far my favourite game in the world right now. Please please please keep expanding it. I wish there were more like it!			"

While on mission your crew will go into combat (which is tactical and turn-based) and perform skill checks outside of combat, all with nice fluffy descriptions.In combat your crew will be alternating between social and physical attacks to get most out of moods and stances, combat is in-depth and interesting.At first even classic difficulty seamed easy, but in later part of the game it was properly challanging.I recommened for all fans of rogue-like.

I've been playing for more than a few hours and I have not even touched the variety of situations you can get yourself into. This is the best part of the game. And with the DLC there is even more to explore. The vast variety of encounters is what really gives you a feeling of exploring.The combat is unexciting and lacks the complexity of higher budget games but it is enough to provide a challenge and a sense of struggle so when you complete your adventure you feel like you earned it.The cartoony characters are diverse and fun to explore since they each have their own skills. It's good to choose characters for your team which compliment each other and are different at the same time.I like this game.Do I love this game? ... meh ...

												Seduce nuns! Beat wolves with shovels!  Insult mummies by saying they've soiled themselves! All three of those are things you can do in Renowned Explorers. You have your four classes (Scientists, Fighters, Speakers and Scouts) and they all work pretty much like any RPG. Combat's simple, but you don't always need to beat stuff to death. You see; There's Peaceful approach (For all you Undertale fans out there) to make your enemies feel REALLY happy! There's the nasty approach which basically lets you insult them so much into being demoralized, or there's the good old stabb, smash, shoot or slash with the Aggressive approach. Pretty much expect everyone to use those against you too.			"

												Renowned Explorer (RE) is a really great game, the gameplay is a mix of strategy, tactics and exploration, with some RPG elements (xp, loot, equipment, chose your own adventure), and the mix holds really well thanks to a great execution by Abbey Studio.But more than that, it is really an adventure you should experience. It makes you think, design your own stategy & test it on the map. You will fail miserably at times, just to retry and enjoy Epic victoriesSo what's not to like ? well it's just personal, but the reason I didn't buy it sooner was because of the heroe's portrait design, it could use some improvement, after all they are the heroes of this game and they should deserve extra care, the rest of the design is well done, the music complements well the feeling of being part of a great adventure.I really look forward to extensions and improvements to get my team on another epic adventures.

												A unique and polished experience. There aren't many rogue-like RPG's out there, I love the combat sytem with the different emotions and ways to win the battle. There are tons of different characters to choose fromand to pair up in a team of 3. The comic book esque art style is pleasing to the eye. The game is lacking in content and having to explore the same areas in different playthroughs gets repetitive, but the ongoing updates from the developer will hopefully fix this in the future.Great game overall, would recommend.

												Renowned Explorers: International Society is not your typical party-based RPG/Adventure game. I'm not even a good example to review this product, since this this is not my game genre, but when I bought it I decided to take a shot in the dark and, oh boy, was I glad I did... This game can suck an entire day out of your life simply because you are having too much fun with it and not even realizing. The sense of progression (the RPG part) is extremely satisfying: Every time you get a new perk or a new item for your charecter, you end up rediscovering the entire game. The sense of a strong party is also really good, since after three or four ""encounters"" (battles), you get a hold of your entire deck and understand the roles which your charecters will assume once in battle to achieve maximum efficiency. Of course the game's focous is the adventure you see yourself in and the infinite deck of possibilities is what really makes it fun. Choosing who is going to do what in a certain event decides everything you'll get from an exploration. To top it off, I'd just like to add how the devs perfectly integrated a dynamic combat system, with nine different variables that affect the gameplay, all of which depend on a charecters emotional strength, mood and defense power. You can learn more about this in the store page or just buyin' the game already, cause that is going to be my final point: Even if nothing in this review called your attention, many other things in-game will, being why I strongly suggest that you should buy Renowned Explorers: International Society.

												I've only played this game for 10 hours but I can already tell that it's going to scratch my ""Faster than Light""  itch for a while to come.  The sheer number of random instances are amazing and the ability to play around with your expedition team to test out different group dynamics makes for quite a bit of replayability.The only complaint I have is there are a pretty small amount of expeditions currently,  like 8 different locales that need to be explored.  Though they're decent sized there definitely needs to be more added which the devs are in the process of doing so that complaint is being dealt with.Bottom line is if you're on the fence about this game but you like RNG's like FTL then you'll find a good passtime in this.

												This is an amazing game that has plenty of complexity and differing paths to enhance replayability, but still manages to be a relaxed game that can be played casually for a lot of fun. The item system is fantastic, allowing for building up characters differently each game. The characters themselves are perfect, with a huge amount of different strategies to play and different groups of characters with which to adventure.Additionally, the developers are among the best I have ever seen, continually releasing patches, updates, and even new content for free! There have been tons of community events hosted by Abbey Games to promote people playing the game and when the event is completed, the devs usually add in new items or content as a reward to the community.This is a fantastic game that is fully worth whatever price it is, and I highly recommend it.

												This is a great game. I see it's on sale, if you don't have it and you're considering getting it do so.  If you like turn-based combat or boardgames then you should be right at home. The game has a humorous, upbeat style and likeable charactes. Interactions are all text based, there isn't really anything grim or dark if that's your thing, but it's a good time and mixing and matching your crew of adventurers while devising new strategies is a lot of fun. To me at least. I saw this game was on sale, I had previously played it and liked it enough that I thought I should give it a recommendation for anyone on the fence. It plays a lot like a board game, with rpg and strategy elements. You pick a crew of three adventurers (who all have their own personalities, perks and skills that will help in various challenges), you travel around an adventure board, encountering combat and dialogue challenges, leveling your characters up, collecting treasures and moving on to the next adventure which you pick from a world map. Between adventures you return to the Society headquarters where you can buy various specialists that either grant a benefit or make the game play slightly differently and place research points into a civilization like tech tree that does the same. You can also buy items for your characters here that do everything from simply adding attack and armor to adding new perks and skills. There are a lot of different ways to win the game, and there's dice rolls on everything that you can weigh in your favor with specialities, treasures and craftable/salvageable toolkits. The devs are still supporting the game with new content and tweaks so things are still changing all the time. If any of this appeals to you, you might like renowned explorers. I recommend the game and you can easily find out within the return period if it's for you so what's stopping you, try it!			"

												I've really enjoyed this game. The turn based tactical combat has an XCOM feel, and it can be just as brutal. Exploring on the map and managing resources is a blast, and nothing is more exciting than weighing a small guaranteed reward against a larger riskier one. The storytelling is fun and light hearted, though it loses a bit of its luster after a dozen or so playthroughs. There are a few clunky mechanics, but the devs are rolling out patches fairly consistantly to fix things and improve. The game is ~$20 right now, and you will easily get your money out of it.			"

Posted: October 9, 2015
												Giant scorpions!  Pirates!  Sheep?  Welcome to the world of Renowned Explorers!  I'll start by saying I bought this game on a whim.  I was looking for something fun and challenging, but that wouldn't take a vast amount of time to complete. I would have settled for a ""Meh"" time killer, but I bought this and now I'm hopelessly addicted.  I can honestly say my first thought after an hour of playing was that I'd gladly pay for any future DLC to expand the game.  And that was after I'd lost five times.  It's a unique game that can be a bit difficult to describe, but rather than just shouting, ""I love it!"", I'll give it a try.   Basically you start by selecting a team of 3 characters from pools of 4 different types of explorers.  Each explorer is unique (some attacks abilities are repeated but the characters all have their own animations and it goes a long way to giving them the feeling of individual personalities) and has Skills, that effect how they play and their success rate on events that can occur while on an adventure.  After selecting your team, you start working your way through Adventures you want to undertake.  While on Adventures,  you explore locations on the Adventure Map searching for resources (used to upgrade your team) and events.  Events fall into three basic categories:  Adventure Wheel challenges (think The Price is Right), combat instances and story challenges (like choose your own adventure books). Lots of  events contain elements of all three.  Combat is tactical and features a unique system in which attacks are divided into Friendly (charm), Devious (psychological) and Aggressive (physical violence).  This ties into the flavor of your team.  Now at this point, we need to jump back to character selection.  Certain characters complement each other better when teamed together.  I've read some comments criticising the combat system as confusing and certain adventures as too hard.  The truth is, what team you put together determines which expeditions you're best suited to undertake and what tactics are best to use in combat.  *The game gives you all this information, you just need to read it.* When you select your crew, it tells you what types of team (Friendly, Devious or Aggressive) the character works best with.  It even gives examples in the character discription of the types of charcters they'd work well with.  It will even show you the type of team (Friendly, Devious, Aggressive) you're putting together at the top of the team selection screen.  The descriptions of Adventures tell you what type of team or what character skills are best suited for those adventures.  I imagine a lot of those people complaining did what I did at first, which is skim this information and go, ""These three look cool together, I'll use them!""  Team Super Awesome may be the coolest looking group of explorers around, but it doesn't mean they'll work that well  together or that they have any hope of  making it out of Transylvannia alive.   This is a roguelike.  I recommend sticking fairly close to the recommended teams until you have the chance to get a feel for the Adventures and different characters.  For the combat system, it's one of my personal favorite things about the game.  You can overwhelm pirates with charm, beat the living daylights out of evil cultists, or even make an ancient goddess cry and run away.  The types of attacks you use (your Atttitude) versus the type of attacks your opponent is using (their Attitude) create a Mood (displayed in the top center of the tactical map) that grants various buffs/debuffs.  As a tip, next to the Mood display are little indicators showing how many of the other types of attacks you can use before your Attitude changes, which changes the Mood.  You can mix and match attacks, managing and manipulating the Mood to your advantage is part of the challenge.  Be aware, the AI can do the same.  Pros:  A wide cast of playable characters that feel like individuals (not just reskinned clones).  A fun art style that goes very well with the game's sense of humour.  The combat system is unique and challenging.  Tons of content and an enormous amount of replayability.  While there is some violence, most of it is slapstick or cartoonish, and  I'd say it's one of the safer games out here for younger players.  It's fun, which I know sounds rather simple, but I can honestly say at no point have I been bored or felt gameplay was tedious.  Stability (I haven't had a single bug or crash).  Cons:  A playthrough only consists of 5 Adventures.  You won't understand why that would qualify as a con until you play it and realize how much you wish you could squeeze in just one more  :)			"

												I am honestly in love with this game.While this is not the most in depth battle system there is out there, there is more than enough to make you think about your next action: Do i back off and heal my characters? Is the debuff worth the heal? Or does this character really benefit from the buff this gives more than the other? And that just on the defensive side. Positioning is key, and keeping track of your opponents and their skills, especially on harder difficulties.As for exploration, with many events in the game (500 at least i believe) runs will never really be the same: coupled with the fact that your explorers have their own personalities, which will influence some of the events, and their skills, which will definitely impact your chances of success. It's all risk vs reward, and how far you're willing to push your luck for a bit more gold, status, or research, or just stay safe so you dont lose those valuable resources, or endanger that good run.Can really recommend this game, it got me hooked, and with so much personality in the characters, and every captain having a different leader perk, there's plenty to find here; especially if you liked FTL, since there's some of that game in here... but with a strategy RPG battle system, and less space. More treasure, though.			"

												Renowned Explorers captures the feel of pulpy adventure serials through an appropriate soundtrack, charming character designs, and decent animation, all the while providing an interesting set of systems for hex-based ""combats,"" social maneuverings, and between-mission downtime sessions.  The ""combats"" themselves aren't necessarily solvable by violence alone, however, and may be won through feel-good diplomacy or psychological cruelty, and is reflected in a rock-paper-scissors approach to each units' three base abilities - one each for aggression, deviousness, and friendliness.  Overall, this results in an engaging experience which can be enjoyed in around two hours of playtime per session.  Reaching the 2500 points required to win is a little tricky, especially with the old research trees being overhauled and replaced, but adjustable difficulty settings make this a tad more manageable task.

												It's a decent game, if a bit on the repetitive side. Even swtiching up your team and strategy doesn't help as much as you might think, as you're playing through the same scenarios (randomized to an extent, but the same core events at each location) with variations on the same kinds of attacks and defenses.Visually, there is nothing to complain about. It looks great, and it plays snappy. There's a decent amount of humor, and it's entertainingly written. I've only encountered a handful of weird UI things, and no bugs worth mentioning.As a starting point for a bigger game experience -- updates, DLC and the like -- it's good. If there were dozens of adventures and more gameplay variety, I could see giving this a whole-hearted ""Buy it. Play it. Love it."" review. It's not there yet.			"

												I heartly recommend this fun little game. What seems simple on the top can prove quite grueling at higher difficulties. It doesn't have much rogue like stealth in it though. You choose your own playstyle, meaning you can strongarm your way through, or charm!			"

												A fun rogue-like in which you create a party composition of characters to find ancient treasures. I particularly enjoyed this game because you could choose to seek out skill based events instead of just pure combat, with success percentages changing depending on your party's explorers were skilled in.Game play takes place on a board where you can move to different nodes that have possible events listed on them. You can choose nodes with skill based story events or go for combat nodes, which revolves around a novel rock-paper-scissors type of attacking. While the combat was interesting, I found clearing the events to be much more fun, as the well-written events all calculated your success by formulating the characters physical stats as well as their skills, such as diplomacy, engineering, archaelogy, etc. The game then animates a spinner that makes you hold your breath as it makes that one last tick between success or failure.The setting is incredibly novel and charming as you explore the world as a turn of the century exploring league searching unkown and wild lands for rare artifacts.The replayability is very high; each playthrough doesn't take that much time, and the urge to replay again with a better more effecient setup or completely different exploring party is very strong.

												It's hard for me to call this a ""good"" game- I'm not exactly sold on the weird friendliness / violence tactical fighting system- but it is strangely moresome. I think it's because it's a well executed roguelike that finds fun in the format with short well-constructed campaigns. Although I didn’t feel like an explorer that much really, it is a delightfully fresh theme (one can take only so many dungeons), and has a great progression of unlocks and content discovery. I think it has some occasionally troubling representations of the non-Western locales you explore, and I really wish it had taken an approach to the era more like 80 days did. On the other hand, it has a great diverse cast of characters, with more playable women than men (all of whom are awesome). It’s definitely worth checking out.			"

												I usually dislike turn-based RPG's with complex management systems, and this game is certainly that. However, the charm and wittiness of how combat works actually draws me in more than I'd like to admit. If you want to call it that, as it draws more inspiration from ace attorney and Faster Than Light than your standard ""here are a dozen similar-but-different ways to harm an opponent""-RPG.Aside from that, the game certainly does a lot with very little (most encounters are but text, a few bitmap images and some quirky sounds). The wheel of fortune is great, encounters are interesting and the writing is top-notch.I'm still absolutely not sold on this type of game. But Renowned explorers is certainly unique enough to warrant a look even for those who usually skip traditional RPG's.			"

												This is an amazing game that has plenty of complexity and differing paths to enhance replayability, but still manages to be a relaxed game that can be played casually for a lot of fun. The item system is fantastic, allowing for building up characters differently each game. The characters themselves are perfect, with a huge amount of different strategies to play and different groups of characters with which to adventure.Additionally, the developers are among the best I have ever seen, continually releasing patches, updates, and even new content for free! There have been tons of community events hosted by Abbey Games to promote people playing the game and when the event is completed, the devs usually add in new items or content as a reward to the community.This is a fantastic game that is fully worth whatever price it is, and I highly recommend it.

												Hmm. Well honestly beats the hell out of Curious Expidition out of sheer character and presentation alone honestly, in my pathetically humble opinion. Original gameplay that actually offers nonviolent options while still satisfying that weird reptillian urge to uterly dominate your opponent. Has alot of roleplaying potential, and half of the fun is making up your party composition at the start of the game. Characters run the gamut from power hungry crazies to chill bros. Bonus points for having a pretty mellow and fun soundtrack.Alot of different encounters and the randomness of the dice make for decent replayability without being too masochistic, although the further you get the more it inches that ramrod towards your♥♥♥♥♥♥if you arent properly prepared.

												This is a great game. I see it's on sale, if you don't have it and you're considering getting it do so.  If you like turn-based combat or boardgames then you should be right at home. The game has a humorous, upbeat style and likeable charactes. Interactions are all text based, there isn't really anything grim or dark if that's your thing, but it's a good time and mixing and matching your crew of adventurers while devising new strategies is a lot of fun. To me at least. I saw this game was on sale, I had previously played it and liked it enough that I thought I should give it a recommendation for anyone on the fence. It plays a lot like a board game, with rpg and strategy elements. You pick a crew of three adventurers (who all have their own personalities, perks and skills that will help in various challenges), you travel around an adventure board, encountering combat and dialogue challenges, leveling your characters up, collecting treasures and moving on to the next adventure which you pick from a world map. Between adventures you return to the Society headquarters where you can buy various specialists that either grant a benefit or make the game play slightly differently and place research points into a civilization like tech tree that does the same. You can also buy items for your characters here that do everything from simply adding attack and armor to adding new perks and skills. There are a lot of different ways to win the game, and there's dice rolls on everything that you can weigh in your favor with specialities, treasures and craftable/salvageable toolkits. The devs are still supporting the game with new content and tweaks so things are still changing all the time. If any of this appeals to you, you might like renowned explorers. I recommend the game and you can easily find out within the return period if it's for you so what's stopping you, try it!			"

												This game is the second release from a company that is quickly becoming one of my favorite developers.  They had a game with impressive depth and presentation in Reus, and although it lacked a couple of satisfying gameplay elements (most notably the ability to change time), it was still a killer experience.  Renowned Explorers takes that bar and raises it so, so much higher.  If you're a fan of any of the following themes, you'd be amiss to skip this title: rogue-lite, exploration, team customization, good characterization, great presentation, tactical combat.			"

												Don't want to write a review, too busy playing the game!No seriously, this game is charming, interesting and while on the surface, doesn't appear to have a lot of replayability due to the number of scenarios, actually hides an amazing amount of secrets in each location. So what does this game bring to the table? What makes it replayable?It is designed to be played multiple times so each session will only last a few hours at most. You form a three person team from a roster of 20 characters divided into four specializations. The catch being that only four are unlocked at the start to be in the captain roll. Simply playing the game and running with different characters in the other two positions permanently unlocks them for the captain position in future playthroughs. On top of this you can choose how you approach your encounters, be it friendly, devious or aggressively so playing for or against type can throw your opponents for a loop.Now the biggest drawback is the lack of locations to explore. Currently you have three possible starting locations and then choose from a handful of others. Your goal is to gain enough reknown to beat a rival explorer at a special party, but you only have time for a total of five explorations before the deadline hits and the most reknowned explorer is crowned. While I will freely admit to wanting more locations to explore there is a lot of replay value in what is currently available if you're determined to hunt down all the side quests or you want to nail a significant portion of the 100+ achievements currently available. Each currently available explorable location is stuffed full of interesting things to uncover. You can scour every spot on a playthrough only to discover a different event chain in that location in your next playthrough. The locations were definitely well thought out and had a lot of time and effort put into each one by the developers.Would I recommend this game?Yes. If nothing else, it's definitely worth a solid ten to fifteen hours of gameplay just to unlock all the captains and see a good chunk of the quest events. There are plenty more hours to be had if you want to find all the in game trophies and want to grab a good chunk of or even all the achievements. I just finished unlocking all 20 characters for captain use at nearly 13 hours and have only gotten about half of the in game treasure from various side quests and main quest chains and finding all of said side quests.tl;dr10/10 Would make sheep feel bad about their life choices again.

												These impressions are after 5 hours of playtime. My video impressions review is available here.Click here to view this review with images.Overview of the gameRenowned Explorers by Abbey Games is an adventure strategy game set in a fictitious 19th century where the aim is to become the most famous adventurer! A playthrough in RE consists of your team embarking on 5 expeditions, upgrading your team, and gathering renown to beat your rival, the French clown, Rivaleux.I’ve played the tutorial twice, and in my second playthrough we were defeated during the final mission. I would expect a playthrough to be between 3 - 5 hours, but this game can be replayed due to randomised encounters and a large variety of ways to adapt your team.Flow of the gameA game starts with you picking your team of three characters. Each character has unique skills, traits, abilities, stats. I didn’t pay too much attention to the numbers, but I now understand the implications of skills from playing the game, so would spend more time creating a team that suits my tastes. The great thing the game does is recommend crew members from a given character. There are 20 characters to pick from.Characters will affect how well suited the entire crew is for different attitudes, so it is worth explaining the mood system the game uses.Mood and Spirit SystemThe game represents character’s (both friend and foe) health as spirit which symbolises both physical and mental health. When dealing with an encounter, you can defeat an enemy’s spirit by being so friendly that they wish to stop fighting you, or by being devious and upsetting them (essentially destroying their soul), or by standard physical aggressive attacks.Each character also has an attitude which describes the state of the character. For example, an enemy character might encourage me with a friendly attack that hurts my spirit, but increases my mood to be confident, which gives me a bonus so my next aggressive attack will do 25% more damage.Each team also has a attitude describing the team’s approach, and can be handled using the rock-paper-scissors approach to exploit weaknesses.On top of this (and my favourite feature) is the mood system which describes the battlefield based off you and your enemies actions. The mood changes after one or more strikes from the same attitude reach a certain threshold. Friendly moods are generally more fragile to maintain than devious or aggressive ones. Moods may empower your team, or weaken you.For example, if everyone is friendly to each other, you may enter the ‘Pleasant’ mood.In this mood, it gives a major boost to physical attacks but only takes one aggressive attack to turn the mood to ‘Brutal’ (if you imagine a group of people encouraging one another and then someone throwing a punch, it would be brutal!). There are about 9 moods in the game, depending on the attitudes of the two teams.I have found the mood system to be fresh and surprising deep when dealing with encounters, and I’m now finding more creative ways to deal with certain characters.When you have selected your team you are sent to your first expedition on an island which serves as a tutorial. The tutorial does a great job at covering everything, and is about 30 minutes long (each expedition is generally longer due to the rising difficulty).Your team has two major resources, resolve and supplies. Run out of supplies and your team with have major issues. Run out of resolve and you lose the game!You move around the island, much like a board game, and each ‘stop’ on the map may have different outcomes. You may find some resources You may need to pick a team member to handle a situation (think events in FTL). Each character’s chances are shown for success, and the game does a great job of explaining the breakdown of the chance, plus all the possible outcomes. A dice is rolled for the outcome based off the chances. You may have an encounter (which is their term for a battle).Encounters are playing on a grid battlefield (think XCOM) using a variety of skills (each character has an skill for each mood to begin with). Each battle has a dominant attitude (based off the number of attacks you used of each type) which may give you greater rewards or change the way an encounter plays out. For example, if you were dealing with some aggressive locals, being friendly with them might encourage them to spread the word about you afterwards.As you move around the map you gather tokens that are cashed in for certain resources after the mission. There are also extra special tokens which give bigger bonuses. These resources are:Gold - Which is used to buy items in shops.Status (reputation) - Which is used to acquire an Entourage, which can give your team bonuses (like more resources from tokens). Also used to upgrade shops.Research - Used to unlock technologies (similar approach is the Policy tree in Civilization V).Insight - Used to get more of the above resources.After completing an expedition, you are returned to the world map where you can spend your resources, upgrade your crew, and gain your bearings for the next expedition. Different stores are available to spend your resources, and new stores are added depending on which expeditions are taken.There are still a few other mechanics (like character leveling) but I believe this highlights all major features of the game. Why I enjoy this gameI have thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game, here are a collection of my thoughts on why:- The game is very satisfying, as you built up your massive collection of tokens on your expedition to cash in later. It helps you feel like you have achieved something on your quest.- The game universe is fun and creative (think Indiana Jones + Tintin).- Beautiful artwork for a very diverse set of characters and locations.- Nice music to set the scene.- It seems impossible to unlock everything in one playthrough. For example, I only unlocked 8 out of 36 possible research items, so there are many strategies to try.- Variety of expedition locations to take, with it’s events being procedurally generated. You probably could visit all the locations in 2 - 3 playthroughs, but it’s nice to see it’s not the same places every time.- Game can be played with save/load states, or in ironman mode where all decisions are final.- Game has great help/reference guide.Things that may be disappointing- It can be frustrating if all your random rolls fail (but there are upgrades to help this).- Mood system can take a while to figure out (but it's worth it).- Each location is essentially the same if you strip away it’s character. Though I do feel like that character is enough to make each location interesting and different (think how in FTL that sectors were different types, and while they were basically the same it does still influence your decisions and the situations you encounter there).- Some simple UI features missing, like end turn once all characters have taken their actions.- A playthrough can be quite short at 3 - 5 hours.Overall impressionsI was thoroughly impressed with Renowned Explorers. It has been great fun to play, and surprising with how easy it was to get into, but also contain a lot of depth at the same time. Also it is great value for it’s release price if the game interests you. A solid 4 out of 5 stars from me (possibly 4 ½ with more playtime and UI fixes).★★★★☆If you have any questions or comments, you can tweet me on Twitter at @JackAttackNZ			"

												What a fun little gem of a game!Part rogue-like, part RPG, all adventure!The game's writing is witty and fun, and the combat system is a pretty clever rock-paper-scissors kind of system that has enough depth, but not too difficult.The game doesn't have too much longevity though, once you play through the adventures once or twice, there isn't a whole lot of replayability.But is it worth the price? Absolutely!			"

												Excellent game! The game has a ton of replay value by mixing and matching different crews and going on different expeditions. You can choose different abilities among your crew to help on different expeditions or encounters. The battles play like a tactical rpg with some rock-paper-scissors elements. There is some randomness involved in different challenges, with modifiers depending on different attributes your team possesses.Pros:-The animation style is endearing-Easy to start, but also has a lot of depth in terms of tactics and combinations-Game is light hearted-Unique game, really unlike other things I have played before-You feel accomplished when you win a tough battle or get a rare treasureCons-Starting tutorial can be a little bare so it takes a couple playthroughs to get the hang of things-Some bosses can be annoying or difficult if you dont play them the right way (reinforcements keep coming or the boss may be immune to a predominant skill your team has). This requires you to play a couple times to know how to prepare for a certain expedition, or read a guide. Overall highly recommended.			"

												A wonderful idea, and wonderful mechanics. My big gripe is that like many of these games it seems the developers forgot to ask anyone who didn't know the combat system inside and out how difficult it is. If you can beat the game you need to have played it almost perfectly. Aside from that, it is charming and engaging enough to keep me interested where a worse game would have driven me off with the difficulty.EDIT: Newly implemented difficulty selector. I still don't know how to beat the final level on classic difficulty (if it is possible) but now if you want to see everything you can play on easy.			"

												SUMMARY: A fun, clever, challenging, and character-filled ""exploration and Tactical RPG roguelike"" set in a fictional 19th century.  Manage a party of explorers, choose different ways to deal with enemies and challenges, unlock mysteries, and try to become the most renown explorer ever. There's a lot to do and find - and you can play an entire game in an hour or less . . . then do it again.  A must-buy for fans of good adventure/SRPG games.Renowned Explorers: International Society takes place in a fictional 19th century where Exploring is the big thing, and most countries get along to sponsor investigations of the mysterious phenomena of the world - and find all sorts of amazing treasures.  You're running one of these adventuring groups seeking fame, fortune, and of course to show up that complete jerk Rivaleux with the great hair that keeps ruining EVERYTHING by finding it.Plus, you get to do this your way.  The game is all about choice:* Select a party of 3 adventurers from 4 differnt types (Scientists, Scouts, Fighters, and Speakers).  Each adventurer is a unique personality with special abilities, skills, looks, and even backstories you can unlock.* Send them forth on adventures where you travel strange lands seeking fortune, fame, information, encounters, treasures, and occasionally lost sheep and llamas.* Face assorted challenges that will test your skills and planning (or at least risk management), and weigh your options wisely.* Exchange campfire stories to boost your abilities or find out more about your crew - and watch them develop* Have them enter into conflict with assorted inhabitants and enemies, and decide how to handle the issues - friendliness, deception, or aggression.  Abilities and your options change as you use them and as the ""mood"" of battle shifts.  You could find yourself sending an enemy home in a body bag, off crying, or have them decide you're a great person and leave you alone.* Improve your characters as they gain experience, with new skills abilities.* Return home with treasures you find or select.* Upgrade your research, hire helpers and specialists, buy equipment, and even deliver lectures to raise resources.  As you explore more, Exporer groups will help you out, further increasing options.* Head towards the inevitable conflict with famous explorer and walking smug grin Rivaleux to show him up as best explorer!* As you play keep unlocking more possible lead characters, extra stories to tell around the campfire, and more.* Try and find every treasure and campfire story.  Oh and beat Rivaleux!* Participate in various weekly challenges.Renown explorers packs in adventure, mystery, choice, resource management, three kinds of conflicts, and plenty of humor - and a campaign takes at most an hour to play!  Since each game often unlocks more options after you play, you can try it again with a new mix of characters, new leaders, new stories, and randomized settings.Along with the great game play is excellent graphic design, with a colorful cartoony world, a good soundtrack, and snappy writing.  The game is even self-aware of how bizarre it's world is, with characters commenting on and embodying old tropes of pulps and victorian adventure with gleeful self-awareness.On top of all of this there's a great tutorial and clear controls, so it's easy to pick up for people who aren't always into the tactical RPG genre.So who should by this game?* First and foremost, if ""easy to play/hard to master roguelike cartoony Tactical RPG with base management"" pushes your buttons you should buy this.*If you like a good character-optimizing and exploration-focused adventure game, you'll enjoy this.  Getting things ""just right"" is a challenge.* If you're looking for a fun rouglike RPG - though this is more map-point exploring than corridor-crawling with tactical battle over simple click-and-fight.It's hard NOT to reccomend this game to people, it's that much fun, that easy to pick up, that challenging.  Except to Rivaleux, he's a jerk.			"

												I have to say I had a bad first impression of the game, art wise. Upon first starting up, the initial loading screen and introduction menu looks badly slapped together. Really, white text on black screen loading? Abbey Games you couldn't have done a simple but nice splash screen with a loading bar? And the start game menu! Why are all the text buttons arranged in a small row vertically (so hard to read!), when there is so much space? Why is the start menu screen background a flat boring landscape when you have far better art throughout the game?Whilst this may come off as nitpicky, first impressions do count!And this is such a shame (and so easy to fix!), as RE:IS is a gem, and I can wholeheartedly recommend it.It is a great mash-up of gameplay genres: rogue-like permadeath choices (if you choose to play it this way), choose-your-own-adventure storytelling, reasonably deep and interesting tactical hex-grid-like battles.It has an interesting and fresh setting, fun and funky characters, mostly well-written and funny storylines.I had a lot of fun playing this game. Even though I won it twice in classic adventure mode (failed in many other runs), I would go back to retry again using different captains and characters because you want to see how other strategies play out.I would say this game has surprising depth.Replay value wise, I agree with other commenters that the number of expeditions are a little on the low side. After a few playthroughs, you have seen many of the events there are to see. If this can be bumped up, it will really make the game shine.			"

Posted: September 25, 2015
												I have to say this is probably one of the most fun games I’ve downloaded since making a Steam account, definitely a pleasant surprise.  It’s a fun little premise based on running a team of three explorers through a handful of expeditions to exotic locations (pirate-infested isles, Count Dracula’s castle, the mysterious Shangri-Lai), exploring and gathering rare treasures.  Your time is split basically between three screens – the planning screen where you use the resources you’ve gathered to buy new equipment, unlock scientific advancements to improve your abilities, and gather an entourage of followers to increase the value of future resources.  It’s a nice little balance that allows you to take different approaches in how you improve your team.  Easy to use but requires some time and thought to really master and make the most of your choices.  The other two screens are the game itself.  The first is a map of the area where you pick what locale on the map to explore, trying to match your characters’ diverse skills to what the region is likely to yield.  IE, don’t send your party of fighters to spots where expertise in engineering or science is needed.  Finally the third, where you’ll spend a bulk of your time, is in the turn-based combat screen in which you resolve encounters according to your characters’ abilities in a kind of fun paper-rock-scissors dynamic that can see a friendly argument rapidly turn into fisticuffs.  The challenge of course being to balance it so that your own characters stay one step ahead of the fight by leveraging the skills their best at.    Altogether it’s a diverse little game that allows for a lot of play-throughs with different teams and styles.   It’s also the rare RPG where skills actually mean something more than just an alternative way to kill enemies.  The right mix of skills on your team can have your characters gathering tremendous amounts of renown (the way the game is scored) while a poorly selected and equipped team may end up just scraping by or eventually outmatched in the later stages.  It’s even possible to go through the game without technically ever getting into a physical fight – defeating enemies purely through the persuasive powers of your speech skill, a real rarity in any kind of adventure game.I’d say it’s definitely worth a try if anything about the premise appeals to you.  The developers did a pretty excellent job of bringing the world to life and offering something a little different, and they’ve continued to tweak an already well-developed game in response to the community’s wants and suggestions.  And if it’s the art that’s maybe giving you pause, I’d advise you don’t let that dissuade you – it’s actually a pretty nice looking game when it’s running and while the cartoony style fits the sometimes humorous tone, this is a serious game that takes a level of skill and dedication to really master.

												I can say that this game represent a rock-paper-scissors type of game. Why? I just felt like it is. It's also a rogue-like type of game so keep note of that before buying it.PRO:- The battle mechanic is what makes this game unique! Why? Different action = Different outcome :)- Easy to learn the basic BUT the twist is that it's hard to master the game. That is what makes this game FUN!- If you rush throughout the game, you might be able to finish it in 1 to 2 hours BUT again, you can play it over and over and OVER again with different setup (Crew) which give different results which makes it interesting hence it's a rogue-like type of game.- Watch youtube videos or read the guide on how to understand more of the game and trust me, you will definetly love the game more if you understand the mechanic because there are a lot of possible ways to explore or battle the enemy like I previously said on my first PRO above.- Tons of setup (Crew which consist of a captain and two members) to choose from!CONS:- If you are the type of person who does not have the patience to learn deep in a game's mechanic, you won't be enjoying this game, Im pretty sure you won't.- Honestly, I found no cons tho... that is pretty much it..TL;DR> Love Rogue-like? Love learning a game mechanic to it's deepest so you can truly master it? Love random rewards based on your action in game? Then you might like or love this game!Oh another important note, you may rage a lot at the beginning, but no worries, it's the normal process of learning from your own mistake. UPDATE @ 5TH JUNE 2016 - Im back in the game after like 2 months of not playing and I just finished my FIRST expedition and damn! I can say that I am so enjoying this and will be playing more! And and! They have a DLC, not just a money grabbin' dlc but a worth the money kind of dlc! With new features, mechanics and *DRUMROLL PLEASE!*  NEW CONTENTS!! like two extra expeditions though I did not buy it, but maybe I will once I feel like I need the extra stuff.10/10! Still an awesome game!			"

												I would recommend rhis game to anyone. The combat system is strikes the perfect balance between too simple to give a challange and too complex to get into. The theme is one rarely seen in games and expertly done. The difficulty can suit anybody regardless of experience. The story you create as you adventure with your crew is indefinately compelling. The only downside is the seeming lack of variety in locations but your playstyle, characters and ordering will create new scenarios well into your 30th visit to that area. This game is also still getting support post-launch with a free ""Mali Mystery""  and Halloween event out already. This is honestly the best game I've played all year. (granted Fallout 4 isn't out yet. BUT STILL.) I would feel sad if anybody was to miss out on playing this game.			"

												Fun stuff and very reminiscient of ""Curious Expedition"" but undoubtedly a game with a tremendous amount of promise. This is not your typical stab them up, you can choose to resolve conflicts diplomatically, politically and anything in between. Or of course you could slaughter what you view as inferior cultures and take what's rightfully yours! Only negative here is the ""Cutesy"" art, which  I don't really  care for. 8/10

												Clever strategy game with exloration, turn based combat, permadeath option, tons of characters and a bit of resource management thrown in there too. If you couple this with the high replay value (although a small minority of reviewers disagree) then this game is more than worth the money. Absolutely don't miss out when there's a sale.I'm an achievement hunter/wh**re and this game has plenty to keep me coming back. With my latest successful runthrough I have just ticked over 100 hours and plan on putting more in to discover all the strange little secrets there are to be found. I got the expansion in the sale which doesn't add loads of new stuff to do, but enough to make it a bit more varied and interesting.My only real complaints relate to the RNG which can be a ♥♥♥♥♥, although the odds don't lie, and the impenetrability of some of the game mechanics, which are explained but not 100% clearly. Overall a very good and original game, and I look forward to any new games the devs bring out. 8/10			"

												So much of the game is about building up your team, but the game will be over before you finish leveling them up or get an opportunity to benefit from much of the skills and bonuses that you accumulate. The Friendly/Devious/Aggressive system of resolution is interesting in theory but the execution leaves a lot to be desired, since their end effects are hardly distinguishable. Moving around in each campaign feels less like exploration and more like playing a slot machine with a very limited number of quarters. It often does not feel like you have very much control over how much of the game's victory point resource you get, and so ultimately it comes down more to luck than anything else whether you can even approach winning or not. The music and encounters are extremely repetitive after a few playthroughs, with enemy types, map types, and win conditions having little to no variation.			"

												Don't get me wrong this isn't exactly a bad game. It just that for somebody who's used to strategic games it gets dull VERY fast. Some review compared it to Final Fantasy Tactics, which couldn't be further from the truth.The games throws a lot of shiny options at you which seem like a lot of content at first, until you realize that in the end it's heavy rock-paper-scissors combat without further depth, packed in a short campaign with no meaningful story or incentive to be replayed, since the unlocks don't really make your next run that different. (Opposed to say Faster Than Light where ships / layouts play REALLY different)It can be fun to play, but it's too much to learn for a short term experience, yet not enough real/meaningful differences in enemies/abilities/strategies to keep you hooked for a longer period.

												This is a combat game with a very small combat brain; its major tactic is to outnumber you. If you don't need depth, logic, or character development, go for it. If you want an intelligent, open-ended explore and learn game, keep looking.			"

												Renowned Explorers is the 2nd game of Abbey Games, creators of REUS which I also love and played a good amount. It is a roguelike exploration game similar to FTL which you create a party of three explorers from a good amount of available ones and hunt for treasures across the world while beating challenges game throws at you with various skills of your explorers and occasional combat. But don't think you just beat everyone opposing you when I say combat, because in REIS words can be sharper than a sword from time to time. Insults or compliments can be more than enough to discourage someone from fighting you and can be a better solution.What makes REIS shine though is its' insane replayability; your crew and captain selection changing how you play and your winning strategy completely, random generated maps and each map having tons of different events which you need to play a map over and over again to see all of them, highscore chart and weekly challenges. Another thing is Abbey still supports the game with adding new events and treasures, even after being nearly a year since its' release. A great thing when they could just move on and start to work on their next project.Even after playing this much I still didn't see many events in the game and there is still lots of treasures I couldn't manage to get. There is lots of strategies I still didn't try. And I don't do weekly challenge's even because I couldn't find time to work on them yet. That's a good enough example of game's depth and replayability I think. And as a last note its dlc, More to Explore is a great addition to the game. It's new maps are great and it's campfire system adds a whole new strategic layer to the game, giving you new choices you can tinker on. So don't worry, it worths that price tag easily.Renowned Explorers is one of the best games I played in last years and easily worths its price. It has excellent storytelling, humor and art, great replayability and strategic depth and it is tons of fun to play. It is a must get if you are a fan of roguelikes or Indiana Jones style adventures.			"

												Renowned Explorers is a pretty fun game, plenty of strategiews and mixing of teammates. Occasionally it can get repetitive but with the new expansion it's pretty decent. replayability is pretty alright as well! Would recommend for both casual and more serious gamers.			"

												Charming game underpinned with wit and attention to detail. A run through to completion is typically around 3-4 hours but there is so much replayability value thanks to the amount of different treasures to be found and the variety of combinations of characters, all with their own distinct personalities and skills. On the surface it's a simple rock-paper-scissors game, but there is a surprising amount of depth both in character customisation back in London and in strategy during the encounters which can be solved in a number of ways. Devs are very supportive on the forums and you can see why: they have made a distinctive game over which a great deal of care has been taken. A recommended buy.			"

												Amazing game. Easily worth $20 if you like rogue-lite and tactical combat. If you get it for less than that it's a no-brainer. After nearly a hundred hours played, I want to write my first-ever Steam review to hopefully make a few more people aware it's out there.While the artwork makes Renowned Explorers look cutesy and light, it's really anything but. There's an impressive amount of depth here, and on many levels. I love the tactical challenges of games like xcom and Invisible, inc. (which was previously my favorite game of the year). This game is in many ways similar to those games but I think it's quite possibly better.In the beginning you put together a team of three explorers and then guide them through a series of perilous expeditions spent hunting for treasure. The expeditions are made up of a series of (usually optional) stat rolls for in-game currency, fame and research, along with combat encounters that also reward you. The stat rolls are nerve-wracking and sometimes you have to make the choice to gamble your entire game on a roll.The combat is a modified rock-paper-scissors style where you have to control which abilities you use based on enemy weaknesses, range of abilities and overall ""mood,"" which will give combat-wide buffs or debuffs based on the past series of moves you've used. You can get by in the beginning based on the tutorial info but once you've put in maybe 30-40 hours in the game you really start to master the depth and can use things like delayed starts to combat, stacked AoEs and predictive shop buys to get items for specific encounters in advance that can really sway battles in a huge way.The Abbey games team is also doing one of the best jobs I've seen of offering regular updates that reinforce the diversity of options while adding content and balancing existing strategies. They added an entire new encounter with the completely free Mali DLC and just today released a modification to captain perks that were previously merely passable. Now they're interesting and powerful. They also post regularly to discussions in the steam forums.There are a few bugs that pop up with new content from time to time but they get stomped out pretty quickly and with the speed and regularity of updates I can't complain.I'll probably try and buy their previous game Reus too, just because I love this one so much.10/10 favorite game of the year.

Also the many characters available each with their own different perks guarantees that you can try hundreds of different ways to play each game.The game is already excellent, but if they decide to add some DLCs or Updates with additional locations to explore, that would be awwwwwsome!

												Renowned Explorers: International Society is a strategy game, but its core game mechanics are very unique. Overall - 9/10Pros:-The visual art style is very nice, it reminds me of Samurai Jack. -The UI is very intuitive and looks great.-The core mechanics are simple, but completely layered and complex the more you understand the game.  -Depending on the difficulty and game type, a playthrough can last from 20 min to a couple of hours, making it a great choice, regardless of how much time you have to play.  It's designed for multiple playthroughs, as there are new characters to unlock as leaders.  Also, there are a lot of unique treasures to add to your cumulative collection.-Many different ways to complete encounters, such as aggressive combat skills, devious or friendly speech skills.-A number of Perks that affect skill ""rolls"".  (Archaeology, Diplomacy, Rogue, Tactician, etc.)-Choose your crew of 3 from a number of characters, each with their own skills and perks.-Fun and addictiveCons:-Combat encounters can get slightly repetitive.

												Indie rogue-like games have been quite popular recently and Renowned Explorers is a great addition to the list. The game plays like mix of tabletop game and turn-based combat, with tokens collection and ability checks. Great game! Pros: Colorful, cartoonish art style fits well with the music. Cool battle mechanics, like the interactions between personal moods and general attitude. Great replayability, you could play a completely different new game with the same team just by switching the captain or your play style. Character customization and improvement through level up, equipped items, researched papers and entourage crew. Nice flexibility in the difficult levels. In the easiest mode, you don’t have to worry much about the battles if you just want to have fun with map exploration and treasure hunting. Some captain perks may not look very great at the start, but you can get awesome combos later on if you try to find the right treasures and research specific papers. The developers support is awesome, there are some confirmed improvements and content coming through the next months.Cons: Random events and abilities checks are a major part of the appeal of these games, but RNG can be quite frustrating some times. There could be a few more Expedition places to choose, the potential is enormous. As a personal choice, I would prefer if some fantasy aspects were left out of the game, making the Exploration places and characters more like in real life. I was waiting for a new game from Abbey since Reus and they do not disappointed, looking forward to the next ones!			"

This is such a refreshing exception to the mass of brain-dead anxiety-inducing killing sprees that pass for games right now.  Renowned Explorers is the antidote to what ails ya.That Indie feel, with that AAA polish.  Multiple ways to win in most situations.  Truly funny, in a charmingly modest way.  Great balanced gameplay with strategy and room for creativity.  However, this little game is no pushover; you'll need to pay attention, think, and learn, in order to succeed.  That said, I've played it through at least ten times, and haven't won yet.Please support this developer for having significantly raised the bar.  Kudos, Abbey Games!!!			"

												This game is amusing for a while with many interesting features and various charcters; however, it becomes repetitive after you explore every map. Although there are several different map varieties, events, and landmarks (including from DLC), it is not enough to make you enjoy the game in a long-run. Should have included more locations to explore.Combat is simple and well-designed as well as challenging in harder level and difficulty. Nonetheless, the campaign map play tremendously relies on luck, not player skills, to roll the roulette with the chance of good and bad outcome, though the amount of success chance depends on in-game character skills. SO maybe you can get it on sale, good game for time-killing.			"

												So in this game you establish a team of 3 explorers, then go off on a series of adventures in order to defeat that dastardly Frenchman Rivaleux and his team of equally dastardly explorers. You have 3 options as to how you handle encounters: You can be Agressive, Friendly or Devious. These work in a rock paper scissors style system. As you complete these expeditions you find different types of currency, which can be spent on upgrading your crew in various ways. The in-game tutorials do an excellent job of explaining this to you, and prevent any confusion you may have at first. The encounters themselves are fun and unique, even if you play through the same encounters again and again they always go a little differently, though they can be a a little cheap (and borderline unfair) at times (I'm looking at you, Vladimir). Unfortunately there are very little encounters currently in the game, so you WILL be playing the same ones again and again.Overall I'd say it's an excellent game and well worth the price, with frequent updates adding more content. If you're at all interested in strategy or turn based combat I'd say this game is a must-have, as it's a nice blend of combat and RNG (generally to determine how many resources you manage to gather) with a lot of replayability and quirky, interesting and  generally adorable characters.I highly reccomend it and would give it a 9/10.

												First, this is my favorite game this year (2015).Why ? Because it got everything for a good roguelike-strategic-rpg-adventure game. Well, that's quite a long tag but let's speak about the game.You're a crew of explorers (leaded by a captain). Every member has special abilities and stats. Also note the levelling aspect and the equipment.You set-up your crew (researche, buy stuff, get entourage), and then you jump on an adventure campaign !You get through an random-generated node-network areas. On these zone, you can complete actions with a success chance that depend on the traits of you crew members (archaeologist, naturalist, athlete, rogue ...).An sometimes, you get into fights. The game proposes a sort of rock-paper-scissors system depending on your actions (aggressive, devious or friendly) and get you bonuses or maluses.Each playthrough is unique (depending on your crew abilities, the treasures that affect your next runs, the random-generated maps, and the way you make the choices).It's needed a lot of runs to discover bits by bits the story proposed in each campaign.I'm currently at 32h and I'm not near the end of the content of the game (without speaking of the next adventures in two weeks)To conclude, it's an innovative, well-written and nice-looking roguelike-strategic-rpg-adventure game.

												I highly recomend this game. Lots of enjoyable encounters and scenes. The cartoon aspect of this game is cute and I do enjoy that one can play this game in many different ways (9 for purists, more for those that like to mix it up). There are a ton of treasures to find and each have special benefits. Money, fame, and science also have their own benefits as well.This game can be pretty hard at times though. I have yet to attempt Shangri La on classic mode. Some people can figure out the game and make the best optimized crews for their own playstyle, but for people like me who enjoy selecting a crew either at random or because it would seem fun, then stick to the lower dificulties.

												11 hours Completed Main Story Mode on the default difficulty (hard)Surprisingly fun and addictive. But it can be a bit repetative.A great family game. No scary or inappropriate things.Was a bit too easy. But then the whole idea is to push your explorers as far as you can to collect as much treasure from a map. It took the deaths of 6 parties before I understood how to maximise. The point of the game is to push and make the game harder as you go and challenge yourself and your explorers.There is some luck involved so if you hate that don't get it.Supplies is the most important currency. This buys you more time to mess around on a given map and get more treasures. Once supplies run out each step starts penalizing your party huge, til they do the final mission to exit the map and they are super gimpy and end up dead.			"

The ability to replay this game time and time again makes it incredibly valuable. It's also easy to pick up and put down without losing your place or focus. Incredibly designed and worth every penny.			"

Posted: October 12, 2015
												Overview:  A stellar game with elements of party management, resource management and tactical combat. The game consists of short, challenging play-throughs that build familiarity with the game levels and concepts. As you improve, the game provides re-playability through selection of different combinations of party members and/or attempts to refine your strategy for high score. Not only is the game already fun, but the developers are very active in the steam community to fix bugs and implement suggestions for improvement.Read on for a description of the game play elements.Party Selection: The first challenge is picking a captain and two crew members from a selection of 12 characters with a variety of strengths and weaknesses. The characters are divided into 4 classes, each with 2 of 9 traits, a variety of attacks, and semi-hidden personality traits with hints in the character description. The game provides plenty of advice for selecting your team, including description of a character’s strengths and weaknesses, recommended party members, and symbols for a party’s relative strength in each of the three offensive areas – allowing you to quickly select a balanced or specialized party. There is plenty to appeal to min-maxers, challenge runs, or leisure players that just want to select a quick party and go exploring.Expeditions: After choosing a party you are cast into your 1st of 5 expeditions, in which you explore a location for resources (gold, campaign and research) and renown (victory points). The map shows the location of the final boss and a couple of nearby locations. Each location gives a hint of the challenges and rewards you may find. Some spaces give rewards automatically, some required the roll on a an adventure wheel, where your chance of success is determined by your party’s class, traits and stats. Some challenges provide an opportunity to avoid the roll for a lesser reward, others impose penalties for failure, including a loss of resolve (game over at 0). Your goal is to choose the route that will provide the most reward on the way to the final boss. You can take as long a path as you like, but if you run out of supplies, your team starts suffering stat penalties.Encounters: Encounters are brief tactical combats that occur during expeditions. During combat, your characters can use aggressive attacks (physical), devious speech (insults) or friendly speech (compliments) to reduce your opponents’ spirit (hit points). Speech abilities also have 4 debuffs and 2 buffs (friendly speech) that can be applied to a target. Friendly abilities can be used on your own party to heal or remove debuffs. The debuffs/buffs only apply when a character has a positive or negative state of mind, which can be manipulated through use of devious or friendly speech. Also, using aggressive, devious, or friendly abilities will affect the mood of which is how the enemy perceives your actions. The enemy also has its own mood showing their preferred method of attack. The game applies bonuses in a RPS format based on your and your opponents’ mood, where aggressive > friendly > devious > aggressive. If your mood matches your opponent, you receive a bonus to abilities in the superior mood. If your mood is superior to your opponent, you receive a defensive bonus. If your mood is inferior, you receive a defensive penalty. If your characters die in combat, you lose one resolve. Characters can also be revived in lieu of attacking your opponents. Preparation: After each successful expedition, you are given the chance to spend your resources to improve your characters. Research can be spent to improve your ability to earn rewards, or to make combat easier. Campaign is used to upgrade your shops or hire an entourage, which can improve the value of future reward tokens or increase the number of reward tokens you receive for certain events. Gold is spent on items. Each character can hold one offensive item, one defensive item and one trinket that provides unique bonuses. Will you buy quality armor for a single character, or spread the wealth for small improvements for all of your characters? Finding treasure during expeditions also earns insight, which can be spent during preparation to earn more research, campaign, or gold tokens – you decide.Ending the Game: You win the game if you successfully complete 5 expeditions AND finish with more renown than your arch rival. You lose if your party is wiped out during combat, loses all of its resolve during expedition or combat, or if you complete 5 expeditions but don’t earn enough renown to be the top explorer.If you like strategy and tactics, this game is for you.

												Honestly, I was surprised by how good it is. The artstyle is good, character designs being one of the things that I liked the most. The gameplay is engaging, highlights being the exploration of the different areas. It can sometimes be difficult, but the more you play it, the easier it gets imo. The sound design is great, love the atmospheric sound in the stages and the goofy sounds that the characters make. Seems to have quite a lot of replayability to it with the team customization and with the unlocking of other characters as captains. Though, I do have a slight issues with this game.While the visuals are good, they, in combat, look a bit too blurry and have barely any detail. I also think the sprite animations need a few more frames during the attacks to make it a bit smoother, and maybe add a reaction to the characters/enemies being damaged when attacked. I also noticed that there was no sound to the mummies attack. Tiny issues, but they do make a difference.Besides those slight problems, I ran into a few glitches. One where my character attacked the enemy, went the other way (away from the enemy, not towards it) and attacked. Then there was some random lines of codes popping up on my screen after I had made a purchase in one of the stores.  "

												Interesting tactical gameplay, a wide variety of playstyles, and nice presentation make for a great bout of rogue-lite fun!Renowned Explorers is, as it says, a tactical rogue-like where you play a team of explorers seeking to become the greatest of all time!  Set in a 19th century vaguely steampunkish setting, the world has a lot of charisma and each expedition stage has its own quirks and charms.  I especially enjoyed the wide variety of crew members and I hope one of the things the developers release is more of them, as they add a real splash of color to the proceedings, especially as you realize that each explorer has hidden traits and abilities as well.The goal is to become the most renowned explorer in the world, racing against a rival and his own crew of explorers.  You gain renown by, well, exploring and the fun is deciding what path you will take to both explore and to deal with the variety of challenges before you.  There are both choose-your-own-adventure moments, the random outcomes decided by the Adventure Wheel and influenced by the skills and stats of your explorers (sometimes also with those hidden character influences coming up), and tactical encounters.  Though simpler than something like the X-COM games, it still has engaging strategin elements, helped along by the emotion and three-part attitude systems.Conflicts can be resolved by Agressive (straight up combat), Devious (trickery or intimidation), or by Friendly (diplomacy and enthusiasm) means.  Resolving encounters with different attitudes leads to different rewards, told to you on the battle screen.  Also, the emotions of characters can shift through different states, both positive and negative, each with added buffs and debuffs based on the emotion.  Performing repeated actions of a particular attiude can shift the overall attitude of the battle, which ALSO has a variety of buffs and debuffs.  Even blending some of one attitude during a round can shift the attitude to a different style of the current one.  There's a lot to discover and understand here, especially early on.While I love the encounter system, it does have its flaws.  My biggest gripe is that there is only one 'health bar', Spirit, meaning that all forms of influence take from that bar.  It's not usually a problem, but it feels just a little off that both insults and gunfire do the same harm and are healed the same way.  When it comes to the Adventure Wheel, it can be a bit rough early on, especially as you are learning the system and the kinds of challenges, and sometimes the rogue-lite elements can bite you on the♥♥♥♥♥ throwing you into hard-to-handle situations just because of the arrangement of an expedition.Overall, though, I greatly enjoy the game and look forward to many more playthroughs.  So many more teams to try and Captains to unlock!Pros:+ Interesting tactical encounter system+ Bright and colorful art style+ Charismatic cast of playable characters and plenty of things to unlock+ Rogue-lite elements lead to lots of variety in playthroughs+ Variety of expeditions to undertake, multiplied by the rogue-lite elementsCons- One health bar for all kinds of attacks feels funny- Rogue-lite elements sometimes bite you on the♥♥♥♥♥br>- Might be a bit overwhelming at first to completely grasp the emotion/attitude systems "

												This game is fantastic. It takes the core gameplay loop of FTL (exploration of stages with various points of interest and random events), adds an additional resource management/research/etc strategy layer to visit in between stages, and mixes that with a deceptively deep and difficult tactical combat system. On top of all that, it's charming as hell and has a very interesting theme. Kill your enemies with kindness (or swords)! Check this game out. If you enjoyed FTL, like the theme, or have any interest whatsoever in tactical combat games (or games that offer alternatives to violence), you owe it to yourself to check this game out. If you're on the fence, just look it up on YouTube or something. You should check this game out.			"

												One of the best games I've gotten on steam in a long time. Reknowned Explorer's is like FTL for pulp adventure stories and with more polished art. The fact that it's a roguelike with a variety of strategies makes for a game with a lot of replayability, but what really stands out to me is that for a roguelike the variance is pretty low: unlike FTL, where many runs end up a fool's errand based on the whims of the RNG, runs in RE are all feasible based upon the goals you set for yourself and your experience with the strategies for your team build.Learning to overcome the game in a variety of ways through your failed runs is a rewarding style of game design. The only real complaint I have about RE is that I wish there was more content, but that's not because the game is unsatisfying. It's just so good I want more of it.			"

												I just want to preface my review with the fact that I genuinely love this game. This game is not the most complex, but its fun. This game takes a genre I love (pulp adventure and exploration, like the RPG's Spirit of the Century and Hollow Earth Expedition) and turns it into a short and heavily replayable strategy game for the ages.Pros: The characters: While this game may not have a Bioware dialogue tree, this game still gives each of the possible party members a unique personality. The moves, the skills, the speech bubbles all give each character a different feel and a different strategy going in.The comedy: Your rivals are as over the top as Gaston. Your characters get into rediculous situations where you have to going into a conflict because the locals are too friendly, or where you accidentally drop a safe from a treehouse. Even the expressions can be funny.The Replayablity: Why not try a different location? A different party? A different strategy? Get different treasures this time? There are a lot fo reasons to replay the game.Cons: Minor gameplay issues: Sometimes movement grids don't show up until you start and cancel an attack. Sometimes targeting can be misjudged by a few pixels (an issue even Shadowrun has). Its unfortunate, but doesn't always ruin the gameplay.Achievement Hunters: As much as I love the stories that can be told with this game, one of the major calls of this game is the achievements. Complete the game with a certain personality, complete the game with every character as a leader, get a bunch of treasures, do it all on iron man mode. If that's not your thing, you might not get as much enjoyment from this game.			"

												 Renowned Explorers was one of the rare games that I took a huge interest in when first seeing it and I fell in love with it when I finally got my hands on it. I absolutely and completely enjoy the concept of picking a team of explorers and going out exploring the world trying to discover as many secrets of the world as I can before the most renowned explorer award is given, trying to out due the pompous arch-rival, Matthieu Rivaleux. This game is very much like a board game in its systems, and that is a great thing. It tells you for the most part a different story each time you play given the different makeup of the team you put together and the semi-random elements of the location map.The graphics are made of the typical Abbey Games design of very colorful, playful 2D graphics. There is a lot of character put into the drawings and combat aminations. It would have been nice for the graphics to have a little more animation besides the very fun and personable nature of the animations during encounters, but that is a very small criticism to the overall package.  The graphic design is outstanding, it is clean and clear what you should be doing with all the information the game can throw at you in its tooltips as well as a very subtle color coded system based on the different moods. The music matches the game perfectly being exciting and fun. There is no voice acting which can make one feel a little lonely on these adventures, but again the rest of the game quickly makes you forget you are sitting in front of a computer. The rest of the sound effects are standard click feedback, nothing special but done well so you don’t notice them; which should be the praise for click feedback sounds.The gameplay is really what makes this game standout for me. There are two main phases of the game; The World Map is where you buy upgrades and equipment to prepare for you next adventure, and the Location Map where the other half of the game spends most of its time. The World Map gives you different locations(shops) to go around and spend your different tokens you have gained in your last adventure. You have research from your study tokens that works like a standard tech tree in most other games, giving you bonuses that lets you specialize and get more tokens and supplies so you can explore more efficiently and longer. You can also spend renown to gain tokens based on what city and character you have (I would recommend doing this first before spending any tokens but after you spend your research). You can then spend status tokens to buy helpers that will make those tokens worth a bit more. Finally, you want to spend your gold on items to improve your characters. After you finish with all of your upgrading you pick your next destination based on the one you think you can handle then rinse and repeat until hopefully you complete the four trips to complete the game or you run out of resolve and lose.The other half of the game involves going on adventures. These happen in two parts, the location map where you run into narrative effects collecting tokens, gold or taking part in encounters, where the interesting part of the game takes place. The map events are often reading the event then choosing what to do next. Most of the choices are based on what skills the event is looking for and how good a character you have is at it. The game gives you all the information you need to make a good decision including the percentage chance of success along with what you might get and what may happen if you fail. Most of the time it’s an easy choice, other times do you really want to risk a resolve on a 50% roll?The encounters take you to a strategy combat map, where you move your characters around and choose an attack for them to use on enemies. The attacks are mostly linked to one of the three different moods in the game; aggressive, devious, and friendly. There are bonuses linked to if you win the encounter by keeping the overall mood to one of these. But you also need to keep in mind that each character is good at curtain moods while being weak in others. There is also a paper, rock, scissors kind of thing going on with each character’s mood that can weaken or strengthen their play. I’m slightly mixed with this part of the game, I understand this allows the “non-combat” characters to be useful in battle and sometimes even better if going against curtain enemies. It makes sense but requires you to stop trying to make sense of a battle that is emulating diplomatic conversations; it’s the weakest of the gameplay, but it’s still good.That is the gameplay overall, it’s a great game in my opinion. It’s fast and has plenty of meaningful decisions with a good level of difficulty with the high score “good” winning condition. There are plenty of characters and enough locations and events to keep you playing for some time before it might become a bit repetitive (good thing there is an expansion in the works!). Story/Theme – For me it’s an outstanding theme with a good story that keeps me interested through multiple playthroughs.Graphics – Very attractive graphic style that is playful and sets up the rest of the game beautifully.Sound/Music – Great music, gets you in the mood, but not much else.Gameplay – Great mix of menu driven adventure with a mix of strategic battles.Pros – Theme and GraphicsCons – Battles could use a bit more work  Should you buy it? – Yes, for the price you will easily get your money worth.

												I'd recomend this to anyone who likes rougelikes, enjoys stagey games, or happens to like a challenge. Renowned Explorers is the type of game that's a little tough to pick up because you need to learn what you're doing or you won't get far. Once you get in the saddle the game kicks off with great plots,  annoying   lovable   pyschotic  eccentric, individuals, and the general desire to bodily harm a rude frenchman. The game's still in development, so while there is a good chunk of things to do it feels like a few things are missing. But there is enough content for people to spend dozens of hours trying to find ALL the events, secrets, captains, reactions, and more. Combat itself can be tough. There's only a few ways to effectivley heal and sometimes I want to bang my head against a wall when my party gets wiped out AGAIN. And on some expeditions everything goes wrong and if you don't plan things out, you will lose the boss fight, and any chance at regognition for sure. But there's nothing like the sound of sweet sweet loot, glory, and achivement to make up for it. Best of luck, You'll need it.			"

												This game has a lot of things to recommend it, most of which pale upon repeated playthroughs.Upon first glance, it features a wide array of playable characters. However, the characters have a lot of overlap in abilities and the available equipment is constant across runs, leading to very few distinct-feeling characters. And one of the three characters in your party has to either be one of the 5 starting captains or a character that you have already used a lot. Still, there's enough variety to keep things interesting at the start.The combat works in emotions and diplomacy in addition to violence, which is interesting and innovative at first. Ultimately, though, it's just a rock-paper-scissors elemental system by another name. It's also frustrating that each character has one style of combat that they suck at, meaning that you're essentially playing rock-scissors and just having to grind things out whenever your enemy picks rock. The splash-damage abilities are a little disappointing, too. Since regular attacks often one-shot weak enemies, a splash attack that hits multiple enemies for a third of their health is frequently useless. Once the novelty of winning a battle with kindness or insults wears off, what's left behind is underwhelming.There are actually very few adventure paths in this game. You get one of three random ones at the start, then three new options open up (same each game), then three new ones (same each game), then two more (same each game), then one more (again, same each game), and that's it. The unique treasures, events, and dialogues are quite cool. That is, of course, until you discover that they aren't unique. You get the same ones each time, on each adventure, on each run-through.I guess I'm being pretty negative about the game. And there's a good bit to be negative about. But that's only because I've played it too much. The game is great when you first start playing, and will remain great if you have the sense to stop. Buy this on sale, run through each of the adventures once, and never touch it again. You'll have good memories of a novelty game that didn't overstay its welcome.			"

												Indie rogue-like games have been quite popular recently and Renowned Explorers is a great addition to the list. The game plays like mix of tabletop game and turn-based combat, with tokens collection and ability checks. Great game! Pros: Colorful, cartoonish art style fits well with the music. Cool battle mechanics, like the interactions between personal moods and general attitude. Great replayability, you could play a completely different new game with the same team just by switching the captain or your play style. Character customization and improvement through level up, equipped items, researched papers and entourage crew. Nice flexibility in the difficult levels. In the easiest mode, you don’t have to worry much about the battles if you just want to have fun with map exploration and treasure hunting. Some captain perks may not look very great at the start, but you can get awesome combos later on if you try to find the right treasures and research specific papers. The developers support is awesome, there are some confirmed improvements and content coming through the next months.Cons: Random events and abilities checks are a major part of the appeal of these games, but RNG can be quite frustrating some times. There could be a few more Expedition places to choose, the potential is enormous. As a personal choice, I would prefer if some fantasy aspects were left out of the game, making the Exploration places and characters more like in real life. I was waiting for a new game from Abbey since Reus and they do not disappointed, looking forward to the next ones!			"

												This game is amusing for a while with many interesting features and various charcters; however, it becomes repetitive after you explore every map. Although there are several different map varieties, events, and landmarks (including from DLC), it is not enough to make you enjoy the game in a long-run. Should have included more locations to explore.Combat is simple and well-designed as well as challenging in harder level and difficulty. Nonetheless, the campaign map play tremendously relies on luck, not player skills, to roll the roulette with the chance of good and bad outcome, though the amount of success chance depends on in-game character skills. SO maybe you can get it on sale, good game for time-killing.			"

												So in this game you establish a team of 3 explorers, then go off on a series of adventures in order to defeat that dastardly Frenchman Rivaleux and his team of equally dastardly explorers. You have 3 options as to how you handle encounters: You can be Agressive, Friendly or Devious. These work in a rock paper scissors style system. As you complete these expeditions you find different types of currency, which can be spent on upgrading your crew in various ways. The in-game tutorials do an excellent job of explaining this to you, and prevent any confusion you may have at first. The encounters themselves are fun and unique, even if you play through the same encounters again and again they always go a little differently, though they can be a a little cheap (and borderline unfair) at times (I'm looking at you, Vladimir). Unfortunately there are very little encounters currently in the game, so you WILL be playing the same ones again and again.Overall I'd say it's an excellent game and well worth the price, with frequent updates adding more content. If you're at all interested in strategy or turn based combat I'd say this game is a must-have, as it's a nice blend of combat and RNG (generally to determine how many resources you manage to gather) with a lot of replayability and quirky, interesting and  generally adorable characters.I highly reccomend it and would give it a 9/10.

												Interesting tactical gameplay, a wide variety of playstyles, and nice presentation make for a great bout of rogue-lite fun!Renowned Explorers is, as it says, a tactical rogue-like where you play a team of explorers seeking to become the greatest of all time!  Set in a 19th century vaguely steampunkish setting, the world has a lot of charisma and each expedition stage has its own quirks and charms.  I especially enjoyed the wide variety of crew members and I hope one of the things the developers release is more of them, as they add a real splash of color to the proceedings, especially as you realize that each explorer has hidden traits and abilities as well.The goal is to become the most renowned explorer in the world, racing against a rival and his own crew of explorers.  You gain renown by, well, exploring and the fun is deciding what path you will take to both explore and to deal with the variety of challenges before you.  There are both choose-your-own-adventure moments, the random outcomes decided by the Adventure Wheel and influenced by the skills and stats of your explorers (sometimes also with those hidden character influences coming up), and tactical encounters.  Though simpler than something like the X-COM games, it still has engaging strategin elements, helped along by the emotion and three-part attitude systems.Conflicts can be resolved by Agressive (straight up combat), Devious (trickery or intimidation), or by Friendly (diplomacy and enthusiasm) means.  Resolving encounters with different attitudes leads to different rewards, told to you on the battle screen.  Also, the emotions of characters can shift through different states, both positive and negative, each with added buffs and debuffs based on the emotion.  Performing repeated actions of a particular attiude can shift the overall attitude of the battle, which ALSO has a variety of buffs and debuffs.  Even blending some of one attitude during a round can shift the attitude to a different style of the current one.  There's a lot to discover and understand here, especially early on.While I love the encounter system, it does have its flaws.  My biggest gripe is that there is only one 'health bar', Spirit, meaning that all forms of influence take from that bar.  It's not usually a problem, but it feels just a little off that both insults and gunfire do the same harm and are healed the same way.  When it comes to the Adventure Wheel, it can be a bit rough early on, especially as you are learning the system and the kinds of challenges, and sometimes the rogue-lite elements can bite you on the♥♥♥♥♥ throwing you into hard-to-handle situations just because of the arrangement of an expedition.Overall, though, I greatly enjoy the game and look forward to many more playthroughs.  So many more teams to try and Captains to unlock!Pros:+ Interesting tactical encounter system+ Bright and colorful art style+ Charismatic cast of playable characters and plenty of things to unlock+ Rogue-lite elements lead to lots of variety in playthroughs+ Variety of expeditions to undertake, multiplied by the rogue-lite elementsCons- One health bar for all kinds of attacks feels funny- Rogue-lite elements sometimes bite you on the♥♥♥♥♥br>- Might be a bit overwhelming at first to completely grasp the emotion/attitude systems "

												This game is fantastic. It takes the core gameplay loop of FTL (exploration of stages with various points of interest and random events), adds an additional resource management/research/etc strategy layer to visit in between stages, and mixes that with a deceptively deep and difficult tactical combat system. On top of all that, it's charming as hell and has a very interesting theme. Kill your enemies with kindness (or swords)! Check this game out. If you enjoyed FTL, like the theme, or have any interest whatsoever in tactical combat games (or games that offer alternatives to violence), you owe it to yourself to check this game out. If you're on the fence, just look it up on YouTube or something. You should check this game out.			"

												One of the best games I've gotten on steam in a long time. Reknowned Explorer's is like FTL for pulp adventure stories and with more polished art. The fact that it's a roguelike with a variety of strategies makes for a game with a lot of replayability, but what really stands out to me is that for a roguelike the variance is pretty low: unlike FTL, where many runs end up a fool's errand based on the whims of the RNG, runs in RE are all feasible based upon the goals you set for yourself and your experience with the strategies for your team build.Learning to overcome the game in a variety of ways through your failed runs is a rewarding style of game design. The only real complaint I have about RE is that I wish there was more content, but that's not because the game is unsatisfying. It's just so good I want more of it.			"

I love the refreshing ""combat"" mechanics; the ability to sway a group of voodoo monkeys over to your side of the discussion is as ludicrous as it is fun.As a fan of turn based strategy game, this is a welcome addition to my library.Hoping for more future DLC and workshop support!8/10. Will search for treasure again.			"

												This game as awesome!The mechanics are so varied and exploring is not just about the expeditons (which are awesome and have lots of replayability!) but also about trying out the near infinite number of builds and strategies for completing the game.My only gripe is that you CAN play in non ""iron man"" mode... And I accidentally did the first time I completed the game :DDo not be decieved by the cute graphics! This game is tough in an awesome way, where every time you lose, you will know exactly what you did wrong.			"

												I spent a lot of time on this game but it was more for curiosity than satisfaction. I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times. There are a lot of neat concepts but the combination of which doesn't really work. This is due to the huge dependency on dice rolls rather than mini-games and the end product just wasn't satisfying to play. I think the randomness of dice rolls in getting loot, and just plain getting stuff done was too frustrating. Even the starting map is random and there are definitely way better ones to start with than others.  The character, captain bonuses, and skills are also very poorly balanced so you can end up with some very crappy teams on maps that don't use any of your relevant skills even though the vague descriptions imply they do. The battles are also sometimes very unfair with huge neverending waves of enemies. The battle map, obstacles, and starting positions are also completely random so getting a good or bad start can make or break your battle. I feel like there are a lot of good cocepts here but they took away too much player choice with the design. This feels less like a strattegic game and more like dice roll gambling on most everything. I think this game would be a lot more fun if players got more choice in choosing loot, mini-games affecting events, and battle positions. Right now, it's not really fun to just watch bad stuff happen to your team due to bad RNG.			"

												This game is phenomenally addictive. It's got a unique combat system what will make you want to try all sorts of different explorer combos so you can tackle the situations differently everytime. And since the maps randomly generate, no two expeditions will be the same.Really my only complaint is that you only get to go on 5 expeditions per game. I wish it were longer and had more characters. Other than that? I am loving the hell out of it! If you like tactical rpg's, this one will be right up your alley.I cannot sing this game's praises enough. What are you waiting for? GO BUY IT.			"

												My frustration with, and the subsequent hazing by the Steam Community over, FTL has been well documented.  The game was solid, but far too random, frustrating, and unrewarding an experience for me to recommend.Renowned Explorers is, in my opinion, FTL done right.  Instead of space, you are in the age of exploration with a crew of allies looking for treasure all around the world, so if that setting doesn't do it for you, I don't blame you for giving the game a pass, but everything else is great.  It's a turn based tactical combat game focusing on using both strength and speech to win the day, with the option to hit, insult, or chat with enemies to win them over to your side, each with benefits and drawbacks.  Say, you meet a nasty pirate captain.  Maybe, after you talk nice to him and win him over, he decides to go with you as a lobbyist, to bolster your rep...or maybe you pound him into the dirt and turn him in for an extra bounty...different solutions lead to different outcomes here.Alongside the interesting combat mechanics, the game uses a spinner to determine success in many randomly generated actions, such as studying plants, climbing perilous cliffs, searching for treasure, dashing out of a collapsing tomb, etc. and this spinner uses your inherent % for success to give you a visual representation for these challenges, which is much more satisfying than a basic pass/fail.You begin the game choosing a team of 3 explorers out of a total of 20, with one captain and two subordinates.  The captain perks and the synergy with certain people allow for some really interesting ways to play and combinations and this is aided further by a robust upgrade system which gives bonuses for research, which can affect all or some of your crew.Overall, what I love most about this game though is how approachable it is.  FTL has a cripplingly high difficulty at times, making it easy for anyone to give up on it in frustration.  Explorers though, has multiple difficulty settings, each scaling well and allowing you to cater your experience, along with two modes, one which lets you retry encounters you fail and another which ends your game, allowing for another layer of challenge.  I feel in control when I play.  And while I haven't been Classic difficulty, which is on par with FTL, normal has been very good to me.  This is a game which, when jacked up in challenge, will make hardcore min maxers cry, but when played on easy or normal is easily approachable by kids or families.  It's a game which I think suits all ages, especially with the charming art style.Explorers is, in my opinion, a great game.  It's fun and approachable, has a lot of variety, and there's many teams to try out and treasures to collect, with the devs adding new, free expeditions to go through all the time.  This game rocks.  Give it a look.			"

												Interesting game. Looks simplistic at first glance, but the combat mechanics are a little deeper. The rock-paper-scissors thing is nothing new, but its interesting to see how they interperet it as aggression-trickery-niceness (and sometimes funny. Attacked by wolves? Scaring them works pretty well, but its far funnier and just as effective to make them SAD They leave and state they just want to be alone. You couldve just killed the wolves, but no, you made them need THERAPY). True one has an advantage over the other, but they have effects based on whats actually being done, which in turn is affected by what party members you went with. The reward for each approach can be different as well, not just affecting the story but your loot tokens recieved. The buff/debuff based on your party's tactics can be helpful or annoying, but nonetheless can swing the battle either way. However it does mean you have to coordinate your team's tactics, since if you use a different tactic too much it will switch to that buff/debuff, but if you use a tactic that matches the current battle mood the counter resets, so it can be managed.But every stat has tooltips if you hover over them and there are clearly displayed meters for the tactic switching, all the information you could want is on screen during battle and you're given percentages for success on non-combat choices. You'll probably still fail your first expedition, but it's pretty easy to find out why and there's loads more team combinations to try. Choices given to you in the story are relatively interesting, even if the results sometimes aren't *You impress the villagers.* ""Wow! You're so great!"" .....yeah it mustve taken them a whole day to write that exchange. On the other hand, some do give you a tough choice and interesting things to discover, if not an explanation as to why. Stole painting, painting makes my party member more devious, activating a debuff until the expedition is over, but I somehow wrest the painting away and sell it later for loot. Dunno why it happened, how I got the painting away from them or why we sold a mind-altering artifact with zero consequences, but whatever.So there's some ups and downs, but most of it is pretty interesting. I was just gonna do one expedition to give the game a shot and according to Steam I've nearly played five hours. Several teambuilds and expeditions later and I'm still playing. Make of that what you will.I do wish the tactical elements came into play more or were better defined. Flank and Shank is a nice ability, too bad it's sometimes hard to tell who's being flanked at first because of the strange pentagonal spaces. I also wish some of the character's personalities showed up more in the decision results, but it seems to be the same for whatever role the person fufilled.I mean Molly the austrialian scout has it in her bio that she got in trouble for offending people with off-color language, it'd be a nice touch to add some sort of dialect based cursing. Or have other character's cut her off mid-sentence and force her to put loot tokens in the swear jar. Just a little more personailty on display would make this a bit more fun.			"

												Amazingly fun and depth filled adventure. I originally decided to buy this game after Total Biscuit had a review of it on his channel, and said that it was as good if not better than FTL. Since I loved FTL, I figured this game would be right up my alley and with a great pricepoint of only 20 bucks I couldn't refuse even though I almost never buy games at full price anymore. Well after 30 some hours of entertainment I have to agree with TB that this is a really great game with an amazing amount of combat depth. The wheel is probably my favorite part and makes the skill checks some of the most interesting and tense parts of the game. All in all great indie title that deserves to be played by many more people.			"

												If this game was a tribute to the first Pirates! by Sid Meier, it would do a great job.Renowned Explorers brings you to the world of 19th century expeditions, and managing a three man (or woman) crew from the Highlands of Scotland to Shangri-La, by meeting locals, subduing evil spirits and beating the crap out of friendly sheep. I know, right? The moduled scenario is cool to.The skill set of your explorers combines nicely with a great research system, perks, attributes, you name it - it's there somewhere. It's a great quit-and-retry (or more fail and try to decipher) casual game.The cartoony graphics are neat, the music score and effects aren't very noticeable but fit in well, a few things here and there are a bit unpolished but I would recommend it, especially for those who enjoyed Reus as much as I did (although this has not much to do with it).Worth it.

												Unique RPG, lots of replay value. I came back to this after about two months and it's like I was playing for the first time again. Recommend going through classic mode until you beat it, to maintain a challenge (I still haven't beat it, but I get closer every time). Also, the free updates keep me coming back. Excited for the next one!			"

												Amazingly fun and depth filled adventure. I originally decided to buy this game after Total Biscuit had a review of it on his channel, and said that it was as good if not better than FTL. Since I loved FTL, I figured this game would be right up my alley and with a great pricepoint of only 20 bucks I couldn't refuse even though I almost never buy games at full price anymore. Well after 30 some hours of entertainment I have to agree with TB that this is a really great game with an amazing amount of combat depth. The wheel is probably my favorite part and makes the skill checks some of the most interesting and tense parts of the game. All in all great indie title that deserves to be played by many more people.			"

												If this game was a tribute to the first Pirates! by Sid Meier, it would do a great job.Renowned Explorers brings you to the world of 19th century expeditions, and managing a three man (or woman) crew from the Highlands of Scotland to Shangri-La, by meeting locals, subduing evil spirits and beating the crap out of friendly sheep. I know, right? The moduled scenario is cool to.The skill set of your explorers combines nicely with a great research system, perks, attributes, you name it - it's there somewhere. It's a great quit-and-retry (or more fail and try to decipher) casual game.The cartoony graphics are neat, the music score and effects aren't very noticeable but fit in well, a few things here and there are a bit unpolished but I would recommend it, especially for those who enjoyed Reus as much as I did (although this has not much to do with it).Worth it.

I find that the difficulty can be pretty hard if you go for the high-star expeditions, so whether you want a ""casual"" game or a hard-core game is really up to you. I highly recommend this game and I do hope they come out with even more DLC content...I'd buy every piece of it! =D Love the graphics, love the re-playability, love the concept and theme, love everything about it!

												I have a hard time justifying recommending this game, but I have spent only a handful of hours with it, so I assume that once you develop some strategies, it gets easier. And I have had tremendous fun with it. I have only played in the brutal ""no reload"" difficulty, and I have refused to reload, despite dying nearly constantly with every step up in difficulty. I can now succeed three star missions roughly 1/2 the time, and I have yet to succeed at the most difficult of the missions. As a result, my highest ranking after the missions so far is 3rd.Some players complain about the fact that enemy reinforcements ""appear randomly"", and that does make the game more difficult, but if you have played some seriously difficult tactical RPGs, this is nothing new to you. If you haven't, then you can count this among the difficult tactical RPGs. If there's a way to avoid a fight, even if it's just a 5% chance, you take it, because fighting is hard in almost all cases.The best part of the game is assembling your team. You start with four possible Captains, and by recruiting other folks onto your team, you can unlock them as possible Captains, assuming you can make it past two missions alive. (The tutorial mission counts.) Speaking of the tutorial, this is a big negative for me. The game has no manual, and the tutorial is very incomplete. You can read up more on how things work as you go, but you'll be assembling your first team of explorers with absolutely no clue as to what anything writen means. If you play on the ironman difficulty, you will almost certainly lose on your first REAL mission, and winning the game will be nigh-on impossible.That said, a full session takes maybe two hours, and the game is terribly fun. And it does get easier as you start to understand it.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. The party building is varied enough that you can replay multiple times without it feeling old, the resources feel scarce enough that your purchases matter, and the combat is tactical but not impossible. My only complaint is that the game freezes my computer every once and a while. As of this writing I've played about 7.5 hours and the game has frozen 4 or 5 times.			"

												A graceful rogue-lite, brimming with personality, if somewhat short and rough around the edges. This review will have some things to say about the design of the game, but I do really enjoy playing it as a whole.The game could use some polish. I've found that there are some graphical goofs (not quite glitches) that impeded the flow of the game. Things like character portraits weirdly off-center or obstructing other portraits (I'm looking at you Agatha and your poofy hair!), and mechanics that aren't necessarily intuitive like the unique traits some characters have affecting certain encounter choices.Some of the locations/encounters tread a little close to stereotyping, but nothing terribly offensive; I think the story could benefit greatly from incorporating more homages to real-world historical artifacts as possible treasures.In the end, I enjoy Renowned Explorers very much. It has good replayability, though I'm not sure how many playthroughs before I get burnt out, as some have said there is a degree of repetition in each playthrough. I am glad to have supported your development!			"

This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].There is treasure somewhere on this island, I am certain of it, and my team of would-be explorers is determined to find it. But getting to it will not be that easy and there are surprises around every turn. As we make our way through the jungle, we encounter a group of monkeys being berated by another, rather mean group of monkeys led by a peculiar blue monkey. We could simply ignore the incident and be on our way, but that is not who we are. We decide to step in and a fight ensues. The blue monkey is relentless in slinging insults towards us, which depletes our spirit and makes us want to run away in tears, but we persevere. We could beat them up or be mean to them in return in order to teach them a lesson, but we decide on a different approach. We are being super nice to them, which catches them off-guard and convinces them that we are pretty cool people. Both groups of monkeys end up being influenced by our friendly approach.This is the kind of decision-making that permeates throughout Renowned Explorers: International Society, a vibrant and entertaining mash-up of various genres, including adventure, turn-based strategy, and role-playing. You begin by making a party of three explorers, each with their own unique abilities. Some are friendly diplomats, some are aggressive warriors, whereas others are devious scientists. There are a lot more characters to choose from with a nice amount of variety in traits and abilities. Once you choose your party, you set out to explore exotic locations around the world in an effort to become the most renowned international explorer. Each location acts as its own separate expedition on which you can gather gold, status, research, and insight. After a successful expedition, you return to your headquarters in London and spend the accrued resources on equipment that increases your stats, entourage that enables you to collect more resources, and technologies that give you an edge on the following expeditions.You can usually choose between two new locations to serve as your next expedition. Once you arrive, you will be presented with a point of interest. How you get there is up to you. You travel from point to point on a small map. Most points will provide a short story, some resources, or an encounter as described in the opening paragraph. Depending on your crew and the challenge, you will usually be able to choose from a variety of options. Chances of success will depend on the traits of your characters. The outcome will be determined on the adventure wheel (like the one on The Price Is Right). For example, you may choose to break down a door with a fighter or talk your way in with a diplomat. The more advanced your character is in a particular trait, the higher are the chances of success.There will be times when you’ll be able to get out of a fight, but sometimes that will simply not be possible. Battles take place on hex-based grids. Renowned Explorers uses a very interesting combat system, which enables you to be friendly, devious, or aggressive to beat your foes. This acts as a sort of rock-paper-scissors system. Friendly is very effective against devious, devious against aggressive, and aggressive against friendly. But the opposite is true as well. For example, being aggressive against devious will either penalize your team or provide bonuses to the enemy. But if both parties use the same attacks, there will be no bonuses or penalties for anyone. All characters can use a combination of two attacks, never three. The combat system is definitely interesting and entertaining (a battle between your devious crew and a herd of super friendly sheep can be pretty funny), but it’s not particularly deep.The ultimate goal is to become the top explorer, and beat your rival Riveleux to the top spot. You have five expeditions to gather as much renown as possible. After that, that particular playthrough will end whether you have managed to beat him or not. The adventure mode features rogue-like elements. If you lose all of your characters in battle, it’s game over. If you lose just one or two, you can still win the battle and carry on (you also have the ability to revive them in battle), but you lose resolve every time a character goes down. If your resolve drops down to zero, it’s game over. You can sometimes also lose resolve on the adventure wheel. If you’re not into rogue-likes, there is a separate mode where you can save the game anywhere you want. The game is designed to be replayed over and over again using different play styles. It is also not possible to see all locations in a single playthrough. There are 11 locations in the game, but their map layout is procedurally generated, which adds a level of unpredictability during exploration, even if it is a location that you have already visited on previous playthroughs.Renowned Explorers: International Society uses a very nice, colorful art style and a charming, lighthearted way of storytelling. This approach gives it quite a bit of personality and simply makes it a joy to play and experience. On the other hand, the soundtrack and sound effects are not particularly involving and don’t stand out in any way. I felt as if the same exact tune just kept looping over and over. Also, the game does not do enough in order to explain its systems very well. In the beginning, it all seems pretty convoluted and it takes a while to figure out the systems in place. The biggest issue with this game is that the design perhaps isn’t strong enough to support many playthroughs, which is what rogue-likes strive for. After you’ve tried out all three play styles and seen all the locations (of which there are not that many), there is simply not that much incentive to go on. I also think that the combat system, while unique and fun, is not deep enough to keep you engaged once the novelty wears off.Renowned Explorers: International Society is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for something a bit different. It successfully manages to combine gameplay elements from several genres into a single, cohesive whole. It is a colorful, lighthearted romp that feels like a mash-up of Monkey Island and XCOM, which is definitely worth playing, in my opinion. However, it does not quite deliver the depth and replay value synonymous with the best rogue-likes out there.7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD) "

The graphics are charming, the gameplay is challenging, but never obscure, the humor is top notch, I'm not sure I have anything negative to say about it.  The combinations of characters let you play it your way, or go something different for a challenge.  They give out free DLC.  They're patching every two weeks.Seriously, if you like adventure/soft RPG type games, and don't mind the randomness of a rogue like, this might be one of the best of it's kind ever.  Get it.			"

												Great aesthetics, fun gameplay. Feels like FTL meets Carmen San Diego.There are three levels of strategy to this game -World - deciding what to invest your resources into improvingExpedition - choosing which encounters / events to activate, and which route to take before running out of suppliesEncounter - ordering your three explorers around to defeat enemies.The encounter turn based strategy game is the weakest part, and unfortunately is also the largest part of the game. Encounters are either trivially easy or punishingly hard. The best ""strategy"" i've found is trapping enemies with no ranged attack behind a ""chokepoint"" that they could walk around in 2 turns if the AI wasn't so bad. Otherwise the strategy is to burn down the boss before the minions can kill you too many times.Overall this game is pretty good and well polished, especially considering the price point. I just wish they would balance the encounters so they're not so hit or miss.			"

												Great game, I heartly recommend.Basically, it's like FTL - an exploration game on proceduraly generated maps, where you collect stuff, improve your stats and try not to get wiped.Only compared to FTL, this game has better graphics, funny animations, more collectables, actual character customization, stuff to do in-between maps, and a combat system that requires you to use your head a little.A good adition to any collectionI can see it getting repetitive eventually, but hopefully the developers will keep the game interesting with additional contents in time.

												Beneath the awkward graphics lies a surprisingly tactical roguelike. Every action matters and a great tension is created between playing optimally to clear the encounters and maps safely and playing greedily to maximise your resource gain. Sequencing your abilities in combat is crucial and any sloppy mistakes are punished hard. I've been having a blast playing it and recommend it to anyone interested in tactical combat or choose your own adventure style games.			"

												Light hearted, tongue-in-cheek game that still gives the sense of exploration and excitement you'd expect. There are a ton of interlocking systems at play here, but they mostly work, even if the devs could arguably have achieved the same outcome with less...fiddly-ness. Regardless the game is fun and captivating. Average run time is 3-4 hours so much longer than a traditional roguelike, but this allows you to really get invested into your crew. Once you're experienced, and with fast combat animations, you can get this down to 1-2 hours. Combat is enjoyable and tactical like you'd expect. Huge cast of unique characters. You'll want to keep on playin'!			"

												The first playthrough I was worried that there just wasn't enough in the game to keep me hooked, but boy was I ever wrong. This roguelike adventure game is both well-stylized and well-thought-out hiding a clever depth behind a very simple interface. At first a lot of events in the game seem to be very random, but after a few playthoughs you can really start optimizing strategies that feel really satisfying when successful.The game is fast-paced and instantly re-playable with just enough depth and uniqueness of your crew to make you care about each run. As far as Rougelikes go, this one is incredibly well-balanced, and I am impressed.If nothing else I said has convinced you, in this game it is totally possible to confuse a Voodoo Monkey so hard that he walks off the battlefield.

The cards also unlock mini-story missions for each explorer, where you learn some backstory and build relationships (even a possible romance!) between members of the team. Big plus: The devs are pretty active and continue to update the game. There are also community challenges, encouraging players to try certain combinations and tell their own lil' adventure.			"

												While I find it to be a really fun game, their customer service kind of sucks.  The game consistently crashes when loading certain encounters, some of these problem encounters are actually the final locations (bosses) of certain travels like the Mali Mystery and the Emerged Island.  Therefore, I can't even take certain missions because I can't avoid the final boss encounters.  And while a bug report window pops up after every time it crashes, not once have the game creators responded to my problems.I've tried to continue playing by only taking on the missions that don't crash, but that makes for really stale gameplay, and I can't expand my strategies.  I know not everyone is having problems, but if you're unlucky enough like me, good luck getting any sort of help			"

												This is the most colorful method of flipping a coin.Nice little bits of stories, sufficiently complex game mechanics and a lot to discover. The is a lot of content without any story worth the name. But in the end it is just flipping a coin. Sure you can prepare for the next expedition, but whether you win or lose is largely random. Take your perfectly picked team on the best matching expedition and there is still a large chance of failing since everything is random.If you don't mind failing arbitrarily, repeatedly or sometimes even due to enemies so big you can not target the ones behind them (which the devs acknlowledge as a bug but refuse to fix) you might enjoy the game for short time. Just remember: the only advantage this game has over sitting your room and tossing a coin and calling yourself a winner of a 5 heads-streak is achievements and trading cards.			"

												This is another one of those games that has so much potential but for me falls short. Obviously im in the minority as you can tell by other reviews. My gripe is the gameplay and the content. I felt so hampered and shortened by the lack of options, and the game is positively too short. You dont have time to enjoy the things you earn. It makes me want to not play because ill only get to use things for two or three explorations. Not enough companions. Not able to recruit new companions. What would have been great is if you could recruit the bosses or at least some of them, that you defeat into your party.A lot of missed oppertunities here. Fortunately the refund button works.			"

The game is very clearly not optimized for Mac. Even after putting the game on minimal settings, the framerate wa horrible and the game soon crashed. I though, okay, I just started but maybe it was a fluke issue. Restart, and within a minute it freezes. Okay, one more try... Same thing.

												Had fun playing it. Maybe a little too random at times. A tad bit difficult to understand on the first playthrough. Interesting gameplay though and a must play for fans of choosing your own adventure. Failed expeditions can feel like a huge waste of time, but keep in mind that failure is part of the gameplay here, so don't be too disappointed if you fail your first couple of expeditions.The visuals are solid. Feels like board game art and it really jives well with the whole treasure hunting/world exploration theme going on. The music can be incredibly repeatative and uninspiring. Sounds like a cheap mobile game. Background music is recommended.There's a lot of different strategies and paths to victory here, but it really takes more than a few failed expeditions to get to the right one and even then success can kind of feel random.There a lot to like, but definitely a huge chunk to hate.6.5/10			"

												Long Story Short, I am terrible at this game.  The Mood System is a fair bit deeper than the typical rock paper scissors you see in games like fire emblem. The Mood System is Hate, the Mood System is Life. The Mood System will rekt you again and again until your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is so big and used to the ramming it gets that you will learn how to use the reaming to your own advantage.But even then, getting rich, famous, and well known in this game is no walk in the park oh no. I have never completed a game, or rather, 5 expeditions in a row. I simply suck too much. You Will Too. Get used to it, Don't be fooled by the colorful aesthetic of this game. It. Will. !@#$. You. Up. While entertaining you with innocent little stories at the same time.			"

												It comes close, but it doesn't deliver lasting fun. The overland adventure is enjoyable, and it's fun to min-max the captain bonus with the entourage and other bonuses you get in town, but since the combat at the end of each expedition is a totally different sort of challenge that can STRAIGHT UP END YOUR GAME, it's jarring. The game takes the sensibilities of euro-style boardgaming and melds them with high-stakes tactics, and the resulting combination is too bumpy for me.			"

												First of all: I cannot reccomend this game.I can see that many people compare this game to FTL game. I didn't play it, so I cannot do it, but for me RE:IS is not really good game. Well, it's overpriced at least.Graphic is nice, music is ok and it's quite fun to play...for the first time. For me, this game has ZERO replayability.I have played this game just 5 hours, so not much. First game was great. I started in adventure mode and finish the game in 4 hours. I thought that next game will be different. Maybe not 100% different but still. Unfortunatelly events are very similar, there is just few spots on worldmap that you can visit and I simple feel that I am doing the same things agin and again.I will give it a shot one more time, but play again just to unlock new characters and find some more treasures is not enough. Idea was good, but there is not enough content for now.			"

												Amazing game. But it should be in early access. I'm not recommending this not because I didn't like the game itself, but because of the lack of content. There are very few expeditions you can do, and most of them take place in Europe or North America. After awhile of playing, you start to remember every random event and what is best to do to earn the most stuff. I got this game for free, but you shouldn't pay 20$ for something that you can quickly finish.			"

												I cannot recommend this game. I want to, I really do, but it is unbalanced in a few, yet crucial, ways that transforms a charming and novel experience with a lot of promise into sheer frustration, or, more frequently, shock and disbelief. Make sure you've made your sacrifices to the random number generator gods before playing this one. There are (at least) two things that need to be re-worked: 1) the Resolve mechanic, and 2) the attack power of minions. You start each expedition with barely enough Resolve to survive it. The early expeditions are easy enough, but then sometimes you die on the first encounter of your first expedition. Even hardcore rogue-likes are more balanced than that. Failure is often so unavoidable mainly because Resolve is reduced for each character that falls, and once you hit zero Resolve, it's 'game over'. This is also due to minions doing nearly as much ""damage"" as bosses, and respawning at a considerable rate with no perceivable limit to their quantity. Because some encounters railroad you into certain strategies, and because your party might only be really good at other strategies, you can end up with a highly skilled and decked-out party who is just up♥♥♥♥♥♥creek in some encounters. And that wouldn't be so bad occasionally, but since the result is 'game over' and you really had no chance, it's more than a little confusing and frustrating. So to save yourself from this fate, you'll find yourself just doing whatever your party is best at, regardless of whether it's appropriate to the situation.IMO, the worst kind of gaming experience you can have is really wanting to like a game that has some genuinely great ideas and a lot of potential, but not being able to because of the despair it engenders via meaningless ""are you feaking kidding me?"" and ""I'm not even mad anymore, this is just ridiculous"" moments, in spite of your level of mastery. That's what happens here w/ RE:IS. Maybe it's worth a purchase on sale, but not at full price.			"

												Two Words: Difficulty spike. The game encourages you to play your own way and try different teams and strategies. As far as I can tell the only thing that really matters is getting a bunch of gold to upgrade your gear to have good stats. I played on the second to easiest difficulty and I was having no trouble with end level bosses besides them being a little grindy to defeat until the final expedition. Then suddenly there are minibosses that can oneshot my strongest hero. After save scumming my way to victory I encountered the final boss. The boss and his party all had several hundred spirit(health) each while my people had around 40. My brother and I each have tried the game multiple times and every time our runs come to an end due to difficulty spikes at one point or another.I really enjoyed the art style and humor of the game, but the frustration of insurmountable difficulty is too much. I had hoped to enjoy this game, but I just can't.			"

												After playing 'Reus' I was really excited to see what else this studio came up with. This is a talented group, and there is definitely an audience for this game, but I think the audience is too ""niche"" to warrant the sweeping positive reviews.Stylistically, I think the campiness was a weird choice. After playing the tutorial and seeing the evil ""rival"" I was thinking, ""Hey, this would be a fun thing to show to my 7 year old nephew"" but then I realized there's way too much reading for someone of that age and the difficulty is too high for him to enjoy... so... I don't know, I thought it was silly. Let's go plunder a native tribe by telling them jokes... :|The bonuses are fun. You get LOTS of shiny throughout the game. It doesn't pay off unless you complete a whole level, though, and the boss fights were the deal breakers for me. I think in the last fight I did there were 4x as many enemies as my I had in my party. Challenging fights are fun... but I hadn't even really completed a full level (past the tutorial), so it seems like it just ramped up too fast. And while the game is technically a 'tactics' game, in that it has a grid and you walk around, there seemed to be less tactical decisions focused on positioning, movement, cover, etc... and more so just their 'mood' system.

												There is a lot to like about the game, it's pretty, it sounds good, it has lots of options, but all of this is completely undermined by the random encounter generation.  You will get a long string of trivial fights that offer no challenge and just waste your time and them BAM, your expedition is over because the random numbers said the next fight was totally impossible for you to win.  After a dozen expeditions I've had 1 or 2 fights that were interesting, six that were completely impossible and dozens that were nothing but a waste of time I had no chance of losing.  A lot of time and effort went into polishing this game, but none of it was spent on the most time consuming and success determining part, the fights.			"

												When I got this game, I was hoping it was a randomized places to go, it's not. Everytime you start over, you are greeted with the same place, in the exact same order. The route you take is randomized I think, but you will always get the same main treasures. It gets really repetitive quick, because replaying a game with different combinations of character is a big part of this game, but it just gets boring doing the exact same thing over and over but with different characterss. I will recommend this game only during big sale, but I will not recommend it on full price.Aside from repetitiveness and the lack of randomness, The combat system is pretty good.

You are meant to benefit from selecting a team with similar synergies (for want of a better term), however I did not notice any differnce who I played with and even in battle it always seemed better/easier to choose 'Aggressive' over any other whether I had fighters included or not. Maybe I failed to give this game enough chance, it certainly isn't terrible, but I would recommend only getting in a sale.			"

												RE:IS is basically a generic ""we made a roguelike look at us guys"" game that is so poorly balanced that it's almost laughable. The first half of the game is a total steamroll, while the latter half features a cheating AI and really cheap game mechanics (bosses with infinite reinforcements that arrive every turn which are also damage sponges) to try and counter the steamroll. There's also a lot of cheap screw-over mechanics where unless you have a guide open displaying every possible outcome to everything you are probably not going to be getting anywhere.Devs have nerfed every possible winning combo to the ground because ""muh singleplayer game balance"" making it even more un-fun than it already was.

												Let me start with this: the game is fun once or twice, while you explore all the locations. Then it dies. The advertised ""replayability"" is that you can use a lot of characters on your runs, however they are not fundamentally different from each other, they all use the same mechanics, just different sprites. The randomized locations are not randomized, you are going to face the same challenges each and every time at the end of the map, no exception. Sure, the enemies may spawn on a different part of the map, or you take a different road,  but all runs feel the same. The treasures you can unlock are not changing the way you play the game in a big way, they are just giving you extra resources for various activites. TL, DR:DO buy this game when it's on a sale for 5-10 EurosDO NOT buy for full price, or expect anything more than 4-5 hours of (awesome) gameplay. This game has NO real replayability.			"

												Let me start by saying this isn't a bad game. This is a nice little game that will probably provide you with at least ~10 hours of entertainment before you get bored. That being said, I'm already bored.I'm not the type of person that likes to min/max everything in the game. I don't want to try and beat my high score and I don't want to get 100% achievements. I just want to enjoy playing the game and I want something that keeps me coming back to relax. This isn't it. I think my biggest problem with this game is that there isn't enough variety. I keep seeing the same encounters over and over again. In every play through I fight the same bosses, I see the same treasures, and then different characters don't really provide me with that much varied game play. It feels like I'm playing the same hour and a half campaign over and over again. The mechanics of this game aren't all that interesting if I already know how to win every fight and I'm esentially playing the same characters. I like tactics games, but the combat in this game is so simple and so unvaried that it ends up being completely uncompelling. Overall I am disappointed with this game. It's still a cute little game that I recommend people try when it's on sale. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Found the beginning pretty good, but by the final encounter, the enemy team takes out each one of my characters in a single attack.  Wasn't the whole game to get to this point and have a chance?  They all move further than I do and fight with stronger attacks. Frustrating.  Too long for too little enjoyment. Played on normal difficulty, won't play again.			"

Product received for free
												It's a digital boardgame with the goal to beat a certain highscore. At the beginning you pick 3 units out of 4 categories to make up your party. At the beginning there are only 1 units per category unlocked.The game consists of four parts in two phases. You can try 5 levels to reach the highscore, each having different properties.Within the levels you have the discovery part, wherein you navigate a graph which has fog of war, with a vision distance of 1.You can see what possibly awaits you at next nodes and movement is limited by a resource. (I've seen this in a similar game with a similar name.)The level's exit is marked at the beginning and running out of fuel makes it so every move reduces the party's stats for the level, so you wanna avoid running out of fuel.Nodes have stat checks, where you pick one party member and roll the dice. You see the percentage chance before rolling so you just pick the highest.The other part in this phase is combat. It's turn based combat on a hex grid. There are 3 types of attacks which complement each other (we've seen this in many RPGs). The prevalence of a type determines the type of combat (which can frequently fluctuate) which changes stats. The different types of attacks also have buffs and debuffs. The game tries to bash ""violence"" and so one of the 3 types is aggression, which often results in fewer resources after the fight and has it's own stats, whereas the other two types, being verbal violence and compliments, sharing their stats, making it easier to gear up for them. The ""non-violent"" attacks work exactly the same, they just have a different presentation. A very superficial change. You cannot gain inforrmation on enemy units and you cannot tell by their looks if they have ranged attacks, since those can be ""verbal"". This makes combat rather frustrating as you can get easily surrounded and gangbanged by enemies whom you thought were out of range.At the end of a level, there is the second phase on the world map. Here you can spend your 3 resources. Purchase gear with gold. Unlock general bonuses with resarch. Increase resource acquisition with reputation. Then pick the next level.The whole game has an adventure/indiana jones theme.These kind of boardgames are fun at the beginning and rather random when you play them more often.I liked that the game let me skip the tutorial completely.I disliked that the game literally told me to ""Stop being so entitled!"" and to ""Check your privilege!"". The hamfisted denigration of physical violence by slapping on a veneer of verbal violence and ""pacifism"" was pretty meh.			"

												Its fun, but inconsitent and little technical glitches make it bothersome more often than not. The idea is great, there isnt enough depth to the explorations and encountrers to play over and over again and playing with different styles requires no extra thought save making sure your three explorerers are of the same skillsets. Gets a little repetitive and the encounters drag a little. Gets harder as you go and it was fun to get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked by some old nuns who were surprisingly flirtatious.Periodically, boxes or buttons just dissapear, HUD flickers or the base map is a mess of glitching. This doesn't go back to normal until you reset. Like a lot of independent games on steam, this would be better as a mobile app and if it were priced as such.			"

												Generally speaking these sort of rogue-lites appeal to me and after seeing a glowing review about the game from Total Biscuit I decided it was worth a shot. The game downloaded reasonably quickly and launched fine. I got through the little intro and crew selection and was embarking on the first expedition when I had my first encounter (A MAJOR part of the game mechanics where all combat happens). While on the load screen for the encounter the game crashed at 5%. I thought maybe it was a one-time thing, after all the first time launching games isn't always perfect, so I tried again. I went through the intro and related process again only to have the game crash once more upon entering the loading screen for an encounter at 5%. I did this a few more times with similar results. Encounter loading screen crashes at 5%. Every. Time. At this point I'm convinced it just won't work on my PC and I can't for the life of me figure out why. It looks like a really fun game so it's a real shame I can't play it. I've seen on the support forums other people having the exact same ""5% Crash"" issue and the only response from the developer that I've seen was a sincere apology but no real solution. Don't spend money on this unless you're willing to gamble that it just won't work for your PC.			"

												I've played this game for a few hours, and to be honest I don't know what was expecting. I read the reviews and weighed out the pros an cons, decided that I may as well get it to test it out. It is fun. I'll give it that. The characters to choose from have personality, and putting certain ones together creates different effects while you're exploring. People are saying there's not enough places to go. Honestly, I don't even mind that much because different stuff can happen depending who you're teamed with. All in all, it's an okay game, I'd give it a 5/10. I took a point off because I'm just a spiteful person.The thing that would really get my♥♥♥♥♥♥hard was if the treasures you got at the end actually meant something. I mean, I'm aware they make you more famous so you can beat those grade A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that are the most famous. But after that, then what? They just look pretty on Anna's shelves? THEY DON'T HAVE SHELVES BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPLORERS.I dont know, it's an alright game but you gotta really love repetitive game play if you wanna spend £15.

												While this game does a lot of things right, it fails in a few key aspects. The game is supposed to be about an intrepid band of explorers venturing into the unknown and discovering lost lands, lost peoples, and lost treasures, but ultimately, it fails to deliver on that.For example, you're supposed to be exploring the unknown, but in reality the path you're taking is fairly predictable. You know exactly how long your supplies will last, exactly what kind of challenge you'll run into, and exactly how best to deal with that challenge. There is certainy random chance involved, which is good, but it's in the wrong place. Instead of throwing you into the unknown and making you figure out how to get out of the mess you're in, you are instead encouraged to look forward, figure out what lies in store for you, and then meticulously plan out where you go and in what order to have the best chance of success. This isn't a bad mechanic per se, and in a different game it could make for some great gameplay, but for a game about exploring the unknown, it just doesn't click.The combat is another example this. While I like the idea of using a combination of weapons, words, and trickery to defeat your enemies, the way it was done just makes everything feel gamey and contrived. Everything is boiled down to an attack on the enemy's HP, and at best you might get something that inflicts an unreliable status effect or changes the ""mood"" of the combat. Trying to be diplomatic or sneaky just ends up feeling the same as any other combat, rather than being it's own, interesting way to tackle challenges.			"

												This is the first game I'm going to try to refund on Steam.I saw the comments about it being X-COM like and I thought I'd try it out. It turns out that there isn't much going for the combat other than a rock-paper-scissors sort of thing with three attack types. Of course, the game suggests building your team around one or two types, so you're going into a RPS contest without one of those choices. Each character has a small number of attacks to choose from, and they were mostly the same between the characters I tried. If there's some way to switch team members between expeditions, I didn't find it.Between combats, the game has a dull board game feel, like playing Monopoly. Sometimes you roll on a wheel to see if something good or bad happens. There are different skills that influence this, but there's not much way to prepare for a particular type of area where different skills might apply, unless I missed that, too. I should note that the UI for this game is often confusing.Also, there's some bug for unusual resolutions that makes the mouse cursor not line up with whatever position it's using for selecting buttons. I played this game on my TV, which obscures some of the edge of a standard resolution, so I clipped it a little in the video settings. I had to change resolution in the game to a standard choice and restart.The point is, I don't want to play this game any more.			"

												Pretty dissapointed with this game, here's why:- Annoying emotion-based combat system which requires you to play a certain way - not the way you want- Events are seemingly completely random in difficulty and one loss will see you start right from the beginning- You can only equip a measly three items per character which are limited in choice and offer little satisfaction- You are given an extremely limited choice in regions you can travel to and cannot return to them- The game is way too short ""but we want you to play it lots of times over"" - Devs (that's called laziness)- Token system is stupid - what ever happened to simple gold coins and loot?- Too many classes, sub-classes and perk combinations which usually end up failing in the end- Random map spawning - who thought it would be good to have bosses spawn on healing areas?- Entourage system is a complete waste of time and you will never notice it- Research papers seem half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and are basically a talent tree you will never notice- Speech attacks can be fumbled - how?- Get stunned once on a boss level? Prepare to be swarmed by the infinite amount of enemies who you will have to sit and watch one by one as they move and attack you...How fun.Everything you expect this game to be it simply isn't. There's simply too much going on for it to be enjoyable; classes, subclasses, perks, weaknesses, combinations, tokens, entourage, moods, positioning, speech attack, speech defence, spirit, normal attack, armour. Lots of the encounters you will have will just be you spinning a wheel and leaving it to chance, if you lose, be prepared to lose resolve (Life) - run out of those, and you could have just thrown away hours of work because you chose the wrong characters from the get go and no, you cannot escape these events when they occur.If you're looking for a game where you can happily play a couple of hours a day, building up your team and equipping them with the best items, exploring new regions and amassing lots of coins and artifacts then this isn't for you.Unfortunately, I think the devs put so much time into making the game look good, that they forgot to actually play it. Devs - get in touch with me if you want to know how to make this game work.Not recommended.			"

												Game-play is sufficiently deep to warrant multiple playthroughs.  The ""you die and start over"" game style is great because it places value on each decision.Very enjoyable, so far.			"

												This game is really fun!  I love the resource management aspects, and the meaningful choices you can make.  The RPG elemements are actual kept fairly minimal and definitely tolerable for a non-RPG oriented player.			"

												For 17$ the game is too shallow. Very few levels to play, with very few effective teams.Getting 100% is tedious and makes the game even worse than what it is.It could be easily released on mobile for 3.99$I see it's an overall cancer to sell mobile games on steam, sadly.			"

												So I've edited my original review. Originally, I lfelt like it wasn't a full game yet. There are still somethings I'd like to see fixed, but most of what bothred me about the game initially is fixed, and it's a lot of fun.I'd still love to see an option to have it auto-end a turn when you have no more possible actions. Not only does this feel like a time waster, when you realize you need to hit the end turn button, or when you hit it, but because the mood of the battle changed, it didn’t read the input and you have to hit it again, but everyone and then you think you’re done and you skip over someone who still could have acted a moment to late. The latter hasn’t happened to me often, but there are some issues in how the encounters are drawn that can lead to it. First off, everyone and then I’ve lost a character behind a bush or a tree, this is especially bad if the character has been knocked out, and you are trying to find them to revive them, but there is a blurriness to encounters that sometimes makes it hard to tell on the characters that don’t have vibrant colors if they have acted or not.There are a few other interface issues that also make the game frustrating. The arrow that shows you when your character has leveled up isn’t that noticeable, especially with all the other buffs and debuts that sometimes show near the portrait. If you don’t notice before you move to a new location, you can no longer level the character until after that encounter. Also, I was almost 20 hours into the game before I noticed the very subtile tool icon, that allows you to use tools to help your chances on skill tests.It would also be nice if you got to carry over something from a previous game. As it is, you do unlock the option to make more and more of the characters ‘Captains’ which give you various bonuses,  but you get nothing for doing better on one game than another. If you could maybe choose one treasure to carry over with you, that would be great. Especially since the treasures are slightly randomized, and so sometimes you get a treasure that would benefit a Tactician, but if you didn’t create your crew with one, you can never take advantage of it. It would be lots of fun if you got a treasure that your current crew couldn’t use, but you could keep, and then design your next crew around it. But aside from those nitpicks it’s a lot of fun. The characters are great. You have 20 to choose from, and they are extremely diverse. The characters come from all over the world and they each have a flavor to them that makes them exciting. They all feel like they really do have personalities, and in fact, in certain encounters you will suddenly discover that one of your crew has a ‘hidden’ characteristic like being vain or a glutton, that changes your options. The battle, or encounter animations are great. I love that two out of the three play styles are based around talking not fighting, and they’ve put some real thought into it. It’s more complex than a simple rock paper scissors mechanic. For instance if both sides in a battle are friendly, there is a huge bonus to being the first to physically attack. However, actual attacks swing the encounter radically towards the aggressive side, and if you had been hoping for a friendly resolution, you’re going to have to do a lot of work to make up for whoever did the attack. That means that if you’re trying to play friendly, it’s beneficial to keep playing friendly. However, more aggressive groups can sometimes get a one time big bonus by pretending to be friendly and then attacking.			"

												A tricky game, although a bit short. I can really recommend it for some quick gaming, but played correct it's not much more than say 24 hours of gameplay to beat the game. Of course you can do that over and over and try and beat the score, but there's not more than like 9 different locations, and for one campaign you're gonna do 6 of them, and after that it's the final scoring count. As such you'll not always level up all your characters fully, won't explore all science and so forth. The science for that matter, if you want to score high I'd say you're prone to basically go for the same stuff each time, although you might do slight variations depending on your crew. In the end though it's pretty much like playing golf I guess, in the sense that what you'll end up playing against in the end is your own score, and beating that one, but of course, if friends have this game you'll have their score in the list to beat too. It's a strict single player game though, but finding new ways of beating your own score can be surprisingly rewarding.It is a fun game though, so I recommend it, but if you're gonna pick it up I suggest doing it on a sale, since I can't with a good concious recommend this at full price.

I still really like stories 4. I'm more devious, than friendly or aggressive5. I don't care about the money, give me the status and research! 6. Cultists seem to get me more often than anything else.Great game that is easy to pick up for a few minutes-hours, and then go about your day.			"

												I had something written out before, but it got lost in the shuffle. Rewriting it now, just shows how much I think of this game :PThe game plays out a lot like FTL with your characters moving through nodes and finding encounters or just picking up the various resources you can use to upgrade things in between expeditions. I find this much more engaging than FTL however as the encounters that you'll find aren't simply based on the roll of a die, but have a Fallout New Vegas style chance to succeed that depends on your party members skills and ability scores adding a bit of depth to how you choose and level up your characters. The types of encounters are widely varied and you probably won't see them all within a couple playthroughs. At 11 hours I still haven't beaten a few of the levels and even within the levels I can breeze through there's still some secrets I haven't been able to figure out (whats the gargoyle statue for o_O) Combat has been mentioned a lot, with a lot of notice given to its presentation. Basically there are 2 types of attack (Speech/Attack) that are in turn seperated into 3 Attack styles (Speech = Friendly/Devious and Attack) The 3 styles have a rock paper scissor effect on each other in that if you're consistently using a style that beats the opponents style you get a global buff or a debuff if you're on the losing side. Neutral means a buff to the winning style although I've not yet seen opponents take advantage of this. Additionally the way you win battles will give different rewards and potentially different outcomes. Attacks also have the ability to buff and debuff your opponents in various ways and I think that' s the general meat of the combat strategy. Overall its a pretty simple system which actually works to the games favor as it keeps the game flowing as combat encounters are just part of the general exploration ecosystem.A couple of nitpicks that I have with the game, visually I love the animations and graphical style. In most cases. In some places its oddly old style flash looking with flat colors and overly simplistic layout like the title screen. The lack of polish extends to other places like when you finish an expedition and you count your rewards, skipping ahead will cause it to pause for a long while, and some of the character suggestions are strange. Like Hildegard being suggested for Friendly and Aggressive despite have no attack skills and a poor regular attack. One larger one is that the combat system has the aforementioned buff debuffs attached to attacks, but enemies can be IMMUNE a buff or debuff and take no dmg from the attack. This can render a char ineffective in whats usually the effective strat. You can still go neutral, but it seems like a weird thing to have. Overall: I find this game reallllllly compelling. like, I should be studying for finals but I'm not, compelling.			"

												A great turn based strategy game with thoughts having to be spent on figuring out the best path or the tactical combat setup. Easy enough on the lower difficulties to not require a deep understand of the vast counters to all the actions but deep enough to offer a smart challenge at higher ones.Only drawback was the fairly lacklustre tutorial.

												A fantastic gem of a game. The aim of the game is relatively simple, take a crew of three and discover as much as possible and become the world's most renowned explorer. How you achieve this is up to you. Do you want to be known as a devious researcher, a prized fighter or perhaps you simply want to bask in your own glory. There are several different ways to play, with various different expansions giving the game hours of replayability.Encounters are relatively simple, yet also fun and engaging. Buffs and debuffs become very important and the mood of the battlefield has consequences. Trying to be friendly to an aggressive opponent for instance, would put you at a disadvantage. Each team has a cptain that offers various perks to the expeditions and can help boost your final score significantly. Each character (16 in total) has their own perk. As you play the game, you can unlock more captains to add more variey. Crew members also have a set of skills that will assist you in finding treasures, not every treasure you find on the map will be yours; you need the right people for the job. The skills are further developed and acquired as you progress in the game. Certain characters traits, being mean, guillable or even hating coffee even come into play with additional dialogue options or events in certain places.The actual exploration at first is amazing, while the number of expeditions is static, the maps are somewhat random and certain things don't always spawn. Lategame, this can also be quite frustrating when you're trying to farm that one treasure you don't have. This will take quite some time to achieve, though.There's also quite a bit of humour in here, which adds to an amusing experience. The art specifically is fantastic and some of the faces the crewmembers pull really tickles me.All in all a highly enjoyable experience that I can't recommend enough. I've been playing the game for over 100 hours and I'm still discovering things!			"

												Beating up natives by complimenting them or telling them they have dirty underwear or even just straight smacking them with a taser or oar. What's more to want?It's a roguelike elements with options to turn them off if you are a pansy like that. It's got a large group of characters to form a party of 3 with,giving you plenty of options to form synergistic exploration teams. You steal cultural treasure to give to London where they belong. There are loads of treasures to find and loads of achievements to unlock. Each play through is unique enough to kkeep it fresh. There is a delightful measure of strategy in the fights and just enough random luck to keep you on your toes both inside and outside combat. It's a great game with some fun writing and settings. Its lighthearted and silly. Each game isnt too long,maybe 2-3 hours from start to finish which makes it great for a pick up and play kind of game.I'm loving it as my new squeeze when i have free time.If you love light turn-based strategy games with a splash of resource management and just enough randomness {in maps,events,etc} to keep it fresh then you'll love this game. Unless you just had your cultural artifact stolen by some foreign devils. Which by all means....still get this game and do it to other tribes and cultures the world over.			"

Select a crew composed of three characters of which one will be the captain and therefor recieve a unique ability depending on the character. Theres 4 types of characters to choose from all with different strengths, attacks, abilities and all that jazz. The overworld features shops, research and upgradeable entourage for you to aid you own your adventures where you will find treasures, charm locals, research stuff and kill the baddies. The combat is turn based on a hexgrid, featuring a rock-paper-scissor style type of damage you can do. There's enough content to keep you busy and the combat, art and setting is a fresh new setting for us gamers to enjoy. "

 Would unleash a dinosaur on the good people of London again 10/10. I got this game after meeting some of the developers at a game convention, one of the artists was an absolute darling and had a very nice chat with her. So, influenced by being social and thinking 'they deserve my money', I bought the game and did not regret it for a second.  Feels like a boardgame, I love boardgames  Lovely art, very nicely done Has a lot of surprises and humor Sounds + voice acting is a m a z i n g but it can also be played with music off and watching a show with one eye (multitasking, ay). DLC's really add to the game, campfire addition is lovely. The interactions between the characters is lovely. Would travel the world with a grumpy grandma and a magician child again. It does take a while to get used to the tactics but worth it, I would like more levels/places to explore/more randomized encounters but it is still a very entertaining game that every once in a while I play. Currently sick in bed with the flu and l o v i n g the game once more. I have encountered some bugs that I have not been able to fic yet (screens turning white or black and unable to continue) but I am hopeful this will be fixed soon. 9/10 total score. "

												This is such a charming and fascinating game. It combines many gameplay elements including turn based strategy, RPG, roguelike, and storytelling into a very tight and balanced package. The game is fairly short but emphasizes replayability like most roguelikes. The adventures and stories varied and have multiple results so you end up seeing something new every time you play. RNG is used pretty extensively but it feels suprisingly fair.The multi layered rock, paper, scissor combat system is very unique and adds so much to the charm you could easily confuse it for a Nintendo game. The story telling is light hearted and silly that it's hard not to smile. The secrets and collection elements are very rewarding as well. The game is challenging but beatable even on the hardest difficulties. There's a large number of difficulty settings so it's even playable If you want to adventure with your kids or just want to experience the stories.The best part of this game is the community. The developers have encouraged community driven weekly challenge events that have brought together the most positive gaming community that I have ever seen. The players are constructive and the deleopers are responsive to feedback. It's easy to get advice from the pros and trolls are delt with in a calm manner.This game is great and the only complaints that I have seen are in regards to the length. If you don't like playing roguelikes that favor replayability then this may not be the game for you. It's also pretty silly so you should consider staying away if you prefer your games violent and grim.			"

												Now this is a very difficult game to describe. The closer comparison to a prior game, though not perfectly accurate, would be FTL -Faster Than Light- except instead of being in space, you're sent back to the exploration time of the late 1800.The goal of the game is to become in 5 ""expeditions"" the most ""Renowned Explorers"". To do so, you need to select a team of 3 explorers, among 20, with their own stats and skills, and try to gather as much ""renown"" as possible by collecting treasures during the expeditions.An expedition is a semi-random map of interconnected nodes containing various ressources and treasures gated behind skill-checks and/or fights, and must be completed by reaching and defeating its associated boss. You have a limited number of free moves or ""supplies"" to explore the map, with some potential resupply here and there. You can explore beyond these free moves, but doing so will net some random penalties to your crew's stats. Too many penalties and defeating the boss may become impossible!Between each expeditions, you can spend your hard gained ressources on various improvements: team stats, skills, supplies, amount of ressources or renown obtained etc.A full run will usually take 2h, or around 30 minutes per expeditions. The first expedition is set (sort of) but you get to decide the next 4 among the 8 available in the base game (10 with the More to Explore DLC). They all come with different difficulties, skill-requirements and themes. The harder they are, the better the rewards.Of course, a game about exploration wouldn't be complete without a world to discover. Renowned Explorers offers a colorful, lighthearted and witty one. You'll be befriending sheeps, insulting lamas and slapping monkeys (they deserve it) while you visit tropical islands, the deserts of Egypt or the forests of east Europe.If my 200 hours on the game have not hinted on it yet: I fully recommend this game.

												I won't go in-depth - just a few points that I found to be important in why I like the game.Design: Very fun concept.  Characters are well-designed and help keep replays fresh and interesting.  They have their own stories that unlock through completed playthroughs.  If you are a completionist, you will have fun designing parties with hopes of getting the one or two elusive treasures that requires just the right party to pass the challenges.  The same goes for the steam achievements.Graphics: Many rogue-like rpgs are lacking in graphics, which can be a big turn-off to many people.  It's nice to play a rogue-like with good graphics.Combat/Gameplay:Combat is grid-based.  I love grid-based gaming concepts.  It makes for great strategy.  Characters rely on 3 emotions.  You can physically fight, positively persuade/inspire, or deviously sadden/confuse/frustrate your opponents to achieve victory.  In a world where every game follows the model ""kill stuff and get stuff"" - Big Kudos to the designers for creating a game that allows you to win and be rewarded by using means other than physical combat!!!Other than that, the devs and community are actively involved.  Look forward to future add-ons!!			"

 Would unleash a dinosaur on the good people of London again 10/10. I got this game after meeting some of the developers at a game convention, one of the artists was an absolute darling and had a very nice chat with her. So, influenced by being social and thinking 'they deserve my money', I bought the game and did not regret it for a second.  Feels like a boardgame, I love boardgames  Lovely art, very nicely done Has a lot of surprises and humor Sounds + voice acting is a m a z i n g but it can also be played with music off and watching a show with one eye (multitasking, ay). DLC's really add to the game, campfire addition is lovely. The interactions between the characters is lovely. Would travel the world with a grumpy grandma and a magician child again. It does take a while to get used to the tactics but worth it, I would like more levels/places to explore/more randomized encounters but it is still a very entertaining game that every once in a while I play. Currently sick in bed with the flu and l o v i n g the game once more. I have encountered some bugs that I have not been able to fic yet (screens turning white or black and unable to continue) but I am hopeful this will be fixed soon. 9/10 total score. "

												Renowned Explorers: International Society, is a very fun game which presents the player with unique ways to solve encounters, during a battle you can kill, trick, or befriend the enemy, each option weighing out with different strengths and weanesses in your campaign, and against each type of enemy.this game also gives you unique explorer's which make up your team, and change how you approch each scenario. This is a game which will have you playing over and over to try out different teams, and different motivations. a great game for everyone!

												It's one of the most FUN games i have ever played, and it's a shame that it's not more popular. Every campaign is short, so you can finish it in one sitting, but thanks to different levels and team compositions it's really replayable, and ever after ""winning"" it 10 times there are still things i didn't see yet or bosses i couldn't defeat. I hope that game will still be improved by DLC's, because fankly - creators of Renowned Explorers deserve money for what they done.			"

												The decision making strategy portion of the game is what I find the most fun. The combat just becomes brutal after a short while and diminishes the re-playability for me.

												I'd be lying if I said that my achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ness didn't push me to play this game a bit longer than its shelf life should have had me playing it, but if there wasn't a solid game there to start with then I wouldn't have even made to the point where I started to get completionist pangs. The game is a really solid strategy in the same line of games like XCOM, Darkest Dungeon, Shadowrun and the life, yes it a more whimsical experience but in some ways it is actually a bit more complex than some of these games.You can find my whole review of the game here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2016/10/renowned-explorers-international-society.html.

												Renowned Explorers is a game with a high replay value. The story telling and events are quick-paced and a good laugh. There's plenty of room to expand upon the game's core model, meaning that there will likely be some more expansions or DLC packs in the future.The only thing I would change is this: the length of the gameplay scenarios, overall, is a bit short. No crew gets to explore the entire map, unless you choose to press on after the endgame. I suppose it works well for its design, but a lengthier campaign mode would likely challenge fans of strategy games a bit better.Still, it's a great time and worth picking up.			"

												Interesting Tactical RPG.I played through the campaign about 6-7 times, and my most fun playthrough was probably the 3rd or 4th time. It took me some time to understand all the mechanics, which were fun and interesting, but also hard to synergize in a party IMO.The down side to this game is probably just the lack of places to explore. All of the locations are random generated, but the stories are always the same. So you find yourself repeating the same stuff over and over. When I finally realized this, the game became stale. I played it out a few more times, so I could unlock characters to be leaders, but in the end the replayability is pretty bad.In the end I still recommend this game, because it is fun the first few times through, and I think that's worth the On Sale Price. I wouldn't recommend it at its full price though.			"

												What a gem of a game!A bit daunting at first, because there are a lot of systems to learn, currencies etc. But it hs some real depth to it and it's a great theme - not just a skin on a dungeon crawler, but part of its core. Don't let the accessible graphics fool you, this is no toy.It does suffer from the same issue I have with similar roguelikes, in that you can end up spending a lot of time developing your character/s, and end up losing the game pretty suddenly and brutally. But the development works so well in this game that it can't be a complaint - and it gives you enugh difficulty options that you can negate that to some extent anyway.Looks great, very polished, well written.Definitely recommend, and it's a bargain at full price.

												Plenty of good games out there for Mouse + Keyboard, but this is a solid pick for a game you can play well with a touchscreen (always double tap).  Something more than an adapted board game, Renowned Explorers is an adventure limited game of questing.  Or just call it a light rougelike if you like.  You assemble a team, face a myriad of challenges and in the end compare yourself to the rest of the Renowned Explorers Society.  Sometimes you'll get really far with little to show for it, other times you'll fall on your face.  Almost everytime you play through will be different, unless you take the game too seriously. ;)			"

What stands out to me most is the way the personality of the characters comes through not just in the obvious ""story moments"", but in the way that you can get small bonuses for resolving conflicts in a way that jives with the characters you picked for your party.The tactical element in combat is a little light, but it's still there.

First runs i did not understand the mechanics, it can get really painfull...Do not regret buying it. "

 A Modest Modern Masterpiece First of all, I’m a pretty big fan of roguelikes, I don’t enjoy the punishing difficulty that usually accompanies them; but, I do love the anything-can-happen feeling that they provide. Oftentimes, a sharp, well-tuned “little” game can outshine most triple-A titles. This is one of those times. Renowned Explorers: International Society hits on a lot of levels for me, I love Indiana Jones, roguelikes, upbeat humor, and pop art. If any of those things don’t interest you, this might not be your game irrespective of anything I have to say. If you’re still interested, lets hit some pros-and-cons.ProsMore Fun(ny) than a Barrel of ColloquialismsFantastic Art that Complements the Experience and Conveys the CharactersReplay Value that is Actually Worth Replaying™Deep Combat Strategy and Dozens of Characterful CombinationsAn Ever-Faithful Adherent of the All-Wonderful, All-Good RNG (long may he reign)ConsCons were a lot tougher to come up with, and so I’ve written a bit more than word-bites for them, but it is important to recognize flaws in even those things that we love.I don’t much care for 1000% voice acted titles, Morrowind had plenty enough of the talky-talky for me. Plus, you will always be able to tell more story with the written word, and that’s really what we want... more story, more game. This particular game’s sound is pretty good, but in a game that punches this far above its weight, the sound becomes a key weakness in an overall above-and-beyond style title.Remember that deep strategy? It comes at something of a price, the emotional rock-paper-scissors that carries the strategy behind this gameplay can break your party without even asking nicely (it’s a hazard of roguelikes but can hit out of the blue like few other titles I’ve seen), and remembering what’s-good-for-you-and-bad-for-those-guys can become burdensome after a few back-to-back playthroughs.I understand that it’s more roguelike and only RPG-lite...but I will always complain about not-robust-enough RPG features. If character build and customization options are absent, I’m angry; if they’re limited, I’m mad; and if they’re as-robust-as-all-hell with a side of Grim Dawn meets Skyrim… I’m still mildly annoyed. For the record, this game only makes me mad.ConclusionMy conclusion is that this game is nearly as good (and better in some ways) than FTL; it perfectly captures what a roguelike should be, brilliantly evokes a setting often overlooked, and manages to inject a heavy dose of that good old fashioned just-one-more-turn. So, my hat’s off to you Abbey Games, the modest game you’ve made is nothing less than a modern masterpiece. tl;dr: If I could only pick five games to play--for the rest of my life--this would be one of those games. 9.5/10 would explore again.

												This is a fun little game of strategy, planning, and story telling.  What stands out to me most is the way the personality of the characters comes through not just in the obvious ""story moments"", but in the way that you can get small bonuses for resolving conflicts in a way that jives with the characters you picked for your party.The tactical element in combat is a little light, but it's still there.  Most of the strategy is wrapped up in the larger game of collecting points, not in the smaller combat mode.			"

												I love this game.  Its deceptively simple systems make the game easy to get into but difficult to master, and oh-so-refreshing in the turn-based strategy genre.  Putting together a party of explorers to see how they combo together (or don't!) has never been so satisfying!			"

												This rogue-like tactics-board game is one of my favorite games. It's situated in a bright, zany world where you get to explore exotic lands for treasure and fame. You get to comprise a team from a large cast of characters and explore random areas, which offers replayability. I enjoy the unique moments finding certain skills to match encounters, testing my strategies in achieving high scores, hoping for tons of treasure, and managing my team pre and post expedition. The dev community interaction is spectacular as well.			"

												I won't go in-depth - just a few points that I found to be important in why I like the game.Design: Very fun concept.  Characters are well-designed and help keep replays fresh and interesting.  They have their own stories that unlock through completed playthroughs.  If you are a completionist, you will have fun designing parties with hopes of getting the one or two elusive treasures that requires just the right party to pass the challenges.  The same goes for the steam achievements.Graphics: Many rogue-like rpgs are lacking in graphics, which can be a big turn-off to many people.  It's nice to play a rogue-like with good graphics.Combat/Gameplay:Combat is grid-based.  I love grid-based gaming concepts.  It makes for great strategy.  Characters rely on 3 emotions.  You can physically fight, positively persuade/inspire, or deviously sadden/confuse/frustrate your opponents to achieve victory.  In a world where every game follows the model ""kill stuff and get stuff"" - Big Kudos to the designers for creating a game that allows you to win and be rewarded by using means other than physical combat!!!Other than that, the devs and community are actively involved.  Look forward to future add-ons!!			"

												I, like many, have a Pavlovian weakness for turn-based strategy games. Late into the night, I find myself wondering WHY OH WHY I have been compulsively playing Civilization for hours, when there's hardly a lick of story to care about as you progress and battles are formulaic.Not so Renowned Explorers! I picked up the game primarily for its adventure-explorer narrative; as a person who named their pet rabbit after the leader of the ""Kon-Tiki"" expedition, how could I not? The premise is remarkably well done: it's full of tongue-in-cheek humor and bizarre excursions to exotic locales, vying for the renown of the global exploration community. What really shines about this game for me is the blend of mechanics. First and foremost, the fact that you can choose three different styles of combat for most of your encounters (Friendly, Devious, Aggressive) provides a fun and engaging challenge. Part of the reason I love RPGs is because they offer alternative options to combat such as talking your way out of trouble. Renowned Explorers pulls these approaches into its combat scenarios by providing characters with separate stats for physical combat and ""speech"" combat. Balancing the different strengths of your crew in each encounter makes it more nuanced than just having the biggest guns in the game. In addition to more varied combat options, crew set-ups make this game extremely replayable. You pick three people as your expedition crew, and the characters' different skill sets make each combo play very differently. Finally, this is an adventure game afterall, so strategy elements, while present, don't take up all your time. You can buy gear, perform research, recruit assistants, and give lectures to earn strategic resources. The options available here are enough to impact your expeditions, but they truly are secondary to them.I do have two minor complaints. First, each game ""ends"" before you complete all of your available expeditions. I expect that was done to allow people to complete more playthroughs with different crews and strategies, but it makes the game seem too short and a little incomplete. Yes, you can play the rest of the expeditions on the map after you ""win,"" but you'll be past the point where you can unlock new strategic resources, and a lot of the battles get pretty easy. My second - and again, minor - complaint, is that the character's speech combat animations don't make much sense and add little to gameplay. If I remember correctly, Ivan's ""Terrify"" action always produces a speech bubble of a teddy bear. I guess maybe the idea of a character that burly with a little teddy bear is a bit unsettling, but without actual dialogue, it all gets a bit nonsensical. The annimations for physical combat are much more cohesive. Anna's special attack is particularly cool, and there are 20 other characters with special abilities and differing stats to try out.			"

												Plenty of good games out there for Mouse + Keyboard, but this is a solid pick for a game you can play well with a touchscreen (always double tap).  Something more than an adapted board game, Renowned Explorers is an adventure limited game of questing.  Or just call it a light rougelike if you like.  You assemble a team, face a myriad of challenges and in the end compare yourself to the rest of the Renowned Explorers Society.  Sometimes you'll get really far with little to show for it, other times you'll fall on your face.  Almost everytime you play through will be different, unless you take the game too seriously. ;)			"

												Renowned Explorers is my favorite game on steam.  I've logged over one-hundred hours on this game and I still want to play it more.  I was interested in this game, and a friend bought it for me a year ago for the holidays, and been playing it regularly since then.Pros:-6840 different party combinations!?  Options galore!-Customize each party member as you see fit with perks and equipment!-Tongue in cheek setting and humor.-You can subdue an enemy by talking about moustaches.-The expansion has made a great game better, by adding in campfire stories to build relationships, learn more about your characters, and get interesting rewards.-Not terribly hard to run, even on older machines.Con:-Probably not getting any more expansions.

												Incredibly entertaining game with huge replay value. I'd say, it feels more like single player boardgame rather than a video game.It's a unique mix of many genres. Worker placement (refering to boardgames again), RPG, text-only puzzles are among bigger ones.Can be casual, can be pretty tough to beat. Though, your enemies are kind of cute either way, so losing doesn't feel that bad. Can recommend this game to the kids :)Offers big assortment of distinct characters and strategies to pick from.Anyway, game is awesome and well worth its money, don't hesitate to try it!			"

Although (fortunately) there are options for the style and difficulty with which you play, don't be fooled by the casual looking style, this is a rogue-like through and through, which means it can be very challenging and takes a lot of trial and error, to become proficient.

												Renowned Explorers is a facinating bit of gamecraft. It's systems, taken individually, are nothing novel. However, the whole is definitely far more intriguing than the sum of it's parts. There is always a new depth to be explored.It's combat is strategic, despite relatively few active abilites. And it definitely has that ""one more run"" element down pat. You'll find yourself theorycrafting crew, build, strategies, etc.It is occasionally a little unpolished, and the storytelling is so-so. But overall, a solid B title. I very much recommend a purchase, expecially for the rougue-like lover.			"

Charming and original of this degree is a rarity. Playful and endearing whilst maintaining a degree of sohpistication is the best I can sum up the titles very original identity.Gameplay here cannot be commended enough. Complex enough to satisfy yet easy enough to understand without being intimidated is the best recipe for strategy IMO and REIS pulls it off.If you want a fabulous strategy game without the commitment most of the genre demand of you as a gamer, you'd be hard pressed to find a better offering than this.

												Interesting Tactical RPG.I played through the campaign about 6-7 times, and my most fun playthrough was probably the 3rd or 4th time. It took me some time to understand all the mechanics, which were fun and interesting, but also hard to synergize in a party IMO.The down side to this game is probably just the lack of places to explore. All of the locations are random generated, but the stories are always the same. So you find yourself repeating the same stuff over and over. When I finally realized this, the game became stale. I played it out a few more times, so I could unlock characters to be leaders, but in the end the replayability is pretty bad.In the end I still recommend this game, because it is fun the first few times through, and I think that's worth the On Sale Price. I wouldn't recommend it at its full price though.			"

												What a gem of a game!A bit daunting at first, because there are a lot of systems to learn, currencies etc. But it hs some real depth to it and it's a great theme - not just a skin on a dungeon crawler, but part of its core. Don't let the accessible graphics fool you, this is no toy.It does suffer from the same issue I have with similar roguelikes, in that you can end up spending a lot of time developing your character/s, and end up losing the game pretty suddenly and brutally. But the development works so well in this game that it can't be a complaint - and it gives you enugh difficulty options that you can negate that to some extent anyway.Looks great, very polished, well written.Definitely recommend, and it's a bargain at full price.

It is quite fresh air in the ""kill everything"" system. Making wolves sad really made my day :)- Easy to learn, hard to master. Despite the fact of ""roulette"", the decisions and optimalization are the key points to victory.- Exactly the right lenght of game - Option to set difficulty (with or without save etc)- Stategic map, sometimes really like chess- Min max optimizationCons- It can be repetitive (not for me so far, but I rather mentioned that)- I would little bit change some UI elements//Edit based on the comment			"

												I am really enjoying Renowned Explorers thus far. The combat is simple enough that it doesn't require weeks to understand, but complex enough to offer different challenges depending on your party composition. I've come close to winning a few times, but haven't succeeded yet. Which seems like a great difficulty level for me - I want it to be tough to beat. The strategic game is complex enough that I'm still learning ways to optimize my party, and I'm really looking forward to beating the game, and experiencing the new content that the devs are planning. My favorite thing is how different encounters can have different content depending on your party composition. Try to find the artist who needs a model with Maria in your party. ;-)			"

												This game is awesome for many reasons.It really does give a nice exploration feel. There are a large number of party combinations to try, and for casual gamers you can set the difficulty somewhat low and just explore around.However, this review is aimed at the more serious gamers.This game, at higher difficulty levels, has a lot of strategic depth. It is a rogue-lite (with the only progression unlocking new captains--you start at lvl 1 explorers each game, with no new equipment). So essentially a pure rogue-like.There are several different parts to this game.1) [Non-expedition] Resource management. You never have enough to do everything, even with full focus on one of them.Gold for equipment.Status to hire followers and specialists. Give new perks (see below) and improve # of resources gained on expeditions.Research to write papers (which give various bonuses; there are multiple research trees focused on different things).Fully focusing on gold, for instance, will never get you enough for the best equipment for all your characters.Full on research? MAYBE you'll get half the trees unlocked.Etc.(And you'll still get other resources; just where you focus your bonuses can matter a lot.)2) Character developmenta) Your captain perk matters a lot. Each captain has a different perk that can make a big difference (or not, depending on the captain, but its all in how you use it). Hard to explain without going into horrible amounts of detail, but different captains are better at some strategies than others; lots to explore.b) Perks: each character starts with 2 perks and gets at least 2 more during level-ups (choice between 2 different perk groups for each character). You can also gain them during exploration and from equipping trinkets.Perks give you more options during exploration (e.g., with enough Archeology you get might get unique options when exploring a pyramid, or with enough Athlete perks maybe you can do some crazy stuff when running from natives across a bridge).Perks give you bonuses on the 'adventure wheel'--a %-based spin that resolves various non-combat encounters. (Different perk ""groups"" give bonuses, and specific perks can too. E.g., if you have 5 ""naturalist"" perks, maybe you get a big bonus on identifying some new species of animal you find, giving bonus research. If one of those perks is 'biology', maybe you get a separate, additional bonus.)Perks also give combat stats.c) AttacksEach character starts with 3 regular ""attacks"": A physical attack of some sort, a deceitful talking action, and a friendly talking action.All of these damage enemy ""spirit"". (And the friendly one can be used on allies too, will heal them.)The talking attacks generally inflict a status too: saddened, excited, etc. (These give bonuses or penalties to combat stats.)It can be really interesting if you are trying to be friendly; you may end up buffing the enemy! Careful...Each character also unlocks 2 unique attacks as they level up (AoE, line attacks, single target, and all sorts of other stuff).d) Equipment: Each character can equip a trinket (perks, resists), offense item (offensive combat stats, maybe buffs too), defensive item (defensive stats).e) Special things. Sometimes you may get a permanent non-perk thingie that stays with the character either for the rest of the current expedition (each game is 5 expeditions) or for the rest of the game.The different classes of character have typical perk groups they unlock and typical types of builds. (E.g., scouts tend to be glass cannon with long range attacks and quick thinking/rogueish perks. Fighters tend to be melee with athletic or tactical perks.)Utilizing different combinations of characters is fun--it can play very differently.3) CombatSo there are 3 different flavors of attack: “aggressive”, “deceitful”, and “friendly”They interact in different ways depending on the overall mood of the fight. (9 total combos. E.g., if enemy is aggressive, it is ok for you to be aggressive (small bonus) or deceitful (bigger bonus), but if you are friendly you get a debuff.)Each of the 9 combos has a different threshold for changing, and changes when enough abilities of a different flavor are used. (E.g., when both sides are ‘friendly’, using a single aggressive ability will change the mood. But when both sides are aggressive, it takes a lot of friendly abilities to change the mood.)Further, you can have specific abilities, items, artifacts, research, or other stuff that gives bonuses or penalties when in a certain mood.There are buffs and debuffs; deceitful talking abilities can give Enraged, Saddened, Terrified (all of which give different penalties, and also can have interactions with items & other abilities/research/etc), and friendly can give mostly buffs (and one debuff): Confident, Excited, and I forget what the debuff is called (makes you more vulnerable to speech attacks).Each character has an attack rating, a speech rating, armor, and speech defense. (And ‘grit’, which dodges all attack types.)So on top of all that, the way you win a combat also matters. If you mostly used one ability type, that is how the combat will resolve. (E.g., mostly used friendly abilities.)This affects what bonuses you get (if any)--different abilities, research unlocks, and the specifics of the encounter can all affect what the bonuses are for different combat endings.Further, your overall reputation is affected by how you typically resolve combats, and this overall reputation can affect how things go when you run into people during your explorations.4) [Expedition] Resource management & exploration: Don’t run out of food or resolve (lives).You can trade resolve for stuff sometimes, but probably shouldn’t. If you run out of food you start getting horrible penalties (like -40% to your attack stat, or to a defense stat).You have to balance how hard you think an encounter will be (and what type of challenges your team is able to overcome) with gaining resources. You want as many resources as you can, but if you have no scientist on your team (there are 4 classes and only 3 characters per team…) then you should probably avoid challenges that will require naturalist/engineer/archeologist perks (though engineer & archeologist can be gotten a bit from other classes).(There are 4 challenge categories, each corresponding to different groups of perks; you can see what challenges there are at a node before you go there.)You can base a strategy around buffing up the resources you gain for overcoming certain types of challenges, then seeking those out. All sorts of stuff you can try :).Anyway, the game is fun and challenging. You should give it a shot.BTW, as to the cons in the most helpful negative review: - Adventurer wheel screwing you over: You have a ton of control over this.  a) Avoid nodes where you know your perks don't line up with the challenge type  b) Unlock tools in the preparation research tree (gives a big boost to your % chance to get through)  c) Choose perks wisely, equip trinkets to fill in some gaps(BTW, adventure wheel is essentially a %-based way of resolving non-combat stuff. You get a base % chance modified by perks and various other things.) - Boss fights: they can be very difficult if you aren't prepared. But once you know what you are doing I think they are challenging but not unfair/impossible. - Lack of content: Yeah there aren't that many islands yet. But there are so many different events... I'm 8 hours in and I've barely scratched the surface I think. I could replay this a ton.AND they are planning to release more content.I usually buy a game and give it a 2 hour shot, then give it a hard look for whether to refund or not. I hit the 2 hour mark and knew there was no way I could refund this.Give it a shot, its worth the try.			"

												Beating up natives by complimenting them or telling them they have dirty underwear or even just straight smacking them with a taser or oar. What's more to want?It's a roguelike elements with options to turn them off if you are a pansy like that. It's got a large group of characters to form a party of 3 with,giving you plenty of options to form synergistic exploration teams. You steal cultural treasure to give to London where they belong. There are loads of treasures to find and loads of achievements to unlock. Each play through is unique enough to kkeep it fresh. There is a delightful measure of strategy in the fights and just enough random luck to keep you on your toes both inside and outside combat. It's a great game with some fun writing and settings. Its lighthearted and silly. Each game isnt too long,maybe 2-3 hours from start to finish which makes it great for a pick up and play kind of game.I'm loving it as my new squeeze when i have free time.If you love light turn-based strategy games with a splash of resource management and just enough randomness {in maps,events,etc} to keep it fresh then you'll love this game. Unless you just had your cultural artifact stolen by some foreign devils. Which by all means....still get this game and do it to other tribes and cultures the world over.			"

												A charming, challenging and innovative strategy game that depends a bit on luck, but has enough depth to encourage multiple playthroughs.Stand Out Feature: A rock/paper/scissors combat mechanic which causes moves (both yours and your opponents) to set a ""tone"" for the encounter, which in turn will setup future moves to become more or less powerful.  In conjunction with being able to design your party fairly freely (either maximized to exploit one of these tones, balanced to handle whatever the enemy throws at you, or anywhere in between those two extremes), this encourages experimentation during combat and creates scenarios in which careful considerations must be made.  In addition to tones, both players and opponents might be put into certain moods by moves used upon them (Excited, Furious, Sadness, etc) which function as a conditional status effect that makes certain moves more or less powerful, adding more calcuations into the decision making process during the player's turn.Pros: Endearing art style.  Multiple challenge tiers to provide a tailored difficulty.  A large enough cast of characters (all with their own individual skillsets and level paths) and scenarios to choose from to foster replayability.  Cons: Animations become repetitive quickly.  Many non-combat encounters resolved by a % die roll that's not always clearly defined stat wise and will heavily influence your success or failure regarding the overarching goal.Would Recommend To: Anyone whose a fan of turn based strategy games.  Anyone bored of traditional turn based strategy games looking for a twist on the formula.  Lovers of indie games with solid production value or good price/gameplay content ratios.			"

												This game is thouroughly enjoyable for the fans of an FTL-like experience. The game is similar in format, provides interesting turn-based combat with a rock-paper-scissors style combat system, interesting map layout that allows for tactical exploration, simple and effective RPG elements that allow for characters to develop throughout the story, and lastly a very fair random outcome generator that makes the game enjoyable from begining to end. I failed the first 3 times playing the game, but in my fourth playthrough, I not only succeeded, but continued to play after the initial campaing was over to complete all the remaining maps, each providing a respectable challenge along the way. 10/10 would play again.

												I had something written out before, but it got lost in the shuffle. Rewriting it now, just shows how much I think of this game :PThe game plays out a lot like FTL with your characters moving through nodes and finding encounters or just picking up the various resources you can use to upgrade things in between expeditions. I find this much more engaging than FTL however as the encounters that you'll find aren't simply based on the roll of a die, but have a Fallout New Vegas style chance to succeed that depends on your party members skills and ability scores adding a bit of depth to how you choose and level up your characters. The types of encounters are widely varied and you probably won't see them all within a couple playthroughs. At 11 hours I still haven't beaten a few of the levels and even within the levels I can breeze through there's still some secrets I haven't been able to figure out (whats the gargoyle statue for o_O) Combat has been mentioned a lot, with a lot of notice given to its presentation. Basically there are 2 types of attack (Speech/Attack) that are in turn seperated into 3 Attack styles (Speech = Friendly/Devious and Attack) The 3 styles have a rock paper scissor effect on each other in that if you're consistently using a style that beats the opponents style you get a global buff or a debuff if you're on the losing side. Neutral means a buff to the winning style although I've not yet seen opponents take advantage of this. Additionally the way you win battles will give different rewards and potentially different outcomes. Attacks also have the ability to buff and debuff your opponents in various ways and I think that' s the general meat of the combat strategy. Overall its a pretty simple system which actually works to the games favor as it keeps the game flowing as combat encounters are just part of the general exploration ecosystem.A couple of nitpicks that I have with the game, visually I love the animations and graphical style. In most cases. In some places its oddly old style flash looking with flat colors and overly simplistic layout like the title screen. The lack of polish extends to other places like when you finish an expedition and you count your rewards, skipping ahead will cause it to pause for a long while, and some of the character suggestions are strange. Like Hildegard being suggested for Friendly and Aggressive despite have no attack skills and a poor regular attack. One larger one is that the combat system has the aforementioned buff debuffs attached to attacks, but enemies can be IMMUNE a buff or debuff and take no dmg from the attack. This can render a char ineffective in whats usually the effective strat. You can still go neutral, but it seems like a weird thing to have. Overall: I find this game reallllllly compelling. like, I should be studying for finals but I'm not, compelling.			"

												So I've edited my original review. Originally, I lfelt like it wasn't a full game yet. There are still somethings I'd like to see fixed, but most of what bothred me about the game initially is fixed, and it's a lot of fun.I'd still love to see an option to have it auto-end a turn when you have no more possible actions. Not only does this feel like a time waster, when you realize you need to hit the end turn button, or when you hit it, but because the mood of the battle changed, it didn’t read the input and you have to hit it again, but everyone and then you think you’re done and you skip over someone who still could have acted a moment to late. The latter hasn’t happened to me often, but there are some issues in how the encounters are drawn that can lead to it. First off, everyone and then I’ve lost a character behind a bush or a tree, this is especially bad if the character has been knocked out, and you are trying to find them to revive them, but there is a blurriness to encounters that sometimes makes it hard to tell on the characters that don’t have vibrant colors if they have acted or not.There are a few other interface issues that also make the game frustrating. The arrow that shows you when your character has leveled up isn’t that noticeable, especially with all the other buffs and debuts that sometimes show near the portrait. If you don’t notice before you move to a new location, you can no longer level the character until after that encounter. Also, I was almost 20 hours into the game before I noticed the very subtile tool icon, that allows you to use tools to help your chances on skill tests.It would also be nice if you got to carry over something from a previous game. As it is, you do unlock the option to make more and more of the characters ‘Captains’ which give you various bonuses,  but you get nothing for doing better on one game than another. If you could maybe choose one treasure to carry over with you, that would be great. Especially since the treasures are slightly randomized, and so sometimes you get a treasure that would benefit a Tactician, but if you didn’t create your crew with one, you can never take advantage of it. It would be lots of fun if you got a treasure that your current crew couldn’t use, but you could keep, and then design your next crew around it. But aside from those nitpicks it’s a lot of fun. The characters are great. You have 20 to choose from, and they are extremely diverse. The characters come from all over the world and they each have a flavor to them that makes them exciting. They all feel like they really do have personalities, and in fact, in certain encounters you will suddenly discover that one of your crew has a ‘hidden’ characteristic like being vain or a glutton, that changes your options. The battle, or encounter animations are great. I love that two out of the three play styles are based around talking not fighting, and they’ve put some real thought into it. It’s more complex than a simple rock paper scissors mechanic. For instance if both sides in a battle are friendly, there is a huge bonus to being the first to physically attack. However, actual attacks swing the encounter radically towards the aggressive side, and if you had been hoping for a friendly resolution, you’re going to have to do a lot of work to make up for whoever did the attack. That means that if you’re trying to play friendly, it’s beneficial to keep playing friendly. However, more aggressive groups can sometimes get a one time big bonus by pretending to be friendly and then attacking.			"

I still really like stories 4. I'm more devious, than friendly or aggressive5. I don't care about the money, give me the status and research! 6.

												Fun rogue like adventure game with a interesting combat system.  Good storytelling and interesting characters to choose from.  Graphics are fun indy style, with good combat animation.  Music isn't worth mentioning, I forgot it existed a number of times, but I was listening with low volumn on so that may be my fault.  Character  balance is hit or miss and it can be fairly tricky to understand what characters will be super effective and which will be duds.On the negative side this is not quite a rogue like you won't get through the 2nd playthrough without getting repeat events and by the third or fourth that's all that you'll see.  This game would benefit greatly from user created content but as they seem to only want new content from their DLC that's a major weakness.  Also the classic hard mode ""the way the game is meant to be played"" is punishing and not in a good way, in a any mis step after the 2nd mission in combat mode will end your adventure, and as this is randomized turn based combat, you can just get unlucky with enemy placement and get into near immpossible situations.  Overall though I still do recomend this game, it is fun, just doesn't live up to the potential I feel it has with some more polish and the ability for users to generate their own content.			"

												This game has a very fresh design with a real sense of ""gentlemen on adventures"". Easy to understand and go through thanks to a great tutorial and UI, but very rich and deep in tactics. Sadly the game is insanely hard even in the easiest difficulty mode so it's not something you'll be able to handle has a newcomer to the genre			"

												A very enjoyable fun little game.  The only problem is ""little"" - just when I think the game is building to a crusendo and characters are starting to really evolve - the game ends!  It relies on you wanting to go back and keep unlocking characters and cards - which I will do....  because it is FUN.  Will have to try the More to Explore DLC...			"

												Not into turn based RPGs, but this game was different enough and has enough of a strategy bent to get you hooked. I love the idea of using emotional warfare, that combined with the graphical polish and playful sense of fun and humour makes it very worthwhile.			"

												Fun rogue like adventure game with a interesting combat system.  Good storytelling and interesting characters to choose from.  Graphics are fun indy style, with good combat animation.  Music isn't worth mentioning, I forgot it existed a number of times, but I was listening with low volumn on so that may be my fault.  Character  balance is hit or miss and it can be fairly tricky to understand what characters will be super effective and which will be duds.On the negative side this is not quite a rogue like you won't get through the 2nd playthrough without getting repeat events and by the third or fourth that's all that you'll see.  This game would benefit greatly from user created content but as they seem to only want new content from their DLC that's a major weakness.  Also the classic hard mode ""the way the game is meant to be played"" is punishing and not in a good way, in a any mis step after the 2nd mission in combat mode will end your adventure, and as this is randomized turn based combat, you can just get unlucky with enemy placement and get into near immpossible situations.  Overall though I still do recomend this game, it is fun, just doesn't live up to the potential I feel it has with some more polish and the ability for users to generate their own content.			"

												RE:IS takes a simple idea that is feels similar to many other TBS games, and elevates it to a new level. Playing the game once through is quite short, only a few hours if you try to do as much as you can. What makes RE:IS so interesting however is its replayability. Each play-though can be done with different characters, each with their own personality quirks, and the maps will change with every new game. This means that there is a good deal of randomness which takes each short play-through and turns it into a springboard to enhance your subsequent play-through. Each character is quite fun to learn how they act and what their strengths and weaknesses are and this only enhances the play-through, seeing how different pairings lead to better, or worse, teams.

												This is a chill, low-key solo game,  It's very friendly for those who like doing something else while they play. You can pause and resume pretty much whenever you want. So it's very low investment in terms of time. The theme plays really well with the roguelike format. The graphics/animation are really nice. There is a lot of depth, but if you don't care, you can just play with turning your brain off. There are a lot of decisions to make, and while luck does factor, it never feels like you lose/succeed because of luck. Highly recommend. "

												Renowned Explorers is a great little game. The stories are cute and fun, and the veriety of characters means no two games are quite the same. The blending of roguelike and rpg elements can get a little frusterating from time to time, but the fun and charm of the game really overpowers any flaws.			"

Note: This review was written 26/4 2017 CET. However, Steam, for some reason, shows the date of my original review which was deleted due to personal quality control. I just wanted to mention this to clear up any potential confusion.International WaifusA Review by Foruke-SamaStats at the Time of ReviewingHours on record: 53,7Achievement progress: 112/148 (76 %)SummaryDespite a somewhat lacking variety in combat skills, Renowned Explorers: International Society manages to keep encounters tactical and enjoyable, the explorations and choices in between, and the art style, only adding to that. With multiple reasons to replay again and again, the title is well worthy of your attention and, in my humble opinion, a must-buy for fans of the genre.The BadCombat variety suffers from explorers sharing cooldown-based skill sets. These skills are the ones making the greatest difference in how a character is used during encounters. The fact that both Harry and Hatice, for example, learn Piercing Shot and Focus as their cooldown-based abilities means that they act in an incredibly similar fashion during encounters, even though their basic skills differ. This is no deal-breaker, but it does make encounters more repetitive when you've done a larger amount of runs.The GoodThe focus on buffs/debuffs with massive effects means that your actions during encounters bear more weight. The overall mood along with characters' emotions and unique skill- and character-based debuffs can be combined for devastating results, by you if you play well, by your opponent if you don't. This helps make encounters feel much more tactical and rewarding.While moving forward, node to node à la FTL, you actually get information about what kind of things you will have to deal with when moving to your chosen destination instead of just blindly moving forward hoping for the best. This allows you to make tactical, calculated desicions while on the move, giving you the opportunity to figure out which nodes would give you the greatest chance of success, emphasising the idea that it is your fault when things go badly, which leads to the domain of RNG growing smaller compared to other games in the genre.In between expeditions, you get to spend your limited resources to tweak and upgrade your crew. Much like in combat, each decision makes a big difference due to your 5-expedition-limit and precious resources gathered, granting the title a greater degree of tactical choice and planning.Community challenges, well-crafted achievements and general rogue-lite replayability make sure that the title can endure a huge amount of playthroughs for those interested.The VerdictRenowned Explorers: International Society provides tactical, enjoyable gameplay; the charming art style and animations add to that to grant the player a positively unique experience that houses the potential to entertain the player for hundreds of hours. Fans of Rogue-lites and tactical games, your money is safely spent on this title.			"

												It's a game that seems so simple, but the depth is amazing. I thought this would be a casual, 12 hour game, but two years later I am still going back to it. Some of that is due to the amazing community and the weekly challenges, and some is also due to the game getting two things exactly right: the tone and the balance. The game is light and fun, yet challenging, which is apparently difficult to pull off, since the other games I own rarely achieve it. Repeat playthroughs are a must. I recommend this game to my friends, but it's a hard sell for some reason. I'm here to tell you: buy ths game. Would that there were more like it out there.			"
