												One of the best games ever. Like masturbating with a woman. 10/10 ---If you play with Windows 7 x64x32 or Win 8/8.1 x64x32, you <<have to>> patch from 1.5 to Version 1.7, <<and>> add this two Lines to the config File:(Start the game at least one time before searching for the ini. It will create itself after the first start of the game)My Documents\My Games\Fallout3\Fallout3.ini----------------------------------------------------------------Find: bUseThreadedAI=0Change it to: bUseThreadedAI=1add below (new line):iNumHWThreads=2----------------------------------------------------------------If you do so, you should have no freezing problems.__________________________________________Pls lilke this review, if you think everybody should enjoy this awsome game. Because i read plenty of negative reviews, complaining about freezing and crashing. but it´s very easy to fix!Eines der besten Spiele je Produziert. 10/10 ----Wenn du mit Windows 7 x64x32 oder Win 8/8.1 x64x32 spielst, musst du von der Version 1.5 auf 1.7  upgraden (Link in den Kommentaren), und füge diese zwei Linien zur Konfig hinzu:(Einmal das Spiel starten.

												Note: ""hours played"" is not shown correctly, since I played on windows 8. And therefor had to make som alterations to make this game work.If you play on windows 8: 1) when you start the launcher, pick tech support and search for Windows 8. Follow all the steps as it is mention in support page. Yo can also just search for it in your browser.2) If you now start the game, and get error ""Ordinal 42 could not be located"" you have to download some extra files. Steamcommunity has an great guide for it. https://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/864961175577058035/I've played this game many times on both pc and ps3 since it's release in 2008. And bought this game on steam for nostalgic reasons. When it comes to RPGs this is one of my favorites of all time. And Fallout3 also has the best dlc packs I've ever seen for a game. This game is highly recommended :)			"

Great game for the age! But for some it does not work. Here is a way to fix the game1. Run the game atleast once2. Go To Library-->Fallout 3-->Press Properties-->Local Files-->Browse Local Files-->fallout 3-->Fallout 3.ini3. Press ""Ctrl+F"" type (without quotation marks) ""bUseThreadedAI""-If the game has been started it should already be a line named ""bUseThreadedAI=0"", change the 0 to 1.If the line isn't there, add it in the in the .ini folder. Anywhere is fine as long it      has its own line.4. This is maybe not needed, it works without it for me.   -(This next line shouldn't be in your file already but do a quick Ctrl+F to make sure, if it is change    it accordingly)-Directly underneath ""bUseThreadedAI=1"", write ""iNumHWThreads=2"". If it's already there, just change whatever value it is to ""2"".Save & Exit¨For 144hz users.Keep the screen settings at a maximum of 60Hz and you should be fine. This prevents stuttering, and prevents the physics engine to spasm out.			"

												I drank water from toilet to increase health. 10/10 would buy again.EDIT: Wow, I didn't realise that this ""review"" had got so much attention o_O. Allright, since I've played this game for nearly 600 hours, I'll give you a serious recommendation.If you're a fan of The Elder Scrolls series like me, you'll love it. Fallout 3 is kinda similar to TES IV: Oblivion in many aspects. Don't expect a fast-paced shooting gallery because combat's the weakest spot in the game. Fallout 3 is all abount exploration, moral choices and immersing yourself into the world. Walking lonely with your dog like two little dots in the Capital Wasteland, crawling in the dark while exploring an abandon Vault, punching a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in his face because he annoyed your girl, blowing up a city to become an evil based... are just some small things among thousands of insane♥♥♥♥♥♥you can do in this game.What I love most about Fallout 3 is the dark atmosphere. In this game, you really feel like you're in a dead world. You rarely find a house that's not completely ruined, you will meet many kinds of people, from poor citizen who can't protect themselves from Mutants to cannibals and slave traders. The diversity is undeniable, the world is beautifully crafted in a dark and heavy tone. Fallout 3 sometimes doesn't take itself seriously, it's the result from a script filled with black-comedy, from story, dialogues to the ridiculous amount of gore. Fallout 3 is an over-the-top game, but it still managed to maintain both dark tone and comedic writing.Combat is... well, not so much things to say. You can find bazilion of weapons, from a small pistol, sub-machine gun to things that can blow up a god damn building like a rocket launcher called Fat Man, a holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's-on-fire machete with a name that I can't spell properly and a gun that can shoot junks you put in called Rock-It-Launcher (I wished it allowed me to put someone's head in it). However, the impressive amount of weapons can't prevent the combat system from being dull. 3rd person camera works better than it does in Oblivion, but I found it a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to use it in combat so I recommend sticking with 1st person camera. This game has a turn-based system called V.A.T.S. In the first Fallout games, this point counts the actions that player can use, from moving to using your weapon. In Fallout 3, this system serves as an aimbot helping you ""mark"" enemy's parts of their body (it has percentages, so don't expect to get 100% YOLOSWAG420). The problem is, VATS can be abuse, you can shoot an enemy, run back, wait for it to regenerate and bam, get back to the warzone. The mechanic of this system is a little bit weird and I'm not sure if it's a positive or negative point.Shooting people isn't something special, you met a bunch of bandits ? Keep the distance and shoot them. You found a big ♥♥♥♥ing bear ? Keep the distance and shoot him. You met 10 Enclave soldiers ? Keep the distance and shoot them. You met a mother♥♥♥♥ing Deathclaw ? Keep the distance and shoot him. Combat is kinda dull, repetitive and it only feels decent if you manage to find creative ways to punish enemies, like putting a grenade inside a bandit's pants and see him explode or firing a flamethrower while sneaking behind an Enclave soldier.Graphics looks kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by today's standard, but you can always find some enhancing mods so that's not a big trouble.My conclusion: After 580 hours in this game, I had a very good time immersing myself in a dark, dead wasteland. Combat is dull, karma system doesn't make sense sometimes, but other aspects has hidden those shortcomings perfectly. I'm not a Fallout hardcore fan, but now I want to be. 9/10. AND GOD DAMN IT BETHESDA, RELEASE FALLOUT 4 ALREADY!!!.P/S: It works fine on Windows 7, at least for me.			"

												Probably one of my favourite games of all time. Stepping out of the vault into the harsh sun drenched wasteland is a moment in my gaming history that I will never quite forget. The thrill of seeing this open world stretching off to the horizon, knowing that adventure awaited me, left me almost awe struck.The game itself is a totally open game where you can chose your own path in a Post Apocalyptic hell hole. Will you be a heroic saviour of mankind, or a vicious survivor who does what is needed to survive? It is completely up to you. On your way you will meet a mix of people, some evil, some less so, and others .. well let's just say the wasteland produces a lot of strange characters. A great game, but made even greater by the modding community that has been built up around it. This is one of those games I highly recommend modding pretty much immediately. And if you have any worries about doing so, check out my tutorials for modding this game: 


YouTube™ Video: Modding Fallout 3 - Part 1 : Getting Started with FWE and Marts Mutant Mod 

			Views: 440,686		

			This video is aimed at people new to modding Fallout 3 or people who have been reluctant to install mods because they felt it was a little too complicated.		

Be warned however that this game is old, and will need quite a lot of tweaking to get working on Windows 7 or later. If you also own Fallout: New Vegas, I would actually recommend using the Tales of Two Wastelands mod to play the Fallout 3 story using the Fallout: New Vegas engine, which is far more stable and works fine on Windows 7. I have no tutorial on this mod yet, but when I do, I will update this review.IMPORTANT: I have played this game for several hundred hours, but not on this account, and most with certain mods installed that stop Steam from knowing that I was playing.

												Excellent game.100% working on my Windows 8 64-bit system.Only limitation is impossibility to recover back after keys Alt + Tab.Note: there is no Steam achievements.Step 1 obligatoryStart Fallout, click Play, push the escape key and Quit.It will validate your game, detect your graphics card and create a fallout.ini.=======================Step 2 if neededIF CRASHING WHEN CLICKING ""PLAY""Fallout 3 has an error that says ""Ordinal 42 could not be found in the Dynamic Link Library"" or something related to ""Xlive.dll"".This error message comes up when you do not have Games for Windows Live installed on your computer. You can download that client here: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/pc/DownloadClient Note, you will not be able to make any other use of the service at this time. If that doesn't work, click ""options"" and set your resolution to your desktop res, or try windowed mode.======================Step 3 if needed (I did not needed it)As Fallout 3 was created prior to the release of Windows 7 and 8, it is not tested or supported on either of these newer operating systems. There are, however, a few workarounds that players can use to run the game.First, you may be able to run it using compatibility mode. To change compatibility settings for Fallout 3:1.Locate the application file for the game. This can be found in one of the following folders depending on which version of the game you use: ◦Retail versions: C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3 ◦Steam versions: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Common\Fallout 32.Right-click on the application file and select Properties.3.Click on the Compatibility tab.4.Check the box Run this program in compatibility mode.5.Choose Windows XP Service Pack 3 from the drop-down.6.It may also be necessary to check the box for Run this program as an administrator.7.Repeat steps 2-6 for the Fallout 3 launcher file in the same folder. It is labeled: FalloutLauncher8.Run the game.======================Step 3 importantFallout 3 was not developed for use on PCs with more than two cores. If your PC has more than two cores, please try the following steps:1.Open your My Documents folder.2.Under My Games, open the Fallout 3 folder and select the fallout.ini file.3.In the fallout.ini file, find the following line: bUseThreadedAI=04.Change this line to read: bUseThreadedAI=15.Add another line after it that reads: iNumHWThreads=26.Run the game.======================Step 4 Optional but strongly recommended!Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch TONS of bug fixes. It would take dozens of pages to list them all.* The site registration for Nexus is free and quick.Patch v1.8 (1 November 2014)http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19122/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F2Fwww.nexusmods.com2Ffallout3%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D19122&pUp=1 "

												Imagine yourself in a world that consists of daily routine and hard work. A small room for your house and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for your neighbors. You dont know what lies beyond the safety of… The Vault. Fallout 3 takes you on a never seen before adventure in a videogame that still shocks and awes people today. With one of the largest maps in a videogame and 5 DLC’s, fallout 3 brings the post-apocalyptic future, from books and movies to life where you are the main character. with 100’s of quests and people, Fallout 3 is an amazingly fun game to explore.	It takes place in the post-apocalyptic washington D.C. which has 100’s of streets and even more metro tunnels. With everything from compounds to abandon buildings, you will come across everything from raiders to town dwellers to the enclave and more!Ok, now for the numbers:Graphics: 7.5/10 This is not concerning although because of new mods coming out daily for new experiences.Controls: (Pc) 7/10 and (xbox controller) 10/10. Buy a controller for this game, it is worth it.Handling: 9/10. A very smooth game.Story: 8/10. Story ha its moments and It's just ok. But the side quests where very good and a few DLC's where amazing like Mothership Zeta.Gameplay: 8/10. Falls short a bit compared to the rest of the game but it still has great moments, especially in the DLC’s.Creativity: 8/10. Never done before… in a videogame.Price: 10+/10. $20 in DLC with the game for only $20 full price. I have over 300 hours on this game and still i got it for $5 on sale!!! DO NOT TURN AWAY BECAUSE OF THE PRICE!!!Hype: 10/10. Enough said.Overall: 9/10. BUY BUY BUY!			"

												This game is like a girlfriend.You meet, fall in love and have a blast when you spend time with her, especially when your exploring dark subway tunnels, if you know what i mean. She looks gorgeous all of the time and always does her best to keep you entertained for hours and hours and hours on end, she has a really nice and amazing futuristic 1950's style to her that no one could hate and she has some really good taste in music too!Sure, she has a few issues, she takes her time getting ready and sometimes when she is getting ready she will just stop getting ready and go to sleep until you wake her up again. She wont even talk to you or respond to you in anyway if you own a Windows 7 operating system but that can be fixed easily, you just have to convince her that its not all bad and then she will come around!If you break up with her, you will always find yourself coming back to her and she wont even judge you, she will act like she always did before you split up with her, and everytime you do come back the experience you have with her again is amazing and diffirent to the last timeBuy this game, its an experience you will never forget!

												I found a dog in the middle of junkyard and it started to follow me. I took that dog everywhere and we became best buddies. One day, I got into a nasty firefight and was worried for my newfound friend so, I yelled at him to run away. I survived the firefight, with the help of a few dozen stimpaks, and I returned to Vault 101 in search of my dog.I returned to the Vault and didn't see a sign of my friend. I was worried and waited for hours on end. He was nowhere to be found. I was so worried. Sadly, this story doesn't end well. I never saw the dog again and I know that somewhere in the Wasteland lies a dead dog. Knowing this, I began to cry.10/10 for making me feel for a digital dog			"

There are so many aspects of it that make it a very fun rpg/shooter game, but with an awesome storyline that makes you feel like you are the character you are playing. You get sucked into the game and it feels so real. The option to choose to do right from wrong makes it very fun and almost makes you want to play the game from both sides to see what would happen. You must give this game a try. I know you'll enjoy it!			"

In Fallout 3 you're given so much freedom in what to do such as being a good guy or bad guy, slicing up a person or blasting them with a mini nuke. With so many options this game is worth buying and playing multiple times over. Some complain that there are too many bugs that make the game unplayable, but if you touch it up a bit maybe install a few mods to patch up the game you may find this as one of the greatest games ever made.

												How to get FO3 working on Windows 10. This worked for me (AMD FX-8350, Nvidia GTX780),  so I´ll share it with you.1. Download Games for Windows LIVE Disablerhttp://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/1086/?Just open the exe and select Disable G4WL.2. Go to C:\users\yourname\Documents\My Games\Fallout3\FALLOUT.iniOpen the file with NotepadFind bUseThreadedAI=0 and change it to bUseThreadedAI=1, immediately below it add a line with iNumHWThreads=2This should be enough for most of you. 3. If the game crashes at a new game, download this modified d3d9.dll.https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4rlGqEs-BxtcWdEdlh0TDM1SkkGo to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\ and paste it there.This dll makes FO3 think that you have a Nvidia 7900GS, so your graphic settings will be reset. Just adjust them to your liking again, most modern GPUs can run perfectly with the Ultra preset.Don´t forget to enable all the data files in the launcher. For some reason, the DLCs come disabled by default.Some screenshots:

I previously played on Xbox, and I haven`t really started a PC run.I wholly reccomend this to anyone wanting to play a game with great rpg, as this game is fun even five years after it`s original release. I strongly reccommend getting the DLC, as it adds a lot of content.

												Gameplay is excellent. I've heard some complaints about the combat but i thought it was great. The V.A.T.S gives you a really cool tactical shooter perspective.The Animations are a bit akward and theres no sprinting which should be ESSENTIAL because the world is so vast. This is nothing that mods couldn't fix. The leveling system is amazing in which you can choose which skills you want to master based on your playstyle.Visuals:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=441989686The visuals are alright. It's something you would expect since it was released in 2008. I thought the visuals were pretty good and nailed the vibe but looked a bit bland. I installed a few mods to fix this. If your computer can handle them i suggest modding the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game graphically.Audio:The audio of this game is AMAZING. The soundtrack fits right into the retro 50's post apocalyptic setting. Having the in game radio on at all times is a REQUIREMENT to fully enjoy this game.Environment:

The environment in this game is big but not huge. It's an open world game much like Skyrim is. The map is filled with sidequest you can do for awesome rewards like laser guns or awesome launchers that launch 6 nukes at a time and causes an a explosion so big it might crash your game and make GTX Titan Z's cry.Optimization:This game is not very well optimized for Windows 7,8. But there are solutions on the internet that will fix the game for the most part. During my 60 hours the game crashed about 11 times. around 7 of those were in one of the DLC's(Point Lookout) which is almost unplayable due to low framerate and crashing.Verdict:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=441062483This game is hands down one of the best games i have played and this a must buy for any video game fan. Even tho i put 60 hours into this i've barely scratched the surface since i have 3 full DLC's and their respective sidequest and half the sidequest in the main game to complete. After this i am definetly gonna definitely gonna pick up Fallout: New Vegas			"

ULTIMATE Fallout 3 Setup & Mod guide Windows 10, 8 & 7 
A Guide for Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition
By: BenWah

			The best setup guide for Fallout 3!		


I also recommend getting RH_Ironsights ( http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/6938/? ) and Realistic Wasteland Lighting ( http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20346/? ), even if you're doing a Vanilla run through. The Ironsights mod adds an essential feature that for some reason Bethesda did not put into the game (all you do is just pull the gun a little closer), and the RWL mod changes the weather and lighting to get rid of that awful green tinge on everything, and makes it look wayyy more realistic. You can get a lot more mods through the guide I showed you above.ACTUAL REVIEW:Fallout 3 was my first entry into the fallout franchise, as such it will always hold a special place in my heart. It's not perfect, but it's a damn enjoyable game. Arguably the best location of all the fallout games, some great exploration. The storytelling is good too, but if you start thinking about it, then it starts to make less sense (why does it look like the planet was nuked only 10 years ago when it's 200+ years later, why is every building full of tons of ammo and loot after so long, why not use Megaton's water purifier?). Mainly I blame this on poor writing on Bethesda, but overall it's still a good game, still miles better than Fallout 4.Another minor issue of mine is that every 5 minutes the capital wasteland just spawns a random event out of no where, and unrealistically scales the events to your level, but I guess that's to prevent us from being utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥while exploring.Overall: Fallout 3 is one of the best post-apocalyptic games out there. It actually feels like an apocalypse, and plus you can explore a bombed-out DC that has so many awesome places to look through. Some may say... DERR BUT FALLOUT 4 IS NEWER AND LOOKS BETTER HAS BETTER GUNPLAY. Looks can be decieving my friends, I too fell for the trap that was Fallout 4. Yes, the gunplay is better and the game looks cooler, but it suffers in literally everything else.If you're looking for your first fallout game, don't get fallout 4, get this one, then get New Vegas.

												I shot a guy in the chest with a .32 pistol......He exploded...-----------------------------------------------EDIT: ------------------------------------------------I thought this would be a good idea to publicize a fix (because somehow this got popular) for laptop and desktop Intel HD 2000-5000 series integrated graphics.If you are using a laptop with those graphics, grab this  d3d9.dll [www.dropbox.com] file. Then place that in the game directory. ( usually something like this : C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/SteamApps/common/Fallout 3 goty/ just place it in there)Possible fix for Win 8+ users, since Games For Windows Live was discontinued, Microsoft left GFWL out of the main Windows 8 (and newer) install and you will most likely get a Error 43. Just grab this  Installer [www.xbox.com] and install GFWL. (It's not just for Xbox 360, the download link is just there.)			"

												This is a great game from Bethdesda, it was the first I played in the series and it was a brilliant Survival Horror style First-Person Open-World Role-Playing Game. (SHFPSOWRPG).If you even remoteley enjoyed or found interest in games like Skyrim, Fallout: New Vegas or other titles from Bethdesda, this one is VERY MUCH WORTH IT. The narrative is great, the main story can be completed in about a few hours, but if you roam the world and try to explore, interact and enjoy it then it will take well over decades for you to finish it. If you ever manage to finish all the sidequests, storylines, locate all the places on the map, experience all the random events and meet all the intriguing characters and learn of stories in the past or present gameworld; then you can play the DLCs, Broken Steel, Operation: Anchorage, Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta. The DLCs accumulate up to even more hours of main quests, not to ignore the fact they add new locations and maybe even a whole new part of the game world.TL;DR: Get this game, it is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant you slacker.-Stario			"

												Ah, the good, somewhat old, Fallout 3. The best in the series, falling shortly behind Fallout 2, the god of such RPGs, in my opinion. If you care to put some time into optimizing the bugs and tweaking settings to make it run propely, this is a damn near perfect game by our beloved Bethesda. Expanding the universe of the already exciting post-nuclear America, we're shown what happens to the area surrounding Washington, D.C., called ""The Capital Wasteland"". A rather grimmy environment that is packed with creepy and eerie surroundings. There's not one moment in the wasteland where you can feel truly safe from the mole rats to the Deathclaws wanting to rip your head open with their giant fangs. Did I mention they're ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying?Gameplay has stayed somewhat true to its predecessors, you still have the V.A.T.S. system, but it's no longer turn-based, as you'd guess. The story is not the greatest, it has never been in the Fallout franchise, but what makes up for this is all the other stuff you can do in the Capital Wasteland. There's tons of different sidequests to do, multiple unique weapons and other stuff to collect, such as the bobbleheads - which increase your stats depending on which ones you pick up. The world is giant as you would expect, about 100+ locations to discover and, potentially, loot. Rating: 9/10			"

												Fallout 3... Where to start....This is the game that introduced me into RPG games.It was and will always be my favourite game.The interesting things in the games lore, the places, the people, the weapons. All so perfect. And the DLC makes it even more God Tier.I've played more than this steam review will say. I own it on Console and the retail disk copy and i am proud to own it again on steam.There is no way you can get bored in this game. If you run out of Quests. The modding community is there for you. So many possiblities and mods that make it amazing. This is the most amazing game i have played. Full stop. No recent games have even gotten near Fallout on my list. It's just so bloody perfect.Buy it if you don't have it. Get GOTY if you can. You won't regret it.Oh and for those who say they have problems with Windows 7. I use Windows 7. It's called Google and the Modding community. I suggest you actually look around a bit. I give it a strong 9.5/10.			"

												Overall: 10/10Probably my favorite game of all time, although I really liked Fallout: New Vegas for it's weapon and ammo variety I still preferred Fallout 3s' atmosphere, story and characters.Concept: 10/10You are born in an underground vault that's had no contact with the outside world for hundreds of years. Create your own unique character, male or female, and quickly escape to learn that the nuclear war from long ago has left a wasteland topside. With humanity struggling for survival, mutants occupying the DC ruins with a mysterious agenda, and the various irradiated creatures of the waste, the setting feels like ""Fallout"". Play how you want, investing in the skills you choose to develope your character to reflect your play style.Graphics: 8/10At the time the graphics were not bad, but not good either. I would give some leneincy to Bethesda however, considering how large and content rich their open world games are. Character models could be stiff as well, but I was able to overlook this because of the sheer variety of locations, items, people and creatures you interact with.Sound: 9/10One thing i'll always credit Bethesda for is having so much voiced dialogue. Every NPC has voiced dialogue despite their importance, greatly improving immersion. I was also impressed with the radio stations. Hours and hours of music and dialogue between several different radio stations made the long walks to new destinations less of a bore. As far as Audio effects go i'd say most were well done. Some guns didn't sound like they had enough ""bang"" to be realistic, but the energy weapons and melee sounds were entertaining.Playability: 9/10Amazingly customizable, even more so with mods. You can make your character look how you want, play how you want, and do what you want. Use the weapons and tactics you want to use. If you want to go off and explore 30 minutes into the game you can, and it's just as rewarding/interesting as following the main quest. I only knock a point off of this due to the many bugs/issues people had at the release of this game. While it's improved drastically, there is still the occasional crash, glitch, or corruption.Entertainment: 10/10There are literally hundreds of hours of fun to be had here. A lot of people complained about the main quest, but I found it to be interesting and more importantly, rewarding. The main quest however, is just a tiny piece of the games content. 90% of the entertainment can be found by just exploring on your own. The character customiztion enhances this, making a lot of interactions and situations unique to your character based on their skill set or decisions. Replayability: 10/10The amount of customization options and content ensure that no two playthroughs are the same. I've made half a dozen characters and still discover new things in this wasteland...			"

												Warning: Disliking this game is punishable by death.Methods of execution include getting beaten to death by drug-crazed raiders, blown apart by explosive weapons, turned into ash by one of the many laser weapons used here, and dying slowly and horribly from radiation poisoning. Fun! But all of these execution methods are, ultimately, better than becoming a communist. As Liberty Prime so eloquently puts it: better dead than red.Seriously though. Dislike this game and I will personally call a vertibird strike on your♥♥♥♥♥ You have been warned. o_OThe first Fallout game by Bethesda is noticeably different in tone from the old Fallout games, and particularly Fallout 2. This is one of the bleakest and most depressing games I've ever played, depicting a world that is in far worse shape than any other Fallout game where there are at least some signs of civilization returning. Here... everything is either dead or slowly dying as it is consumed by non-stop violence and pervasive radiation. How lovely. x_xThe most logical explanation for this, aside from the change in developer, is that whereas the previous Fallout games centered on the West Coast of the USA with only a few major cities (Los Angeles/The Boneyard in Fallout 1, San Francisco in Fallout 2) showing up in relatively small roles in the plot, Fallout 3 centers on Washington DC, the US capital (as well as Pittsburgh, PA in a DLC). A city that, in any nuclear war, would be a primary target for destruction, and that destruction is very much on display in a disturbing amount of detail. As someone who has visited DC three times in my life at the time of writing, the last of which occuring about a week after I first played this game (January 2009), strolling around the ruins of a place I have seen in the real world is really eerie. Almost every major landmark in DC can be visited in Fallout 3, except now they are all in various stages of ruin (The Washington Monument is more or less intact, while the White House is just a massive radioactive crater) and filled with ceaseless violence.If you have played Bethesda's other open-world RPG's like Oblivion or Skyrim, then you know how this plays: lots of quests and stuff to do, but mostly its about running around a huge world and seeing what you find. There are some glitches and crashes, so be sure to save often. GFWL is part of this, but you can tell that to bugger off pretty easily (and in fact you need to in order to use the best mods). Also while it might take a little work to get mods working, they are more than worth the effort. The superb mods for New Vegas and Skyrim found on the Nexus Network websites can be traced back to Fallout 3 mods, and many have the same creators (Fallout 3's FWE later became New Vegas' Project Nevada). In other words, this game has insane replay value by itself, and modding Fallout 3 can turn this into a game with virtually endless amounts of things to do.The GOTY version includes the five DLC's, which are a mixed bag of awesome, competence, and failure. Broken Steel is probably the best since it allows you to play after the end of the main story, along with the host of additional content it adds. The Pitt is a dark atmospheric journey into the industrial ruins of Pittsburgh filled with gray morality and disturbing choices. Point Lookout sends you into a similarly immersive swamp area with lots to explore and one of the most memorable (and by far the foulest-mouthed) characters in the Fallout series. But the other two DLC, Operation Anchorage's linear adventure into a simulation of a great battle before the apocalypse (It's ok) and Mothership Zeta's killing spree through an alien spaceship (ugh...), fall far below the other three in quality. Regardless, all of them add more to the game and give you plenty of new toys to use in the main game.I've heard this game has some issues with Win7 and newer operating systems, but I don't know anything about that since I'm still using the same PC I used when I first played this game so many years ago. I do believe there are fixes, but people with those newer OS's should look into them before buying this (or just get it on sale)Regardless of its bugs and other issues that keep it from being perfect, this is one of my favorite games of all time, and that's really all you need to know. Buy it. Play it. Like it. Or else I will call you a communist and point Libery Prime your way.Communism is the very definition of failure. :P			"

												Just to clarify with you, I have been playing Fallout 3 ever since I was ten years old (yes, a ten year old played this game). I remember begging my mom for it day after day ever since the first day it was released. When I saw that lunchbox (collector's edition) shaped present under my tree, I opened it instantaneously and saw my dream present. I ran up to my room, launched it on my Xbox 360, and experienced one of the best things I had ever seen/played in my life. I think that overall, I have accumulated over 1200 hours playing this one game, so now you know that I have some experience with it. Moving on to the review...*By the way, I wrote this review as a huge piece, but I decided to divide it up with headers if you want to learn about a specific aspect only.INTRO and CHARACTER CREATIONFallout 3 is set in a post-apocalyptic version of Washington, DC. You are a resident living in Vault 101, one of the many underground shelters built by a company named 'Vault-Tec' before the bombs dropped in America on October 23, 2077.  About 200 years later, the game starts you off with a thirty minute prologue. You begin right at birth where you create your character's appearance and eventually set his/her's S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes and your TAG skills. If you played the original Fallout or Wasteland games, you will be very familiar with the character creation system. Basically, you have 33 points to work around with that can be placed in Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck and you will excel or be weaker in certain areas depending on where you allocate these points. TAG skills on the other hand raise three of your skills by +15 to give you boosts in certain areas when you start off.PLOT/STORY and QUESTSIn the beginning of your life, everything is fairly normal in the vault. You are raised by your single-dad, James (voiced by Liam Neeson), and deal with the usual experiences of childhood such as birthday parties, friendships, bullies, and school. Once you reach the segment when you are nineteen years old (five segments at ages 0, 1, 10, 16, and 19), things start to go wild when your dad leaves Vault 101 without you. Naturally, you decide to escape the vault yourself to find dear old Dad and discover why he left and where you can find him. Along the way, you will run into extremely diverse characters ranging from a grizzled man who is the sheriff of a town centered on an undetonated atomic bomb, a ghoul-hating, deceptive old geezer who owns a refurbished hotel, a psychotic, Russian pimp who is willing to sell his women's ""services"" to anyone who has enough caps (currency), and even aliens. I won't say anything more about the plot, but in my opinion, Fallout 3 has a very personal main quest that will pull your heart strings on numerous occasions.Accompanied by the main quests are an insane amount of side quests that will lead you to the many interesting settlements across the Capital Wasteland. They range from simple assassination and extortion missions all the way to solving a crisis between two ""superheroes"" disrupting a town or managing a cannibal situation. Whenever you play Fallout 3, your quest tab in the Pip-Boy 3000 will always have at least something in it for you to complete and you will never be left empty handed - especially with the amazing mods out there (I will get into that later). USER INTERFACESpeaking of the Pip-Boy, it is your main user-interface while playing. With the press of a button, your status, karma, missions, map, items, notes, and radio will all be easily accessible to you. It is a great, clean interface that makes everything very manageble for the player.SOUNDTRACKOne thing that is easily overlooked with Fallout 3 is its incredible soundtrack. All of the music is from the early-mid 20th century and it perfectly fits the atmosphere of the game. Eventually, you will know many of the songs note for note and for some reason, I have not gotten tired of the music six years later. However, the ambient soundtrack is another huge strength for the game. When you are exploring the Capital Wasteland without the radio playing on your Pip-Boy, you will get to hear the creepy atmospheric music play in the background. It will build up the suspense in you and keep you always on the lookout for any nearby threats. The combat music is good too and it will make encounters feel more deadly and action-packed.GAMEPLAYAs for the gameplay, the shooting mechanics are ok, but not the best. There is no iron-sights capability without mods, so if you are playing this on console or without the Fallout Script Extender, FOSE for short, then you are going to have to aim with a tiny UI crosshair. This is a bad system, but it is managable due to slight auto-aim. I think that the auto-aim was added with the intention to correct this flaw, but once again it can be removed using mods (we are getting there :P) and it is not a big deal. There are a variety of guns in the game that range from the categories of small guns (pistols, rifles, etc.), big guns (miniguns, rocket launchers, FAT-MAN's, etc.), energy weapons (laser and plasma pistols and rifles), and explosives. Melee combat is basically the exact same as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion so if you liked it in that game, you will enjoy it in Fallout 3. You can go unarmed or use a bladed or blunt weapon.Weapons are not the only things to consider in Fallout 3. Secondary skills like repair, medicine, and speech all carry just as much weight as the combat skills. It is even possible to make characters that focus exclusively on non-combat skills and have hireable companions do all the killing for you. This is the beauty of the Fallout games, any character build can be viable as long as you do what is necessary to make it work.As you progress throughout the game your character gains xp by completing tasks like killing, discovering new locations, lockpicking, hacking, passing speech checks, completing quests, and more. When you reach the xp requirement to advance in level, you can allocate your skill points (amount of skill points determined by intelligence) to any of the thirteen skills accessible to you. This does not follow the ""practice makes perfect"" levelling module that The Elder Scrolls uses.MODSThis is the big one that you have been waiting for! The Fallout 3 nexus (fallout3.nexusmods.com) at this moment contains 13 526 files available to download for free to enhance your Fallout 3 experience, and the number grows daily. Just about anything can be tweaked or created by using the Garden of Eden Creation Kit, or G.E.C.K. for short, and can be uploaded to the nexus for others to try out. You have probably heard of mods that are commonly used like Fallout Wanderer's Edition, Energy Visuals Enhanced, RH_Ironsights, and Weapon Mod Kits, which can greatly add to the experience. These mods are excellent and add many things that should have been in the game to begin with. Just be warned, mods can cause instability with the game, save corruption, constant CTD's, and can be incompatibile with other mods. For your first playthrough I would highly recommend downloading strictly fixes and tweaks like the Updated Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch, the Fallout Stutter Remover, Fallout 3 - Enhanced Camera, the 4GB Patch, and texture mods. You could even download FWE, but I would 100% go to the preset options once you exit the vault in the FWE control panel and use the 'I Love Vanilla' preset to keep the original feel of the game. When you are done with your first playthrough of the vanilla game, go ahead and add in all the mods you want! Just make sure you know what you are doing and if you don't, follow Gopher's EXCEPTIONAL 'Fallout 3 Modding Guide' on Youtube.CONCLUSIONWar, War Never Changes... but in this case that's good.Follow this guide - http://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/828937546147175081/ "

TL;DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Fallout 3 is a first / third-person action role playing game that was made and published by Bethesda Studios in 2008.It is the third major sequel to the popular Fallout franchise featuring a whole new gameplay mechanic because, unlike its predecessors, it uses the first person / third-person type of gameplay reminiscent of the TES (The Elder Scrolls) series.PLOT (No Spoilers):The player takes on the role of a vault dweller in Vault 101. After his father leaves the vault for unknown reasons, the player escapes in search of him and discover the truth about the true purpose of the Vaults.As he steps out into the wasteland, he discovers that the world was not as dangerous as the other vault dwellers were made to believe. Sure it was still a sh** hole filled with dangerous monsters, raiders, fanatics, and mutants but it was not, as irradiated and inhospitable as he thought it was. This world was fully capable of supporting human life.Explore the so-called “Capital Wasteland” in search of your father and discover the wonders and the horrors that the nuclear apocalypse has brought.PROS:+ Good graphics for its time (8 years old at the time of this review);+ Vast open world with a lot of places to explore;+ Good story however...(see CON #1);+ Immersive and atmospheric game world;+ Easily moddable;+ Good adoption of the TES game mechanics;+ Solid gameplay;+ Massive amounts of side quests;+ Massive amounts of items to collect;+ Crafting mechanics;+ Good music, sound effects and voice acting;+ Lengthy game time;+ Cheap in price;+ Good DLC selection; and+ High replayability.CONS:- Very poor ending (not applicable if you have bought and installed the DLC 'Broken Steel' or the 'Game of the Year Edition' of the game);- Compatibility issues with later versions of Windows (7 and above); Fix- Compatibility issues with later CPUs (quad-core above); Fix- Low resolution textures even on high settings;- Poor level scaling for enemies which may turn the game boring after max level;- Poor enemy and companion AI;- Occasional physics glitches; and- No iron sights feature for the weapons.NEUTRAL:+/- Excellent radio music but limited in selection;+/- Game's difficulty is not that challenging, even on the highest difficulty;CONCLUSION:EXCELLENT GAME and a wonderful addition to the Fallout franchise. Fallout 3 delivers a wonderful RPG and first person experience that proves once and for all that solid game play mechanics and world building can stand the test of time.WORTH IT?Fallout 3 has a 'Game of the Year Edition' (GOTY) which costs $19.99 (or your regional equivalent) which is well worth the price. If you see it on a sale, then you may want to consider it as part of your RPG game collection.FINAL NOTES:The GOTY edition includes all the DLCs.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Decided to play the game with my spouse as my character, spawned into the Vault, and grew up.  I watched the place fall apart, fled, and found myself in a vast wasteland.  Ended up in a shack inhabited by a junkie with nothing but a BB gun to defend myself (my spouse) against the horrors of the wasteland.  Tried to take a gun that was laying around, not realizing that ""red"" meant ""stealing.""  The junkie started punching me, but she was so weak that I was able to shoot her to death with her own gun before she killed me.  Decided then that I was not a good person, killed and stole anything and everything in the wasteland...  until the slavers.  I found honest to god human slavery in the wasteland, was offered caps by the slavers to track down runaway slaves because of my hardass reputation.  I heard the slaves, humans in cages, pleading. It sunk in, my spouse would never stand for this.   It took nearly every chemical and every bullet I had on me, but I killed every slaver in that settlement and freed every slave that wasn't too scared to run once the shackles were loosed.  Discovering you're willing to shoot/beat a junkie to death to survive is not a quest, nor is destroying a hub of human slavery, but when you wander around the wasteland, you find our own quests woven between the echoes of the person you were and the person you are becoming.

												First of all, I've played Fallout 3 on Windows 7 from the start, and I'm playing it now with Windows 10 without any big issues. Sure, I've seen a crush or two... actually, maybe around of 5-6 crushes for all the time I've played the game (and it's more than 200 hours and about 8 years now). But, I've seen much worse from other, ""fully Win 10 compatible"" titles. Maybe I'm just lucky? Well, I have 3 PCs, and all of them are playing Fallout 3 just fine. Screenshots aren't working, though, and Windows keep sending me troubling messages every time I start the game... But that's not so bad, I think. Obviously, you can live without my screenshots. And most probably, you can run the game on your PC as well.What troubles me from the technical side - is not Bethesda, but the very Steam itself. For I've bought the GOTY version right here on Steam store, but for some reasons, it thinks what I didn't accomplished that. So I can click ""add to cart"" button, and only after that Steam will recognize the fact I already own the game. But if I'll start any search through Steam store, again, it will be thinking that I'm still not owning the game. So far, Steam can't fix that problem, and that's really annoying, especially when it tries to promote me the same stuff again and again.Finally, to the game itself! In the part of texts, speeches, quests, characters motivation and overall complexity - among all other things I cherish role-play games for - Fallout 3 isn't good enough. It's even quite bad at many moments actually... but with that, some moments are simply unforgettable, must-see things. Like the character generation and intro story, as an obvious example.Next, I'm quite unhappy with GUI - and especially with Pipboy and inventory management. It's even worse than in the vanilla Skyrim. With all that stuff you need to carry just to be able fix your gun and armor in the field. And with irritating encumbrance system in comparison with the amount of useful stuff, spreaded across ""Wastes""... It feels even worse than in the Diablo-like games, where you fight, loot, then sell the loot, and repeat the process. In such ""action-RPGs"" it is common now to have a companion which will be doing the trading part. But in the Fallout 3 universe, you'll be looting and walking overburdened across the wilderness way more often than doing something actually interesting, like solving quests and so on. And that's the burden of the most part of modern games with open world. There are much more uninspiring ""flags gathering"" than actual challenging adventuring stuff.On the other side of coin, with such big wastes, and the gross amounts of various interactive objects... Game designers made the whole game full of various eastern eggs and curious setouts all over the map. And that was really fun, exploring the wastes and discovering such installations.In the end, Fallout 3 is one of those ""take good with bad"" type of games. Where I don't like the storyline, the fighting part, the inventory, endless process of collecting stuff and gathering it at some storage.... And, with all that, turns out what I like some parts of the story (and some sidequests as well). I can even role-play and actually empathize with the protagonist - which is always very important. I like the feeling of the big and non-linear adventure, where I can really do quite alot, see many things... it would be quite clear to say that, while many things which made Faloot 1&2 legendary, were discarded by Bethesda... The size of what was done, is really helping the game to stay at the ""enjoyable"" zone. It is not a good successor of Fallout 2, but, it is still a game from Fallout universe. Just closer to a basic action, than to RPG.So, my mark is 7/10. Worth some time through while being quite questionable at some gamedev decisions.			"

Fallout 3 – Game of the Year Edition is a first-person open world post-apocalyptic RPG. After escaping from Vault 101, a subterranean nuclear fallout shelter you lived in all your life, you explore the post-nuclear war-torn wastelands of Washington DC while on the trace of your father's footsteps.Pros: 1st person perspective is a huge departure from the original Fallout games that add to the immersiveness. The game offers a very large world to explore, filled with bandits, super mutants, ghouls and radioactive creatures. I love the bottle caps as currency, although you're likely to mostly barter for ammos and equipment in exchange for the incredible amount of scraps and junk you can scavenge. There's a nice amount of guns to get your hands on, drugs (or chems) to give you boosts, and an assortment of food and medicine to keep your health up, most of which is irradiated which forces you to carefully manage your radiation poisoning. Quests are plentiful, and everywhere you go you'll have people asking for help in these hard times. The RPG elements consists of your basic attributes and trained skills, while leveling up allows you to train those skills and assign perk points to an increasing list of perk options, so that you may make your character just the way you want it. The VATS system allows you do precision targeting in fights, with VATS points just limited enough to avoid over use.Cons: The world design is not on par with modern post-apocalyptic setting: wastelands feel barren and empty, buildings look and feel repetitive, and the urban DC area is nothing but impassable walls of concrete rubble with only the occasional building you can actually get in. Graphics and character designs feel repetitive and didn't age well. Gameplay does include a third-person option, but it's basically the same as the first-person option except that you see your character's back. Getting started can discourage newcomers as the early game is much harder and players spend most of their time going back and forth carrying junk with their limited carrying capacity to barter for barely as much ammos as they spent getting their loot, assuming the few vendors even have any stock of ammos compatible with the guns you have.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youI'm threading lightly as not everyone will enjoy this game: it's not as lively as Fallout 4, not as deep as the Metro series, and doesn't have the personality of the Borderland series. If you're a classic Fallout fan looking for a modern take on the isometric cRPG style, you should probably be looking at Wasteland 2. Otherwise, this game and its DLCs will give you dozens upon dozens of hours of gameplay, so of course I recommend it!P.S.: Those experiencing compatibility issues can fix this through the use of Mods. Unfortunately, these are not supported by Steam and installing an external 3rd party Mod manager will prevent this game from running normally through Steam. If Star Wars | Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords can have Steam Workshop support added a decade after release, I see no reason or excuse for Bethesda not to do the same with their original take on the Fallout franchise.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												This is BY FAR my favorite game of all time.  My time on Steam pale's in comparison to the amount hours I've spent on my old PS3.  Only game I've completed 100% on.This game works perfectly, just don't alt-tab.To get it to stop crashing on Windows 7 follow these steps:-Download Fallout 3-Do NOT have Fallout 3 running during the next steps-Click on the Windows button in the lower left hand corner of your screen and seach ""FALLOUT"" (all caps)-Under ""Documents"", there's a file called FALLOUT, open it in Notepad-Use CtrlF to search for the line ""bUseThreadedAI""-It will be set equal to 0-Change ""bUseThreadedAI=0"" to ""bUseThreadedAI=1""-Add the line ""iNumHWThreads=2"" right under ""bUseThreadedAI=1""-Save the changes to the document FALLOUT-Close the document-Launch Fallout 3, and enjoyHope this helps someone out there.

****4 out of 5Expansive, awesome and beautiful. Fallout 3 is what RPGs aspire to. Featuring a long absence from the 90s classics Fallout 1 and 2, Bethesda Softworks brings back Fallout for a new generation. Awaking in an apocalyptic nightmare, your own hope to survive in this new world is to explore, upgrade and befriend or back-stab as many people as you can.Fallout 3 is a gorgeously realised game not only in its visuals, but the narrative, its atmosphere and the unremarkable but noticable human touches throughout.Fallout 3 is one to recommend, albeit you can find yourself wandering through a carbon copy of the same underground tunnel or factory at times, but that's nothing to greatly disservice such a great experience.

												Fallout 3 is simply one of those titles that every gamer, casual or hardcore, should have in their collection. This game suprised me with a sense of immersion that I hadn't ever had with a game previously. The story, graphics and gameplay is fantastic and throw in the fact that the PC version can be further enhanced to cater to your specific gameplay through modding and you have an absolute jem of a title here. This game, like many others of Bethesdas RPG's will give you many many hours of gameplay for the money. Extremely recommended!!!!			"

												Still an unoptimized relic that will be sold to a world that has long since left Microsoft Vista and Games For Windows Live in the trash bin of history. Fallout 3 is the quintessential Bethesda game which puts the burden of functionality directly onto the consumer to mod the game into some shape that doesn't crash as soon as combat begins, even if it’s altering one line of code in the ini file. The qualities of game mechanics and story are nothing without the ability to run on a machine and operating system built after 2008. When GOG and Lucasarts/Disney patch the likes of KOTOR 2 or older games into something that can easily run decades after their initial release, Betheda should be able to hire coders to take out GWFL with their Fallout Shelter war chest alone.

												I don't know what anyone here is talking about, the game works perfectly if you have Windows 7-10, although at first it'll let you know the game isn't compatible. Click ""Learn More"" once that message explaining this pops up when you run Fallout 3, and you'll be redirected to install Games For Windows Live, which takes about 5 seconds. Boom, it works. Enjoy. It's a great game (one of the best) so make sure to pick it up.EDIT: I retract my previous statements, the game is broken as of now, as it is not able to start a new game. I'll find a fix for it, and keep this review updated.EDIT II: Please workEDIT III: I hope this is my last edit. I downloaded this mod and now it runs.

												Bethesda should've patched this version better on Win7 or Win8.It IS a classic and has made so many revenue so you!!!Down vote until a better patch is out.------------------For now, you have to do the following thing from the link:http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20371/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Ffallout3%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D20371&pUp=1------------------Making Fallout 3 work on Windows 7 & 8Getting Fallout 3 to run on win 7 and 8Step 1: Copy the D3D9.dll from the “Source Files” Folder into the main Fallout 3 Directory (Not the Data directory)Step 2: Right click on the “FalloutLauncher.exe” and “Fallout3.exe” and go to properties.Step 3: For both “FalloutLauncher.exe” and “Fallout3.exe” right click and go to properties and set the compatibility mode to Windows XP (Service Pack 3)MAKE SURE THAT FALLOUT 3 IS NOT OPEN FOR THE NEXT STEPSFallout 3 Config File EditingBefore you try below copy the “Fallout_Default.ini“ file included in the “Source FIles” Folder and place it into your Fallout Directory (NOT THE DATA ONE)Manually Editing the config file if the above doesn't work.Step 1: Open up the Configuration file in Notepad in the fallout 3 directory, (Which should be named ""Fallout_default"") press Ctrl+F and find the following line of text. NOTE: THIS IS CASE SENSITIVEbUseThreadedAI=0You must change this to:bUseThreadedAI=1Step 3: Directly underneath the changed line of text, create a new line and type:iNumHWThreads=2Step 4: Save the config file and then close. Then try to launch Fallout 3.These steps are basically telling the game to launch using just 2 cores. This way it will make sure that the game will not freeze due to errors trying to find 'outdated' cores.This fix will usually solve your problems, however if this has not worked and the game is still crashing then try these additional steps:-Uninstall Fallout 3, disable .NET 3.1 under 'Turn windows features On or Off', then reinstall.-Renaming or deleting the music folder inside the Fallout 3 folder apparently helps as well somehow?Now it should work GOT FOSE get it to run on win 7 & 8 hereStep 1: Right click and go to properties. Then go to compatibility mode and set it to windows XP (Service Pack 3) and check “Run as Administrator” "

												Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas?I see a lot of people asking about if they should play Fallout 3 first, or Fallout: New Vegas. I went through this dillemma myself. I chose to buy Fallout: New Vegas.Let me first give you a brief summary about the two games:Fallout 3: You are a vault dweller. Your father has left the vault for an unknown reason. You go after him and enter the Capital Wasteland. You're main goal is to find your father again.Fallout: New Vegas: You are a courier who had to deliver a package, but in the middle of your journey you were shot in the head by a member of the Chairmen (one of the families of the Strip). You wake up after being healed by an old man and you track him down. There is also a war going on in the Mojave Wasteland between the NCR, the New California Republic which is a faction that works with laws and such as they did before the bombs fell, and Caesers Legion, a faction based upon the old Romian Empire which is build upon slaves.There are two major differences in the two games.Fallout 3 is build upon the idea that you are fresh out of the vault. In the game, everything is new to you ánd your character.Fallout: New Vegas is not really build upon this idea. You were shot in the head and you start your journey from a little farmers town.Fallout 3 has an interesting storyline which I really enjoyed. It feels more personal then in New Vegas.Fallout: New Vegas has a lot (and I mean a lot) of choices. The game is bigger than Fallout 3, because it has more quests.I chose New Vegas because I wanted to have a lot of things to do in the game. But I now regret this decission. I think you should buy Fallout 3 first, it's a great beginning for Fallout games in general if you have never played one. You get all the basics early on in the game and your goal is pretty clear. If you already played Fallout 4, then I'd recommend you to buy Fallout: New Vegas.			"

ROBCO INDUSTRIES UNIFIED OPERATING SYSTEMCOPYRIGHT 2075 – 2077 ROBCO INDUSTRIESSERVER 69 Welcome to this short Fallout 3 review_____________________________________In February 2015, I decided to start a new Fallout 3 play through. My goal was clear: Doing Everything!That means talking to all the NPCs, visiting all the landmarks, every little shed, cave, settlement and unmarked point of interest; doing every quest, obtaining every unique weapon, collecting most of the pre-war books and sugar bombs, and acquiring so many bottle caps that I could safely say that I could start my own soda manufacturing company!The apocalyptic open world of Fallout 3 offers the player a great atmosphere. The music is well suited in terms of capturing the essence of this devastated world, where everything is reduced to mere antiquated forms of junk and scrap. I am always amazed by how great the mapmakers at Bethesda recreated the ruins of D.C. There is even a whole metro system underneath the city, waiting for someone to explore it. The map is pretty cool, you can’t argue with that. So take your time and explore every square inch of it – you won’t regret it. Since I knew this was going to be my last playthrough for the next couple of years, I meant to do it in style! So I went ahead and spent countless hours of tweaking and installing mods to shape the game to my liking. The outcome was rather impressive, especially since I am not easy to please!I had a blast! It took me 200 hours (18 months of playing) to finish the game (including expansions). I could go on and on and explain what kind of character I played (he was neither good or bad by the way) and what decisions I made, but this is a review after all, right? So let’s get to it.The apocalyptic open world of Fallout 3 offers the player a great atmosphere.

The map is pretty cool, you can’t argue with that. So take your time and explore every square inch of it – you won’t regret it.What is not so great, on the other hand, are the graphics. They were outdated even back in 2008, when the game was released. Bad textures, bad lighting and this green filter that was put over everything – Gross! Luckily, there are tons of mods that aim to fix what Bethesda missed, and if done right, the game can look absolutely stunning.

 I would also like to make an observation on the combat system: While I don’t think it’s bad, it offers much space for improvement.BUT: Fallout 3 is not primarily a shooter, but a RPG with shooter elements - and it does a pretty good job at this. In my case, it was easy to stay in character throughout the whole game (unlike in Skyrim (in my personal opinion)). And I am not talking about the way I killed people, rather, it refers more to about how I approached situations, and how I resolved them. In many cases, the game offers the player a wide spectrum of possibilities - Some of them are hidden (that’s why I had the Wiki close to me). Fallout New Vegas did this whole RPG thing even better.

Remember when companies still sold expansions or add-ons instead of just DLCs? (I am looking at you, horse armor). Fallout 3 got some really good expansions, though they are not all great. Mothership Zeta is the worst of those add-ons in my opinion - You are basically trapped on an alien ship with only few characters to interact with, no interesting loot and no story or other assets. Also, you seem to simply be walking from room to room, through endless corridors, hoping for it to end after the one before.The best thing you can get in this add-on (referenced above), is the pretty cool (and not so lore friendly!) Samurai armor you can obtain by killing one of the few NPCs you meet on the ship. *Sigh* Operation: Anchorage (another add-on) is almost as bad as Mothership Zeta, but you get some pretty good loot at the end (nice for stealthy characters). It also offers a little bit more depth by putting you in the role of a soldiers of the U.S. Army during the 2070s. So lore-wise, this add-on is not a complete waste.Broken Steel is pretty good, since it simply expands the quite vanilla Fallout 3 story in a good way.Point Lookout and The Pitt are pretty amazing. Both add a new map for you to explore, with a main quest, side quests, new weapons, enemies, loot and characters. My personal favorite though is The Pitt, because of the dark atmosphere and the possibilities for the more, shall we say, evil characters.

 I could say so much more about this game, but I am lazy - so I will just say that I love this game and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a decent RPG with a great atmosphere; And if that’s not enough you can always enhance your experience (and you should do that, because the Vanilla version of Fallout 3 is rather, well, “meh”) with many awesome mods.Thank you for reading my humble review, and, if you need help with identifying the mods from my screenshots you can contact me via Steam. Comment on this review and I will add you as soon as possible. Have a nice day! "

												Fallout 3 on Windows 10: It just doesn't work....at first. But if you are willing to tinker with it a bit then you can get it running just fine, maybe even better!This is a pretty good and immersive game where you get to wander around the ruins of the 1940s version an ancient city called ""Washington D.C."" after total atomic annihilation in order find your missing dad who is played by Liam Neeson! Along the way you find some creatively built shanty towns, interesting characters and cool factions. You can choose to make the Capital Wasteland a better or significantly worse place depending on the way you chose to tackle quests given to you by the many locals you meet. This is a must buy on sale. Tunnel Snakes rule!!!			"

												This is my first Fallout game that I am playing, tho I have already NV and 4 added in my library. I have decided to start with 3, then NV and in the end 4.Even this is rather old game I like it very much. With just a few mods game starts to look not bad at all. Game mechanics are good, the world so far that I saw is interesting and big and I have still a lot yet to discover.NPCs and monsters looks interesting and I guess for the time that game was announced and put out to play they were quite good.I am still level 11 in game, but I spent already like 20 hours and all I can say is that Fallout 3 is a must play game for all the gamers that likes sci-fi genre, open worlds and shooters.

												As of writing this, I have installed FO3 for the upteenth time.Don't let the 47 hours fool ya.  More like 800+ hours in total.I have modded this game so many times, broken it, removed it, installed again just to mod it and eventually break it again.The basic game itself is amazing.  You don't need to do anything more than load it up and fall into the time trap.Killing Rad Roaches to Super Mutants, with BB Guns to Mini Nukes, protected by rags to Power Armor, while wandering into and out of a nuclear wasteland making $caps...yeah.  Oh, and there's a great story, if you want to bother with it.Then one day...you just need a little more.Lucky for you there's a massive community of modders out there who can give you anything you want.More content?  Yup.More guns?  Yup.Better graphics?  Yup.Just more cool stuff?  Yup.Even Hot babes?  Yup (but only in game).Get yourself a good seat cushion.Oh, and before you go all negative Nancy on this because you had an issue with the game, check one of the many modding communities.  They probably fixed it years ago.			"

												Do not buy if you're currently in Germany. You'll get an outdated and censored edition of Fallout 3 which forces the German language on you (language not changeable). Absolutely cannot recommend the German version.The non-German versions however, are perfectly fine. Might be hard to run on some systems newer than Windows Vista, though.			"

												**This game has serious crashing issues that can be fixed via google and steam forums**Fallout 3 and New Vegas are two of my most favorite games with a focus on story telling while still being fun to turn people into little giblets.  With the modding scene and the DLC this game will never truely die.  Although in retrospect i would say that New Vegas perks are much more fun and modify gameplay more than FO3s basic perks. Play them both and enjoy their differences.  Everyone and their dog should play this game because it is a timeless classic.			"

												This tutorial helps in fixing all the problems for everybody - go watch "" Apoqsi "" youtuber and there is his video named "" How to Fix Fallout 3 Freezing, Crashing, Visual + Radio Stutters, and Errors! (PERMANENTLY) "". It's great. It works. But make sure to run it in compatibility mode for Windows XP Service Pack 3. :) If this doesn't work, nothing else will. Period.In case you guys have newest drivers that tend to break Fallout 3 and New Vegas, he also has a tutorial on how to fix that also. :) A game ? A bit too light on a roleplaying aspect, less choices than New Vegas, but a very enthralling world filled with awesome stuff and LOL moments throughout - I mean - listening to Billy Holiday while filling a SUPER MUTANT'S face with bullets - it's hilarious, very atmospheric and very relaxing to explore ... :) No real complains.

												Most of the poorer reviewers on here have complaints about how the game functions on the newer operating systems but they exagerrate the problem. In fact for windows 7, it only took me about 15 minutes to find information about how to fix the game for windows 7 and then fix it. It's not complicated at all and that's very little work in exchange for hundreds of hours of game playtime. If you like Skyrim and have it for PC, then you already know basically how Fallout 3 works so jump right in! I honestly love this game despite the little bit that I had to fix when I started playing. This game is definitely worth the investment!			"

												See people posting poor votes because the game is unstable on windows 7 and later. When did this game come out now, 2008? That's almost 10 years ago. You people whine too much. Don't see anyone complaining that dos games aren't playing on windows 10. This game has long since finished it's active duty and is at the point you have to put a little bit of work into making it run. Also if you spent a moment googling isntead of complaining, you would have known that a quick google search reveals a solution in the top 3 results. This solved my rapid random crashes right up. The issue is due to the game engine not liking CPUs with more than two cores as it seems. To everyone complaining, guess what, in order to play System Shock 2, you have to literally disable all but one processor core for the running game instance, otherwise the game crashes. SOLUTION: Find and open (backup first!) the fallout.ini file in ""My Documents\My Games\Fallout3""FindbUseThreadedAI=0change it tobUseThreadedAI=1Add this line after itiNumHWThreads=2			"

												Great game, great characters. However there are a few flaws.The first one is it's legendary instability under Windows 7 or later. Depending on your setup, the game can be anywhere between unplayable and crashing at the title screen to playable, but with scrambled music due to the Directsound kerfuffle. Heck, even though the game is playable under Vista the soundtrack is scrambled albeit still fixable if you're willing to go out and buy a Creative gaming sound card if just to use ALchemy to fix the soundtrack. The biggest issue is that Bethesda is not willing to fix the bugs even though there is a huge fanbase, and is even working against the fans by issuing takedowns at unofficial patches to fix the issues. That's right, the developer doesn't want fans to play the game with proper music. Secondly, the game uses the problematic Games for Windows Live framework for a lot of things, including copy protection. Microsoft recently announced that they're shutting down GFWL. Guess what this means for the game. Sure, again there are fanmade patches to work around this, but well, it shows Bethesda's mindset.In short, unless you're willing to go the full mile securing a decent Windows XP machine and then get your hands dirty with unofficial patches, don't buy this. If you absolutely must, get one of the console versions instead, PC gaming master race be damned. Don't get me wrong- It's a great game, and I support both consoles and PCs equally, but the PC version of this game is just not worth it and I'm not happy with the way Bethesda is treating the PC players of this game.EDIT: Just bought a new laptop and upgraded it to Windows 10. Won't run, period. The game installs, the Launcher comes up (along with a stern warning from Windows saying that this game won't run), and... nothing. Clicking on Play results in nothing happening. Additionally, the game's installation of Games for Windows Live bricked the laptop's internet connection until said item is uninstalled. It has went from bad to worse. I definitey don't recommend it now. It's a great game, but it's coding is so bad it's not even forwards compatible with newer versions of Windows.			"

Posted: September 27, 2014
												I'd like to start this review by saying that Fallout 3 is an absolutely magnificent beast of a game and that it will remain one of my most beloved games for ETERNITY. I first played the base game, without any DLC, and I'm very glad I did. This is primarily because even without any DLC, there are a plethora of locations to discover and explore, so many quests to do and plenty of people to help or hinder (or shoot in the face and rob). This review might be a bit long, but it is one of the few games I can play again and again, time after time, and still become 100% immersed in, so bear with me ;)Some spoilers may lurk below, be warned!First off, Fallout 3 is a single-player, post-apocalyptic game set in a post-nuclear American wasteland. As I touched upon earlier, the game world is gigantic, maybe even dauntingly so. I'm the type of gamer who has to discover everything, so for me this was a massive plus in the game's favour. This wanderlust is helped and even encouraged by a compass at the top of the screen, highlighting discovered and undiscovered locations. Once you're out into the wasteland proper, you're not really limited in where you can go, either. The amount of freedom this game gives you is refreshing and liberating, though be careful where you wander! As I found out, the answer to 'What's that thing over there running at high speed towards me?' is not 'let's go have a look', but instead 'it's a bloody great Deathclaw, and it's now chewing my face off, cheers wanderlust!'Another point in F3's favour is that players can play in a way which suits them. Want to be a lovely guardian angel who wanders the wasteland helping others and destroying evil? Or would you be a horrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that goes round pistol whipping people in the face? Do whatever you want, there's a variety of options you can take regarding playstyle. Also, while the range of options for offense/weaponry isn't as massive as some other games, there's still a very wide selection. Weapons can also be built once you've found the relevant schematics, some of which, without spoiling them, are very fun to play with. You can also experiment with different types of armour, or walk round in your pants, it's up to you really. The skills and perks systems allow you to choose whatever path you want, whether that involves big guns or slapping people about with melee weapons.DLC aside, I was surprised at the relatively short length of the main questline in F3. For players who prefer to concentrate on the primary story arc, you may find the game ending somewhat prematurely. The full potential of this game really is unlocked when you take all of the side quests and exploring into account. The world is there to explore and it adds so, so much to the game. Some of the missions are downright crazy, while some locations are inherently creepy - I'm looking at you, creepy haunted place and acid-trip-gone-wrong Vault - and despite the length of the main arc, it is still an engaging storyline. I also found this game to be very immersive, especially when wearing headphones. You also have access to a radio through your Pip Boy device, and it's an oddly enjoyable experience wandering the wasteland listening to 'Jingle Jangle Jingle'.The game is not without it's downsides however (though sometimes even they result in some classic moments). F3 will sometimes glitch out, and sometimes, it will glitch out spectacularly. The game incorporates a follower system, whereby some of the NPCs you meet in the game will agree to come and help you out, fighting monsters with you and the like; now I was wandering around with one of these followers and we happened to be walking next to those metal roadside barriers. I jumped over and ran on a little ways and turned round to make sure no beasties had snuck up on me, only to see my follower doing what appeared to be the Hokey Cokey dance on the barrier; before I could fully process this he was slingshotted into upper orbit, disappearing into the sky like a big green blob. It was okay though, he dithered out of the ether again about 10 minutes later, just in time to stop me getting done in by one of the wasteland's hostile denizens.You may also find yourself randomly taking damage for no reason other than you trod on some clutter. Certain places in F3 are  immensely cluttered, meaning you will also at times be flung across a room as plungers apparently have a secondary function as trebuchets. When you're trying to sneak down a tunnel and not get your face shot off, suddenly treading on a cup and getting thrown into your assailants arms isn't much help. Also, if you've just left a crazy fight, uber low on health, and a wayward plate decides it hates your soul, you better prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥because it's probably going to do you in if you stand on it in the wrong way.While the ability to play this game however you want is a massive bonus, it also has its pitfalls. You can pretty much kill any NPC you find, and this can, at times, irrevocably screw up your game. F3 also has several console commands that you might use to help you out, such as using them to unlock a pesky door you keep failing to lockpick. Some of these commands can also screw the game up, so it pays to be mindful of what you're hammering into the console if that's something you enjoy exploring in a game.Overall, I found Fallout 3 to be a wonderful game. It looks fantastic, and the post apocalyptic setting is rendered beautifully. The developers did a wonderful job here, and my only regret is that I didn't play it sooner. It also has so much replayability, you can come back to it again and again and make different choices, choose a different path. While it has its downsides, F3 makes up for them with an engaging world full of interesting characters and factions. It also helps that a lot of the bugs are hilarious and often don't have a massive impact on gameplay (I, for one, don't mind vanquished Mirelurks pinwheeling off into the sky). I do however think to get the full benefit of what this game has to offer, you have to pursue the side quests and get your explorer hat on. I also think that while I've reviewed the base game in general, the DLC adds a massive amount to the game and are well worth the money.			"

												Before I get hate let me say, I do love this game, I have always loved fallout games since the very First.But, very sadly. This version is riddled with game breaking freezes for windows 7/8.With just installing the game and playing it on 7/8. The game freezes consistently in as little as you loading into the game.There is a fix that you can mess with the data file and add some text lines. This helps 99.9% of open world and ""LARGE"" indoor area freezes. But it does nothing to Fix ""SMALL"" indoor area freezes. This includes ""MAIN QUEST"" small indoor areas and other nonmain quest small indoor areas. Making progress in the main story/quest nearly imposable.If not for the freezes on windows 7/8. I would easily give this game an 11/10.Yes I do still play this game (ignore my low time, I don't play it threw steam).But I have to give it a thumbs down. Due to the game braking freezes.If you can do the fix (relatively easy) and deal with the extreme frustration of having the game freeze in critical areas/times and having to end task it then load it up again..........only to make it maybe 5 more secs in then having to do it all over again and again and again for small indoor areas. Then go for it. I do.TL:DRI love this game. But game breaking freezes on windows 7/8 keep me from giving it a thumbs up. "

												Fallout 3 suffers a tad from having to follow up the original Black Isle titles since it's not the same kind of RPG but it is a good game. Exploration is rather enjoyable since there are goodies littered all over the wasteland and in this respect it reminds of of Morrowind (which is only natural of course). It's an enjoyable game even if your FPS skills are minimal due to the auto targetting VATS system and all in all its worthy to be experienced by any fan of the adventure, fps, and rpg genres. The game has so much replay value and that's before you start modding it so... definitely worth playing (though roleplaying an evil character isn't as well thought out as in the originals).			"

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANA                                                   War... war never changes.English:Don't trust my gametime, i've bought this game on Steam too, just for collection. This game literally ruined my life, i've finished it like 14 times before losing the count. No, i'm not crazy, yes, my social life imploded. And don't trust the grandpas that will tell you this game is garbage just because they played the first 2 Fallouts and refused to play this one, they are just ignorant. In this game you live a wonderful and touching adventure in first person (Identifying so with the character), watching the character growing and becoming the hero or anti-hero that he'll be. Oh yes, because obviously you can and have to choose between choices that will influence the events and your karma. So, we have an abnormus replay factor, if we consider that we can play as good, bad, neutrals or do a mixed playtrough, choosing maybe a different type of class for the fight. AND, the game is easily moddable and has a large and active modding community: Nexus Mods. So, even if you have finished it in every way possible, you can mod it and transform it in a new game to discover. Trust me, this game is AWESOME.                                             La guerra... la guerra non cambia mai.Italiano:Non fidatevi del tempo di gioco che dice Steam, l'ho comprato anche qui giusto per averlo. Questo gioco ha letteralmente rovinato la mia vita, lo avrò finito qualcosa come 14 volte prima di perdere il conto. No, non sono pazzo, si, la mia vita sociale ne ha risentito un pochino. E non fidatevi dei vecchiacci che vi diranno che questo titolo fa schifo, solo perché giocarono ai primi due ai tempi, e si rifiutarono di giocare questo, sono degli ignoranti. In questo gioco vivi un'avventura stupenda e toccante in prima persona (Immedesimandoti dunque nel personaggio), vedendo il personaggio crescere man mano e plasmandolo lentamente nell'eroe o antieroe che sarà. Eh si, perché ovviamente potrai e dovrai fare delle scelte che influenzeranno gli eventi ed il tuo karma. Abbiamo dunque anche un fattore rigiocabilità enorme se consideriamo che possiamo giocare da cattivi, da buoni, da neutri o fare un mix, scegliendo magari anche una tipologia di personaggio diversa per quanto riguarda i combattimenti. Senza contare il fatto che il gioco è facilmente moddabile e vanta di una community di modders vasta e attiva, ovvero Nexus Mods. Dunque anche avendolo finito in tutte le maniere possibili e immaginabili, potete ancora moddarlo all'infinito e renderlo un gioco nuovo tutto da riscoprire. Fidatevi, questo gioco è perfetto.			"

												You are now entering the wasteland of fallout. Please enjoy your stay and make sure not to stick your hands out of the trolley. We do not like mutants.As you see to your left these manhunters are the natural enemies of all living things they are called the death claws , they are quite deadly and remember to use VATS to target and aim for their vulnerable spots. VATS for you who have forgotten is a system that stops gameplay… I mean time and allows you to target enemy weak points and resume time with a touch of the button. This allows us to survive better but remember you have a limit to how much you can use it before it runs out. Which is why you should buy our nuka-cola energy drinks for a special price of 5 caps!Now proceeding near  the city of NPC""s... I mean homeless people. You will see that while the conversations with them can be dynamic with many ways to approach them and handle a situation. They tend to not be that expressive. Don't mind that though its just them being shy. Remember that how you develop yourself as a human being will change how you can approach these guys and other situations on your travels.Don’t worry though if you collect a bobblehead I’m sure it could make up for your lack of intelligence or anything else!Now put on your toxic suits thats under your seats we are heading into the toxic tunnel infested with ugly... i mean disfigured mutated humans. They are victims of the after-matches of the war and tend can be hostile towards you. Its important to note that you can choose to align yourself with one faction or another to win them over. Which tends not to be as complex as new vegas as a result of relying on equipment for doing this.Don’t worry while we don’t have casinos that are grand like New Vegas every day is a huge gamble to live or die so remember you can skip hours of a day if need be by sleeping.Up next is the ship of dreams, where scientists come together to figure out the future. Rumors have it that the main reason to come here is the research on clean water systems. The scientists are trying to find to make the water clear and drinkable for all. The incoming tour of an alien spaceship is brought to you by Unknown Inc. Where even the employees don't know each other. The DLC… I mean discoveries located casually during this tour.. are well worth your wait and price of admission. We have discovered that the environments are completely different and well thought out layouts are quite nice especially seeing new friendly face…Remember folks how you develop yourself as a human being is what this game.. I mean place is about and I highly recommend paying to move into one of these broke down… I mean luxurious homes.  "

												I've tagged Fallout 3 as one of my top games in my Steam account. I've actually put way more hours into it than my Steam account shows (see note below), and it's one of my favourite games of all time.I love the post apocalyptic setting - this game really pulls it off. But unlike some of the other Bethesda games such as Skyrim (which I also love!) this one has a really engaging landscape. There is stuff to check out everywhere! I get so sidetracked when doing quests because there's always something that catches my eye and I think ""oooh what's that?"" and I go check it out. There's so much to do!In the most part the quests are really good, but I admit I was getting a little bit annoyed near the beginning of the main quest with the constant ""looking for Dad"". One thing that is great about FO3 is the very satisfying weapons. Some shooters can be a little weak, and RPGs are usually weaker still with the FPS elements but I found FO3 to be very solid. Yeah the AI is not brilliant but the weapons themselves feel very good. I particularly love taking somebody's head off from half a mile away with a sniper rifle :-)Also, you can't really talk about a Bethesda game without discussing mods! I'm a big modding fan and I never play these games vanilla for very long. I used FWE, MMM & EVE along with several mods that added new perks and a mod that allowed you to level up more slowly but get several perks per level which I really liked.Overall, it's a fantastic game and I'm really looking forward to playing New Vegas and then Fallout 4! (Yep, I'm seriously behind on my gaming!)Windows 7 Users Please Note:=====================When I first started playing the game it was around 2011 and I ran it on an Alienware Windows XP machine and it ran very well. Then I stopped playing for a few years and came back to the game later after I had moved into a Windows 7 machine.It crashed constantly, and when I saw constantly, I really mean it! After literally weeks of trying to get it to play properly on my 64 bit Win7 machine, trying every fix out there I gave up. However, I managed to get a pirated version of the game to work (doh!)So whilst I absolutely recommend the game to anyone who loves shooters, RPGs or post apocalyptic games, if you have a Windows 7 machine, don't get the Steam version. Try and find an old disc based copy instead.			"

												I'm playing this game in 2016 on a laptop with integrated Intel HD4400 graphics running Windows 10, and after installing 3 patches to get the game working, it plays great. I'm playing at 720P on medium texture detail and getting 45+fps, which is about the minimum I find comfortable to play at in action games.The game really deserves some more official updates though, as it still plays well and looks good despite being older. They should really have an official patch that removes any trace of GFWL from the Steam version, and they really should add a few steam features, like cloud save.			"

												An unbelievable well made game, one of the best games ever made. The graphics, gameplay, plot, lore, music score, and art style are just astounding. Without dlc, this game is awesome. With the dlc, the game is utterly amazing. As someone who plays all games across multiple consoles and PC, Fallout 3 is easily in the top ten best games ever created. I highly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of western style rpgs. Other games in the top 10 that I recommend(PC or Console): Mass Effect 2, BioShock, Legend of Zelda(Majora's Mask, Ocarina of Time, etc.), Civilization 5, Mario 64, Portal 2, Half-Life 2, Super Smash Bros Melee, Last of Us. Fallout 3 is a real treat of a game and if you haven't played this game yet you are sorely missing out. If you end up liking this game, I also recommend Fallout New Vegas. Not as good but still fun.			"

												I remember getting Fallout 3 for Christmas years ago. I popped the disc in my console and... I wasn't feeling it. Probably because I was mostly playing FPS games (read: Call of Duty) at the time. I wasn't familiar with RPG's. But, at a certain point in time I decided to give Fallout another go. It's been one of my favourite games/franchises ever since. (Became a big Bethesda fan as well.)Spread across console and PC I have easily put a couple hundred hours into this game. It just doesn't get boring until there's absolutely nothing left to do. And believe me, that won't happen very quickly. There are many places to explore (at your own pace) and besides that, building up your character the way you envision it, is awesome.So, do I recommend this game? Absolutely.			"

												I don't know why but whenever I start playing FO3, I get bored of it after completing about 75% of the game and stop playing. I started a third new game 3 days ago and played about 23 hours in just three days but just got bored. I am guessing that this has something to do with:- Low citizen and human settlement count. Also some of these so called settlements only consist of 2-3-5 people (i.e. Girdershade).- Major settlements such as Megaton and Rivet City have no logical reason to be major settlements. Maybe Megaton stays alive thanks to travelling caravans and only two Brahmin located in the centre (even Arefu has three) but there is no explanation of how Rivet City can even survive.- Terrible gunplay, bullet sponge enemies such as Super Mutant Overlords, Feral Ghoul Reavers and Albino Radscorpions. For example a direct hit to a Super Mutant Overlord with a badass Fat Man will only take 33%-50% of its HP.- Downtown DC, the most interesting part of the game is just rubble (justifiable) and all travelling goes through dungeon like metro tunnels.- Quests are mostly forgettable and most of them are just glorified fetch quests. Some of the unmarked quests would make better quests if they were fleshed out.- Factions are not fully developed and more interesting minor factions like The Union or Republic of Dave can be fully explored and related quests can be completed very quickly, without any human interaction.Compared to New Vegas, where some major quests included very interesting and meaningful dialogues, a world that does not only revolve around you and combat being mostly an option and not as tiresome as FO3, Washington DC is just a post apocalyptic playground. Nevertheless FO3 can entertain a player for a long while even though you may not find yourself patient enough to complete it. If you want a real Fallout, a Fallout that continues the legacy of being a mature Post Postapocalyptic game, you can just skip this and get yourself over to Fallout: New Vegas.			"

Product received for free
The worst part is Fallout 3 isn't optimized for Windows 7 and later. I wish that was fixed but some people know ways to play it on windows 7 and thanks to them I can remember the good memories of Fallout 3.Fallout 3 was a old game back in 2009 and I was young back then and I still love Fallout 3 to this day. I just love the setting of this game. It really feels like being in a complete wasteland and with the dlc's for this game can be even more intresting and crazy. So many places to visit with some intresting people to run into. So many weapons to pick from and use it's like so much power in your hands until you cannot carry anymore and you gotta walk the entire time very very very slowly. But it makes sense, and weight is a important thing sence you really cannot carry like 50 fat mans unless you use god mode to carry whatever you want without being slow and all that.  "

This game made me laugh, cry, rage, and just... feel in general. :( Proud to say this was my first Fallout game and it taught me to appreciate what I have before it's gone. Good games like this are honestly hard to come by. U: Pros:• Story line will move you to tears, or at least it did for me. It kept me intrigued and wondering what was going to happen next.• Good voice acting - THREE DOG! :D• It has DLC that's actually WORTH BUYING! (wow! C:) • The world is HUGE! There's so much to do and to explore.• The nostalgic green tint and dark ambient music really make the atmosphere feel.. well /dead./ In my opinion xD It actually feels like you're in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. :3 Seriously man like sometimes I'd discover some old building and like.. it would creep me out and I would barely be able to go in. D: I'd nope the heck out of there xD• Graphics aren't bad for an older game ^o^Cons:• None :DJust buy it, you'll thank me later. xP Well, probably not but hey at least you got an *AWESOME* GAAAME! 8D "

  Very good game,despite it's age  Fallout 3 is a very good post-apocalyptic action RPG game with a big open-world map filled with many locations to explore(221 with the DLCs,and 163 only in vanilla),a pretty interesting story which consists of 14 main quests,17 side quests,and another 38 unmarked quests(I recommend you doing the side quests because they're not related to the main ones and are very interesting).The game's time lenght is ~14 hours only for the main story and 100+ if you want to complete every quest in the game,the DLCs,and to explore every location.The game occasionally crashes on Windows 7,8,10 but you can reduce the chance by following  this guide .Below are the Pros and Cons of the game.  Pros   ------------------------  Big world with lots to do Very good post-apocalyptic atmosphere  Fun combat (both FPS and VATS) Many weapons to choose from Many perks and skills to level up (58 perks,79 with the ones from DLCs.And 13 skills) Highly moddable Each DLC takes place in a separate and unique map  Cons   ------------------------  Main story is kinda short Has fewer choices compared to other games in the series No iron sights (you can add them with mods) Occasionally crashes on Windows 7 and above (check the link above) Still has bugs (nothing game-breaking)Also,mini-reviews for the DLCs: Mothership Zeta I personally didn't like this one.It's way too linear,basically it was just running around,pressing buttons and killing aliens.The story was kinda boring and it doesn't even have side quests.But the ending is cool though.It's like 3 hours long. Point Lookout My personal favourite.It's a very good DLC with a beautiful setting and good story.It's open-world and has side-quests too.It's like 5-6 hours long if you do everything. Broken Steel It basically continues the game's main story.It's pretty interesting,has side-quests and free-roam and it takes place in the vanilla world except the last mission.It takes like 5 hours to beat everything in it.And also raises the level cap to 30 when installed. Operation: Anchorage It's a good linear DLC that takes place in a simulation.It's very short,like 2-3 hours. The Pitt Beautiful setting(yeah,I like post-apocalyptic settings) and nice story.It's ~4 hours long.Conclusion? It's well worth the full price and can't wait to play it again with different perks,builds,and quest choices. Note: This is my first ever review, so I'm sorry if I forgot to mention some important or necessary details.  "

												After finishing what i consider to be one of the most beautiful stories i have ever played, i can only say Wow... just wow!!!There are basically no words to describe, how awesome this game really is. Initially released in 2008 even after 6 years its far better than most post modern rpg game titles and that my dear fellow gamers says a lot!As i am writing this review down im trying to find any flaws that may pop into my head, but truth be told i cant find anything wrong with this title. Whether its the graphics, whether its the gameplay or the story itself Fallout 3 has everything in adundace and more. I myself am still shocked at the amounts of detail this game offers and the awesome vibe u get  when u follow the story of the nameless hero of vault 101 aka the ""Lone Wanderer"" as he roams the derelict wastelands of his nation's capital.A world filled with crazy wannabe mad max raiders, super mutants, aliens, fascist regimes, lone rangers, mutated animals and oc what every nuclear title requires Cockroaches. To help u fight all that as with every bethesda title u have to freedom to become everything u want and use every weapon at your disposal from pipe lines to future laser tech. And if u want to add a little bit of macho manliness u can be kenshiro from hokuto no ken series and fight all your way using only your hands in unarmed combat. And if u think thats not enough to keep u alive, thats why u have Liam Neeson as your papa to remind u how awesome u really are ^^.Fallout 3 game of the year edition is prolly one of the most awesome rpg titles to have been created this far. Personally i enjoyed it more than i did skyrim and truthfully i never expected this game to be so good. But it feels good to be proven wrong just this once.10/10 or 9/10 for those of u who will think the lack of any vehicle movement is enough to discourage you from trying this title!!!			"

												This game is a classic and, as I have already played the game when it was released with a physical disc copy, it would get a thumbs up from me under normal circumstances...BUTThe steam version, in it's current condition and if you're unlucky does not work as it should. There are crashes for just about every operation the game performs. If you google Fallout 3 crashes you will be treated to a cornucopia of nine or more fixes for reasons the game could crash. Do you have a processor with more than one core? Crash. Do you have a laptop with an integrated graphics card? Crash. Do you have autosave on? Crash. Do you have Windows newer than Vista? Crash. Did you forget to sacrifice to Cthulu before booting? Crash.This may not apply to you though, it seems some of these instances are more serious than others. I myself got the lucky draw of several of these risks, playing on a laptop running Win7 with an integrated graphics card and a quad core CPU.The only reason I didn't return the game after rebuying it digitally was that I got it to work somewhat after doing a convoluted set of tasks that may or may not have involved cthulu in some form of desperate plea for help.So after modding the game with a file that overrides the graphics options, fiddling with settings in both the launcher and ingame, setting compatability for WinXP and having to order the laptop to only use one cpu in task manager every time I load the game  (Because OF COURSE it resets every time you reboot the game) I got it to work, allthough it eventually crashed again and this time, having saved up it's spite for a good hour, it crashed so hard it froze my entire computer and I had to do a hard reset to make it work properly again.I do hope that I am wrong though, and that this was a case of the integrated graphics cards gremlins, which presents a much less all-engrossing scope. Fallout 3 is a legend in it's own right, a classic that everyone and anyone should be able to try out or re-visit.			"

												Fallout 3 isn't just a game, It's an experience.+ One big continuous open world. Loading screens appear only when entering major cities or buildings.+ Very atmospheric and immersive world to explore.+ Every NPC’s are really living in that world. They follow their own daily routine from morning to night. You’ll meet them, talk to them and even remember their names.+ Good writing and a touching story. It is fun to talk to NPC’s and trying out different dialogue options to see the outcome.+ Freedom in almost every aspect. A quest can be completed in many ways. You can almost kill anybody you meet (even an entire town). You can be a good guy, a bad guy or have a mix of both. You can play as an action game or you can play stealthily. You can choose to play in 1st person or 3rd person. You can roam anywhere you want but...+ Enemies don’t scale. So if you wander off to the wrong area during early levels, you will die easily.+ Many types of interesting enemies. Some are scary.+ Graphics.+ Voice acting.+ VATS+ Mods. A lot of them.+ Galaxy News Radio and...+ Three Dogs.+- Progression system and level cap (max level 30). The progression system is fun and addictive (with a lot of useful perks to choose) but I personally prefer Elder Scroll’s progression system where you get better at what you use. This way you can shape your preferred character with more flexibility and can even change your play style anytime. That’s why it is not a negative, it’s something that I have a mixed feeling.+- Dynamic day & night cycle. This game has day and night cycle but it is purely for cosmetic effect and doesn’t change or affect gameplay.- A.I’s are stupid sometimes, especially if you play stealthily. (Mods fix this)- Stealth gameplay could be better. Most area design doesn’t encourage stealth gameplay. No non-lethal option either. (Mods fix this)- Crafting options are very few. (Mods fix this) - No iron sight aiming in 1st person. (Mods fix this)OVERALL: Solid 10/10, best in the series.			"

												Love the game so far. Pros:Fun environment to travel aboutAwesome craftingCool graphics to look atUnique storyCons:Game will crash randomly on win7 ultimate. Game will sometimes mess up alt+tabbing.Developers have stated they wont optimize Fo3 for windows 7 or above.Therefore this game, even though i like it so far, gets a downvote from me. Conclusion:Wait for Fo4, Fo3 is not good on Win7, I've also done several fixes to make the game work properly, no resolution. Save your money or get it on console.			"

												Lots of people would have a couple hundred more hours if Bethesda would fix & optimize the game to work with Windows 7 & 8.Other than that tedious issue, it's an amazing game, especially with mods! Mods like GNR Enhanced, Point Lookout Reborn, Alton Il, Vault 101 Revisited, and more really spruce the game up.There's lots to do in the wasteland, such as...-Slavery! (Yes, really.)-Destroy an entire town!-Kill a mugger!-Shoot things!-Use V.A.T.S.!-Give water to people!-Explore!-Save/Reloading!-Modding!-Kill aliens! (Mothership Zeta)-Loot!-Steal things!-Be evil!-Be good!There's lots more to do, but let me get to the gameplay.It's an RPG, FPS, game. You are also given V.A.T.S., which lets you take a moment, and plan your shots out. You can cripple an enemy's legs, then deal with them, shotgun style, or just shoot their head, like everyone does. You can talk to many residents of the Wasteland. Some will be your companion, others will give you quests, and some prefer shooting first.Fallout 3 has quests. Main storyline quests, sidequests, and unmarked quests. Storyline and sidequests show up in your Pip-Boy 3000 under the Quests tab, while unmarked quests don't. Things like supplying people with Sugar Bombs (food), or Scrap Metal are unmarked quests.If you're a fan of shooters, and RPG's, this is a game for you.			"

												""Are you sure"", he asked.I took a deep breath and started typing.""Yes, I am. I know, I know, I have a huge backlog and I want you to buy me Game of The Year edition that will probably swallow hundreds of my hours that I don't have if I don't give up.""Soon enough, Fallout 3 GOTY landed in my library.I consider myself to be a completionist, however, my work and habits prove I've become more of a collector. I was happy to get Fallout 1, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics on GOG for free when they were removing them from their library back in 2013. Then I've replayed Fallout 1 and started playing Fallout 2, creating character named after my daughter. I've stopped middle game and decided to return later (never did, but I will probably at some point). Same friend that got me Fallout 3 GOTY gifted me Fallout: New Vegas that I also didn't complete, but I've used to justify my laziness as 'my own plan to play the series in chronological order'. So of course, when I got GOTY, I was stuck and needed to deliver - at least to myself.Fallout 3 GOTY stands independent of the other titles in the series. It was Bethesda's revolutionary change of perspective. Instead of old isometric view, Bethesda went with first person, immersing playerbase even deeper in 50's inspired postapocalyptic nuclear wasteland. We went upclose and personal with mankind's ♥♥♥♥ed up end. To make a long story short and to avoid any spoilers, your main mission in F3 is to find your dad who left Vault 101. That requires exiting the Vault yourself for the first time in your life. Your first encounter with other humans and their pitiful destinies will probably happen in the city of Megatron from where your adventure will explode in every single direction possible. It is hard to describe Fallout 3 properly in short form. However, if we say we're having an unbeliveable, mature, choice-and-consequence heavy RPG title that sometimes intentionally goes silly and offers almost unlimited freedom along sidequests more complex and interesting than the main questline, we wouldn't go wrong.F3 GOTY comes packed with base game and additional DLC materials that will make you chase ghouls, mutants and raiders for tens and hundreds of hours, even in military virtual reality program. Its rich lore, interesting characters and unexpected plot twists here and there, along with the possibility to drive the game your way based on your choices is what makes it so appealing. It's hard not to enjoy sounds of rustling wind in the outskirt of devastated Washington DC. Letting go and losing yourself in loneliness of human misery never felt this good. Game fails a bit short in the shooting section. Hit detection is appearantly offset to simulate RPG system of risk and chance, luckily for us, F3 integrated V.A.T.S. queuing system that lets you hack the enemies to pieces, cripple their limbs and create some dramatic fighting scenes, all based on some sophisticated dice rolling.But, here comes the big but(t). It's silly to recommend Steam's version of Fallout 3 GOTY. Simply, it doesn't work.I was informed of several issues that Windows 7, 8 and 10 users were complaining about before I've decided to play the game. But how severe these problems are, I had no idea. My hours in the game were characterized by random crashes, sound and graphic problems and unbeliveable glitches. I've tried it all - vanilla play, unofficial and official patches, different and recommended high rated Nexus mods, uninstalls and reinstalls, LOOT launcher installation. Latest problem occured literally out of nowhere. After 3 hours of installing and reinstalling drivers from different sources and ultimately completely messing up my display settings without being able to run the game, I've decided to quit.I feel sad and angry. Fallout 3 is, in the end and as much as I've managed to play, a great, great, loveable game. However, Bethesda's ultimate and insolent refusal to patch this gem is the reason why you shouldn't get it. Chances you will end up with good game badly broken are pretty high and that's something not worth risking. There are no excuses for not fixing what can be fixed, especially when almost 20 years old original and sequel are running flawlessly on modern systems. ***Hey, you've liked this review? Hated it?

Fallout is love. Fallout is life.If you're like me and never played previous fallout games then you will be a bit confused when you play the game for the first time. But after about an hour into the game you simply can't stop playing. Okay so here is my story: i started playing this game right before Fallout 4 came out since i was too poor to afford FO4 at that moment so i watched a few reviews on YouTube and decided to play it. As i said if you're new to the franchise like me, you will be confuse about how some elements in the game work right off the bat but that dissapears shortly after 1h into the game. You are born and raised into a vault untill the age of 19 i think because of a nuclear blast and after some incidents you are bound to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of the vault. After that the fun begins. It's YOU vs THE WASTELAND.The fallout 3 world is so god damn massive that even with my 10 hours of gameplay i haven't come close to completing even 10% of the game. There is a main story and many many side quests that you can choose to do. They are all equally fun so i suggest doing them all, well, you don't really have a choise to be honest. you will be so addicted to the game that it will be hard for you NOT to go for all quests. You can choose how you want to play the game and every action you do effects the ending of the plot. There are many endings so prepare yourself to be either as good as possible or as evil as possible. 10/10 would recommend			"

												Although New Vegas is much more popular, and has more to do, I prefer Fallout 3's story. Because you see yourself born you become more emotionally invested in the story then you would with the Courier. The only downside is that the main campaign has pacing issues and doesn't let you know when the final mission is so odds are you'll finish it before you wanted to.The DLC actually breaks the game though, so I'd advise playing through it once and then deactivating it after the playthrough. The DLC added monsters are more or less boss level and are spawned in mixed with regular enemies in most cases.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time. Unfortunately, it's currently broken on Windows 10. All of the fixes to work around GFWL and the multi-core processor bug appear to have broken themselves in the transition from 7.It's too bad that Bethesda is unlikely to fix these problems for the vibrant community that continues to support this game--a game which no doubt is still very profitable for the company.At least New Vegas still works.

												I guess I should write a review about the best RPG game I have ever played. Don't let my hours played fool you, I have played through the entire story and all DLC's on my playstation 3 a lot of times and still I haven't seen everything (EDIT: I am also playing with mods currently so all the time I have played in the last month and everything I will play won't be counted (as of 19-3-2016)).Which brings me to my first 'Pro' Pros:-A HUGE amount of content, it is insane how much there is to do in Fallout 3. The map is big, there are a lot of places to discover, people to talk to, quests to do, items to find, computers to hack, locks to pick and enemies to shoot. A vast assortment of mods add a lot to this already amazing game!-The story is good, its nothing special but it is good enough, the DLC's are also amazing and have their own stories!-DLC done right, this isn't some cash grab DLC game, the DLC's add new items, enemies, lore and more to the game!-Great atmosphere, the music is really good too!-Your choices matter, the dialogue system is great, although the characters you talk to are a bit 'lifeless'. Cons:-Stiff NPC's/unrealistic animations, When you talk to someone they stand still like they are a tree, the animations aren't very good either.-Graphics are very outdated, this isn't a con to me personnaly but it might throw some people off, ofcourse there are mods to make it look better!-Bugs and glitches, sometimes funny, sometimes game breaking.I recommend this game because I think it is amazing, video games are truly a form of art.Steel be with you!

Posted: December 25, 2013
												Have you ever been a long-time fan of something, gotten really excited when you heard it was coming back, only to be massively disappointed with the result? Fallout 3 had this effect on many fans of the Fallout series, myself included. When developing Fallout 3, Bethesda only kept what was valuable to Fallout. Not “valuable” to the series and what made it so great, but valuable in terms of measurable monetary value. Fallout 3 is an attempt at bringing Fallout to the “modern gamer” and it’s one of the few things Bethesda did right.Right from leaving the Vault you can see that the game is very good looking with a nice aesthetic style, too bad it’s ruined by that horrendous green tint. Despite being pleasing to look at the game world is very badly designed. Locations are randomly placed and most of them bear little or no significance at all. On top of that, there is almost no variation in the caves, buildings or those damned metro tunnels. Once you been through one, you’ve been through them all. And to make matters even worse, exploration in the game in more chore than challenge as enemy levels are scaled with the player, meaning as long as you’re decently equipped and not caught off guard, you’ll breeze right through anything.Gameplay is familiar; it plays as if it’s “The Elder Scrolls IV.5: Fallout”. Bows replaced by guns, skills reworked, etc. On the surface it’s not really a bad thing, combat is more complex than TES but (much) less so than previous Fallouts. Your weapon skill determines your accuracy and damage dealt (this also applies to guns, even though that’s not how guns work) and your number of Hit Points is derived by your Endurance. Skills have been reworked so that “Tagging” a skill only increased its base by 15 points, no longer increasing the rate the skill increases during point distribution on level ups. Also, perks are now gained upon every level up as opposed to every third. Meaning by the time you reach the default cap of level 20, you’ll be nigh unstoppable. Attributes (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck) have been almost completely trivialized, doing little outside of increasing the base number for your skills. And the availability of the perk “Intense Training” only further trivialises the allocation of attribute points. Unfortunately even 5 years post release, the game is still full of potentially game breaking bugs, even after being blatantly dumbed down for the 360 and PS3. And the PC version isn’t much better either, unless you’re running Window Vista then get used to reading “fallout3.exe has stopped working” every hour or so. The original Fallout sent you on a quest to find a replacement controller chip for your vault’s water purifier and Fallout 2 had you finding a Garden of Eden Creation kit to save your tribal village from a severe drought. Both are for the benefit of many, where Fallout 3’s main quest is personal. Leave the vault and find your father. Having a personal goal in a Fallout game was a strange choice. In the first two games you end up having a great impact on the rest of the wasteland, eradicating the Super Mutant threat or the Enclave in Fallout and Fallout 2 respectively. Fallout 3 main quest ends up being a lazy compilation of all these objectives from the previous games and seems pointless. Why are we competing against the Enclave when A: The Enclave was destroyed in Fallout 2 and B: They want the exact same thing we want. So why not team up? It’s certainly not for control of the area, because people seem to be doing fine without a source of pure water. The illusion of player choice exists but you have almost no influence on the story or game world with your decisions. The Evil path doesn’t seem like it is there for players who want to commit to being evil, but there for players who just want to murder people for the fun of it. An example of this wasted potential is in an early side quest, where you can either blow up a town for two obnoxiously stupid characters for reasons which are cryptically arbitrary, or you can save the down by defusing the bomb the town is for some reason based around. Blowing up the town nets you destroying one of the game’s main hubs for nothing more than a cool looking explosion.You’ll find through your travels that there is a strangely limited number of NPCs/town in most of cases, a couple generic citizens with a handful of named characters. How the player can interact with the NPCs is even more limited. Dialogue has been seriously dumbed down since Fallout 2, both in terms of writing quality and sheer number of choices of what to say. Speaking of writing quality, you can’t expect me to believe that “You can’t be President. You’re an abortion of science. You need to die…” (one of the game’s skill check dialogue options) is something that a scientific mind would say, can you Emil Pagliarulo? The delivery of dialogue is just as bad. The number of voice actors is extremely small all sound uninspired, even celebrity Liam Nesson’s performance is off on a few of his lines. Bad writing, bad delivery along with bad facial animation makes NPC interaction nothing to look forward to, at least most of them have very little to say.It’s obvious that Bethesda aren’t familiar with the Fallout universe as there are many inconsistencies to be found in Fallout 3, both with lore and its own story. Most obvious is the changes to the Brotherhood of Steel. Because of Bethesda’s apparent inability to creatively and skilfully write opposing factions with unique and believable motives, they wrote the Brotherhood of Steel to be the goody-two-shoes of the game, as opposed to them being the xenophobic tech-nuts they once were. This is explained in-game as the Elder of the BoS chapter exploring the east suddenly deciding to abandon the Brotherhood’s primary goal of recovering advanced technology to do nothing but help old ladies across the street. This “explanation” was clearly an afterthought used so that the BoS could be in the game for brand recognition. The Garden of Eden Creation Kit was just a mere collection of seeds and horticulture tips in Fallout 2, but in Fallout 3 it’s completely rewritten as some kind of magical life-bringing device to save the wastes from radiation for no reason other than it suited Bethesda’s writing. It seems that rather tell their story in the Fallout world Bethesda shaped the Fallout world around their story, which makes very little sense in of itself.The game’s atmosphere is good as a standalone, but as a Fallout title it’s completely off. Bethesda did a great job of capturing the mood of Fallout but not its atmosphere. All this assuming you’ve turned the OST off of course. For some reason Bethesda chose to abandon the atmospheric music of the first two games in favour of the action movie soundtrack that assaults your ears. Which gives player the only difficult choice of the game: Do I listen to this travesty of an OST? Or do I listen to THREEEEEEEEEE DAAAAAAAAWWWG, the most out of place character in the game.If you’re looking for a fun shoot and loot game with lots to explore then this is the game for you. If you’re looking for an RPG experience with complex characters and depth in the gameplay then you’re better off looking elsewhere. It succeeded as a way of bringing a loved series to a new generation of gamers, but it alienated lots of fans of the original games.			"

												Broke game in two minutes by closing the gate on the playpen before dad could get out trapping him forever. 10/10I have only eleven minutes logged on steam. However I played this extensively up until the release of NV and beyond then too on my 360. I use FSE so the time doesn't get logged on steam as it removes the overlay. So my total playtime is over 1000 hours I expect. This is a post-apocalyptic masterpiece. I played it for countless hours discovering every solitary bobblehead, nuka cola quantum and all 5 behemoths. I bought the DLC on release out of a desire for more of this post apocalyptic adventure. *spoilers*I left the vault in search of a father who left me feeling betrayed. I found him only to have him taken again so soon. I killed Colonel Autumn as vengeance for my father. I came back from the dead to continue my fathers dream and the war against the Enclave, I became a member of the Lyons Pride and the Brotherhood of Steel to cram a power armoured fist down their throats in an effort to rid their evil from the capital wasteland. Then I settled down in my Megaton home, and life was good.*spoilers over*Then I started all over again. This time as a knife weilding pyromaniac, then again, as a tech expert with a knack for explosives and lasers. I kept playing this game over and over, because while the story wasn't NYT bestseller material, it engaged me. The world was interesting with interesting people such as a benign super mutant and old lady hoping for a violin and a man seeking freedom for his band of former slaves and the smart mouthed little p12!ck who lead a town of children. The game looked good to me with its blasted landscapes and shiny monochrome vaults and misplaced tower rising in the south, broken D.C landmarks and its mushroom clouds which conjured a sense of horror as you realise just how much devestation the power of the atom can bring. This game is one of my all time favourites. Sure it has bugs and glitches. Sure the graphics and gameplay are dated but this is still a damn good game. A lot of the old time FO 1&2 diehards hated this. And that is ok. Because sometimes the old games just feel right and this dramatic a change can turn some off. I never played the originals. I tried, but they are too dated for me and I wish I could get into them, but hey.  If, somehow, you don't own this game. I beseech you, get it now and know the cell mutating joy that I did the first time I explored the capital wasteland and became the lone wanderer.			"

												10/10All in all a brilliant game. Buy it if you like any sort of open world games, buy it if you like game that have an emphasis on character freedom, buy it if you love the idea of running around the wasteland shooting mutant zombies with laser pistols while 50's swing is playing through your arm radio. Pros:Brilliant atmosphereGreat settingMassive worldGood questingNice mix of retro sci-fi and post apocalyptiaFantasic soundtrackDeep dialogueCheap, especially at salesGreat array of available modsA gun that shoots nukesSwag DJYour dad is Liam NeesonConsUnstable on Win 7 (easily fixed with some interweb searching)Outdated graphics (by no means bad graphics, just a little old)Certain modern mechanics are lacking (no aim down sights or grenade button and things like that)(NOTE: you can get most of these features through mods)Fiddley menusNOTE: I only have a small number of hours cause I have modded it and run it through Fallout Mod Manager as a non-steam game.

												I love the game, but cannot reccomend it due to instability and constant crashes in newer machines. Bethesda has really dropped the ball and has not updated the game at all. It has major compatibility issues with multi-core processor machines and windows 7, 8 and 10. Be aware. The steam store page says ""not optimized"" but it should say ""incompatible"" or just plain ""unplayable"". To the people commenting that I didn't do my job to research and try to fix the problems, first of all, I did, all of the solutions I could find online only marginably increased the game's overall stability, and secondly, when the consumer has to spend hours trying to fix your game in order to play it, it means the devs have dropped the ball. My point stands.			"

												Played it without DLC in the beginning. I actually wanted to explore more, but then I mis-calculated and the game ended :cBut now I know the main-quest line and I can play the DLC's, which I first have to play through.So far so good. The only problem I had with the game was that it sporadically crashed because it is normally not compatible with Win7. Anyway with a lots of saving a really fun and even serious game though, it got me into the general Fallout hype :39/10			"

												Fallout 3 is an action role-playing open world video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios, and is the third major installment in the Fallout series. It was released worldwide in October 2008 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.Fallout 3 takes place in the year 2277, 116 years after the setting of Fallout, 36 years after the setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear apocalypse that devastated the game's world, in a future where international conflicts between the United States and China culminated in a Sino-American war in 2077, due to the scarcity of petroleum reserves that ran the economies of both countries. The player character is an inhabitant of Vault 101, a survival shelter designed to protect up to 1,000 humans from the nuclear fallout. When the player character's father disappears under mysterious circumstances, the player is forced to escape from the Vault and journey into the ruins of Washington, D.C., now known as the ""Capital Wasteland"", to track their father down. Along the way the player is assisted by a number of human survivors and settlements, and must battle a myriad of enemies that inhabit the area.This is my most favourite game of all time, it is filled with endless hours of fun, such as: Blowing up cities, killing ghouls, killing, killing and um killing... The story is suprisingly good (it's replayable). The characters are good, the story, is good, weapons good, everything amazing, this game is 100x better than fallout 4, I've been playing it since the year it came out and I still revisit it on PC and xbox. After all the story and killing you can still rely on mods to give extra hours of playing with: new missions, guns, followers, worlds, etc, it's endless!!  I would definetly rcommend this to this day! 100%, I love it, 10/10 , buy this now when you get the chance! especially with DLC!			"

												The following review will be pretty similar to other extremely serious reviews á la ""I started the game and died 10/10"". You will still get an idea of the game - but there will be *SPOILERS*. So:I actually did start the game and died.9/10.I'm just kidding.Soon after I left Vault 101 and the sun♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my eyes I realized ""I will have a lot of fun with this game"".I jumped down the hill and, without a real reason, drank from the irradiated puddle directly in front of the Vault and ... died.After enabling god mode I drank from the same puddle again an ... died?!What the heck is wrong with these damn puddles?Irradiated Cheat-breaking puddles: 7.5/10I went to Megaton, a lively and beautiful little settlement (for wasteland conditions) inhabited by a lot of warm-hearted, welcoming NPCs. In an unfortunate turn of events I accidently blew the city up from a Tower miles away. I really can't recall why.Ability to blow an entire city up, avoiding really funny quests and destroying the lives of dozens of people: 10/10Some kid ran into me, asking me for help because his city was ""attacked by giant ants"". I knew that little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tried to trick me so I kindly asked him to get lost. I also stole his sweets.My search for Dad continued as I reached a seemingly abandoned ship, Rivet City. Instead of asking for information I just killed everyone, breaking the main story line leaving me unable to finish the game. But I pushed a hobo from the deck and nobody noticed it, so I got that going for me, which is nice.Able to break the game by killing essential NPCs: 6/10. Only amusing in the beginning.I aquired Abraham Lincoln's very own rifle. 10/10I got killed by a deathclaw. Multiply. Within a matter of minutes. On easiest mode. With god mode on. 0/10. Bethesda please nerf.I found dad, he was playing some sh*t game with Oculus Rift. Was all black and white and way too happy, so I hacked into the game and killed everyone spawning Chinese invaders. I also dropped a chandelier on a b*tch. 10/10.Dad and I went back to Rivet City. He was not amused everyone was dead.Blablablabla, middle part, I saw Dad die, blew up a secret underground base, killed the President and their leader destroying the whole faction, saved the entire wasteland by cleaning the entire water from radiation, gave the water to wastelanders for free, helped the BoS establish their influence in D.C., helped a man liberate his home and finding a cure for a disease that turned people into ghoul-like, crawling mutants, solved the mystery of a dangerous island in Maryland, brutally slaying a tribe of uncivilized brats and solving the fight between a brain and a ghoul, I helped the US army win versus the Chinese who attacked US soil via Alaska, GOT ABDUCTED BY ALIENS, saved the entire PLANET by destroying the mothership AND killing their captain, and when I got back I was killed by THE KID I STOLE THE SWEETS FROM.TEN OUT OF FRIGGIN' TEN!BUY THIS GAME! MOD IT UNTIL IT CRASHES!			"

Hello! I'm going through some of my favorite, and less-so, games, and giving them reviews! You can go see some of my other reviews if you'd like through my profile!*Note* I have played many, MANY more hours than my Steam profile shows, as I played this quite often on my sisters account before I bought it, years ago.TL;DR: This game is a fantastic first entry into the world of Fallout from Bethesda, and if you love being whatever kind of person you'd like to be, I completely recommend this game, but it's best with a few mods, which can be located here: http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/I'm gonna be givin' you the truth about this game, no matter HOW bad it hurts!Fallout 3 was my introduction to the entire genre, and while I am a young gamer, I like to believe that this really shaped what type of a gamer, and person that I am in general, even the small things.Now, I have to agree with a lot of people's complaints, which is that the story is actually quite linear. You aren't given many choices on what you'd like to do in the main campaign, and it will almost always end the same way. But the thing is, you can't judge this game purely on the main story, because it's only a few hours long if you rush a bit.This is an open world game, and when you finish the campaign you can really burst into the world. Well , you don't even have to finish the campaign, really. There are a lot of different people you can meet in the wasteland, and how you choose to use your time can truly mean the difference for your own experience as your character.It may fall short of your expectations on occasion, but overall it's a game experience I doubt that you will regret, and that I personally think is WAY better then New Vegas, but that's a story for another time (I'll link that review once I come to it).I personally love the music in this game, and the other Bethesda entries, and I feel that the radio system adds depth and keeps you immersed in your character. Nothing is too out of whack that you can't roleplay!Pros+Some) Excellent character writing+Interesting story line which kept me engaged+Easily moddable, with a great community+Many ways to play-THREEEEE, DOOOGGG!+Many of the songs in this game are my favorites... EVER!+Still being modded today, with major entries coming in every so oftenCons-Terrible gunplay (Fixed with mods)-Not optimised for an OS past Windows 7 (Fixed with mods)-Dated Graphics (Fixed with Mods)-Some of the voice work could be better.Overall, and excellent game, which still holds up well years after release.Now, for the DLC...TL;DR: The DLC for Fallout 3 add some interesting new places and characters, but it's sad that you have to pay extra for a continuation of the main story, which provides a satisfying end.Point Lookout: Didn't particularly enjoy, because I prefer a bit more of a vibrant area, whereas this was foggy and eery, although this may suit you. You take a ridiculously expensive boat ride to a place where strange plants grow, and creatures lurk, and end up in something deeper than you thought.Do I Recommend: It's got more good things than bad, so yes.Mothership Zeta: After exiting for the evil compound of the Enclave, I discover a crashed ship of some kind. As I go to investigate, I see the rocks and dust around me floating up, and I see my companion drifting away as I float up into the Mothership...I had a lot of fun with this DLC, and while it may not be the most realistic, it still adds a lot of new weapons and a few interesting characters.Do I Recommend: Yes, overall it's a fun experience for something different in the Fallout world, and it's fun to blow up some little green men.Operation Anchorage: This DLC introduces another side to one of Fallout 3's main factions, the outcasts of The Brotherhood of Steel. They want to get a surplus amount of weapons for reasons you can keep your nose ot of, but the only way to do this is to complete an army simulation for the days of the ""big ka-boom"". It's an interesting new experience, and it gives you a bit more of an idea about the world before it went to ""waste""...Do I recommend: Yes, I really enjoyed taking a look at some of the machinery that the soldiers would have worked with in the war (I know it's not real :P)The Pitt: Now this one got me really excited, because I love covert operations, especially when I can choose my own adventure. You are asked to sneak into a Raider's slave camp, and free as many people as you can. You discover the harsh treatment that these people are treated to, and get a real sense of atmosphere.Do I recommend: Absolutely. You are sent in with nothing but leave in triumph, or perhaps something else, depending on what type of person you are. I loved this DLC.Now, for the final, and quite possibly, the most important DLC...Broken SteelThe first think you'll notice about this DLC is that it raises the level  cap to 30, allowing you to get a few more skills in, for this extended campaign. This completes the battle between the pre-war Power Armor and Laser Rifle wielding Brotherhood of Steel, and the Specially designed Power Armor and Plasma Rifle wielding Enclave. Who is good, and who is evil is up to you, but one thing is for sure... This battle will be Epic...[h1Do I Recommend:[/h1] I think that if you plan to buy Fallout 3 at all, you HAVE to have this DLC, as it adds so much more incredible story and combat.BONUS! There's a giant fighting robot with laser eyes! "

BeginningDon't get scared of my playtime, becouse I've bought it for a easier game acess and from the personal respect.I played it long time ago at the release date ( 2009 if I'm correct ).Also being a veteran fan of Fallout 1 ,2 and infamous Tactics. I have found Fallout 3 to be a pretty good sequel of the previous games. Not perfect though.I have always dreamed to experience a wastelands from the first person and this game does it good. I will never forget that feel of exiting Vault 101, fantastic experience. Scavenging through the destroyed cities, looking for supplies and watching out for the mutants or bandits. This game knows how to create a ""immersive experience"".Also it was a first time when I drank a radiated water from the toilet.Being accompanied by a Beautiful soundtrack and Wonderful ""ol'times music"" from the radio doubles that effect.While this game lacks few details from the previous series , like extensive dialogues or better Charisma system with a lot of choices. It fixes that problem ( a bit ) with a great voice acting.Being a hobbyist level designer by myself it amazes me how much they put detail into every location. There is a story everwhere, every placed rock had some kind of backstory or it can even lead you further.Exploring wastelands, city ruins , old metro's never felt so amazing. Especially School or RobCo factory.I loved also how much story was put into the game, you can read about people last moments right before the bombs fell down. When you enter some abandoned office building , its like a time has stopped. Not to mention quests, while there are not that many they are very well designed and don't feel repetive or boring ( aka kill, bring, deliver ).The main storyline of Fallout 3 is quite interesting too, it might feel a bit personal here but It got me hooked a lot more than a New Vegas story. Yeah it seems quite a generic becouse you are a superhero guy that is going to save a wasteland from the bad guys. I like New Vegas but even if it had better design choices, the atmosphere of the game was ""lost somewhere"". It lost its post-apocalyptic feel that Fallout 3 had.But even in the last moments of the game , you had a choices. Especially if you are a pacifist ( or you like a more diplomatic way of playing this game ), then you might find it really interesting. You have a choices and they actually change something here.Its a possible to play this game with a a 10 INT , 10 CHA character by only talking or bluffing.  You can hire some mercs of followers to do a dirty job for you and this is what I also like here. You are not limited to your gameplay style and you are not a ""jack off all trades"", like in the Skyrim.What about DLCs?They are amazing and well done. Each of them offers a different theme so it doesn't feel like a ""1 new quest DLC"".- Operation Anchorage , its a simple shooter. Almost no dialogues , just go and shoot gooks. Some say its the worst DLC , I can agree but not fully. It still allows you to experience a pre-bombs era with a sweet rewards at the end.- The Pitt, this how DLCs should look. Offer a new interesting stuff and continues a amazing Fallout 3 experience.- Point Lookout , was more like a horror game. Really decent DLC. I would like to see a full standalone game set in this theme becouse even for a DLC it was amazing.- Mothership Zeta, a short funny addon where you shoot aliens and meet a lot of strange people from the past.- and the last one Broken Steel , which expands the main story after Fallout 3 events.BETTER DEAD THAN REDLast worldsIt might look old now but with a few graphic mods it looks fantastic. There is a high replay value becouse of many in-game player choices, builds and endings.If you want harsher experience you might try to download some combat overhauls and all that stuff. There is a lot of good mods that kept this game fresh for a several years. As always , Bethesda games are very open to the modding. Thats a huge plus. Becouse if you don't like X part , you can fix it with a Y mod.They gave us a game where we can shape it by ourselves, to fit your gaming tastes.Just don't make Fallout 4 look like a Skyrim, don't ""casual"" it too much please.

												In my opinion this game (even with its old age) is leagues ahead of Fallout 4. Due to fallout 4 trying to please a different demographic (full of high action loving call of duty players) I think its lost touch with what its meant to be but thats besides the point. Fallout 3 is what I would call I gem of a game. If you don't like the way this game has aged then you have 2 options:- watch the ""Bringing Fallout 3 into 2015"" series by ""Some kind of elephant""

			Views: 4,047		

			In part 1 of my bringing fallout into 2015 series we will be focusing on graphics, one of the most important things in a game; only second to content.		

- Buy Fallout New Vegas because It is pretty much a ""funner"" version of Fallout 3. (I would still reccomend you trying this game) If This has enticed you to purchase a copy of Fallout 3 then before you do so allow me to give some negatives-Due to the age of this game, it has no achievments (which some people find a problem with)-steam does not count gameplay hours while playing (a way around this is to re-launch the game while playing and leaving the launcher on in the background-the bugs this game has can get you really impatient becuase it can pull you out of immersion			"

												For the most part, Fallout 3 lives up to the hype.  I had a great deal of fun with this game for the first thirty hours of play or so.  The RPG character development is strong, the FPS aspect is great considering it's an RPG, and the VATS system which is a combination of both is unique and adds a certain cinematic appeal to combat.  And of course, the perk system adds a certain excitement to leveling up that wasn't standardized for RPG gaming yet at the point of this game's release.The open world is exciting to explore as you seem to run across all kinds of events and quests that (as far as I could tell) you weren't handheld and led to from any other place in the game.  The main storyline and the enjoyable DLCs lead you to the far corners of the map, though additional quests are plentiful.  Multiple quests also seem to offer something entirely unique, especially those related to the DLC, where you'll unlock special perks and otherwise unobtainable weaponry - weaponry which often has its own mechanics that differentiate it from other gear in the game.My only complaint with the game, and this may be self-inflicted, is that as I neared the end and started playing the different DLCs it seemed to begin to drag.  I ended up having to push myself to start the game up, even though I, generally, enjoyed my time playing the game even then.  This could be related to your character becoming drastically overpowered if you allow them to in the higher levels.All in all, a great game and one that I highly recommend to RPG and Post-Apocalyptic fans.  I secondarily recommend this game to FPS, as the gunplay is fun, but it won't blow your mind if that's solely what you're hopping into the game for.			"

												Disclaimer: Long, and a side quest spoiler. TL; DR This game takes awhile to get exciting, but its well worth it.Rather than discuss why I recommend this game, allow me to post a slight side quest spoiler, as it really captures the moment where I fell in love with Fallout 3.As I was exploring the wastes, I came across a sizeable tower. As I neared this tower, I saw a Ghoul (ie looks like a Zombie but is  in full control of his body/mind) aruging with someone over an intercom. Naturally I eavesdropped and discoverd the Ghoul wanted to bring his people into the tower, and the people in the tower, very clearly did not want them in. So as the dismissed Ghoul left I naturally tried my hand at getting into the tower. As I was a human, they let me in no problem. Its there that I picked up a quest to eliminate the Ghouls, as they were become increasingly bothersome to the residents. So I ventured into the tunnels, and found the leader whom I saw previously yelling into the towers intercom. He proposed a different solution, one that would let him and his band of ghouls forcefully take over the tower. I weighed my options. Most tower citizens were not bigots, so I saw no reason to kill them to let the Ghouls in, yet I did not want to elimite the Ghouls. Not agreeing with eliminating either party, I opted for a more peaceful route.After a few speech persuasions, (maybe a few stealthy murders) I persuaded the majority of the citizens in the tower to let the Ghouls in. The ghouls moved in shortly after. All was well. I had done it. I had solved a problem, with both parties intact.or so I thought.I returned to check up on my Ghoul/tower residents, and I noticed something amiss. The former tower leader, was gone, and so were a few of the other human residents. Some investigating later, I found the bodies of a few of the previous Human occupants, shoved in a storage closet. I questioned the Ghoul leader, and he dismissed the murders as ""accidents"" related to ""disagreements"". I lost it. I slayed every single Ghoul in that tower, I felt betrayed. Had I not done the good thing? I made two groups coexist. In my quest for an ideal solution I did not see the underlying problem. And now my charecter sits in an empty tower. Filled with neither Ghouls nor Humans, contemplating the error of my choice, dwelling on my unsastisfying rampage against the ghouls that betrayed me. All the while marvelling at the game design, and how it made clear moral choices murky.			"

												To start off, this game is great. I have had tons of fun playing it and it runs flawlessly without any problems on both of my Windows 7 computers. If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic game settings where you travel across a wastland shooting whatever you come across or sneaking past an enemy if you don't want a conflict, then this game is one you should consider buying. With that said, this game does have problems running on some windows 7 and 8 computers. I have had friends who have spent hours trying to get it to run on their computers, some have been successful and others have not. I just happened to be lucky enough to have a computer able to run it without changing anything.			"

												Fallout 3 is not a game... it is an experience. Fallout 3 is half shooter and half RPG and it combines them perfectly and has a great leveling system (S.P.E.C.I.A.L) to help with honing your characters skills to make him or her exactly how you want. Durring my time playing this game i have my fare share of amazing, scary, exciting, and just hilarious moments and i garentee if you click that purchase button your in for a great time.:: For People About to Buy ::Game of the year edition is HIGHLY recommened for the following reasons:1) Great and High quality DLC2) Continued game after Main quest**If you wish to continue roaming the wastes after completeing the main quest you need any DLC IF the right ending is chosenThanks for reading and I hope I persuaded you to get this peice of art and remember ""War, War Never Changes""			"

												Amazing. Words cannot describe the love I have for this beautiful masterpiece. Fallout 3 is my personal favorite game of all time without a doubt. If you like RPG's and games like The Elder Scrolls but also like post-apocalypse I HIGHLY recommend you buy this game! This game to me is a work of art. The charaters, storyline/quests, scenery, weapons, its pretty close to being perfect in my opinion and many other's. I absolutely LOVE Fallout and 3 is my definitely my favorite of the series. This is the only game I have givin a score of 10/10, and it for sure deserves it!			"

I have over five thousand hours in this game. I have it for Games for Windows LIVE and XBOX 360, now I have my 3rd copy, Steam. I have completely finished the game and every aspect it has to offer time and time again, creating countless mods with the GECK. How did I do this, you may ask? Well, I've played it ever since its US release in 2008 and played nearly every day on my old Windows XP and more recently my Windows 7. The way you get it to work on your Windows 7 is you go to your Documents > My Games > Fallout3 > FALLOUT.INI. In lines 88-89, change bUseThreadedAI to 1 and add iNumHWThreads=2 just after it. This makes the game use Threaded AI and it makes the game use only 2 CPU cores; otherwise the game will continuously crash. After you do this, the game will be more stable than Fallout New Vegas.Alright. Onto the review.SettingThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic, retro-futuristic Washington, D.C. following the Great War between the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and other countries. The Great War occurred on October 23, 2077 which caused immense damage and destruction despite lasting less than two hours. Before the Great War, there were the Resource Wars that nearly crippled the world and brought riots to the streets, during which the United Nations disbanded, and a Forced Evolutionary Virus plague coupled with global terrorism rendered the United States paranoid of both real and imagined communist plots. Canada was annexed by the United States in order to help the U.S. war effort against the Chinese in Alaska. The fact that Canada had the plentiful resources of nearly untouched wilderness made America's effort well worth the protection the U.S.A. promised to provide.The WorldRust, decay, and creeping vegetation infest monuments from before the Great War. Amidst the ruins of Washington, D.C., the Capitol, the Jefferson Memorial and the battered remains of the Washington Monument still stand in the desolate area that is now known as the Capital Wasteland. The central hub of civilization in the ruins of the former capital is Rivet City, based in the remains of an aircraft carrier carried far inland and beached by a catastrophic tsunami whose waters have long since receded. Other settlements include the towns of Megaton, Arefu, Tenpenny Tower and Paradise Falls. Movement through the downtown area and settlements is possible through the Washington Metro tunnels and crossing the desolate nuclear wasteland.The Brotherhood of Steel community is stationed in the Citadel, built in the ruins of the pre-War Pentagon where they attempt to preserve as much pre-war technology as possible. Super mutants, who since emerging from their refuges, have waged an unceasing war against what remains of humanity, trying to invade their territory and capture them. The Enclave - the self-styled inheritors of the power of the United States government - under the leadership of their new President John Henry Eden and his ruthless second-in-command Colonel Augustus Autumn, are the player's biggest foes in the game.Emotional ImpactAt the very beginning of the game we are introduced to the Player's father, voiced by Liam Neeson. Character development is thown at us in the first few seconds of the game, great start. I shouldn't already be bored within the first 10 minutes of a game. Fallout 3 does very well to keep it that way.The one (but not only) thing Fallout 3 does fantastic is character development.There'd be more to this review but I would be spoiling it; if you haven't already done so, BUY THIS GAME!!! WORTH EVERY PENNY! Take it from me, I have 3 copies of this game!			"

												Third canonical entry of the beloved classical RPG franchise Fallout. First one ever produced in a decade, if you discount the spin-off Brotherhood of Steel tactical RPG and the action game released on Playstation. Also the first title since Bethesda took over. This one generate quite a bit of controversy within the Fallout community, largely due to the fact it plays different than previous titles, as Bethesda decides to use the Elder Scrolls' engine based on GameBryo, which obviously is what they excel at.Contrast to previous titles' isometric CRPG aspect, Fallout 3 is recommended by the developer to play in First Person perspective, even though a third person is present in the game. Some may mistake this game as an FPS on first glance, but rest assured this is still a pretty heavy CRPG, where character development, stats, skills and perks play the most important role in terms of gameplay, rather than the player's aiming skill.Suffice to say, Beth created this Fallout title with love and homage to the original titles produced by Interplay, who sold the license and rights to them. This curiously gathered a lot of hate within the community towards them, even though in my opinion it was Interplay's fault to mismanage itself and go bankrupt. Other than the perspective, this game plays and feels like a true Fallout title, all the concepts and aesthetics were nicely adapted into the familiar Elder Scrolls-like gameplay, which personally is quite a happy mix due to my loyalty to that series.Needless to say, the gameplay leans more toward Elder Scrolls titles rather than the old Fallout games in the 90's. Some may see as a problem, but I don't. Especially if you live in 2015, you can literally find spiritual successers to every classic RPGs: Wasteland 2 to Fallout (and of course the original Wasteland, which Fallout is loosely based on), Pillars of Eternity to Baldur's Gate, Torment: Tides of Numenera to Planescape, Divinity: Original Sin to Ultima, and a bunch of excellent tile-based dungeon crawlers to the classics like Eyes of the Beholder in early 90s. So you see, Fallout 3 being different than before isn't a problem for me personally, and it surely wasn't a problem for the original Fallout crew, of which a large proportion of developers work for Obsidian to strike a deal with Beth to work on a title truer to the original spirit of Fallout to based on Fallout 3's base game. See New Vegas.One benefit of Beth's taking over that no one can deny is obviously the production value. Fallout 3 is a step up in almost every direction up from Oblivion, which FO3 is built upon. Some folks jokingly name the new Fallout as ""Oblivion with guns"", which indeed tells some truth. Gone is the old turn based tactical combat, in with the new hectic real-time action with pausible VATS system which allows you to plan and spend your action points. I wouldn't favor one system over the other,  but FO3 does bring some fresh air to this aged franchise.Worldcrafting wise, Beth does what it does best. Exploration is rewarding as ever. This time around, the game is set in DC and has an east coast vide, as opposed to the West Coast settings in Fallout 1 and 2. You can definitely tell this is due to Bethesda locating in Maryland. The gameworld itself is slightly smaller than that of Oblivion. This doesn't mean it has less details. If anything, the world in this game is even more vibrant. Beth clearly learnt their mistake with the generic tones of the Radiant system in Oblivion and improved upon it. This also paved the road for future titles like Skyrim and Fallout 4 to progressively become more and more organic and polished. The excellent sequal New Vegas developed by part of the original Fallout crew also take advantage of Fallout 3's engine and many of the existing gameworld assets. which is a nod to Beth's skill and will to inherit this franchise.Final verdict: 9/10. A true Fallout fan's must have. Niche audience of open world and CRPG genre will also find quite a bang for your buck. Although avid fans only waiting for Van Buren project should be advised to find nostalgia elsewhere in titles like Wasteland 2. You may reserve your opinion towards many of the new aspects of this new title, yet nobody can deny this is hell of a game and a truly a rewarding RPG experience.			"

												Fallout 3 delivers on almost everything you can do to attest for a perfect game. The first fully 3d game in this series breaks off its original roots but for the better. Filled with hundreds of hours of lore, quests, secret items and  post apocalyptic locations you will be pulled in from the start. Create your own character and take to the harsh wasteland to make your own legacy. The combat its self can be clunky at times but never takes away from the experience. SOund in this game is damn near perfect from every footstep to the old fashioned music on the radio. Ever wonder what a post apocalyptic 50,s setting would be like? Then step right on up you are home now.Final Score: 10/10			"

Short version: 82%Is it The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion with firearms and a burnt-out wasteland? Yes, it is, with all of the good and all of the bad. The good being a masterfully crafted world that is a joy to explore again and again, with enjoyable combat, loads and loads of items, and an atmosphere that will never let you go. And the bad being the paper thin plot line and almost amusingly bad dialogues, complemented by equally atrocious voice-acting. So, in essence, it’s your usual Bethesda game: a great dungeon crawler with a bad story.Long version:When the first previews were seen about Fallout 3, everybody thought that the new owner, Bethesda just re-skinned their high-selling game, Oblivion, slapped in some firearms, and called it a day. In some manner it’s true, Fallout 3 is not like any other previous Fallout titles, which included two turn-based isometric RPGs, a TBS/RPG hybrid, and a top-down button-mashing hack-and-slash. Fallout 3 on the other hand is an action-RPG/FPS hybrid dungeon-crawler, which features all the trademarks of the Elder Scrolls series, including the good and the bad.The Good: The game world is jaw-dropping. The ruins of Washington D. C. are a marvel to look at, and the surrounding wasteland offers plenty of smaller and larger places and secrets to discover. The map is enjoyable enough to start a new character for the sole reason of exploring it again.The combat is heavily biased in the player’s favour, but it’s still fun. It’s also very violent and gory. Although it features less death animation than the old 2D games, they are so brutal it’s almost a guilty pleasure to wander around and blow the super mutants and the raiders to tiny, bloody bits.The Bad: Practically everything that involved the writing staff. The main plotline is just a mishmash of Fallout 1 and 2 with little cohesion and a plethora of plot holes. The established lore is either misused with little understanding, or simply contradicted (again, Elder Scrolls players are probably used to this). The dialogues and the voice acting ranges from somewhat tolerable to downright painful.Also, like in the case of all GameBryo engine (and Fallout) titles, it’s essential to install the community-created patches to get rid of the thousands of bugs and game-breaking glitches, including one where it’s impossible to start the game on Windows 7 or later. (Visit the community for a guide on how to do this.)Overall, Fallout 3 is an immensely enjoyable dungeon crawler. Just forget the storyline and that it’s supposed to be set in the same world as the much-loved originals, and enjoy the hundreds of hours of exploration and mutant hunting!			"

												Kay, so I have 33 minutes on record because most of my time spent with this game was through the Tale of Two Wastelands mod. My first Fallout game was Fallout 4. I rather disliked the game despite having no previous experience with these games. I here a lot of people say that it was a great game but a terrible Fallout game/RPG, most of which I disagree with. It excels at nothing in paticular and you can get a better open world shooter experience from many other games, while the RPG aspect of the game is borderline nonexistint. The second Fallout game I played was New Vegas, which I absolutely adored. It has become my favorite game of all time, in fact. I was pointed toward this game rather frequently due to my love of New Vegas, and as such I bought it when the game was on sale. I found it rather surprising that this game shared many of the same problems as Fallout 4. For starters, this game's story is terrible. The concept is decent at its core and the world is great, but the main plot line is abismal in its excecution. The characters are all incredibly flat, the villains have no motivation for anything they do, and the story relies very heavily on people making incredibly stupid decisions. It's not good, and I find it a bit puzzling when people say otherwise. I'm not saying they're wrong, but they certainly viewed it from a very different angle from myself. This puts me in a rather difficult position, as naturally I am going to compare it to the other entries I have played. New Vegas had a story leaps and bounds ahead of this game in pretty much every aspect, and I don't think many people would argue that. However, I do think I would actually put this game's story ahead of that of Fallout 4. Fallout 4 had much better presentation with the superior voice acting and art direction, but it was very linear and frankly one of the most incoherent messes I have ever seen in a triple A videogame. I get the feeling that nobody working on it cared in the slightest. 3 is similar, but to a lesser extent. While arguably more linear, the story is at the very least coherent. The dialogue, while not as good as New Vegas, is still very good in my opinion. It gives you a lot of options and is vastly superior to most other dialogue systems in games. The combat kinda suck, same as New Vegas but you can ignore that as it isn't the focus of the game. The world sells this game though. It's great. 4 had a prettier wasteland, but there was nothing to do in it outside of killing people for the most part. Fallout 3's world is much more interactive. There are many more populated areas and people to talk to. A lot of quests have you exploring really interesting locations without murdering everyone. The gothic architecture in the city of DC is another great aspect of the world. The world glows with dark charm and personality, and I think it is more than worth the asking price for the exploration aspect alone. This is kind of a roundabout way of saying I like the game. I love it, actually. Whereas I think Fallout 4 was legitimately not a very good game, I find that most of the complaints for Fallout 3 come from comparing it to Fallout 1, 2, and New Vegas. By its own merits, I think it's a really good game.			"

												If there is any Fallout game after 2008 that has an eery, hopeless, childhood nightmare atmosphere, its this one. Where do I start? Everyone in this world has extreme hardships, wearing from your father being killed by fireants, to finding a violin. In this game, its cowboy rules, you kill, you get killed. You steal, you get your life stolen.  This game also includes some of the best DLC I have ever played. Period. I'm going back into the aspect of the atmosphere.  Point Lookout  Point Lookout takes place in the Fallout equivalent of Point Lookout State Park, a new swampland area with new quests and enemies. Point Lookout in the Fallout setting has a landscape between one-sixth and one-fifth the size of the Capital Wasteland where ""the bombs didn't actually fall, but the world has left it behind"".[/1]My review of this is very simple. The hopeless scale can't even be measured on a Vitomatic Vigor Tester. It makes you feel like a tiny bug, as it continuously pushes you to cultists, fight inbreds, and help ghoul mansion owners. The eery. nightmare world it makes it seem adds a classic horror film aspect. It's my favorite Fallout 3 and Fallout in general DLC. The Pitt The Pitt allows you to travel to the post-apocalyptic remains of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and become embroiled in a conflict between slaves and their raider masters. Explore a sprawling settlement ravaged by time, neglect, nuclear radiation, and moral degradation. The Pitt is filled with morally gray choices, shady non-player characters, new enemies, new weapons, and much more. 2 Words. The Cure. Mothership Zeta Defy hostile alien abductors and fight your way off of the massive Mothership Zeta, orbiting Earth miles above the Capital Wasteland. Mothership Zeta takes Fallout 3 in an entirely new direction – outer space. Meet new characters and join with them in a desperate bid to escape the aliens’ clutches. To do so, you’ll wield powerful new weapons, like the alien atomizer, alien disintegrator, and drone cannon, and deck yourself out in brand new outfits, like the Gemini-Era spacesuit and even samurai armor.Pretty cool. On the scale of the coolest and most fun and controlling DLCs, it ranks up high. The way it includes ancient people (i.e. cowboys, samurais, astronauts) really makes me happy, including the special samurai armor, and cowboy revolver really quenches a thirst for special, yet pretty silly items.

												There's no doubt about it that Fallout 3 is one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, RPG of all time. With unprecedented gameplay, Fallout 3, in a way, paved the road, and remains relevent today. In 2008, Bethesda released Fallout 3, and within two years, they released amazing addon content. Overall, I would buy the Game of the Year Edition over the vanilla copy any day of the week. You get so much more from an already amazing game, such as an even larger map, more quests, more guns, more choice making, and in general, more fun stuff to do. Get this game if you haven't already. You will not regret it, I can assure you that.			"

												My steam profile might say I only have 0.3 hrs or so currently (that may change soon), but I have played this game extensivley on the X-Box 360, and I can say that it is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. The story is so interesting, and your quest seems so important that when you reach a goal, or finish one of the quests it flows so naturally into the next. I could sit down and play this for HOURS (although I could say the same for any Fallout game). The only problem with playing this on steam is that it WILL NOT RUN on WINDOWS 8 or 10 (unless 3rd party software/code manipulation is done, which still might not work). It will work, however, if you run on Windows 7, Vista or XP or if you have a comp that can switch from different versions. Honestly, if you want to play this game, but don't have the right os, don't spend a bunch of money getting Windows 7, just play it on PS3 or X-Box 360. If you enjoy an open yet isolated feeling, an eerie feeling everytime you see something move in the distance, or an enthralling story with exciting combat and endless hours of fun, it doesn't matter what you play it on, as long as you play it.

												Fallout 3 dawned a new era into the franchise. Now, Bethesda's first Fallout, may even be more iconic than the original two. Personally, I had a medium amount of experience to Fallout 3 as a kid, I played it when I got my hands on it; but my trip through the wasteland really began with Fallout New Vegas, a few years on. Finally, I am playing Fallout 3 properly. I would say my only complaint is that it does not capture that lust to explore, like the Commonwealth and Mojave Wasteland did for me. There is no way it comes close to New Vegas, but if you're a Fallout fanatic it is worth pumping some hours into. Specifically, the GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION offers up some of the best DLC in the franchise, such as Mothership Zeta or Operation Anchorage.			"

OK, A QUICK EXPLANATION: I tried to modify the executable files to allow the Fallout Script Extender to work, and it did, but it wouldn't work with the Steam Overlay and still doesn't. According to my save i have about 92 hours, 58 minutes and 55 seconds of play time, so know that despite the appearent playing time of less than an hour according to steam, I have given this game a considerable playthrough.PROS:Large world to explore  - It feels great to adventure across the wasteland seeking it's wonders and surviving its horrors. DLC content adds more things to do and places to exporeCONS:Weak Story - The story is pretty decent right up until the middle and then it all falls apart. None of the actions of some of the chracters make any bit of sense and the fact that a piece of DLC had to retconn the end (by fixing a BIG plothole) doesn't win points in my book. There is just so little love in the story compared to 1 and 2 (and even New Vegas), shoehorned allegories and cliches, etc. Why is Lamplight Caverns just children even after 200 years, ""DON'T THINK ABOUT IT"" says Bethesda. ""Why do i have to die for the wasteland?"" 'BECAUSE IT'S A CHRIST ALLEGORY"" says Bethesda. *sigh*Bullet sponges at higher levels - A stronger enemy should deal more damage and make you think on your toes, not sit there and take it like the world's least satisfied ♥♥♥♥♥.Still pretty buggy - I've had this game crash on me at least 30 maybe 40 times during my playthrough. Also weird things, like entire chunks of the wastes dissappearing into a strange void, Dogmeat died randomly as i was wandering through an already pilfered vault void of enemies. I had a mind-controlled deathclaw with me from Broken Steel, respawn in Megaton with me after completing said DLC and even after killing it, it respawned sometime later in Point Lookout before being killed by hillbillies.Broken combat - The combat is kinda broken. Sometimes functional, but there would be times in which i wished things were tighter.  I found myself many times dealing with the Combat Shotgun that would fire sometimes and lock up in others. Not a lot of replay value - They just offer slightly different still framed images depending on karma level, but tell nothing of the actual consequences of your actions or the fates of those involved, like most RPGS would.The GOTY version includes all DLC, which consists of:Broken Steel: the aforementioned DLC that reconns the story's BIG ending plothole. It continues the fight against the Enclave to crush them once and for all. Decently climactic, and you can blow up the Brotherhood if you want to!Operation Anchorage: Help the Outcasts get into a sealed armory for some nifty Winterized T51-b armor by completing a weirdly Call of Duty-esque simulation in prewar Ancorage, Alaska to take it back from them dirty commies!Point Lookout: Travel down south to the swamplands to shoot at mutant rednecks and finish a feud between a ghoul and a brain once and for all. Not bad, but the only thing i remember is the druggy sequence halfway through.The Pitt: Travel north to what was Pittsburgh to join the slaves down in the muck and rise up to either join the slavers or grant long awaited freedom to the slaves. Admittedly, this one actually did make me hestitate, as you must make a choice that doesn't leave you with a ""and they all lived happily ever after"" result in either instance. Not bad.Mothership Zeta: You are abuducted by aliens and must escape! This one was just weird, and not really in a good way. Usually aliens were included in the series as a joke, but this just puts it into the main game with a serious face. Mostly meh, considering that most of the aliens have shields that turn them into bullet sponges.Admittedly, i played New Vegas before i played this one, so some of the things were just annoying, such as the repair system, lack of variety in weapons, and the lack of a Damage Threshold  and Reputation system that previously appeared in Fallout 2. Granted, without Fallout 3 there probably wouldn't have been New Vegas, but there's still so many problems. Its the first stab at a 3D Fallout title, even if it's become appearent that Bethesda doesn't care about it as much as they do the Elder Scrolls series. Think of it as a historical document, even if it doesn't stand up to time.			"

												There's no doubt about it that Fallout 3 is one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, RPG of all time. With unprecedented gameplay, Fallout 3, in a way, paved the road, and remains relevent today. In 2008, Bethesda released Fallout 3, and within two years, they released amazing addon content. Overall, I would buy the Game of the Year Edition over the vanilla copy any day of the week. You get so much more from an already amazing game, such as an even larger map, more quests, more guns, more choice making, and in general, more fun stuff to do. Get this game if you haven't already. You will not regret it, I can assure you that.			"

												My steam profile might say I only have 0.3 hrs or so currently (that may change soon), but I have played this game extensivley on the X-Box 360, and I can say that it is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. The story is so interesting, and your quest seems so important that when you reach a goal, or finish one of the quests it flows so naturally into the next. I could sit down and play this for HOURS (although I could say the same for any Fallout game). The only problem with playing this on steam is that it WILL NOT RUN on WINDOWS 8 or 10 (unless 3rd party software/code manipulation is done, which still might not work). It will work, however, if you run on Windows 7, Vista or XP or if you have a comp that can switch from different versions. Honestly, if you want to play this game, but don't have the right os, don't spend a bunch of money getting Windows 7, just play it on PS3 or X-Box 360. If you enjoy an open yet isolated feeling, an eerie feeling everytime you see something move in the distance, or an enthralling story with exciting combat and endless hours of fun, it doesn't matter what you play it on, as long as you play it.

												Played this on the PS3 and wasted many many hours of my life.  Actually they were not a waste at all. I enjoyed every minute every second.  The ps3 version was buggy.  Now I got myself a proper gaming PC.  I LOVE IT EVEN MORE! This game is amazing.  Appart from the occassional crash (on windows 10) I find deleting all my older saves helps that alot.  This game is a piece of art.  The story line.  The choices.  The consequences.  It really is amazing. And more amzing on desktop.  WOW.  It runs beautifully.   Dogmeat is the best! BUT HOLY HELL Charon is a killing machine.   I sure love those Ghouls.  Love seeing the changes playing from a goody two shoes on the ps3 to playing an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on PC.  I may only be at the start of my fallout 3 journey (again on pc) but those numbers will sure go up fast.  BOOM! 10/10			"

												It seems my Fallout progress isnt being tracked because one of the plugins (FOSE) i run it with makes sure that it doesnt show my hours on record. Besides that i think that Fallout 3 is a strong contender for the greatest game of the generation. Everything about the game, from the enemies, to the characters, to the settings, to the story, to the music, are all so captivating that, when combined with the atmosphere Bethesda have created, makes it near impossible to put the controller down. This game is so massive and epic, even without the DLC's! But with them your looking at a game of epic proportions. Loving every second of this awesome game. One of the greatest open world games all time.			"

												I love Fallout 3! This is a must have game. There is no excuse not to pick up FO3 GOTY next time it is on sale for 75% off (hint winter sale/summer sale). You can thank me later. I have played through this game countless times. I seem to always come back to it. I love most of the DLC just as much (Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta are the best to me). I still remember the ""Deliverance"" feel of Point Lookout that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up the first time I played through). If you have ever had a life (or booty) threatening/life changing experience with some back mountain, hillybilly inbreds that drank battery acid mixed with their own urine to get drunk, you may know what I'm talking about. The whole game isn't like that, of course. You get to do some bad, some good, and a whole lotta of mutant-monster killing, and sometimes even play match maker along the way to resolving your daddy issues.  Unfortunately I currently am having issues with it playing on my newer laptop (unable to recognize newer hardware that did not exist when the game was created). No hope of getting Steam to assist, so I will keep googling them until I figure it out for myself. Totally worth it!			"

												Alrighty, I'll try to make this short.First of all, the game does work on Windows 7, (at least for me it does). The game is known to freeze and such, but there is an easy fix for it, it takes like not even 2 minutes lol. I looked it up on YouTube. Theres a couple really helpful videos I came across. (perhaps not everybody has the same issue so I don't know if the fix for the game freezing is the one and only problem, but that's all it was for me).Second, the game isn't recording my hours for whatever stupid reason, but I have actually invested about 60 hours into the game now. I've completed some of the DLC's, reached level 23, haven't touched the main story much because I've been running around exploring the map. I've lost so much sleep playing this game lol. Simply put, for those of you who love The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, Oblivion, or Morrowind, and want a game that is basically the same exact thing except set in a modern timeline, in an apocalyptic, gritty world (America) with guns.... and absolute freedom to do whatever, this is a game for you. It's 20 bucks, I'd say that's a steal for a game like this, and even better if you catch it on sale.EDIT:[Okay so the game does crash every 2 or 3 hours of playing, which isn't a big deal, but it's still annoying........ ""Fallout 3 launcher has stopped working""] :D			"

												Disclaimer: I got way more hours on this game than shown.TL;DR Pretty good game if you're into Bethesda games, with typical emphasis on dialogue and exploration. Like any Bethesda game don't look here for particularly good gameplay though I would say it's not that bad, but at this point it may feel rather dated for an FPS.I quite enjoyed this game, I rarely replay games, and this is one of the few I have, albeit my second playthrough was quite different from first. First being vanilla, no DLC with second being all DLC + a few of the most well known mods for the game.Story - The main storyline is... Ok. Nothing special but passable for Bethesda main quest. As usual, side quests are where it's at for interesting story chunks. Though the last main mission is pretty epic. Setting - Awesome world to explore. Chronologically it feels off but ignoring that, the world really gets what it set out to do, a lonesome nuked world. You can have plenty of fun simply walking around the world.Gameplay - Pretty loose, wonky for an FPS. Personally on vanilla Fallout I just used VATS all the time. I wouldn't praise the game much for the gameplay, personally I find VATS to be decent but it's no top tier shooter or rpg in terms of action gameplay. Late game the game gets really easy, nothing will kill you once you hit higher levels. The dialogue system is great though and allows for choices that seem to matter, unlike fallout 4. The leveling system is great. All in all, the game is an rpg first shooter second.Audio - The ambient non-radio music is very fitting, probably underrated since few actually listen to it. The radio has got those distinctive oldies retro songs everybody has come to love. Gun sounds are fine. The voices used for characters are pretty good.Mods - The mod support for this game is top of the line. You can easily mod it to feel very different. Good♥♥♥♥♥♥Lore - Something worth pointing out, though probably not an impact to many is that this game is NOT lore friendly to Fallout 1 or 2. This one of the biggest criticisms of this game, though many have not played those games (including myself) so you probably don't care, but it is what it is.Really if you really enjoy Bethesda type games, where you just explore the world, get interesting sidequests, have great dialogue with npcs, then this really does it right. Just don't expect an amazing shooter, or a pretty looking game.			"

												My love for this game is limitless. It's the game that brought the Fallout world into 3D and away from top-down turn based strategy. The story was rich enough to keep me immersed, and the map was large enough to keep me exploring for months.  Beyond the glitches here and there, I've really got nothing bad to say about Fallout 3. It's well worth keeping in your library, even if you have the later installments of the Fallout Universe. Also, Dogmeat rules.			"

												Fallout 3 is one of the best examples of the FPS-RPG Hybrid genre, combining the sprawling depth of a traditional isometric RPG  with the reflex-rewarding immersion of an FPS.  Rather than dumbing down the game to fit the expectations of the fast-twitch FPS gamer, Fallout 3 keeps nearly all of the Fallout series' trademark complexity, nuanced plot, numerous areas to explore and seemingly endless sidequests.  All this adds up to a truly HUGE sandbox game that you can easily spend hundreds of hours on, never getting bored.That is not to say that Fallout 3 is perfect.  Like most Bethesda titles, Fallout 3 has quite a few bugs, ranging from minor to serious.  Hardly surprising given the sheer scale of the thing, and percentage wise it's a very small portion of the game.  Of course, the bug problem itself leads me to mention one of the best things about Fallout 3: moddability.Fallout 3 is one of the most moddable games ever released on PC, with mods not only supported but encouraged by the publisher.  While you can't get into the nitty gritty of the engine itself using the SDK (unlike most Source or early Unreal games), basically everything else is fair game for being modded.  This can range from the mundane to the fantastic, anything from increases in weapon damage to entirely new plots with numerous side-quests and fully voiced dialog.  Fallout 3 in itself is an amazing game, but with the appropriate mods - chosen from the literally thousands available - it can become truly awe-inspiring.Mods can also include fixes to the bugs that Bethesda left in the game.  Yes, Bethesda may not have fixed all their mistakes in Fallout 3, but they at least left behind tools so that the fans can.All that said, what you should take away from this review is that Fallout 3 is a really, really, really good game.  It takes very little time - as little as fifteen minutes - before the game has thoroughly sucked you in, and once you're hooked you can spend literally hundreds of hours playing and enjoying.  At time of writing I have more than 200 hours logged on the game and there are STILL areas in the Capital Wasteland I am encountering for the first time.  That's serious replayability.			"

I bought this game not too long ago, for 19.99, I also pre-purchased Fallout4, and then they suddenly put Fallout3 GoTY edition on sale for half of what I paid a week or so ago, for 9.99, which obviously aggravates me a bit.4. If you are just now buying Fallout3, for the 9.99 price, AND if you aren't using Win7, then I would say...why not buy it, for 9.99. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend.			"

												Fallout 3 was my first foray into Bethesda as a company and a developer. Originally completed on the PS3 years ago, the quality of Fallout 3 warranted another purchase for the PC. It was a purchase that I did not regret. Fallout 3's 1950's representation of a post-apocalyptic setting is both visually stunning and conceptually very well done. It manages to deliver an astonishingly accurate world that attempts to keep what we know of the 50's in check, yet sprinkling it with a dose of future technology and the consequences of said technology - which effectively suspends the 50's style similiarily to what the Dark Ages did after the enlightened Renaissance period. Fallout 3's characters are as much ""of the times"", as they are diverse. The NPC's mannerisms, beliefs, and way of life are decidely 50's oriented. There are the mutants, the human enclaves, the militant powers, the underdwellers, and the radioactive fauna. These factions breathe life into an admittedly grey, dead world (as befits a post-nuclear setting).Fallout 3 is a dark, gritty story based on the freedom of exploration, role-playing, and as such is what makes the game so incredibly entertaining. There is a linear story, but it's not essential to get the feel of the game because in almost every title of this game type, the side quest content far outweighs that of the linear ""campaign"". Mechanics are simple, the movement a tad clunky, and the combat a tad frustrating. Melee is essentially whack and run, and aiming down sites is near nonexistent. To combat this shortcoming Fallout 3 makes use of VATS, which enables you to aim and fire at specific parts of the body, greatly increasing accuracy and a chance at survival. This aspect incorporates melee as well. There are two incredible soundtracks within the game, the usual OST and in this case, the radio station. These two soundtracks add much to the overall quality of the atmosphere, and in turn the end product.I highly recommend the fantastic Fallout 3.			"

												Basically an Elder Scrolls game done up in ""Fallout"" drag (and I don't mean that as a compliment).  As always Bethesda is awesome at art direction and level design, but terrible at writing and world design.  So whereas the earlier ""Fallout"" games were loaded with the sorts of detail and humor which made their worlds feel alive, playing this just feels like wandering through a wax museum.  It's pretty to look at at first glance, but the novelty soon gives way to an uncanny valley type queasiness which ultimately gives way to boredom.  Skip this and play ""New Vegas"" instead.			"

												Fallout 3 does many things right. The most important of its strengths in my opinion, however, is its ability to immerse the player in an atmosphere filled with choice, unique experiences, and a world worth exploring.The Fallout franchise has always done these things right, but Fallout 3 brought a new atmosphere and a new set of mechanics to an already great model. These mechanics all work extremely well and make Fallout 3 a revolutionary game. The combination of the dialogue system, V.A.T.S., and the functionality of the Pip Boy make gameplay smooth yet still very refreshing. The primary narrative is strong and supports the immersion of the gameplay, while the entirety of the wasteland is filled with areas full of depth and story that is present in almost no other game.Revisiting Fallout 3 has only confirmed the undeniable strengths and with each playthrough, the player will surely find new areas and characters worth exploring and experiencing. For these reasons, Fallout 3, along with its predecessors, stand alone in their own sect of games. Along with these strengths, Fallout 3 added a certain undefineable charm as it broke into the 3-dimensional realm. NPCs, the world, and the physics make playing the game a real joy and keep a smile on your face the entire time.Fallout 3 is a must-own game and represents a special era in gaming in my personal opinion.

												Both Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 are the reason why Fallout is my favourite RPG! The feel, the world, the people, the conflict etc..  Its just amazing! I cant get enough, I played both fallouts on XBOX 360 for hundreds of hours and even %100 Fallout 3. And when I got into PC gaming those were the first from my console liberary that had to go with me to PC. Speaking of PC, I cant believe I now have even more hours to these games thanks to mods.   If you are not caught up in school and have the time to get addicted, than buy both, 10/10PS:  Level Speech and Medicine to 100% before anything else. Than Barter. Thank me later ;)			"

												To everyone that says this game will not run on new machines, dont assume that, its a case by case bases, I have a newer PC running win 8.1 with a quad core processor, the game works perfectly fine for me, havent had to mess with any files to get it to run. If you want the game remember to keep in mind that it MIGHT not work, but there are ways to fix it.			"

												Awesome game in my opinion. Bethesda made a great job. They made a whole world with lots of quests and the best part is there are many ways to get it done. Also the game rewards being a guy, who has to check every corner for some kind of weapon/whatever. I guarantee you will be pleased if you buy this game.			"

												Fallout 3 as it stands is one of the best video games of all time and if you havent played it you are really missing out on a great title. As it stands this version of Fallout may cause some issues with your computer if you don't use mods or know how to mod due to the fact that it's not optimised for  Windows 7 or any newer version. If however you are able to get this to work there are many good parts to this game.Pros-Massive open world-Great modability -Interesting story-Great leveling and perks system-Almost infinite replay value as 2 characters are never alike-Many easter eggs and secrets to find-Great DLC (not needed to have fun)However like many games there are a couple issues with the game itselfCons-Bugs (can be fixed to some extent with mods)-Frequent crashesOverall this game even with the bugs and crashes is a 9.6/10 and seriously worth playing. Just be wary if you try to buy this title for the PC due to the incompatibility.			"

												Originally when you download Fallout 3 GOTY it isn't compatible with Windows 10 and the game will crash after clicking play on the launcher. This is because Windows 10 is missing a Games for Windows Live document. A quick download will fix this. Then you will be ale to go as far as the main menu for the game and then it will crash. If you have an Intel Graphics card then you will need to download an Intel bypass from Nexus mods and drop it into your GOTY folder. If you have a multi-core PC then you will have to edit the games files to allow it to use multiple cores. If you are using Windows 10 then I suggest opening your desktop Steam application and right clicking on Fallout 3 GOTY. From here go to Properties and then to Compatibility. Select Run in Compatibility mode with: Windows 7. Also select Run this program as an administrator. Games for Windows Live download:http://www.xbox.com/en-CA/Live/PC/DownloadClientThis video shows how to edit the Fallout 3 file to use multiple cores and the GFWL download:

			This is everything I had to do in order to play fallout 3 on my PC. It took me awhile to fix the issue but hopefully this help.		

This link is to Nexus for the Intel Bypass mod:http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/17209/?When you download the Intel bypass, open a new File Explorer tab and open the Intel Bypass package. Open your Fallout GOTY file which is in your Steam/steamapps/common. In your Intel bypass package, drag the D3D9 file into your Fallout GOTY folder. Make sure it says 'Copy to Fallout GOTY file'. I recommend playing this game through a couple times without mods. This way you really appreciate the work Bethesda did and the mod authors later on.			"

												IF YOU WANT TO RUN THIS GAME ON WINDOWS 8-10There are two things that you can do, i recommend the second option i will mention, however i feel that it is necessary to at least mention the first:-First Option: 


YouTube™ Video: Installing Fallout 3 on Windows 10 

			Views: 154,470		

			Installing Fallout 3 on Windows 10 - Pretty straight forward, I had no issues playing the game for a bit so I decided to put up a video on the installation.		

 ^ this video should help and probably will help a lot of others. This however did not help me.-Second option: the second thing you can do will work 100%, however you will need new vegas. ^ there is a mod called TTW(Tale of Two Wastelands) which combines the two games into one, where you can go to the capital wasteland and the mojave back and forth. This mod wil allow you to play the entirety of fallout 3 inside of New Vegas' Engine. This is what i do(hence the litttle ammount of hours in new vegas, although i don't play 3 that much since you cannot role play that much in it.I hope this helps out some people that are having issues with this game running. IMPORTANT NOTE WITH SECOND OPTION:-New vegas now does not run by default on windows 10 since the anniversary update, a workaround is to install new vegas anti-crash: this will allow the game to run and not have any issues. Hope this helps!			"

												-Crashes more than my old Windows Vista computer. Exploded a man's pants for his rifle and hat only to find that I had orphaned his son. Felt so bad that I decided to murder everyone in Megaton and then nuke the hell out of the place. Felt even worse so I killed everyone in the Tenpenny tower, fled to Paradise Falls and began working as a slaver. Sold a bunch of innocent kids to slavery and used that money to buy psycho. Then I became addicted to psycho. Started murdering innocent people to fund my psycho addiction. Fled to the middle of nowhere to hide from my enemies. Got abducted by a bunch of aliens. After getting anally probed, I banded together with a bunch of fellow abductees to beat the aliens into submission. Used my favorite super sledge to massacre everyone that had helped me escape. Decided to go to Little Lamplight and finally beat the little snots with my new superior alien technology. Found out children are invincible. Still hacking and slashing. 10/10 best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulator to date.			"

												I haven't played this much yet since I aquired it on Steam, but I bought it on disc when it was released and I purchased each individual DLC upon release as well. I don't remember exactly how many hours I spent playing this game back in 2008 and 2009, but it must have been close to 100 hours. As a huge Fallout fan since the first back in the mid 90s, this was just the ultimate awesome!This is truly one of the few games that kept me glued to my screen for a half a day at a time or more. I remember one week-end when I got home from work on Friday evening and played pretty much through to Sunday evening non-stop (minus food and required hygene etc.), but not many games have been able to do this! It's so immersive, so atmospheric and you just want to keep going until the next level, the next upgrade, the next weird encounter.The GOTY edition includes all the DLCs, so you can definitely no go wrong here. If you have never played Fallout 3 yet (or any of the other Fallouts -- an complete sacrilege if you ask me!!), then play. Seriously, leave your vault and play. This is pretty much an all-time-hall-of-fame game			"

												Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition is my 200th game review, it is also the first in a trilogy of Fallout games released since 2005, which are a continuation of the original Fallout series for the PC. Fallout 3 takes us to Vault 101, where you play as a male/female character of your choice who leaves the vault to search for their father. Along the way you encounter struggling towns, various NPC's, complete quests, explore, and dungeon delve buildings, ruins, and other vaults as you progress through the story.Fallout 3 is a First Person RPG where you interact with your environment and engage in FPS-style combat with enemies. It has an impressive list of voice actors and an immersive story that pulls you into the world of the Post-Apocalyptic Capital Wasteland, essentially the ruins of what was once Washington, DC. Fallout 3 was a blast to play on the PS3, as well as the PC and spawned 2 sequels which take place after the events of 3. If you enjoy post-apocalyptic games as well as FPS combat and RPG's, I recommend picking this game up and giving it a try. The Game of the year edition comes with all 5 DLC's included, so make sure you pick up this particular edition to get the full Fallout experience. Don't forget to tune into Galaxy News Radio, and everyone's favorite disk jockey, Three Dog, for some memorable dialogue and music.			"

												October 31, 2008. Finally, after more than 10 years I would be able to continue my adventures in my most beloved franchise ever 'Fallout' (I did not count Fallout Tactics, which I also loved). I was sceptical at first, since this would be first Fallout game made by Bethesda. Like others, I did not just want a 'Oblivion with guns', also being on the East-Coast would feel differently, compared to the other games in the series. Right from the start the hand of Bethesda was clearly visible. Starting the game as a baby/toddler/teenager was probably not what Black Isle would've done. Also the storytelling is a bit more childish and immature (like in Oblivion). The story was praised by many and even got an award for best story that year. In my opinion, the story(telling) is one of the worst parts about the game. If you have played Fallout 1 and 2, you will notice the story of Fallout 3 is simply Fallout 1 & 2's story put together. There are also weird locations/quests and multiple things that do not really add up to the Fallout lore.Aside from the story, Bethesda still did manage to create a beautifully post-apocalyptic world and kept the Fallout feeling mostly throughout the game. Graphically, the game has aged but it's still well playable.The thing I love most about Fallout 3 is just wandering around the Capital Wasteland and find new locations, items/weapons/armor and/or easter eggs. Often you will enounter various enemies and npc's which either want to help you or destroy you. Gameplay is fun aswell. Killing enemies feels satisfying, there are tons of weapons for you play around with, quests to finish, secret locations.... there's just too much for me to write down. simply put, Fallout 3 will most likely enjoy you for hundreds of hours and is a must-have for every RPG-lover.

Posted: October 10, 2015
												Fallout 3, surprisingly, is a game that was actually developed and made by Bethesda, and not a fan made mod. This is surprising because from just playing it, it can be hard to tell at times. I know I'm late to writing this review, but I wanted to remind both myself and anyone who reads this of how Fallout 3 was in case Fallout 4 doesn't seem as good as it looks when it comes out. (It may not look like it with the 90 minutes I have tracked, but I have completed the game twice; once from a retail copy and more recently through New Vegas using the Tale of Two Wastelands mod.)Fallout 3 is set in the Capital Wasteland, a new location set on the opposite side of the US from the traditional west coasts of Fallout 1, 2, and later New Vegas. By doing this, they allowed themselves to have a clean slate of sorts, and have more creative freedom in writing the story. So naturally, being skilled writers as they are, they just copied a bunch of stuff from the old games and rewrote it to be worse. The Brotherhood of Steel is back, only this time they're a splinter faction that's a bunch of goodie two-shoes that go from shunning you to thanking you for letting them bask in your presence over the course of one quest (the ""real"" brotherhood is still technically there in the form of the Outcasts, but they barely have any presence in the game). The Enclave is back for no real reason at all, considering they were pretty much ended in 2. They made up their own east coast brand of super mutant just so they could flood the game with them. Even things like caps don't really make sense, since the only reason caps were used as currency in the west coast games is because they were backed by the Hub. The whole game just feels like they went through a picture book of Fallout and saw cool things and went ""hey that looks cool, let's put it in our game too!"" without really thinking that much about why they would actually be there.Gameplay-wise, the game is a mixed bag. The exploration can be pretty fun, especially with mods like DC Interiors (which opens up a bunch of the boarded up buildings that Bethesda was too lazy to furnish), but the shooting is fairly subpar, and you can tell that the engine wasn't really built for shooting games at that stage of its development. Of course, you can always use VATS if you'd rather watch the game play itself instead, since it's effectively been turned into an easy button that lets you have 5 turns to blow an enemy to pieces and then gives the enemy one. The whole stat system is a joke, and between the rate you get perks, the perks added by DLCs, and the bobbleheads scattered throughout the world, it's almost impossible to not end up with 10 in every SPECIAL stat and 100 in every skill by the time you finish the game. Because it's basically impossible to specialize in any particular ability due to inevitably having to specialize in all of them, and the fact that the game doesn't really give you any major choices that have actual consequences, it can be difficult to feel like you're actually roleplaying in Fallout 3. But that's fine, because it's pretty much impossible with the dialogue anyways. The dialogue options are, as best as I can describe them, schizophrenically written. You can blow up an entire settlement and laugh it off, then five minutes later meet a group of people you believe to be cannibals and have no dialogue option to say anything other than something negative towards them. At one point early in the game you meet a ghoul bartender, and your only options are two choices of mocking him and the last option, ""Let me think about it for a moment, my good man."", which is so cringey that I can only assume that if Bethesda's animators had any talent it would be accompanied by an animation of the player character tipping an imaginary top hat and taking a puff from a wooden pipe. Most of the intelligence choices are just repeating what someone just said to you back to them in a summarized form written in an overly wordy way, and a lot of the speech checks go beyond ridiculousness in terms of convincing people or things to do things they would never realistically do in a single sentence. The game has a karma system, but I don't know if it's even possible to keep a negative karma level because of how much of it you get dumped onto you just for things like killing ghouls or raiders (which are impossible to allign with because Fallout 3 has no faction system), but it doesn't really matter because it's not even that much fun to play evil. There are no real meaningful evil choices, just a bunch of ""for the laughs"" things. There are one or two noteworthy evil moments and then the rest of it is just ""ahaha i shoot you in the face"" options in dialogue that just aren't really fulfilling, and some of them are just plain nonsensical and make no sense for the player to do, like the one at the end of the Broken Steel DLC. The game also has two factions that hunt you down depending on whether your karma is too high or low, but while the evil karma version is a group of lawbringers who are hunting you down because you're a known criminal, the good varient just gets Talon Company, a mercenary unit that Bethesda just made up and gave no backstory aside from ""they're bad guys and so they want to kill good guys because they're really bad people!"" and set them loose on you.The DLC is about what you would expect so far. Operation Anchorage is essentially just a 3 hour crappy military corridor FPS with a few good rewards, Mothership Zeta is a crappy space corridor shooter with a few good rewards, and Broken Steel is only worth playing because of the fact that it basically forces you to after the end of the base game. The Pitt and Point Lookout are basically the only ones that I would consider ""good"", with the former being a brief but interesting quest line and a relatively fun collectathon with some good rewards and the latter being the only dlc to give a more open experience in a new map with new side quests and things to explore. If it wasn't for the fact that the GOTY edition costs the same as buying regular fallout 3 + point lookout + the pitt I'd just tell you to buy those, but oh well.Fallout 3 is what I would consider a ""popcorn RPG"". It's the kind of game where you can spend 100 hours just exploring the wasteland and looting buildings and doing side quests and then remember that there's a boring main storyline for you to do, but it's not a game where you have to make choices or develop a character or anything associated with more in-depth RPGs, and while to an extent I feel that way about all of Bethesda's post-Morrowind RPGs, Fallout 3 in particular exemplifies the concept. If you're new to the Fallout series you may love it, or if you've played them all you can probably still just forget that it's a Fallout game and have fun exploring, but it's both a terrible RPG and a terrible Fallout game. It's extremely unstable on its own, so either modding it to high heaven or playing it through New Vegas in the A Tale of Two Wastelands mod (which requires both games and all of their DLC) is basically required. If you have time to kill and just want to relax in the wasteland for a little while, there's no reason not to buy Fallout 3 if it's on sale and you've got nothing else to play, but there just isn't anything exceptional that would prompt me to actively recommend the game. Hopefully Bethesda will have learned from New Vegas when we get to play Fallout 4.			"

												If you are from Germany:For the love of god don't waste your money on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ region-locked, voiced-over version of an otherwise excellent game.No characteristic Liam Neeson dad, no proper Threedog ""OWWW!""s, etc. Some of the OST was also cut from the original.I've always felt that the awesome soundtrack and voicing in this game made half the experience and voila: They ♥♥♥♥ it up because some chair-farting lawmakers and publishers got their panties in a bunch and won't allow you to enjoy this classic the way it was meant to be enjoyed.They're hacking and whacking and smacking,Hacking and whacking and smacking,Hacking and whacking and smacking,THEY JUST HACK, WHACK, CHOPPING DIS GAME :(			"

												By Far my favorite game. I have played this game for over 200 hours on consoles, both good and bad karma gameplay. I am also playing the game on my computer right now with mods so its not showing my total hours, but im probably going to get just as much. well, let me say, this game is awesome if you love skyrim and open world games. Skyrim with guns pretty much. Post apocolyptic, great combat, kinda old but still amazing. Graphics are kind of old but the content is great, and the world is huge and there is much to explore. If you were thinking of getting this game, get it. Its amazing and by now you should have it. Great  combat, vats is fun, good rpg mechanics, with good stat diversity and character diversity. Get it.			"

												Fallout 3, the game itself, is fantastic. But do not buy it. The installation is plagued with compatibility issues, necessitating you to go reading through third party guides just to find out how to properly install the game you paid for. Then, in game, there are other issues you have to constantly be aware of or else your game will crash. For example, did you know you cannot save over old save files? If you do, and load your game, it will freeze and crash every single time. There is no in game warning for this, just as there is no warning on the game page that this game is incompatible for most computers made after 2007 (as I've said, you have to read through third party guides and install third party mods just to play the vanilla version of the game).I do not know how it's legal to sell a broken product with no official warning given to potential customers. They use weasel langauge and say that the game is not 'Optimized' for Windows 7 and beyond instead of outright saying it will not work, which is the issue. Hopefully some people decide to read the reviews about the game on Steam and realize just how much of a headache they'll be going through just to install and play the normal, unmodded version of the game. And don't forget - never, ever save over an old save file (a bug the programmers never warn you about nor one they give you option to disabled) or else you can say goodbye to hours of gameplay. Fallout 3 - the game itself is great. Installation is a massive problem (for no reason, since it's still possible to install with third party mods not officially created or endorsed by Bethesda, the game creators), and there are too many game ruining bugs. Seeing as how it's been years since this game was released, these issues are obviously never going to be addressed by the company - I suppose it's just easier to slap an extremely vague warning (hidden in the middle of the sale page) and just keep letting unaware customers continue buying a game they don't support than it is to have some integrity and intiative and fix the game. If you must play this game, find circular means - Bethesda obviously does not care about their customers consuming experience. Given their treatment of customers, I will not buy (nor recommend anyone else to buy) any other games from Bethesda, Fallout 4 included. They are still charging a hefty price for a broken game (giving no warning to customers about the broken software), which can only be played with software created by dedicated fans who receive a sum total of zero dollars for making Bethesda's product workable for them. What a despicable company.			"

												Although I'm a dear fan to the Fallout series, I cannot bring myself to recommend this game to ANYONE until they read what I'll say about the game. And if, but only if, you can read through all the faults of the game and still want it, then I would recommend it.The story for Fallout3 is something that starts out interesting. You begin as a small child to explore the world and quickly progress through your life until your father decides to hop on out of your life. This will lead you to begin your search through the wasteland in hopes of finding your father and question why he left. Sadly this fresh new idea will leave you scratching your head by the end of the game wondering why over and over again. More than once you find yourself 'ambushed' and cutscened away unable to do anything. Othertimes you'll find yourself facing a decision where you cannot, CANNOT, choose the most reasonable option just because. Although the main story is full of these moments, I often found myself in side-quests almost slackjawed in awe at some of the situations the game placed me in. So while the main story is lackluster, there are some interesting side-quests within the game that can make up for the main story.Combat. Oh lord, the combat for this game. You have literally two options to pick from either you A.) Shoot thousands of rounds at an enemy until they die or B.) Use VATS to instantly vaporize your opponent with no problems. And although many might argue with my description of the combat, clearly these people have never played melee runs or min-maxed their talent points properly to become completely broken. Overall it's combat falls flat just like the TES Bethesda games which require you to simply click your Mouse 1 button enough times. Sadly dialogue with other characters often falls flat and you'll find yourself in a stale world where I truly felt ALONE despite being around ten or so characters.I really cannot say anything bad about the soundtrack, most of the game consisted of real world songs which were all fantastic for their time and fit in with the atmosphere that Fallout 3 has to offer.Overall the game suffers from a poor story with terrible gameplay mechanics, where the side-quests and looting seem to be the only redeeming features of the game.

												Out of any company that could've gotten the rights to the Fallout franchise it had to be Bethesda, the company notorious for dumbing down the Scrolls series, Fallout was once an intricate RPG that focused on character progression, decision making that actually had an impact on the world around you, deep interaction with NPC's and using tactics to overcome tough disadvantages.Fallout 3 is nothing more than an action game in an open world, with barely any RPG elements at all besides for upgrading your players stats everytime you level up, which have no consequence as to how your game plays out seeing as it's so damn easy in any case, as you basically role play as Superman which allows you to put little regard in thought when it comes to building your character.The decision making, which is an extremely massive part in every true RPG's soul, has been narrowed down to ""Good guy/Bad guy"" decisions rather than offering you multiple options, each which have a consequential impact minor or big that make you feel more involved with the world. The plot, another important aspect of RPG, is as generic and un-inspired as they come, a 12 year old could've written this.In Fallout 3 there is NEVER any sense of danger, ever, you can traverse from one end of the map to the other with ease, unlike the older games in which travelling was a major risk and each encounter felt like it could be your last. I really hope they're using a better team for Fallout 4 because if it's anything like this dumbed down generic open world FPS it's going to stink, if you really want to play a modern Fallout, I'd suggest you play New Vegas, they attempt to fix most of the issues in this mess otherwise you're better off playing Fallout 1 and 2.

												While I am not entirely sure about Windows 7 32bit and Windows Vista 32 bit, but I can tell you this game does run on Windows 7 64bit and Vista 64 bit.  1.  Go to the ""Documents\My Games\Fallout3"" directlory in your user account.2. Open the file ""FALLOUT.INI"" file using a text editor (preferably WordPad).  3.  On the Keyboard press Ctrl+F and look fo the line ""bUseThreadedAI=0"" (without quotes) and replace it with ""bUseThreadedAI=1""4.  ***IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE LINE IN STEP 3*** add the following WITHOUT quotes ""iNumHWThreads=n"" and REPLACE ""n"" with the number of cores your CPU has.5.  Exit wordpad and save changes when prompted to.6.  In your steam library, Right-click on Fallout 3 and browse the local files of the game.7.  Right click on ""Fallout3.exe"" and got to the ""Compatibility"" Tab and check ""Run progream as an administrator"", ""Disable display scaling on high DPI"", and ""Run this program in compatibility mode"" and select Which ever version of Windows XP your OS lets you select.8.  Do the same thing you did in Step 7 to ""FalloutLauncher.exe""And there you have it :-)			"

												One of my most favorite games. First of all lets get this out of the way. The game is old, and the graphics aren't the best. But Bethesda doesn't care about graphics in their games. They care about the world and the story, and how free you are. You walk around post nuclear Washington DC. Being the good guy, bad guy, dude who doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing care, or whatever you can come up with.  The game never ceases to remind you of how ♥♥♥♥ed everything is. And some of the most interesting quests in rpgs come from this game. There are very few repetitive quests, unless you find the game mechanics repetitive (talking, walking, shooting.)  Another elephant I want to get out of the way; there is no aim-down-sights or sprint, and the game is not very immersive (due to bugs mostly.) But thanks to being on the pc, you don't have to worry about most bugs (game breaking ones, ones that make you reload to the last save because you are stuck in space), due to mods! ADS, sprinting, and bug fixes out the♥♥♥♥♥(for modding tutorials, I suggest gopher on youtube.) Basically after playing this game again just using about 2 or 3 mods, I realized what a jewel fallout 3 is, it gets you attached to things very easily, but mostly things like Megaton, robots, that black lady who gives you stimpacks, Hobo McDirtFace, even♥♥♥♥♥♥like teddy bears (if you have hoarding problems this game doesn't help.) But one thing you don't get attached to is your dad. I mean the story is engrossing but you don't really see much of him. Liam Neeson voices him but he only has about 30 or so lines because the amount of times you see is slim. You look for your dad half the game and you would suggest Bethesda to do something with the talent they had. All in all, great game, mods make it better. I tried to make this review trying not to be a parrot, but some things I think are shared opinions.			"

Posted: November 4, 2015
												Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition is a 2008/09 post-apocalyptic role-playing game that takes place in desolate wasteland of Washington DC. You play as the Lone Wanderer, who travels on a journey to find your Father (voiced by Liam Neeson) in the wasteland. Leaving Vault 101 takes personal risks and responsibility. Would you do the same?Fallout 3 starts in the year, 2277, 200 years after the Resource War (United States versus China in a fight for remaining sources on Earth) ended suddenly due to atomic weaponry inflicting against the United States and the rest of the world. Washington DC takes the most damage due to its strategic and political significance. The question remains: What was your Father’s intention to leave Vault 101? The main story is good though some people argued that the plot is decent. In my perspective, the plot is typical and good. It’s not the best or have a strong presentation, but it’s good overall. The real reason for playing Fallout 3 has to be exploration and doing major side quests. Exploring the unknown world of post-apocalyptic Washington DC feels so amazing and worrisome at the same time. These two emotions is what makes the game feel so great. The setting is unpredictable. You may find an abandoned settlement that has a mysterious past,  reading journal entries on what caused a location to fall apart, or some batsh*t crazy thing comes to you when you almost finish investigating an area. The gameplay is primarily first-person or third-person shooter that place strong emphasis on your gameplay type. You can go guns blazing, get a companion and do some killing, conduct stealth and light skirmishes, or just explore alone in the Capital Wasteland. What makes Fallout 3’s gameplay a bit special is the V.A.T.S (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) where you “paused” the game while targeting an enemy’s legs, arms, equipped weapon, and the head. The feature is pretty nice and does help you in dire situations. However, it’s a bit unfortunate that V.A.T.S makes the game paused and not real-time. The stealth mechanic is a mixed bag. You can practically invest a lot of points towards the Stealth skill to make your stealth “level” to what suits you. If your Stealth skill is low then the enemy will “automatically” notice you even when the enemy is not facing you and you are crouch-walking towards an unsuspected enemy. What frustrates me the most was that there is no iron sight or aiming down your equipped weapon. Aiming is mostly useless and “hip-fire” the equipped weapon seems to be what’s best. Is there criticisms for Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition? Fallout 3 is definitely not perfect. There are a lot of technical issues and bugs that Bethesda Games Studios neglected. Many PC users now have Windows 7, 8/8.1, and Windows 10 and a high majority will most likely have an major technical issue that can or cannot be fixed. The games does crash to desktop in modern PC architecture due to no support of multi-core processing (when the game came out, it was dual-core). The solution is there to fix it, but it does not fully bandage the problem. The NPCs look stale, but mods do help make it better. The most critical aspect of the game is the karma system. In a post-apocalyptic setting, any person would know that there’s no (or little) black-or-white scenarios. The karma system is a good concept, but heavily flawed since conducting bad “actions” like stealing or pickpocketing is treated like a horrid sin.The review sounds critical but why does it gives a thumbs up? The answer is simple: It is fun. I remembered when I got the Fallout 3 Collector’s Edition back in October 2008 (where you get the concept art book, featurette DVD, the vault boy bobblehead, and a lunchbox (yes, an actual lunchbox). Fallout 3 crash to desktop so often that I’ve lost count. For some reason, I didn’t too angry about it (even though I should have). Fallout 3 was the first video game that I actually got so immersive to. The setting draws you in and exploration is so much fun. Fallout 3 is one of a very few games that gameplay matters over graphics and “minor” flaws. Does the sequels like Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4 improved over Fallout 3? Certainly. Fallout 3’s default price is at $19.99 (for Game of the Year Edition). I’ve strongly recommend (for those who haven’t play Fallout 3) to get it on a steep discount of -75% ($5 USD or regional equivalent) since the game faces technical issues on today’s PC systems. Fallout 3 is certainly not top-tier game (when looking at it today), but the game was a marvelous achievement for a first-person shooter to be in an open-world setting.			"

												You are born in the vault, and you'll die in the vault. That is until you go out into the Wasteland, to die out there instead. And instead of dying by the hands of old age, or some incurable disease, you will die by the hands of Deathclaws and Super Mutants, or maybe you'll be too busy reloading to stop time and take a stimpack.This game is like a ghoul, old but still alive. The fact that it is on Steam (and playable with a quick patching) shows this. I, for one stopped playing Fallout 3 for ages, and then when buying it on Steam I somehow played for over 70 hours, without even realising it.There are so many ways to play this game, some can choose to be good, evil, neutral or even differing between them. Almost every quest has an optional (or even a few optional) choices, to make the decisions and outcomes different depending on who plays it. What ever karma you play as, it always come back to bite you on the rear, even being good can get on someone's bad side. Although being the 'Lone Wanderer' you will never be alone (unless you're in Point Lookout), you will always have Dogmeat following you around, or whatever various companions to fight for you. If fighting for yourself is your thing, Three Dog will always be there to talk about your travels and to play some tunes through the radio. While fighting a Super Mutant, I'm Tickled Pink will play, when scavenging through the Super Duper Mart, Butcher Pete will play, when travelling through the underground metro system, Let's Go Sunning will play and at whatever other inappropriate moment, music will play. Three Dog's voice will become your last source of comfort in a world torn apart from war, in a world made ugly, in a world filled with pain, Three Dog will be there for you.This game will never lose my interest, nor will I ever forget about it. Fallout 3 will always have a place on my consoles (And PC) and in my heart. Throughout the years I will revisit it and fall in love with it all over again, because games, games never change.			"

												Instead of reviewing Fallout 3 itself I'll just list the DLC and why they're great and/or not so great. Operation Anchorage:You find a group of Brotherhood Outcasts attempting to enter a simulation of Operation Anchorage, which was the deciding battle in the war with the Americans and the Chinese. They send you in there and allow you access to the armory before anyone else if you succeed. All and all, great DLC, adds some tactical strategy to the game which can be ignored if you really want to, great loot (although a bit broken, but nothing a mod can't fix) and a lovely story to play. The Pitt: A very dark and gritty industrial city plagued by a disease, and the raider boss has the only cure. You are sent in to infiltrate as a slave and work your way up to meet Ashur, the raider boss that rules the Pitt. What you do from there on out is entirely up to you. Great story, amazing weapons and armor, lots of new places to explore and I must say the aesthetics are very good. It's real eye candy for those who like a post-apocalyptic industrial setting. Broken Steel:Pretty good dlc, adds a decent story line and some good loot. Not as wild as most other DLCs but it fixes some problems people had with the main game (nobody needs to die at the end, can continue playing afterwards). It's quite challenging and pretty badass but not the greatest. Point Lookout:This DLC tries a LOT of things. Yet fails to make ANY of them work out well. The following will contain some spoilers but trust me, you're not missing out. It starts off with you taking the ferry of a nice man to search for treasure in a new area. Once you're there you see what seems like a deformed man with an axe appearing from the mist in the distance as you dock at a pier with a huge ferris wheel. Then I thought this would be a horror-carnival-mist setting. But no, the axe hillbilly is just a random throw-away enemy with hundreds of them in the land, with equally weird misshapen hillbilly friends. There's nothing to do at the pier either, no elaboration on anything encountered so far. So we're told to go to a mansion in the distance. It seemed like a nice place, really fancy, withstood the apocalypse fairly well. Once you enter you encounter Tribals attempting to kill a ghoul who lives in the mansion, and a smart one at that judging by the turrets, cameras, tamed dogs and speakers all over the mansion. Cool I thought, civilisation vs tribes maybe? Nope. Once you're send to infiltrate the tribes you find out they're stupid drooling addicts that had part of their brain removed. Joining them involves the only interesting part of the entire DLC so I won't spoil that. But afterwards you're send to find the leader. And you go to the cave. And it's just a regular guy. Talking to a hologram brain. Apparently the brain was a scientist that has been battling the ghoul from the mansion for centuries. Soon after you find this out you go to the final confrontation, which doesn't even matter because you need to kill one of the two people anyway. So your choice is kill just this guy or both these guys. Remember the hillbillies? No backstory. No funny quotes. Nothing. The tribe? Just scammed idiots. The mansion? Nothing special. The pier and ferris wheel? Used once in the story but not even in an interesting way. This DLC tries SO MUCH. But it fails to deliver even one of them. If anything, get this DLC just to imagine what could have been, it'd be more interesting than the DLC itself. Mothership Zeta:By far the best Fallout DLC in any fallout game so far. Ever seen those aliens in New Vegas with the Wild Wasteland perk? Or Fallout 4's alien? Imagine getting abducted by them. Then exploring their ship. Then becoming the captain of said mothership. Finding lots of alien weapons, sweet robot enemies, fellow abductees like a samurai who was frozen when he was abducted from feudal Japan, and seeing the horrors of Zetan experimentation. It's great I tell you. A must-have for this game. All together, you should have the Game of the Year edition already, and played it already, and why are you still reading go buy this damn game.			"

On the Keyboard press Ctrl+F and look fo the line ""bUseThreadedAI=0"" (without quotes) and replace it with ""bUseThreadedAI=1""4.  ***IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE LINE IN STEP 3*** add the following WITHOUT quotes ""iNumHWThreads=n"" and REPLACE ""n"" with the number of cores your CPU has.5.  Exit wordpad and save changes when prompted to.6.  In your steam library, Right-click on Fallout 3 and browse the local files of the game.7.  Right click on ""Fallout3.exe"" and got to the ""Compatibility"" Tab and check ""Run progream as an administrator"", ""Disable display scaling on high DPI"", and ""Run this program in compatibility mode"" and select Which ever version of Windows XP your OS lets you select.8.

												One of my most favorite games. First of all lets get this out of the way. The game is old, and the graphics aren't the best. But Bethesda doesn't care about graphics in their games. They care about the world and the story, and how free you are. You walk around post nuclear Washington DC. Being the good guy, bad guy, dude who doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing care, or whatever you can come up with.  The game never ceases to remind you of how ♥♥♥♥ed everything is. And some of the most interesting quests in rpgs come from this game. There are very few repetitive quests, unless you find the game mechanics repetitive (talking, walking, shooting.)  Another elephant I want to get out of the way; there is no aim-down-sights or sprint, and the game is not very immersive (due to bugs mostly.) But thanks to being on the pc, you don't have to worry about most bugs (game breaking ones, ones that make you reload to the last save because you are stuck in space), due to mods! ADS, sprinting, and bug fixes out the♥♥♥♥♥(for modding tutorials, I suggest gopher on youtube.) Basically after playing this game again just using about 2 or 3 mods, I realized what a jewel fallout 3 is, it gets you attached to things very easily, but mostly things like Megaton, robots, that black lady who gives you stimpacks, Hobo McDirtFace, even♥♥♥♥♥♥like teddy bears (if you have hoarding problems this game doesn't help.) But one thing you don't get attached to is your dad. I mean the story is engrossing but you don't really see much of him. Liam Neeson voices him but he only has about 30 or so lines because the amount of times you see is slim. You look for your dad half the game and you would suggest Bethesda to do something with the talent they had. All in all, great game, mods make it better. I tried to make this review trying not to be a parrot, but some things I think are shared opinions.			"

												Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition is a 2008/09 post-apocalyptic role-playing game that takes place in desolate wasteland of Washington DC. You play as the Lone Wanderer, who travels on a journey to find your Father (voiced by Liam Neeson) in the wasteland. Leaving Vault 101 takes personal risks and responsibility. Would you do the same?Fallout 3 starts in the year, 2277, 200 years after the Resource War (United States versus China in a fight for remaining sources on Earth) ended suddenly due to atomic weaponry inflicting against the United States and the rest of the world. Washington DC takes the most damage due to its strategic and political significance. The question remains: What was your Father’s intention to leave Vault 101? The main story is good though some people argued that the plot is decent. In my perspective, the plot is typical and good. It’s not the best or have a strong presentation, but it’s good overall. The real reason for playing Fallout 3 has to be exploration and doing major side quests. Exploring the unknown world of post-apocalyptic Washington DC feels so amazing and worrisome at the same time. These two emotions is what makes the game feel so great. The setting is unpredictable. You may find an abandoned settlement that has a mysterious past,  reading journal entries on what caused a location to fall apart, or some batsh*t crazy thing comes to you when you almost finish investigating an area. The gameplay is primarily first-person or third-person shooter that place strong emphasis on your gameplay type. You can go guns blazing, get a companion and do some killing, conduct stealth and light skirmishes, or just explore alone in the Capital Wasteland. What makes Fallout 3’s gameplay a bit special is the V.A.T.S (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) where you “paused” the game while targeting an enemy’s legs, arms, equipped weapon, and the head. The feature is pretty nice and does help you in dire situations. However, it’s a bit unfortunate that V.A.T.S makes the game paused and not real-time. The stealth mechanic is a mixed bag. You can practically invest a lot of points towards the Stealth skill to make your stealth “level” to what suits you. If your Stealth skill is low then the enemy will “automatically” notice you even when the enemy is not facing you and you are crouch-walking towards an unsuspected enemy. What frustrates me the most was that there is no iron sight or aiming down your equipped weapon. Aiming is mostly useless and “hip-fire” the equipped weapon seems to be what’s best. Is there criticisms for Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition? Fallout 3 is definitely not perfect. There are a lot of technical issues and bugs that Bethesda Games Studios neglected. Many PC users now have Windows 7, 8/8.1, and Windows 10 and a high majority will most likely have an major technical issue that can or cannot be fixed. The games does crash to desktop in modern PC architecture due to no support of multi-core processing (when the game came out, it was dual-core). The solution is there to fix it, but it does not fully bandage the problem. The NPCs look stale, but mods do help make it better. The most critical aspect of the game is the karma system. In a post-apocalyptic setting, any person would know that there’s no (or little) black-or-white scenarios. The karma system is a good concept, but heavily flawed since conducting bad “actions” like stealing or pickpocketing is treated like a horrid sin.The review sounds critical but why does it gives a thumbs up? The answer is simple: It is fun. I remembered when I got the Fallout 3 Collector’s Edition back in October 2008 (where you get the concept art book, featurette DVD, the vault boy bobblehead, and a lunchbox (yes, an actual lunchbox). Fallout 3 crash to desktop so often that I’ve lost count. For some reason, I didn’t too angry about it (even though I should have). Fallout 3 was the first video game that I actually got so immersive to. The setting draws you in and exploration is so much fun. Fallout 3 is one of a very few games that gameplay matters over graphics and “minor” flaws. Does the sequels like Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4 improved over Fallout 3? Certainly. Fallout 3’s default price is at $19.99 (for Game of the Year Edition). I’ve strongly recommend (for those who haven’t play Fallout 3) to get it on a steep discount of -75% ($5 USD or regional equivalent) since the game faces technical issues on today’s PC systems. Fallout 3 is certainly not top-tier game (when looking at it today), but the game was a marvelous achievement for a first-person shooter to be in an open-world setting.			"

												Good game! I mean, it's buggy, the graphics aren't great, they get Liam Neeson as a voice actor and basically put him in the corner for most of the game (spoilers), and a lot of stuff still isn't fixed or just causes random graphics card crashes. It's a bit...broken. And it doesn't really connect to the previous fallout games lore-wise. But I've got nostalgia for it, so, yeah.			"

												Fallout 3 is a wonderful change into 3-D. I found some of the character animations a little stiff, but nothing too bad. I enjoyed a lot of the comedy within the game, with all the 50's goodness on a perfect America. A lot of the decisions didn't make a difference in most of the dialogue options, Which is a let down, but when it did I was happy that my choice actually mattered. The shooting in this game is down right broken without leveling up your skills, unless you use V.A.T.S for most of your combat. After I got my small-gun skill to about 90 the combat was a lot more enjoyable. I found most of the wasteland, just boring to look at with nothing interesting happening other than some enemies here or there, but maybe that's the point. I think some weather or something would have been nice. The story starts off rather slow and uninteresting, but gets a lot better nearing the end of the game. The music didn't standout for me, unlike The Elderscrolls series (This isn't talking about the music on the radio, Which I didn't even know you could listen to on your pip-boy until after I finished the game). Over-all I really did enjoy the game and would recommend this game to anyone a fan of The Elderscrolls series or post-apocalyptic games. I do want to add this game crashes A LOT, but I was able to get through the game just fine without being set back a whole lot, thanks to it's auto-saving.4/5 - Wonderful			"

												It's been years since I first played this game, back on Xbox 360. Back then, I loved it, and I enjoyed coming back to the DC wasteland and find new locations to explore. More importantly, it's the game that introduced me to what is now one of my favorite franchises, and I have a healthy dose of nostalgia for it.But holy hell, the passage of time hasn't been kind to Fallout 3. I would not recommend playing it today unless you are ready to sit down and mod it for a few hours just to get it to run.Graphically, I think it actually kind of holds up, and the capital wasteland still has a certain beauty and charm that the Mojave desert and the Commonwealth didn't quite manage to capture. Characters look like potatoes but don't completely distract from the experience. Musically, it's quite good. The new direction for the ambient music is great, if not as dark and chilling as the Fallout1 and 2 soundtracks. The radio's a brilliant element and GNR and Enclave Radio both have a solid, if unsubtle (""Do you get it this game is about the APOCALYPSE ?!"") choice of themes.Technically, it's a mess. Glitchy as hell, difficult to run on modern hardware and operating systems, yet surprisingly stable once you actually get it to run. This is why I said the years haven't been kind to Fallout 3. In terms of gameplay, it's the second most shallow entry in the series behind Fallout 4, and the gunplay and gun selection is downright terrible by modern standards. Heck, even back then, the lack of ironsights made it a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to play and the spread of some weapons is unfrigginbelievable, even with a gun skill of 100. You'll spend most of your time shooting things and the combat is terrible, so...yeah.But the cherry on top of the cake is the absolutely atrocious writing of the main quest and most sidequests. Thanks Emil. Back when I first played the game, I kind of tuned out the story because it was so boring, with a lot of rude and uninteresting characters who make stupid decisions all the time. Oh, and of course there's next to no choice in this game, because that's absolutely not something Fallout is known for, right ?And yet, despite all my criticisms, I still bought the game and played through the whole story again. Is it nostalgia ? Is it the dumb fun of exploring the ruins of a blasted wasteland ? Probably both. Regardless, Fallout 3 is still worth playing through at least once, for shitz and giggles if nothing else.			"

Fallout 3, My oh my. I've been meaning to do this review for quite some time, never got around to finishing until now.Your in a post-apocalyptic world filled with radiation monsters and every minute is key for survival.PROS+Almost Too much to do.And when I say there is too much to do. I mean there is soooo much to do you'll have to put things in a hat to decide what to do first.+ModdingThis game can be modded to infinity making heaps of replayability and even with some really unique mods.+VATSI've heard of a lot criticism when it comes to VATS but I actually really enjoyed (mostly because I have terrible aim.) I thought it brought a lot of strategy then your typical FPS.+DLC!If you get the GOTY edition you get 5 DLC all with there original story-line and even MORE stuff to do!CONS-SlowNow I get that this game is set to be in a wasteland and that it's meant to represent the emptiness in that but seriously, without Quick-travel I don't think I could have completed it. (Atleast Oblivion/Skyrim had horses)-Dat EndingNo spoilers here but that ending was less fufilling than a happy meal at Mcdonalds-OptimizationNot really a con but this game doesn't play nice with Windows 7. there is an easy way around it though.FInal Notes and Score-This game has been out for so long and been praised i'm surprised if you still haven't played this game. GO GET IT.-I haven't played it but most people would agree that New Vegas is much better than Fallout 3.-This game has a total of 73 Hours with the Main Story and Extras and a whopping 107 Hours if your completionist. Is that something worth your money? Yes.Final Score: 8.5/10 "

												From elsewhere:Having heard this game was just ""Oblivion with guns"" I waited for over a year to finally get it, as Oblivion, though an ambitious project, failed to excite me much beyond being able to go anywhere I wanted (until 2 hours later). I didn't have much hope for this game, but I really want to like it regardless; having been a fan of the original Fallout games since their release over a decade ago. With this love of the series, I tired (I really _really_ tired) to like this game. Like Oblivion, I spent a lot of time on it (70+ hours on my initial play through, less on other characters), dissected it, and tried all I could. Did it stack up? In a few insignificant ways yes, but mostly no.What does this game do right? Quite a bit that I found quite good, Traveling around the wastes (for a while) and making Steal/Sneak-Traps/Explosives into one skill and the Repair is actually useful now. But with these positives come big negatives from the character development angle.For starters:Charisma and Speech. Utterly useless. Yes, it's nice you can reach a compromise between Hightower and the Ghouls, and yeah, you can talk to Autumn at the end (of the pre DLC game) and convince him to leave without needing to exchange fire, but beyond that, there aren't many opportunities to use diplomacy. Further more, there are little experience rewards for playing diplomatic, aside from poor returns from quests and disarming mines and picking the occasional lock.Bad dialogue options, voice acting, not one memorable character, and forgettable plot. From a writing perspective, this game is extremely lackluster. Yes, there are more options available in speech, but most options are interchangeable and/or have no real effect anyway. It would have been a nice touch if you could talk your father out of trying to make you kill the radroach, but alas, like many other points in the game and DLC, many possibilities for a varied play through are utterly ignored. Coupled with all this they dumbed down one of the best aspects of RPGs with an Intelligence skill: playing a role of someone with limited cranial capacity (perhaps they were too lazy to write more dialogue trees? avoid controversy with Palin?). Role playing games should all offer this as it allows for the player to actually role play. Sneak is a very gimped skill that doesn't work like it should as the AI has an uncanny ability to randomly discover you even if you're in a dark room, crouched-walking, wearing light clothing, and avoiding doing anything that would generate any noise. Many times I end up having to just run around, taking shots like a bullet sponge, and dealing with X object while under fire. Stealth only seems to have a use in combat as it increase damage on the initial hit, but other than that, this skill like many others is just a waste. The game, in effect, favors combat, and luckily, at least for unarmed/melee/Energy/Small Guns it is quite balanced. This would be fine if the shooting mechanics were good, however, like Oblivion, combat is greatly stunted.The dream of being able to be a lone wanderer of the wastes, sniping from great distances was shattered. Other than the rifle ""Ol' Painless"" almost all of the guns are painfully inaccurate, but at least targeting parts of the body actually affects the enemy (if you can make contact). On top of this, the shooting as a whole feels utterly unresponsive. Bullets will often not go in the direction you intend, and often hit random invisible walls. Further more, the damage done by a lot of guns (at least in the beginning) are so lackluster that it feels like throwing a gun would do more harm. After experiencing these huge flaws, I only then understood why VATS was included in the game: to bring at least some certainty to combat.So the guns suck, but what about melee and my beloved unarmed skill? The use of these combat traits are so shallow, that playing with that induces mind-numbing boredom. Had they implemented a parry/disarming system, something, anything beyond a ineffectual block and attack buttons this aspect of combat could have made this otherwise ""bleh"" game decent. So the combat is terrible and unrewarding. In addition to that, the enemy A.I. is just plain terrible. They always rush forward, never seeking cover, or taking careful aim. I lost count of how many times an enemy blew him/herself up with a rocket launcher (especially since it is so easy to exploit as well).Bad writing, bad role playing, bad combat; what does this game do well? Traveling... but only for a bit. Having visited every location on all the maps, I can easily say that this aspect is just a repeat of Oblivion. Yes there are a lot of places to go, but after you've seen one subway, you've seen them all. So much so, you'll begin to dread entering them simply because you know you've already seen the same trash pile next to the same ticket office with the same ""feral ghouls"" running around.The DLC summarized:Anchorage; a terribly short and lame, guns-a-blazing, ""mod."" The only cool thing to come out of it is the stealth suit, but even with it, stealth skill sucks. Simply forgettable, and is a sign of how they simply forgot the option to try to play this DLC in a ""less-than-lethal"" manner. All you have is a linear map and dumb enemies. You've played this, and it was called (almost) EVERY FPS EVER MADE. Except those had better shooting mechanics (even the sprite based ones that ran off the Wolf 3D/Doom engines). The Pitt; outside of the Trog designs, it's just ""bleh."" All reward items are just uninteresting. Another thing that is silly about this DLC is that it supposedly had a lot of moral gray-area. Let me spoil it for you: the leader of the Pitt has a baby who is the ""key"" to curing the aliments of the slaves there. Your choice is to leave the child with its parents, or kill them and take the child to the slaves. Where is the dilemma? Taking a child from a privileged life (after butchering her family) and taking it to unlikable characters, or keep the baby with its unlikable parents? Personally, drilling out the baby's brains to get to a ""cure"" would be a better way to really challenge your perception of what is a moral decision. Baby's life versus the life of several hundred people as opposed to terrible people who are the parents. Broken Steel; it's nice you can opt to destroy the Brotherhood, but it doesn't lead anywhere. You can't fully join the enclave and have a differently branching storyline. It, like everything about Fallout 3, is just too linear and not completely realized.Point Look Out; other than the accurate depictions of swamp/southern people, everything about this DLC seems half-done.Mothership Zeta; linear mess that introduces more uninteresting items and characters.All in all, this game is a wreak. Hell, it even crashed constantly while playing it (more than Oblivion, which is amazing). Mods can't save this. I want my $50 back.Edit:I wanted to revisit this game to see if my opinion has changed, and it consistently crashes (5 times) during the loading screens making this game unplayable on my current computer (the same I used to play New Vegas and Skyrim with no problem).

												A truly epic adventure--an absolute stellar collaboration of FPS and RPG experiences. The vast open landscape allows unhindered exploration. The game offers a wealth of NPC characters, each having their own distinct personalities opening or limiting choices based on how you interact with them. The story conversations go far beyond simple dialog, offering players deep and rich character development. There's even multiple paths/outcomes depending on the choices you make throughout the game. Multitudes of different monster types and weapons. While the story and side missions are enough to keep anyone busy for hours on end, the DLCs are well integrated and keep the game fresh for many more.			"

												for best value buy the full (goty) on holiday sale.  game inexplicably still has GfWL.  this can be ignored entirely though if used it will ask for a non existent (if purchased since the discontinued support for GfWL) key leaving us at an impasse.  as i said this not required.  and now a word about time travel - in 2008, most ppl were still using XP which is largely a DOS Shell OS.  i say this to caution buyers to expect certain compatability setting requirements.  Micro$oft is not known for its forward thinking backwards compatability.  that said, if we are willing to put up w/ this ""stuff"" it is a phenomenal gameplay value for $5 (US) which is the seasonal max low price for the goty.  even after completing the game it is worth playing once/six months or so.  as a routine breaker or a rage reset button.  fallout nexus featured mod Tale of Two Wastelands will use the assets from this game to enable playing the Capital Wasteland under the FNV executable (worth the five bucks for this alone IMO).recommended for SP, Fallout Fanatics, Computer Game Historians, Tale of Two Wastelands.

												Fallout 3 had an incredible landscape. Visiting Washington D.C. in an apocalyptic world was very cool and entertaining. The Pittsburgh DLC was absolutely awesome. Pittsburgh being my home in real life made it my favorite DLC ever.Decent mechanics, and overall a nice experience 84 / 100However....SPOILERS - DO NOT READ ONWARD UNLESS YOU WANT SPOILSI decided to take a 6 month break from the Franchise once I discovered the Arkham Series. I remember taking a break over the frustration that I was unable to find the way to the White House. I had seen Pittsburgh, and all the similarities it has to today's Pittsburgh, like the Highmark building and such. I thought ""Geez, the White House is going to look so cool."" My interests were even more sparked once I visited the Capital. 2 days ago, after playing a lot of Fallout Shelter, I decided to go back to Fallout 3 and thought ""Hell why not."" And in just 2 days, I found the tunnel that takes me to the White House. I was so excited to see how cool a decayed, run down White House would look.So I was attacked by ghouls upon exiting the manhole cover, and after that looked around me and thought ""Where is it? It's got to be here."" I have never been more disappointed in my life. I literally took 6 months off to find nothing but a damn hole in the ground. No easter egg, no house, no nothing. 3 mini nukes and a grenade. Wahoo. Never have been more let down.Figured I would share that :P			"

												I recommend Fallout 3 over New Vegas because of its original flavor it has for me. It has extensive features just like F:NV, but there are problems that come with this game. I do not suggest buying this unless you wish to mod your game to some extent, because Windows 7 users are prone to to be somewhat incompatible.			"

												Absolutely brilliant. If you're a fan of RPGs, or you're a fan of post-apocalyptic settings, then Fallout 3 is most likely for you. Set around 200 years after the Earth is devastated by nuclear war, you play the Vault Dweller, who has left Vault 101 in order to follow their father's footsteps and make sure he is still alive.Of course, it's never quite that simple, and once you are out into the wide, open world, you are on your own. For a while at least. You can go nearly anywhere, do nearly anything, shoot nearly anyone, so long as you can live with the consequences.Even without the DLC, this game is huge. Adding the DLC just makes it bigger, and offers more unique items, weapons, characters, and storylines than ever before.This game is very highly recommended.			"

												Fallout 3 is by far my favorite open world RPG to this date. It has a great story, great quests, and great characters. Having Liam Neeson calling me son is also one of the best things to hear. The only real problem is that it's a bit outdated when compared to recently released games. Also, it takes a few adjustments to work on post Windows 7 computers. Beyond that, this is a great buy that was worth the hundreds of hours dedicated to it.  9.7/10			"

												I can't say enough good things about Fallout 3. Everything about this game works with the rest of it to provide a fantastic post-apocalyptic experience - especially when you consider the radio soundtrack composed of authentic songs from Roy Brown, Bob Crosby and Billie Holiday to name a few. And hey, this is the PC version, which means if you find something you don't fancy, there's probably a mod out there to fix that. Have fun in the Capital Wasteland.			"

												Now why can't the actual capital look like the Capital Wasteland? I was so enthralled with this game, so immersed in it (obsessively so) that when I had the opportunity to work in DC I looked forward to seeing my favorite Fallout 3 haunts unblemished. Granted, there was repair scaffolding encasing the Washington Monument, but it was much more intact than the Fallout 3 counterpart. Every time I went into the subway I would be filled with glee to see that structurally the platform areas are remarkably similar, and that the only things I was missing were Feral Ghouls and derailed subway cars.The environment is open, although not necessarily inviting. It's a world alive, with Mole Rats, Mirelurks, Death Claws, Super Mutants, Ghouls, and your garden variety people. The weapons are varied and eccentric at times. Whether you choose to dispatch your enemy with the mundane: shotgun, assault rifle, or pistol; the overpowered: Mini Gun, Flamer, or Fat Man; or the custom built: Railway Rifle, Bottlecap Mine, or Rock-It Launcher. (My personal fave is the Rock-It Launcher, because nothing says you need a hug more than a high velocity teddy bear to the skull.) The main quest can get kind of stale the 3rd or 4th time through the game, but since there are numerous side quests and a sizable map to explore it takes awhile to get old. I enjoy the Karma system in the game and the gentle reminders that gunning down the innocent and sleeping in someone else's bed while they stand there is somehow detrimental to my Karma in the Wastes. I also enjoy the leveling system, choosing where to allocate my skill points and pondering over perks like Puppies and Bloody Mess. Fallout 3 is an incredible game. It can be as fast or slow of a game as you make it. You can rush through, playing only the main quest, and miss out on fascinating things like the Nuka Cola tour and finding the Oasis of the Wastes. With all of the DLC that was added there is so much to explore, examine, and decimate. Fallout 3 is my ""go to"" game. My fallback when I'm bored of everything else that I have. I've played through the main storyline about 3 times so far and I find new areas to explore and side quests that I haven't done a number of times. The DLC  is engaging and, with the exception of one, I find them all great fun. Sometimes I play to be the good gal, sometimes I play the bad girl. There are so many ways to craft your character through gameplay, that you can have a different person every time. The story draws you in, like a choose your own adventure book, and you decide how it ends. Megaton or Tenpenny? See you out there in the Wasteland, lone wanderer. I'll be the one scrounging up toy cars, teddy bears, and bent tin cans because it's dangerous out here. You never know who's going to need a hug.			"

												Fallout 3 was revolutionary in it's time. Daring to move away from the past installment's sky-view strategy look and gameplay, Fallout 3 moves up into the era of the first person shooter. ""War, War never changes."" It has been 200 years since the bombs fell. In the year 2077, following the battle for the last remaining natural resources, involving China, the USA, and the USSR, thousands of nuclear missiles landed throughout the world. Those who could afford it locked themselves away in underground vaults, which would not open until the radiation subsided. You have left Vault 101, your home since you were born, in search of your father. You are the Lone Wanderer, venturing the wastes and ruins of Washington DC, now named The Capital Wasteland. A heavy atmosphere looms as the story progresses, pushing you further into something more then just finding your father and unknown past. How do you battle the horrors of the wastes? Do you rush in with the Super Sledge, slither past and pick them off from afar, or do you hold your ground in power armor with the mighty Gatling Laser? Fallout 3 allows you to play it how you want, when you want. Rush into the thick of things or mosey along with the hundreds of side quests avaliable? From helping ghouls find a home to fighting The Antagonizer alongside The Mechanist and his army of Protectretron Robots to uncovering the secrets of your past, Fallout 3 is one of the true RPGs ever made. For an added bonus: compare screenshots of your journey through the ruins of D.C. with real life photos of D.C. today and see how similar they look. Hopefully the world doesn't have to fight over resources within the next 100 years.			"

												On Xbox 360 I have 100's if not 1000's of hours I got this to remeber my young teen years. My father is a Jedi Knight, two Gods of Legend, and one of the most Boss orgainizatoinless agents to ever live. I remind myself this in every battle and suddenly I understand why i can take a missle to the face and be smacked by a Behemoth (A 15 foot tall Radioactive muscle of Death) and only suffer some blured vision. As well as be in several explosions without a single mark upon my body. Ever time i play this game i rember the smells of youth that are not around anymore as if they were still here because this game takes me back. This is and RPG where everything is wasteland and you leave your mark on the world you can turn on the radio th hear Three Dog tell of your glorious deeds or less that nice activeties as if he was there himself to see. A game were when all is lost you must leave your mark on the world. And at the end of your main objective a slide show starts retelling your deeds across the wastes (Good or Bad) for you to see as well as the effects that would come long after your dead and gone for you to reflect on every decission you made. Will the Lone Wanderer be the Last Great Hope For Mankind and save who you can or the Reincarnation of Death bringing about the second apocalypse and engulf the world in ashes again for your own amusement because you can. The choice is always yours any time any where upon anyone. 10/10 would relive again.			"

												Definately one of my most favorites, and though the story isn't the BEST around, it was more than interesting, for me, atleast. The game mechanics were incredibly easy to use, and felt very nice, no problems with it. Mods were easy to install, and the game managed to hold it's own, while playing a Windows 7. I especially loved the V.A.T.S. system, along with the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. mechanic, that was especially unique for me. And over all, the game, though not always as colorful as it could possibly be, was most atmospheric, especially creeping in a shopping mart, filled to the rim with bandits, that would not hesitate to blow your head off if you looked at their shoes even remotely funny. Over all, great game, one of the best apocolypse related games in my book.			"

												This game is one of it's kind for a nuclear post-apocalyptic style game. In my opinion Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition is better than Fallout: New Vegas: Ultimate Edition and I tell you why. It's because Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition has a dlc named Broken Steel that breaks the ending of the game and allows to keep with the same character. Fallout: New Vegas has no dlc that does that.I had to wait 2 and half years before I got to play Fallout 3 because I did not have a good videocard to start with. But once I got the videocard I needed and started playing it became one of my #1 favorite game of my lifetime, I am a hardcore pc gamer all thanks to Fallout 3.I receommend this game for everyone who likes post-apocalyptic/adventure games.Recommended![Rating 1000/1000]			"

												Please don't look at the time I've allegedly spend playing this game, since Steam, for some reason, does not register it at all. ""Fallout 3"" is one of those games, that I can recommend without any doubts. I know that there are fans of Fallout 1&2 out there, who do not like the changes within game mechanics, but I would say that it's perfectly normal - when something that we really enjoy change a lot, we usually react badly. I did not play any previous ""Fallout"", so I judge this as a standalone game. And what a great game it is. Pros:+ music + open world with tons of locations, secrets, references, memorable characters and pretty much everything else that you would like to see in the game like this+ plot - some people say that it's the worse part of the game, but for me plot was good enough+ player's stats that can unlock new dialogue options (not only charisma, but strength or perception), that actually make a difference (for example allows us to avoid fight)+ perks are awesome. You can use your experience points to raise one of your stats or just add new skills (not only combat related. You can unlock perk that increase the gore effect, allows you to easily influence other gender or children, add new dialogue options and that's only the beginning)+ pretty good morality system, that influence the way that some characters in the game treat us (and if potential companions will be interested in joining forces with us)+ there are always at least two ways to solve each quest (and quite often more)+ humor - dark and grotesque, it fits this game very well+ moddable (it's easy and there are quite a lot ""Fallout 3"" mods out there)+ lore, atmosphere and atmosphere once again. Choosing your hair, mustache, perks, quests, dialogues, creatures - everything fit perfectly into the Fallout world.Cons:- DLC are not interesting at all. Beside possibility of gaining 30 level, there's not much to them. You can't bring your companions on extra adventures. What is worse, they can be very challenging and sometimes you don't have a chance to properly prepare yourself. Some people may find them enjoyable, for me they were annoying and definitely too long.- no sprint option- map can be very disorienting - if you're playing for the first time and don't really know what you're doing, you may get easily frustrated, trying to follow map markers and ending up nowhere- there's not to much difference to buildings or rooms layouts. It's pretty easy to get lost in bigger locations.			"

												Fallout 3 has always been my number one favourite game of all time, I have been playing this game since it first was released many years ago, and up to this day I can still put the game on, and play for hours , still enjoying every part of the game. The storyline of the game is interesting, along with hours of exploring the world in general, if you get bored you can put on Galaxy News Radio and listen to hours of classic hits from the mid 1900's era. Anyone who is interested in playing an open world, roleplaying game,  this game does not disappoint. Hope you enjoy roaming the wastleland.			"

												Accidentally detonated an atom bomb in the first town killing dozens of people and injuring many within the area.Lost Karma.Still had max Positive Karma rank.-Note: Read the notice, the game is not optimized for windows 7 or later. Unless you are prepared to spend some time figuring out what to do to make it work then don't buy it. I spent around an hour and finally find the right fix with the fallout_default.ini file.Outside of the optimization problem the game has been very fun. I haven't played too much but so far my impressions have been good. There is a lot to do and the open world is interesting. Side quests are plentiful, weapons and ammo can be found at a normal rate though you may find yourself running out. The best part is, if you have a problem there is probably a mod to fix it.I highly recommend it if you are willing to take the time to get it running.There is the occasional crash but if you remember to quicksave a lot it shouldnt bother you.overall I would say this game is an 7/10 due to the problems with os and crashes			"

												A lot of games make a big deal out of player choice, but few in recent memory offer so many intricate, meaningful ways of approaching any given situation. You fulfill or dash the spiritual hopes of an idyllic society, side with slavers or their slaves, and decide the fate of more than one city over the course of your postapocalyptic journey through the Washington, DC wasteland. Your actions have far-reaching consequences that affect not just the world around you but also the way you play, and it's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing--and replaying. It's deep and mesmerizing, and though not as staggeringly broad as the developer's previous games, it's more focused and vividly realized.GL HF ;D			"

												Mmmm Fallout 3....Where to start. Ok so I bought this game on PS3 and Xbox 360 the year it came out which was 2008. Played the hell out of both of them. Then they started releasing DLC and it got even better. Fast forward about a year or so to when I got my first gaming PC. Bought the game again, this time Game of the Year Edition. Was blown away again from 60fps and no lag at all. The game revolves around a teenage kid (you) who is searching for their father in the wide open wasteland of DC. There are over 100 locations without DLC and even more with it. The game should take you 40-50 hours first playthrough if you are just a casual player. However if you're a completionist like myself, then you'll probably be playing for around 100 or so hours. There are tons of things to do in this game with and without mods/dlc. Thats the joy of it, each playthrough will be different. On one character you might focus more on melee weapons while you might focus on guns on another. This is one of the only games that I'd truly rate a 10/10. I read some reviews and some people were saying ""DAE WINDOWS 7/8 DOESNT WORK"" I laugh at these people because they are either not tech savvy at all or just being ridiculous. I have had windows 7 for 3+ years and windows 8 since release an I have not had a single problem at all. The game has only crashed a handfull of times in ovver 5 years. Its kind of sad how people are being lied to with the reviews. This game runs perfectly fine. This game is well worth the money even today. This game still competes with Skyrim and is one of the most Amazing games I have ever purchased.So overall this game deserves a 10/10 and is a ""Must Play""			"

Yes it's true the game is not optimized for Win 7 and you probably won't be able to play it on Win 10 but there are ways around that issue. Mine is modded up the wazzo and with a little ini file tweaking it runs fine on Win 7. If you plan on getting Fallout 4 and never played this game, do yourself a favor and spend the money and play it first. Make sure you get the GotY, it's a must!			"

												I wish that there was a neutral review option, because this is amazing, however. While their older games will run on Windows 7 and New Vegas will run butter smooth this game doesn't, even when working to fix everything it'll still crash more often then what's reasonable when running on windows 7. I forced it to run on one core, I ran it in XP mode etc etc. Still it would crash every 4-5 minutes. I hate to say it but if you don't have windows XP or Vista then DON'T get this game, it's not fixable like most other games.Honestly a windows 7 patch at least should be released, most people don't have Windows XP/Vista gaming machines with dual cores these days. There are still people using Win 7 but nope, they don't want to patch.			"

												Fallout 3 is one of my alltime favorite Games. Top 5 definitely.While New Vegas is technically better, it's athmosphere is not nearly as stunning as Fallout 3's.  Mainly because it (NV) takes place in a boring desert and the amazing world-after-nuclear-war-feeling of Fallout 3 is almost completely gone.Also the story isn't nearly as good imho...After one of the most amazing intros ever, Fallout 3 comes up with a good story (not as bad as it's often said) and one hell of a wasteland to explore. As always in  Bethesda RPG the story leaves you with a lot of world still to explore on your own. DLC ,apart from the ridiculous Operation Anchorage (aka CoD for the very poor), are very good as well. And while it runs well on (todays) mediocre hardware, it doesn't look too bad. Even without mods. Of which i would strongly advise however at least the simple ""mtui"". It makes fonts in dialog options smaller (designed for the old non-hd xbox) so that you have 5 or 6 instead of 3 answering options (in ridiculously big letters) visible without scrolling. It's  ""installed"" by simply copying one file into the data-folder.And the one which gets rid of the horrible and now defunct ""games for windows live"".Lightning mods, Texture packs, balance-changing and more-npc mods are also available.The place to go, with free registration needed for bigger files, is http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/It's even worth 19€,$ or whatever, but when it is on sale there is simply no excuse for not buying it :)PS: Sadly Fallout 3 is incredibly tricky to get to work under Win7/10. If you own both Fallout 3 and New Veags, you may try the Tales of two wastelands - mod wich makes Fallout 3 run in the Fallout New Vegas Engine, which is a LOT less problematic on newer Windows'			"

												After playing this game many years later than when it came out, I have to say that I enjoyed Fallout 3 quite a bit, including the DLC. The game itself has a pretty nice story and is actually challenging at first when you have nothing and don't know the controls too well. The massiveness of the open-world and the explroation really contribute to the game's wonder. Like the Fallout series are marked by, there are multiple ways to complete quests and there are quests everywhere. Once oyu get to a certain level you can even get explorer perk which allows you to see all the locations on the map. Go find everything and enjoy the game.Another thing is that you can mod the game and replay the game in a differnet style in a similar sense to skyrim. You can mod the things you dont like or the bugs and even other major things. I played as a goody-two-shoes in my first playthrough and I intend to play as a villian in my second one. The replayability isn't as great as some games, but with mods and a different play style, one can enjoy the game once again. Overall, a good game people should own.Rating: 8.9/10			"

I used to play Fallout 2 with my cousin a lot back in the day, but I was simply too young to understand anything happening in the game. This was at 2007. Fast forward about 4 years, and my dad bought me Fallout 3. I enjoyed it - A LOT.Even though Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite Fallout game of all time, Fallout 3 still has a special place in my heart. "

												If you asked me what my favourite game series is, I would answer Fallout. So far I have not tried Fallout 4 yet, have to say I love Fallout 3 as well as Fallout: New Vegas.The most impressive thing is that Fallout 3 is a continuation of life: you can easily spend a half of a day by organising your inventory, speaking with strangers and making your relationships. Being very realistic, you can do whatever you want and cannot allow yourself in real life on the other hand. I also like to walk everywhere without completing any tasks, just for my pleasure, collecting the dresses, hats, guns and unique items.Listing pros may take forever. The only contra is that the game needs a huge amount of free time.			"

Well we're far from FO2's depth. But yeah that's still a great game, the fact that i discovered it when i was young prob makes a difference, and influences my judgement about it ! Gave me some amazing memories .Scenario is good, but we're far from the previous game's standards ... Pretty primitive and generic plot, with okay characters.When it comes to the game's world, it's rich content-wise , that's undeniable and overall it has a decent amount of details.Meh you know what ? Just imagine Oblivion in a Post-Apo setting, with automatic weapons, add some more crudeness to it,  rough language with the possibility to dismember ppl and here ya go , you sort of have Fallout 3.

												Okay, well Fallout 4 came out yesterday and I pre-ordered it on xbox one, bad me, I know. But good me because I hear the PC port sucks, really bad. So I figure some folks bought Fallout 4 and want to try Fallout 3, because they want to get the bad taste out of their mouths or love it and want to play the game that started the fps version of it all. Well this review is for beginners of the Fallout franchise because I'm what you'd call a verteran, I've played all the games except those brotherhood of steel spin offs that suck, but they aren't considered games. By the way ths is spoiler free so enjoy. I wake up in a vault on my 2nd playthrough on PC, since I was good last time I want to be evil. Now the vault is a whole can of worms that are actually the evil that are known as spoilers so I'll just tell you some things I did for fun in the vault. I took off all my clothes and danced on a table at my birthday party after insulting a bully's mother. I got a BB gun and shot my dad until he fell unconcious and then took a picture with him, still unconcious. I shot a bunch of security guards, killed the overseer, and laughed in a girl's face after killing her dad. I then arose from the vault as a twelve year old boy would arise in the morning freaking out on the release day of Fallout 4. I went to a nearby settlement and improved my vault suit, making it 101 armor? I made a promise to some lousy sherrif to disarm a nuke in town square. I went into the town bar and promised a guy I would help him activate the nuke and blow up the town after having some fun with it and getting an evil companion in it. I went upstairs in the bar/hotel and killed all of the people sleeping in their beds with my baseball bat. (A lot of them are essential NPC's, yes you can kill almost anyone in Fallout 3 with the exception of your dad and a few others out of an entire world of characters.) I blew up the town after getting some info where to find my dad on the bar owner's computer, who I also killed whilst he was sleeping. I helped a radio broadcaster with his radio dish then proceeded to kill him to gain my evil karma back like I do with all good quests which I only do for the experience, I can't talk about anything else now because it's not spoiler friendly so I'll talk about a couple of side quests you can do in the game. Become a member of a tree cult and talk to a giant tree, that's actually a mutant from the second game (Fallout 2) named Harry. After the game if you have broken steel you decisions actually matter as you see what happened when normal players had to end the game. You can help some slaves liberate the lincoln memorial of slavers so they can live in the lincoln memorial. You can help a human hating ghoul assassinate humans. You can help a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ get to Rivet city. You can destroy a giant military base full of american patriot soldiers. You can get a mini nuke launcher and blow up a giant behemoth. (That last one wasn't a quest itself, but it was part of one, and it was really cool.) This game is so immersive, and unlike Fallout 4 (which I love.) You're not playing as the character who lost his son, no, you're playing as you. 10/10 buy this game now.			"

												If you have Windows 10 you will have to go to the microsoft market place and down load thier 36Mb PC client  http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/PC/DownloadClient. Then go to your steam and find your Fallout3 game from your Steam library. Right mouse click the games name in your Library then go to Properties. Then go to Local files. Then click Browse Local files. Go down to the Icon that says Fallout3 with the guys face. Not the Fallout. EXE and not the FalloutLauncher. Right Click on the Fallout3 icon go to Properties go to Compatibility then click Run as Administrator. Your good to go under Windows 10. You do NOT have to pick a Compatibility mode. Jut make sure Run as Administrator is checked you dont need to pick a different OS type to play the game. If you dont have the Microsoft market place PC client installed it wont work at all. Easies fix to get Fallout3 to work under Windows 10 & Pro.			"

												The best things that I have to say about Fallout 3 all have to do with how they handled the atmosphere, backstory and location. Setting FO3 in DC was a great choice, what better place to set a Fallout story? They really captured the Fallout feeling with this game but it's clear they put a different spin on it. It has more of a hopeful feeling instead of the darker, horror like sound that Mark Morgan brought to the first 2, which I liked a lot but I think I like Inon Zur's work better. Fallout 3 does a great job at fleshing out the world too, some of the best stories you'll see in this game are found in the computer terminal logs and random notes you'll find, they did a great job with those and clearly put a lot of work into them.         The main quest is overall hit or miss but will possibly leave you feeling frustrated if you don't have broken steel dlc. I didn't like it, I think the concept is good even though it's pretty clear they took it from Fallout Tactics, it could've been executed a lot better and it definiately felt forced. The DLC is one of my favorite things about this one, Point Lookout is one of my favorite locations in the series so far, the Pitt and Anchorage are also great. My biggest complaint about this game is how they copy pasted a few of the critical story moments from the first 2 games and shamelessly took credit for it from people who never played the first 2. A good example of this would be how you get exiled from vault 101 or how they had a settlement based around and inside a tanker.        Overall, it's a good game, I know it's controversial among some sections of the Fallout community and I was kind of on the Fallout 3 hate bandwagon for a while but I think there is a lot of things this game does right that makes it unique from the other entries. I think Bethesda can make a great Fallout game, they just need to put more emphasis on the main quest and lore next time.			"

I imagine that's not going to be a problem with Fallout 4 so I'd reccommend for a first timer just to wait for that.I want to not reccommend this game for the above reasons, but it's an incredible game.

												Fallout 3's easily my favorite installment in the series, hands down. Fallout 2 and New Vegas were fantastic as well, but Fallout 3 had a great mix of the old and the new; it gave an open-world adventure akin to Bethesda's Elder Scrolls, but without compromising the complex nature of the Fallout games. The game may be old, but it aged fantastically IMO, and it's worth a buy.And to those who are having issues with Fallout 3 on Windows 10; I have Windows 10, and I had issues booting this game up, but there's plenty of guides that'll prove to be a godsend on newer systems. Here's what you need to do to get the game running on Windows 10.https://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/541907675756259732/http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/1086/?Use the guide and mod in the link to begin your Wasteland Adventure. Be sure to comment to see if it's working for you.TL;DR - This game is fantastic, and it's worth a buy for new Fallout fans. Be sure to get it running, though! "

												Just had to buy Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition for PC (even though I already own Fallout 3 for PS3). The graphics and gameplay are smooth, a beautiful open world filled with radiation, raiders, loot and plenty of other things that are trying to kill you. It features the most stunning wastelands that I have ever come across in a game. The reason why I have strayed away from this amazing game is due to the Windows 7 optimization issues notice. Running great so far on Windows 7 Ultimate 64. Highly recommended!10/10 Would risk my life for a couple hundred bottle caps again.			"

												LONGEST GAME EVERJesus Christ.As with all Bethesda games it is highly customisable. It does NOT run well on PC, needs a lot of patching and it's normally against my rules to vote up a game that needs so much TLC, but, it's Fallout 3 baby.I would reccommend checking nexus mods and steamforums for a guide on how to really maximise what Fallout 3 can do, but even with that the random crashes still occur semi-regular and are HUGELY frustrating. I imagine that's not going to be a problem with Fallout 4 so I'd reccommend for a first timer just to wait for that.I want to not reccommend this game for the above reasons, but it's an incredible game.

												Fallout 3....       The question is not whether you should buy the game, the question is why you're still reading this review                                         and not buying the game right now.        Welcome to Washington DC, home of completely normal human beings.  Visit destroyed landmarks, flourishing cities, an underground town run by children, an aessload of metro stations, caves infested with mutated crabs, and a hotel converted into a slaver camp.  Here, you can meet all kinds on unsavory figures, from giant, angry, green men who hate militaristic people dressed in futuristic power armor, to a group of militaristic people dressed in futuristic power armor who hate giant, angry, green men.  You can also wield unique weapons, such as the Firelance, a strange incindiary Alien pistol, to a modified vaccum cleaner that can fire ANYTHING. ANYTHING!!!  Oh yeah, please don't hate the ghouls. Why would you hate the ghouls? TREAT THEM AS EQUALS, DAMMIT!!!Holy craep, I can't even give this game a rating, because whatever the max is, it's just multitplied by ten.100/10 : 1,000/100 : 10,000/1,000			"

												Fallout 3's easily my favorite installment in the series, hands down. Fallout 2 and New Vegas were fantastic as well, but Fallout 3 had a great mix of the old and the new; it gave an open-world adventure akin to Bethesda's Elder Scrolls, but without compromising the complex nature of the Fallout games. The game may be old, but it aged fantastically IMO, and it's worth a buy.And to those who are having issues with Fallout 3 on Windows 10; I have Windows 10, and I had issues booting this game up, but there's plenty of guides that'll prove to be a godsend on newer systems. Here's what you need to do to get the game running on Windows 10.https://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/541907675756259732/http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/1086/?Use the guide and mod in the link to begin your Wasteland Adventure. Be sure to comment to see if it's working for you.TL;DR - This game is fantastic, and it's worth a buy for new Fallout fans. Be sure to get it running, though! "

												Just had to buy Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition for PC (even though I already own Fallout 3 for PS3). The graphics and gameplay are smooth, a beautiful open world filled with radiation, raiders, loot and plenty of other things that are trying to kill you. It features the most stunning wastelands that I have ever come across in a game. The reason why I have strayed away from this amazing game is due to the Windows 7 optimization issues notice. Running great so far on Windows 7 Ultimate 64. Highly recommended!10/10 Would risk my life for a couple hundred bottle caps again.			"

												Unstable but fun game. It crashes often even if you have a good computer. You can play it with or without mods (which extend the game by several hours), but you can't go back. I would recommend Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition if you can only buy one. It's superior story and gameplay wise to this game.In case you're wondering I have only a little time played, there is another exe is which you need to run the game with mods. I've played this game for about 100 hours, actually.			"

												On Xbox 360 I have 100's if not 1000's of hours I got this to remeber my young teen years. My father is a Jedi Knight, two Gods of Legend, and one of the most Boss orgainizatoinless agents to ever live. I remind myself this in every battle and suddenly I understand why i can take a missle to the face and be smacked by a Behemoth (A 15 foot tall Radioactive muscle of Death) and only suffer some blured vision. As well as be in several explosions without a single mark upon my body. Ever time i play this game i rember the smells of youth that are not around anymore as if they were still here because this game takes me back. This is and RPG where everything is wasteland and you leave your mark on the world you can turn on the radio th hear Three Dog tell of your glorious deeds or less that nice activeties as if he was there himself to see. A game were when all is lost you must leave your mark on the world. And at the end of your main objective a slide show starts retelling your deeds across the wastes (Good or Bad) for you to see as well as the effects that would come long after your dead and gone for you to reflect on every decission you made. Will the Lone Wanderer be the Last Great Hope For Mankind and save who you can or the Reincarnation of Death bringing about the second apocalypse and engulf the world in ashes again for your own amusement because you can.

Don't try to alt+tab while playing cuz you will not be able to go back to the game again! Rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPS on anything higher than Medium settings. I don't know how I'm able to play it on Win 10.

												Fallout 3 is certainly a masterpiece and has it's place among the greatest RPG's of all times, including all the DLCs. Unfortunately over the years since its release the technical aspect of the games have become obsolete. You can stil play it on Windows 8 or newer OS, although you have to edit the game fils in order to keep the game stable. Under those circumstances its advised not to download mods to the game, otherwise it's going to crash beyond repair. Another reason behind this problem is possible due to the badly implemented Windows LIVE.The 250 hours I had with the game before it crashed was immensely fun and satisfying. Even though the game is rough around the edges its still very enjoyable to play.			"

												Accidentally detonated an atom bomb in the first town killing dozens of people and injuring many within the area.Lost Karma.Still had max Positive Karma rank.-Note: Read the notice, the game is not optimized for windows 7 or later. Unless you are prepared to spend some time figuring out what to do to make it work then don't buy it. I spent around an hour and finally find the right fix with the fallout_default.ini file.Outside of the optimization problem the game has been very fun. I haven't played too much but so far my impressions have been good. There is a lot to do and the open world is interesting. Side quests are plentiful, weapons and ammo can be found at a normal rate though you may find yourself running out. The best part is, if you have a problem there is probably a mod to fix it.I highly recommend it if you are willing to take the time to get it running.There is the occasional crash but if you remember to quicksave a lot it shouldnt bother you.overall I would say this game is an 7/10 due to the problems with os and crashes			"

												A lot of games make a big deal out of player choice, but few in recent memory offer so many intricate, meaningful ways of approaching any given situation. You fulfill or dash the spiritual hopes of an idyllic society, side with slavers or their slaves, and decide the fate of more than one city over the course of your postapocalyptic journey through the Washington, DC wasteland. Your actions have far-reaching consequences that affect not just the world around you but also the way you play, and it's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing--and replaying. It's deep and mesmerizing, and though not as staggeringly broad as the developer's previous games, it's more focused and vividly realized.GL HF ;D			"

Mine is modded up the wazzo and with a little ini file tweaking it runs fine on Win 7.

												I throughly enjoy playing Fallout 3. Thought I lack the hours on PC I have played Fallout 3 over 500 hours on console. I have completed in all ways and I think it's the 2nd best game on the market behind Fallout New Vegas. This game is simply amazing and goes on sales quite often which gives you hours of fun for cheap. Even though the game is currently cheap for the amount of fun you'd have, it goes on sale often if you're tight on money. It's not hard to run either so many people are able to play. The game is very customizable with everything just like my review on Fallout New Vegas, nearly everything I said there is what is in Fallout 3. They are similar but not too similar where people complain that they are the same game. All I will say now that it's cheap/addicting/fun/easy to run/modable. The perfect game if you ask me :) Please buy xD			"

												Mmmm Fallout 3....Where to start. Ok so I bought this game on PS3 and Xbox 360 the year it came out which was 2008. Played the hell out of both of them. Then they started releasing DLC and it got even better. Fast forward about a year or so to when I got my first gaming PC. Bought the game again, this time Game of the Year Edition. Was blown away again from 60fps and no lag at all. The game revolves around a teenage kid (you) who is searching for their father in the wide open wasteland of DC. There are over 100 locations without DLC and even more with it. The game should take you 40-50 hours first playthrough if you are just a casual player. However if you're a completionist like myself, then you'll probably be playing for around 100 or so hours. There are tons of things to do in this game with and without mods/dlc. Thats the joy of it, each playthrough will be different. On one character you might focus more on melee weapons while you might focus on guns on another. This is one of the only games that I'd truly rate a 10/10. I read some reviews and some people were saying ""DAE WINDOWS 7/8 DOESNT WORK"" I laugh at these people because they are either not tech savvy at all or just being ridiculous. I have had windows 7 for 3+ years and windows 8 since release an I have not had a single problem at all. The game has only crashed a handfull of times in ovver 5 years. Its kind of sad how people are being lied to with the reviews. This game runs perfectly fine. This game is well worth the money even today. This game still competes with Skyrim and is one of the most Amazing games I have ever purchased.So overall this game deserves a 10/10 and is a ""Must Play""			"

Product received for free
												OS: Windows 7 UltimateRAM: 24 GBVID-Card: Nvidia GTX-850 TiProcessor: Intel i7 K-875 2.93KHzGraphics: 9/10Gameplay/Character Development: 10/10DLC: 10/10MOD Community: 10/10Audio: 10/10*Sighs wistfully* My first Fallout game, originally played on console (Xbox 360) and so loved that I got it on Steam, complete with the ""Game of the Year"" (GOTY) edition for the bonus and additional DLC. I also love the fact that Liam Neeson voices your father at the start of the game.I rather loved this game. The whole thing was really great and amongst my favorites. This is ""not optimized for Windows 7 and later"", but it did, in fact, work on my computer. At my time of writing this, it failed the last time I tried to start it up and, using satellite-based internet, I'll let you know if it still works properly within a month (if you see no change, assume it worked fine and I simply forgot.)Graphics: 9/10My only real disappointment with the graphics of Fallout is how dreary/sad they are, but that's still necessary as it IS a post-apocalyptic game, assuming readying for and the execution of nuclear war around WWI or WWII. I wouldn't have scored it down except that some of the graphics are recurring enough to be repetitive.Gameplay/Character Growth: 10/10I simply adored the chracater growth/development system. You have base stats that affect all your skills, and you gain perks as you continue on that grant you special bonuses, benefits, skills or what have you. In many respects, it's like a less complex version of D&D games or Skyrim and the like. There's a great deal to grow in various directions. Big or small guns, stealth or tank, smart/techy or just crash through things you could otherwise finesse your way around? Etc.DLC: 10/10All the DLC in this game is actually quite fun and nice, introducing a fair bit of information and adding elements, weapons and armors that weren't in the original. In point of fact, Fallout 4 DLC has most of this DLC as IT'S version, simply altered like the same person in a new outfit. The DLC of this game adds several hours of enjoyment.  Its difficult to say much without giving details and spoilers. But all of this is worth that.MOD's: 10/10There are a huge number of mods for this game. Change body types, clothes types, add romantic interaction, sexual interaction, new weapons, homes, shops, equipment, armors, clothes, children, etc. Nothing wierd with the kids mod. It just adds what is generally missing in most RPG games - Kids.Audio: 10/10There are several audio components you can adjust naturally, on top of the MOD's you could use.There are in-game radio stations, most of the music is from the similar era (40's) as when society fell.If you're on a newer computer, I'd suggest getting this on sale or attempting it with a download or something in the off chance your PC won't play it. If you need to, figure out how to run a virtual machine on your computer, or perhaps partition your system and load one with an older operating system. It's really worth it.-Paladeus			"

												This game delivers a very unique experience. It's an amazing showcase of how much depth and action can be packed into one title. You don't need to have played any of the past Fallout games to enjoy the story in this game. It stands on its own as a fantastic and well-crafted videogame. You should definitely buy this game. You won't regret the purchase.			"

												I dont quite understand why people are giving this bad reveiws latley. This game does everything it says it does and more, people reveiwing this as bad since it doesnt work with windows 10 (which it does) since it explicitly says ""Is Not Optimized For Win 7 Or later"" and then theres people saying it cant work without modding and this is partially true for windows 7. All of these people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about modding the game has obviously never played a pc bethesda title they have always required the unofficial patches on the nexus forums. Then theres the r♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that complain that the game has not achivements which this is mostly because it was released before steam became what it is today and achievments are pointless on steam so whats the point?

												Finished this a few days with 50-60 mods (mostly minor tweaks or aethetic changes), and I must say this game holds well even in 2013.  It took me some time to get into it, as I bought it in july and finished it in december, but once you do get the hang of the game, it's amazing.  Having played Skyrim and Oblivion previously, I will tell you Fallout is the superior game of both of them.  The setting, set in post apocalyptic D.C., is very immersive.  There's very few RPG's that are set in sci-fi or modern places, so this is definitely a gem to anyone who loves RPG but feels worn from fantasy themes.  However, like everything, nothing goes without some gripes.  As much I like guns in an RPG, the vanilla guns seem very lackluster.  I actually had to install weapon mods to add some more customizability.  Number 2 is the game is NOT optimized for quad core CPU's, something most computers have these days.  I can't think of the code from memory, but I had to put in some lines in my FALLOUT.INI to force the game to only use 2 of my cores or else the game would crash every 20 - 30 min. Number 3, is the vanilla character models, animations, and faces are terrible even for its time of release.  If you played Oblivion, those fugly faces are back so mods are essential if you want a decent looking character.   Number 4 --- too many super mutants -- enough said.  Now if you've gotten this far in this review, I will still say that the positives outweigh the negatives because I'm just trying to give everyone a good heads up, and if you managed to enjoy Oblivion or Skyrim, you can ignore half of these 'gripes'.  Everything else is good.  Overall it's a 9/10, so it's worth your money especially when it's $5-10.			"

												I loved every minute of this game. I tend to spend a lot of time searching for things and what not, so my run through time for the entire game was pretty long, but I love how you can go back, replay, and basically have different outcomes for play styles. I am probably one of the few who love the moral system and how it effects gameplay. This was the first of the Fallout series that I played and enjoyed this way more than I ever enjoyed New Vegas. The story is gripping and the characters are entertaining to interact with.			"

The game areas do suffer from repeated layouts though and you'll be visiting level designs one then once for different locations.

												Fallout 3 is definitely one of the best game i've ever played, I must have spent over 400 + hours on that game and I'm still not bored of it, there is just so much stuff to do that you end up playing over and over again. There is a large variety of guns, melee weapons, objects to collect, quests, creatures, NPCs, clothes etc.. There is also a lot of areas to explore in which most of the time feels new and fresh, you can even have a house that you can add stuff and themes in. But what makes this game really amazing is the ability to mod it, there is just so much awesome mods to add to this game, and its all free! The game itself takes about 60h minimum if you want to do everything in the game, and another 30h + with the DLCs. The story is also really interesting. And of course like other Bethesda games, you can customize your character to your liking, such as choosing his or her name, gender, appearances etc.. The game also has replay value since you can choose what kind of person you are. You can be a hero that saves lives and kills Super Mutants, or be a psycho killer that blows up towns and kill for caps, your choice! There is also a leveling system with special perks for your character and skills developement, which i thing is kind of a must have these days, especially in an RPG. The only downsides that I would give to this game are the weird bugs and glitches and the numerous crashes that you will encounter, and the kind of crappy animations, in which of course can be fixed with mods. The DLC were not that great in my opinion, don't get me wrong they're still worth it, but they're just not as interesting as they could have been. And that also occurs with the companions that can follow the character, exept for a small backstories, they dont have any side quests and they are not that interesting.Goods: + Lots of loot like weapons and objects, to sell or to put in your house. + Lots of customization for your character and your home. + Level up system with special perks and skill development. + Lots of quests and areas to explore. Interesting story. + Over 60 hours of gameplay with a bonus of 30 hours with the DLCs.+ Can save whenever you want and load the game at exactly where you last saved. + The ability of moding the game, which allows you to add whatever you want in the game really.+ Lots of interesting NPCs to interact within which most feels unique and different. + Insane replay value due to mods. + Lots of creature and enemies to kill and that feels unique and different.Bads:- Not so interesting but still worth it DLCs (in my opinion).- Lots of bug, glitches and crashes (especially when playing with mods).- Companions that are not really interesting (in my opinion).- Crappy and unnatural animations (but can be better with mods).Overall, I would really recommend this game to everyone that wants a good RPG with guns, gore and babes, and that want to go on a long adventure that will most likely, never end. Definitely worth the 19.99$ for the GOTY (Game of the Year) edition with all the DLCs included.Final Verdict:8/10 (not moded).Great Game!10/10 (with the good mods). Legendary!Recommended with a Badass seal of approval!!!!			"

												One of the best games ever created in gaming history and one of my favorite games I have ever played. I can't express how much I love this game. Great story, Great gameplay, and very interesting and fun post apocalyptic Washington D.C. to explore. If you like Skyrim you will love Fallout 3. If you like Dragon Age or The Witcher you will love Fallout 3. Fallout 3 is the best and the only game I think is just as good as Fallout 3 is Fallout New Vegas. 10/10			"

												Easily my favorite game of all time. Yes, the compatibilty issues with Windows 7/8 is a problem but once you get past that, this game is an absolute thrill ride. First, presentation is amazing here, never more have I just wanted to look out at the scenic view of the wasteland when you first leave that vault, as your eyes adjust to the light...and you see..chaos..deterioration. Gunplay is great, addictive, and will keep you going till the end. Side quests are located all around the map, some marked, others not, hundreds of hours of gameplay. Ever since day one, I loved the karma system, this idea of being good, evil, or somewhere in between always intruiged me and because of that I have had many playthroughs of the game. Doing a good run, then getting curious and doing all the evil, devious things, then started a neutral playthrough, then doing another good run, because I forgot all the quests, rewards, and the overall atmospheric changes you can have on the wastes. Which, I also loved, because you can actually make a difference in this wasteland. If you get bored with the playthroughs, there's also a thriving modding community out there with plenty of awesome mods to check out. You know, some say New Vegas is an overall better game, with its factions, added gameplay, better mechanics, but there is one thing Fallout 3 will always have over New Vegas: That Dark Wasteland Post Apocalyptic feel, something New Vegas didn't really show.10/10			"

												The Fallout Franchise raised the bar for all the Post-apocalyptic games to come.A lot of games make a huge deal out of player choice, but few in recent memory offer so many intricate, meaningful ways of approaching any given situation.You fulfill or dash the spiritual hopes of an idyllic society, side with slavers or their slaves, and decide the fate of more than one city over the course of your post-apocalyptic journey through the Washington DC wasteland. Your actions have far-reaching consequences that affect not just the world around you but also the way you play, and it's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing and allso replaying and replaying. It's deep and mesmerizing, and though not as staggeringly broad as the developer's previous games, it's more focused and vividly realized.Oh Yeah!? This is prabably the only game that gives a player the freedom to put a live grandes in someones pocket.			"

												Why is Fallout 3 among the best games ever made in a nut shell? It lets you live out a fascinating story in a familiar but ruined world. It paints and charts the life of an imaginary you and lets you act in a way that makes you feel personally invested in the outcome of its story. The characters all feel alive and important. Game play wise it is solid and easily understood enough to carry the story to the end with epic detail, impact, and flare. ProsEverything about it.ConsThis game could only have been better by adding more. More monsters, npcs, stats, and maps. It could have lived on MMO style and possibly gone multi-player. The PC version is buggy and does suffer from crashing at times. It hasn't hit me personally much, and I save often.  Really, it should be updated to Window 10 for the crazy number of copies sold.Bottom line: If you don't own Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition and you like games, movies, or stories, find a way to play it immediately.

I love this game, it is far more enjoyable than New Vegas and I heavily mod both games. Fallout 3 is more deep and complex than New Vegas, it's not a linear and the world is far more open. I definitely recommend this game if you love amazing rpgs!			"

												This game is truly amazing and I am greatly saddened by the fact that it's user reviews are brought down to only ""very positive"", just because people are too indolent to try and solve simple problems. Disregard every negative review as they are ALL complaints about easy-to-fix problems that I will explain in greater detail at the end of this review.Fallout 3 has managed to set standards in both the FPS and RPG genres, and is possibly my favourite game of all time. Very few games come anywhere close to F3 in lore, atmosphere, combat, story, and overall gameplay, and none are on par in all of those elements combined.Lore - the fallout franchise as a whole has some of the most developed and interesting lore that I've experienced from a video game. Though, managing to incorperate it without requiring the player to have played previous games is something that F3 has done incredibly well.Atmosphere - Being set in a post-apocalyptic US, 200 years after nuclear war with China, F3 has done a fantastic job at making a nearly desolate nuclear wasteland something worth exploring. That combined with with themes from a 50's, anti-communist, nuclear, technologically advanced America makes F3 something truly unique and incredibly enjoyable to dwell in and explore.Combat - F3's combat was truly revolutionary for its time. The mechanic found in V.A.T.S was something never seen before and many mechanics in current games get their inspiration from it. Nothing compares to an intense gunfight whilst you have mid-20th century swing and blues playing from your Pip-Boy.Story - Many have complained that F3's story is too linear, and admittedly the main storyline is fairly linear, but the main quests aren't the only story. There is just as much emphasis on side quests as there is on the main one, and side quests often have a lot of decisions to be made. It's in the rest of the quests that you decide how you want to play and what kind of person you want to be.Gameplay - After leaving the vault, you are constantly progressing. Fighting harder enemies, getting better weapons and armour, and increasing your various skills. But it never gets repetitive. While you still have quests to complete, and there are many, gameplay will never become blasé.The complaints I have with this game are few, and all can be fixed with F3's amazing modding community. So I will include links to the mods that fix all of these problems.No ADS - The ability to aim down your sight is one that seems to be in nearly every FPS, so it is somewhat surprising that F3 doesn't have it. Instead, you get a slight zoom by pressing what would be the ADS key. Luckily there are modders that have fixed this. http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/6938/?Micro stutter - This slight stutter is one that has plagued both the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games for a long time. A fix can be found here http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/8886/?Sprinting - It can be annoying when you need to traverse a great distance but you're stuck with that slow vanilla running. It seems odd that you wouldn't be able to sprint, but of course, we have the modding community to fix this. http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/1854/?Now for the problems that keep all the negative reviewers from enjoying the game.If you press play on the first window and it closes without launching the game, more likely than not, you do not have Games for Windows Live installed. This is required to run F3.Games for Windows Live: http://download.gfwl.xboxlive.com/content/gfwl-public/redists/production/xliveredist.msiAnother problem that people have is that the game will occasionally freeze. As you have seen on the store page for Fallout 3, it is not optimized for Windows 7 and 8. I've been using the Fallout Script Extender(FOSE) for a while and I've experienced no freezes.FOSE: http://fose.silverlock.org/This may help too.Better Game Performance: http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/13520/?Overall, Fallout 3 is absolutely fantastic and is one of the greatest experiences I've had with a video game. 95/100 "

												This review comes at a bit of a strange time as I first played Fallout 3 years ago. Then I tried to get it to work with my current rig and it wouldn't despite numerous attempts at fixing it. I eventually gave up and moved on to playing Fallout Vegas. I did like Vegas (and still haven't completed it) but found I had strong memories of Fallout 3 and kept judging Vegas by its predecessor. Then recently a miracle happened and I found a fix that got 3 working again. I have never been able to put my finger on it but Vegas had something missing from it which Fallout 3 had. I think its a combination of things really. For a start I found the whole setting and atmosphere of Fallout 3 to be way more apocalyptic than Vegas. Thats probably down to the twisted wreckage of old highways that dot the horizon and vast skeletal shells of long dead cities. It really makes you feel that something extremely bad happened to the world (which of course did). The music varies and sometimes can be hauntingly eerie.There are a ton of side missions and of course the main story. All that before you even touch the DLC's. The game has many good storylines with some that force you to decide what kind of wastelander you are going to be,With our world supposedly on the verge of its next extinction event and heightened tensions between some super powers its never been a better time to play fallout and visit the maybe world of tomorrow.Fallout 4 is on its way. It looks great so far but I expect it will be compared to the earlier games such as Fallout 3.A most definite 10 / 10 classic title that should be in every serious gamers library.			"

												The hallowed memories of yesteryears games makes the Fallout tradition a challenging project to have undertaken. Bethesda has not released a perfect game, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is indeed a worthy heir to the Fallout lineage. What it has lost by leaving the 3rd person isometric view it has gained back 100 fold by an amazingly detailed world, storylines that go far beyond simple lines of dialog, and many different paths for the player to choose. There is in fact far more content than any single playthrough needs to experience, promising greater replayability.A masterpiece.			"

I'm on a fresh install of Win8, all I had to do was replace d3d9.dll, install g4wl, set compatability to windows vista, bUseThreadedAI to 1, and thats it. I've explorered the entire map for hours with 0 crashes.Edit: i did the free windows 10 upgrade and it still works fine, its also modded out with HD textures, unofficial patch and fose to launch, and it still logs hours into my steam, steam bpm overlay also works. As far as the game goes, Its Fallout3. A classic! 10/10.			"

												I have not EVER played this game. It is probably a very good game, Bethesda has made some of the best I've played. However, do not purchase this game! It crashes every single time I launch it. The game will crash when you click play from the launch screen, I have two minutes logged in the game. All from sitting in the title screen. It is ridiculous. And is both Steam and Bethesda's fault. DO NOT SELL GAMES THAT DO NOT RUN!!!!!I refuse to jump through hoops to play a game that I have just paid money for. Fix it, patch it, repair it,....or drop it.I've ranted long enough....though this is not the first time Steam has gotten my money for games that don't work.It's getting old....real old.			"

												Ridiculous Amounts of FunI purchased this game on a whim. After playing FO3:GOTY on my PS3, I was curious to see what it would be like to play on the PC. I was not disappointed. I had some trouble running the game at first, as this is not optimized for Win10, but after some fiddling around I was able to play with great stability. The only thing I didn't really care for was the lengthy intro. This game is a great way to kill time, and sit back. If your specs are good this game will look amazing. If your like me, and prefer preformance, this will look even better. The combat system is simple, no different than FNV. V.A.T.S. is OP if your stats are right, the weapons and armor are balanced, along with the items. And the soundtrack is nothing to scoff at. There are many ways to play the story. You can play as a theif by stealing everything in sight (say bye-bye to your karma!), you can play as a hero, a monster, and much more. Score:-Gameplay: 8/10-Sound: 7/10-Combat: 10/10-Graphics: 9/10-DLC: 8/10-Overall Score: 8/10On to the technical stuff. All I own is a Surface Pro 2, and some accessories for it. So of course gameplay isn't going to be stellar. I am posting these as a reference for anyone who would like to see what my specs are compared to theirs.

												Since Fallout 4 is nearing it's release date I'll release a review for Fallout 3. Now before I start I'll end the common debate most people have when they want to start playing the Fallout series... DO I PURCHASE FALLOUT NEW VEGAS OR FALLOUT 3? Well since I have both I'll write down the pros and the cons of both games so bear with me for now.Fallout 3 Pros+ Very story rich, tells you about the Lone Wanderer and how he/she was born and raised.+ Is a very beautiful game in my personal opinion.+ Very nice radio that will keep you entertained while travelling the Washington wasteland.+ Multiple endings so you can keep playing this game over and over.+ THREE DOG AND DOGMEAT.+ Very big atmosphere that's entirely yours to explore.+ VATS is a wonderful gameplay mechanic that is introduced in Fallout 3.+ Karma meter which makes you feel like you're an actual person instead of just a mindless killer.Fallout 3 Cons- No iron sight aiming.- Not optimized for Windows 7 or later. (This doesn't mean that it's unplayable on Windows 7 it's just that you have to modify the game files and that's really time consuming. Took me about 7 hours to fix Fallout 3 for my Windows 7 computer.)- Somewhat small level cap (20, but can be increased with the Broken-Steel DLC)- Very short main story line.- Companions AREN'T invincible.- Doesn't have an indicatior for when weapons are really worn thus making them more likely to jam.Now that I've talked a bit about Fallout 3 I'll talk about the pros and cons of Fallout: New VegasFallout: New Vegas Pros+ Iron sight aiming.+ VATS is a returning feature in Fallout: New Vegas.+ Companions are invincible.+ Hardcore mode is an option for all you hardcore fans out there.+ Runs fine on Windows 7 and later (managed to run it on my terrible computer at a stable 60 FPS.)+ A better radio than Fallout 3 (in my personal opinion.)+ Weapon modification is an option.+ REX.+ You're in Las Vegas, what more do I need to say?+ Some fun gambling to do in The Strip if that's your thing.+ Increasing level cap if you have DLC installed. (Increases by 5 for each DLC, 30 is the base level cap.)+ Very big and beautiful world, but not as big as Fallout 3.+ The Kings.+ No karma requirements to recruit companions.+ Reputation for factions.Fallout: New Vegas- Tons of invisible walls over the Mojave Wasteland.- No back story AT ALL about our player character: The Courier.- Very limited story endings.- A lot of walking must be done unless you have found some places to fast travel to. - TONS of bugs.- A.I isn't as good as in Fallout 3.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now for the review of Fallout 3: You start off as a baby that is newly born. You then have a time skip to you as a toddler, and another to when you're 10, and 15. Finally when you're 18 the game really starts. This game is beautiful the moment you step out of Vault 101 and see the sunlight for the first time. It's not too far into the game when you meet Dogmeat, a fan favourite companion loved by all. During this time you are already free to do as you please and explore the Washington wastelands. This game is entirely based by your actions so it's amazing that you get to choose how the game will end. Will you be a villian feared all across the wasteland? Or will you be the guardian angel of the wasteland? If you want to find out... BUY THIS GAME! (Ps. took me about an hour to write, enjoy)			"

												Well, I have played this game before on the PS3 awhile ago, So i decided to try it again on my PC because i thought it would be a better experience maybe putting some mods in the game to ""spice it up"". I bought the Pack that comes with DLC's and the New Vegas edditon, The New Vegas eddition worked well but Fallout 3 didnt work as well as i planned it to. i can get to the launcher but then right after i click play, my launcher crashes and my game doesnt load, therefor i cannot play fallout 3.

												It's an interesting game with a good story and setting.  There are loads of places to explore and things to do.  Without a guide I'm sure you would never find half of the things that you can poke at to get more quests.Just save yourself the time and read the tv tropes page and various wikis.This game is not compatable with modern multi-core processors so it can crash quite frequently when you go through one of the excessively numerous loading zones.  If it was a simple crash to desktop, it wouldn't be so bad, but this crash requires you to restart your machine.			"

												I first played Fallout 3 in 2010, on an xbox 360, I was blown away and an obsession was born in me.The games story compared to New Vegas, isn't the best, but still amazing, I loved every second of it.I played for 100+ hours and then a friend gave me his GOTY with all the DLC, I thought I was going to die. The DLC easily adds 100's of hours to the game, simply because Broken Steel, allows you to continue after the end of the base game.The sidequests, and backstories, for everything are wonderfully done. And the in-game radio stations are just great, playing all the songs that just complete the atmosphere of the game.Other than a few compatibility issues I ran into since I'm running Windows 8.1, (I had to install GFWL for it to work) I just installed 18 mods that overhaul the textures in-game, and it's just beautiful. Even though the hype train is rather crowded, I'm on it.I'd give it a hard 9.5/9.5Keep on fighting the good fight.			"

												Apparently its a great game.I wouldnt know personally.Be forewarned that as with most Bethseda releases you WILL spend far more time fixing bad code, re running the game, playing for a while, then rebooting your pc when it hard locks.Also be forewarned that this is in no way an 'install and play' game. Depending on your machine, you will need to research and apply any one of two dozen or so different crash fixes BEFORE YOU CAN GET PAST THE LOADER. This is NOT a finished retail software package, this is another wholly unsupported beta release, and any OS past Windows XP or Vista are officially UNSUPPORTED. I highly recommend not paying for this title at all. The only way to get your moneys worth on this title is to pirate it.			"

												Bethesda shines in their inability to make a game work despite Oblivion or even Morrowind having zero issues on Windows 7 and later, producing some of the worst animations known to man while indie studios surpass them on a shoestring budget, and of course, the long-time favorite act of getting three people to voice 99% of the characters in the game while one hollywood celebrity plays a minor part. At least Liam Neeson had more than two lines in the game, unlike Patrick Stewart.I had a decent time playing this at 720p and 15-28FPS on an xbox nearer to the release date and when it works it can still be fun despite Bethesda having the competency of your average ""guns are scary and evil"" idiot when it comes to gun mechanics. However, I cannot in any way recommend incompetent garbage that doesn't work.			"

												[This review does contain spoilers. I mean, this game is 7 years old after all.]You probably know all about this game. It came out a pretty long time ago, 2008 to be exact. Even though this is the GOTY version, I won't be reviewing the DLCs.So, let's start with a bit of history you probably already know. Fallout is an action RPG. Fallout takes place after a nuclear war between 'Murka, China and the Soviet Union, which started and ended on the same day. The nuclear war turned the entire world into a wasteland. Fallout from the beginning wasn't a Bethesda game. It was originally a series from Interplay and Black Isle Studios, planned as a successor to the game Wasteland.Fallout 1 and 2 are considered classics and were critically-acclaimed. Interplay later published the two major spin-offs, the favorable Fallout Tactics, and the unfavorable Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. Then we got Warfare and Van Buren, but let's not speak about those.Bethesda later bought the series and developed Fallout 3. They later acted as publishers for the next game, New Vegas, which was developed by Obsidian Entertainment.Most gameplay would be impossible without the Pip-Boy (also present in the previous games) which is a device worn on the player's forearm, which displays the inventory, the quest log, stats, the map, item properties, a radio and even a Geiger counter which can be viewed in the upper right corner. The standard color of the Pip-Boy is Green, but you can change it to your liking. The color of the Pip-Boy also affects the HUD which displays health, action points, and a compass. Fallout 3 also has perks, which were in previous Fallout games. Vault Boy is the mascot and appears on most things, such as when picking up an item, when you're poisoned or when picking a perk.The starting place is Vault 101, where the player was born. It is a safe haven from the nuclear wasteland, where people can live in peace and prosperity. Vault 101 is one of the only vaults left standing since most vaults were desimated by vicious experiments done by the Vault Overseers and personnel. Such as Vault 87, where citizens were transformed into hideous, deformed mutants. The game takes place in the areas in and around Washington D.C. DLCs also take you to Alaska, Maryland, air force bases, and even a mother♥♥♥♥ing spaceship.Bethesda♥♥♥♥♥♥on the lore quite a bit in this game, but it's not really much of a bother when it comes to enjoyment. One faction has been the center of this complaint, the Enclave. The Enclave are the remnants of the US government, and are usually considered the ''bad guys''. They were supposedly eradicated in Fallout 2. The faction was only present on the West Coast, but somehow the Enclave appears on the East Coast....?How does this possibly work out? How does mere remnants of a faction travel across one of the world's largest landmasses, without succumbing to the dangers of the Wasteland? They aren't even supposed to exist in the first place. They are quite powerful in Fallout 3 aswell, even proving a challenge for the other faction, the much more established Brotherhood of Steel, which are usually counted as the ''good guys''. They're all for freedom, liberty, you know the deal. That's another faulty trait in Fallout 3, it's extremely black-and-white morally. There's a bad side and a good side, and even though the game makes a meek attempt to change this slightly at the end of the game (the option to infect the water with FEV), it still hovers over the game like a gray cloud of blandness.The appearance of the Enclave on the East Coast is just roughly and slovenly explained in one of the DLCs, Broken Steel. It was just like Bethesda slapped a book in your face and said: ''This is how it is. Deal with it''. It just doesn't make sense. Many appearances of non-East Coast tech either remain unexplained or badly explained. It makes me believe that Bethesda didn't even inquire with loremasters at Interplay or Black Isle. Even after researching the lore, I have found cracks in the lore that lack any explaination or meaning.Fallout 3 is saturated with plotholes and inconsistencies. Where do people get their food for instance? There seems to be food in abundance, but I can count the number of farms or crops in Fallout 3 on one hand. Surely the food from before the war would've run out a good 200 years after the war? Oh, and the Super Mutants can keep the mighty Brotherhood stalled, but can't defeat a village of young unarmored adults protected by a small wooden barricade.The ""sacrifice"" of your father in the purifier is such a forced plot element, and ofcourse the main bad guy survives with his magic drugs (available to no one else!), which he really shouldn't have access to considering that he's from a shattered faction with no influence whatsoever, that had its technology blown up in the previous game.The story is the run-of-the-mill story that has been given to you in Fallout and Fallout 2. They're basically mashed together. Those stories were about saving your home from the bad guys. Fallout actually evolved the story from acquiring a water chip for the vault to defeating a deformed lump of flesh who had created the most fearsome army of the Wasteland. That's basically what Fallout 3 is, with modification. Your dad escapes the vault, you follow him, he tells you about his plan to help the people, you help him, the bad guys come, you need to defeat them etc. It's a pretty boring and plain story, and a lot of the situations that happen in Fallout 3 are very predictable and don't provide the shock value that Bethesda seemingly tried to implement. The side quests can be a bliss at times though. Tranquility Lane was a load of fun and one of the best quests in the game.The side quests are unique enough and not the glorified radiant quests usually found in games like Skyrim. Some of the side quests have a large effect on the world, The Power of the Atom being the most notable. That quest can change the world 1-2 hours in, if you do it the right way. The biggest problem with the quests are that they are usually very linear, more choices and alternate paths in Fallout 3's quests would do it some good.The combat is basic shooter combat (Oblivion with guns) besides from the system V.A.T.S, which pretty much aims for you. V.A.T.S makes combat too easy way too often. It worked in the earlier games, but coupled with Gamebryo it's♥♥♥♥♥♥Basically everyone outside the cities are empty shells. Main Quest characters and some people in the cities are the only NPCs I cared for. Atleast each city/town has one interesting character. For example Harkness in Rivet City, Confessor Cromwell in Megaton and Mayor MacCready in Little Lamplight. Sure, wandering the wasteland can have some interesting encounters and easter eggs, but otherwise you probably will meet uninteresting people, if you meet anyone at all. And let's not forget the uninspired, tacky writing and the horrible voice acting.Probably the most interesting character in the game is Three Dog. That man has brought me a lot of happiness when wandering the wastes. He's the disc jockey of the Wasteland's most popular radio station. He became a fan favorite, and is still my favorite Fallout 3 character. His jokes and speeches are radiant, but the list of lines from him is quite a long one. I enjoyed listening to that station a lot. The radio in Fallout 3 is very well done and Bethesda did a good job. The songs are great and they fit in with the atmosphere. I listened to both Enclave Radio and GNR.The game uses the Gamebryo engine, the same engine used in Oblivion. The game uses the Havok physics engine.So, Fallout 3 is an enjoyable game with large flaws. Still, it is counted among one of the best games of all time. Probably not. It's a good game, but I'd recommend New Vegas.			"

												Fallout 3. This is a game that will, most of the time, suck you in with its amazing atmosphere and environments. I say most of the time because, just like the Steam notice says there, it's not optimized for Windows 7. Now I have Windows 7, and I fully played through all the content in this game, and what I believe they're trying to say with that is that this game has a bunch of performance issues. Fallout 3 loves to crash. A lot. As in, it made me press the quicksave button all the time so I'd make sure I wouldn't lose as much progressas I potentially could. However, I did play through everything, and I loved it. In fact, this is the second time that I've played through everything in Fallout 3. I just love the game so much that even the regular crash couldn't stop me.The very first part of the game is so well done, very immersive and eases you into the game proper nicely. Don't expect amazing shooting mechanics, while it does have FPS mechanics (you'll never used third person camera because of how bad it is for combat) you don't play it for the shooting. You play it instead for the RPG elements, the storytelling, and the impeccable atmosphere the Wasteland offers you. It's grim, it's gory, it's gritty, it is a complete hellhole on a destroyed post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Many of the landmarks that characterize D.C in the real world are very well replicated here in its ruined and wrecked glory. The Fallout universe itself is a joy to be in, with its 50's/futuristic quirks, power armors, aliens, big guns that really go BOOM, and freaky mutations. The game did give me quite a few jumpscares when I was caught unawares by some of the wildlife. The V.A.T.S system is awesome as you pick your favorite body part and shoot, complete with guts and gore flying everywhere as your enemies die. Good stuff.The inevitable question when it comes to this game is: ""Is it better than New Vegas or is it the other way around?"" I would say that even though I slightly prefer New Vegas, both are worth playing anyway because it shows both Bethesda and Obsidian's strong (and weak) points. And both are good games in their own right.Bethesda made Fallout 3. And what makes Bethesda great are both its sidequests (which are always more interesting than the main story itself) and its attention to detail in its environments. They love to litter the landscape with information, each containing a small story or information explaining why that skeleton's standing in that bathroom, for example. And sometimes it doesn't, all it shows you, all it needs, is the scenery itself that tells the story for you. This makes exploration really engaging and fun because things rarely feel they're copypasted (except the subway tunnels but there's only so much you can do to make a ruined subway tunnel stand out, though some do stand out anyway).The quests themselves have multiple solutions and most of the time offer choice, like a good RPG should, and trust me, you can do some extreme stuff in these which will literally change the landscape, but then again, these choices and this engaging writing are severely lacking in the main quest itself, which is clichéd and ultimately really linear. I prefer Obsidian's writing overall, so New Vegas wins out on Fallout 3 for me there. Fallout 3 though, like any good sandbox RPG should do, which New Vegas does not, is allow you to keep playing after the actual ending. In NV's defense though, there are so many endings that it would be hell to program into, but still, it's something worth keeping an eye out for.Fallout 3's the oldest game of the two, so it will, gameplay-wise, lack a few features NV adds in later on.Like any modern Bethesda RPG, Fallout 3 adds much needed mod support which makes the PC version by far the best, allowing you to fix many of its faults, and become an even better experience than it already is. Though I'd recommend just sticking to performance mods the first time around, as some of these mods can change the game dramatically.The DLC for the game itself is a bit hit and miss in my opinion. DLCs like Broken Steel which let you keep playing the game after its conclusion, or Point Lookout and The Pitt, which add areas of their own with stuff to do are great, but Anchorage and Zeta, though unique, don't add to the game all that much, and you wouldn't feel like something's missing if these never came out.All in all, I totally recommend this game, lots of RPG goodness and with mod support, can have you keep coming for more.

Unlike Fallout 4 you actually get some choice in what you want to say, and if you want you can actually be evil. Want to nuke a small community? Go for it. Want to enslave others for a profit? Go for it. Want to destroy your father's dream of free water for all by poisoning it so as to create a 'pure' society of the survivors? Go for it! Want to blow up the citadel and kill Maxson before he has a chance to grow up and become a major ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Well here is your chance!			"

												Slow, quest based first person shooter with RPG hit or miss combat using Oblivion's engine in a world that feels muddly and dirty like Morrowind. I'm not a fan of this game, but I understand millions of people are. There was a time when I would have crabed a game like this. Morrowind... but a FPS. Well this just makes me want to play a real FPS. Why? I hate clearly shooting an enemy and having it do no damage simply because of RPG style combat where it is a roll of the dice. The story didn't suck me in. It made me think why me and people don't really talk like this do they? It is a vast world out there, but I have no desire to explore it when it all looks the same.			"

												For starters, let's say I didn't hate playing FO3. I've beaten it few times, did the majority of quests and even played all the DLC's. I even had fun doing that. Do I recommend playing it? Maybe. Is it a terrible game? No. There, I said it. Moving on. Here's my main gripe: FO3 is what happens when you take a fantastically written post-apocalyptic game series and hand the rights over to a company whose writers appear to be 12-year-olds.Imagine a world where every city, every store and every household is an entity separate from the surrounding world. Nothing has an effect on anything else. There's a town a miles down the road with a problem with Raiders? Yeah, that doesn't really affect this storekeeper couple. Heaps of radscorpions make life a living hell for a bunch of settlers living in a run-down village? Yeah, that has no bearing on this other community a stone's throw away, their only problem pertains to fixing their fertility robot. Oh, and getting their hands on a vacuum tube located 20 miles away because reasons.When you have dozens of locations with seemingly no connection to one another or the main plot, you end up with a huge sandbox that barely resembles the intricate interconnected plots of the first two games. That's Fallout 3's setting in a nutshell. Real world doesn't work like that. If your counter-argument is ""this is a game, not the real world lol"" you're completely missing the point. Fallout 1 and 2 came out years before FO3 and yet they still managed to accomplish a sense of reality - albeit a very far-fetched and sometimes tongue-in-cheek one.Take Fallout 2, where you have a complicated, interconnected political web between New Reno, Redding, Vault City and NCR. Take Fallout: New Vegas where everything rotates around the ongoing conflict between NCR and Caesar's Legion. Everyone has a say in this, everybody is affected. Your choices affect the outcome and the ongoing power structure. That's how you write a game. And that's where FO3 falls flat on its face.The main plot is bland. I felt like I had no reason to follow the PC's dad. Instead I ran around, doing quests here and there, fetching this and killing that, getting little satisfaction from the caps and experience I accumulated. It wasn't really rewarding. None of it. Just a mindless, momentary distraction on the road to the grave.Oh, and the metro tunnels suck.			"

												A Bethesda RPG set 200 years into a post apocalyptic future. It's tempting to just call this game ""Oblivion with space guns"" but there is more to it than that. You can create custom weapons from schematics and the hacking, lockpicking and XP elements all help to separate it from it's kin - no more grinding skills to level up!Whether these changes make the game more enjoyable than Bethesdas' fantasy RPG's is up to you. The level cap of 20 definately makes it a shorter game than either Morrowind, Oblivion or Skyrim.The GOTY edition is good value for money as fallout 3 on it's own is a tad short; I completed the main plot and reached max level after only 60 hours of gameplay; and although there was lots of content still to explore I had little incentive to do so. The GOTY edition content boosted the level cap to 30, serving to extend that lifespan somewhat. However, I had reached that cap after completing just two of the 5 DLC packs. Fallout 3 is very stylish and, on the whole, I found the game to be fun and immersive with a huge, detailed world and a great plot. I want to add that the radio feature is excellent too, and is largely responsible for me loving a new genré of music.So if you want an RPG that excludes the usual swords and elves, you can't go far wrong with this.

												I've heard a lot of people call this game ""terrible"" in comparsion to the original Fallouts 1&2. While it is definitely not up to par, I wouldn't call the game terrible. I just finished FO1&2, as I am re-playing them all in chronological order, and so far this is a very enjoyable experience. Woulda been nice if they added an option to move kinda like Dragon Age though, that would have added a lot of spunk to the game. Giving the option of Freemode and Turnbased, bringing back some of the memories of old. Some of the quests and things definitely don't feel like Fallout, but most of the experience does. Add ENB and a few mods and the game is even better. Definietly recommended.I am playing with FOSE and a pretty extensive mod collection. That's why my playtime is at 0. If anyone is interested in my mod list let me know, they are good for a first playthrough or if your just trying to run through the core game. Not too much added to make it overwhelming.			"

												It's like Borderlands, if Borderlands were better and a single player experience and actually built up some semblance of an atmosphere that wasn't all just ''sand sand sand epic memes''. You explore the wastelands and, while there's a main storyline (search for your father), the side quests are honestly where its at. Unlike Borderlands typical ''go to area X, kill things and come back'', Fallout 3 has storylines to each side quest that range from the intruiging to the surprising. The areas were the side quests take you are also areas you'd expect to be part of the main storyline, since they're very detailed and numerous. Seriously, if you only play the main storyline you'd miss well over half of the game, and that's not an exaggeration.The way in which you find out about quests makes the whole experience feel more realistic. You don't go to a bulletin board and pick quests, rather, you might run into a citizen with a request, pick up a strange radio signal in a particular area, find a note while exploring a new locale, or just happen to stumble upon a fight taking place. It all immerses you into the world and gives it a realistic feeling of exploration and loneliness. Some of the quests also present you with multiple ways to finish them, which means that you get a real sense of added importance to your choices. It got to the point where I was juggling dialogue choices and planning what to do to proceed, as I didn't wanna have one party come to an unfavorable outcome while the other struck gold.The battle system gives options: you can realistically go through the whole game using only VATS, an RPG-ish system whereby you attack enemies with your equipped weapon; you select a body part of theirs and are shown the odds the attack will hit. Or you can play this entierely as a first person (or third person) shooter. Personally, I found no issue with the shooting, but apparently this is a point of contention as some say its like an attempt at a FPS in an engine that wasn't made for that. I'll say this: it isn't broken and there's nothing inherently wrong with it.A word of warning; this game isn't optimized for Windows 7 (Vista as well, I think), so you might have issues running it. I simply had to change the ini file to allow multi-cores, and the crashes stopped. But others have had a much tougher time at it, so give it a pirate first.But issues aside, a solid 9/10 with hours of exploration. I'm 70 hours in and not even halfway through the main game cause I've been exploring and doing sidequests.			"

I have to say I'm impressed. It brings me the same joy the other bethesda games give me. It's great. Go buy it...			"

												This game has to be my favorite game of all time! I bought this first on the 360, then ps3, again on ps3 because the disk scratched. After I migrated to PC when I had gotten an alienware, I again purchased it on steam. Best choice. Now I can mod and upgrade the graphics to enjoy this game in higher definition.			"

												One of THE best immersions in post-nuclear apocalyptic world. Throughout the game you will be amazed with the story coverage, you will find yourself doing alot of amazing side quests. Also the game tends to be non-linear and offers a challenge for newcomers aswel as veterans. Beside that, it offers an open world designer program that enables you to work and design your own settings and test them ingame - the GOAT. Also the whole retro scene of the world left behind a nuclear disaster is pretty cool.For all RPG-ers, cyber-punk fans, futuristic FPS-ers, and open - world genre enthusiasts I suggest trying this game out. Cheers.			"

												Beautiful story, immersive world, great gameplay, mod it once and it crashes 10/10 would drink from a dirty toilet to save my life again. In all seriousness though this is one of the most beautiful and immersive rpgs I've ever played. I can always gaze at the open landscape of the capital wasteland and enjoy it's destroyed beauty. I can always go back and play through areas of the game with a different approach for a new kind of expierience. I'm always find things I never found before even after spending hundreds of hours playing this game. So many characters stand out and are well defined in a way that it makes you feel such great emotion towards them whether it be positive or negative. This is truly one of my personal favorite games of all time and it almost never ceases to bore or disappoint me.			"

												The road so far......wasn't kind to me. It was full of loss and misery. Full of hopeless people and lost souls that stepped on this doomed wasteland.Yet, it wasn't only damnation that followed my steps. I found my father, my love Amata, a faithful companions... only to loose them the next second.If this was the road so far, what will follow it? I know you can't talk, my good, old, friend, dogmeat. Despite that, I know you can listen, you are the only one who does that. So, thank you, buddy.________________________After 95 hours I finally finished this unique game. It was a long journey that, sadly, or not, came to the conclusion.I have mixed feeling because I can not, but to notice, the flaws of this game.The combat is far from perfection. Constant invisible walls interfere in the shooting so that stealth and sniper headshot from a far is not an option. It is frustrating at times, but the VATS does a perfect job to overcome the combat flaws. It balances it.Writing of the main story. It's not good. It's average. It does the job to send you to a different locations and introduce the world, but that's it. I do like the small stories, though, which this world is packed to it's fullest and the enormous attention to detail. But the main plot... At the end, the feeling is that the bone was thrown and if we search enogh we can find it. In any case, sadly, it's not there. A mere feel of a presence of something epic is not what we want.Don't take me the wrong way. I like this game. It's good. Not perfect but good enough. There isn't any very good highlights but the mixture and huge diversity make this game a unique experience worth to check...if you push by yourself and force to go throw the tedious start that keept me aways the 2 past attempts to play Fallout 3.First 20 levels are a joy to play. You keep discovering new things and some quite memorable moments. A very simple details engage with a perfection to this unworthy world: A text based story about Grognak that you play on a terminal; Tranquility Lane; Princess who is secretly in love with the leader of Little Lamplight; Brother who got two naughty nightwear; A old man who I saved from suicide attempts.Despite the average writing of the main plot where it shines is in the clues of the past. There is no history in Fallout 3. Though, it creates an understanding of the past by the logs, terminals and documents. And it does the job like non other game up this date. The contradictive information, the vision of people of the those past events - at times I felt like archaeologist.There are a huge depth that you can completely ignore and focus on the aspects you like. Do whatever. The world is there. What do you gonna do in it?________________________It happened before and it will happen again.So many killed, so much destroyed... and yet it's not enough, it is never enough. Because war... war never changes.It is time, we need to go my friend. Our journey has just started.


Into the sunset. The last moment of my gameplay.

												You know the drill.  Let's make believe, and in this go at FPS  ""Fallout 3"" (2008),  do believe that Bethesda Games Studio does straight away serve up a world of bad lands and glades of unfriendly beasts. The story can twist and turn as there are all sorts of game styles to configure that manner of mayhem.  Loads of fun, that does require lots of time to get down with this get down. Cheers.			"

Anyway, game works fine on Windows 7+, just do a quick/easy search to tweak the ini-file in a minor way, and you're on your way to one of the best and most expansive games I've ever played.  Still awesome 6 f'in years after it was released!  Oh, and grab the mods (too many to list, and they all work on Windows 7+ as well) -- they will make the game even better and you will have a hard time remembering that this game was released in 2009!

												This is some good♥♥♥♥♥♥ any and all Fallout is a very good thing (even BoS, that's some serious stuff). Lacks the complexity or depth of Fallout 1, 2 & New Vegas but shakes the formula up with an interesting change of setting. What holds this back from a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I-N-G God-like status, is that Fallout 3 often plays it safe in terms of what elements have been used from previous games. Despite the change in location, the fundamentals of this story have already been covered in the past two games, the fact you have a daddy in this game doesn't change jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ But when it shines, it really shines. Some very memorable moments in this game, one thing I do think it has the edge over the other games in the series. There really isn't anything like discovering Tranquility Lane in this series, or any game in general. Cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ 9/10.			"

												Fallout 3 GOTY edition is a good game, I would buy the Game of the year edition instead of the normal version as it comes with tons more stuff to do. The game is an open world RPG and is probably the best game I have ever played, in fallout everything is alive and well meaning you'll find random encounters and the NPC's aren't just people you speak to once and then thats it because most NPC's have stuff to offer like side quests. I have heard people play a load of hours in this game and I wouldn't see why, the first time I played fallout 3 was on my brothers xbox. I never really got to play it till now but I am still amazed by it by playing it to this day. Now there are a few issues with the game and the worst part is the technical difficulties, steam says the game doesn't work on windows 7 and up, well I have windows 8.1 and the game works perfect execpt the fact that it randomly minimizes and then crashes probably because microsoft have butcherd windows as this minimizing♥♥♥♥♥♥happens in nearly every game I have played on windows 8 and sometimes 7 but they don't crash they just minimize to desktop.Another issue with the game is how hard it is but this isn't the type of challenging hard this is just the devolpers way of throwing enemys at you in the open. You will die many times in this game because of the enemys here and another pathetic issue is the fact the higher you are the stronger you're bullets are which means its hard to kill at lower levels, this feature does not make any sense and only makes sense in other games like pokemon because their monsters that battle other monsters and it depends on their level. Because of this bullet's problem it will drain ammunation as well which is a♥♥♥♥♥♥take, I am constantly running out of ammo in this game.but the game is not bad it is really good when you start leviling up and learning all sorts of new things, thats when the game gets better than it was when you played it at a lower level.

												Please note that some users have issues getting the game to run on Windows 7 and up, there are fixes available thanks to the community though.Ah Fallout 3, such a great game (I owned a copy 5 years ago that just used Games For Windows Live). Definitely one of those games that you will never forget, and worth every penny.Story takes place with you being born, from there you name your character and predict how you'll look in the future when you're older. Your mother dies due to complications when giving birth. The first half hour or so is you growing up over many years where you select your S.P.E.C.I.A.L abilities, get your pip-boy and BB gun, take the G.O.A.T test, and then eventually leave the vault you grew up in for 19 or so years to explore the wasteland and demolished Washington D.C. There are many great people you will meet along the way, but you will also make plenty of enemies. You truly feel in control with this game, there's nothing you can't do. Wanna blow up a town with a nuke? Go ahead! Wanna disarm the nuke and save the town? Go ahead! Wanna explore the entire world from top to bottom? Go right on ahead, nothing stops you. There's so many great things about Fallout 3 that you really should experience if you haven't already. Plus what's a better way to get ready for Fallout 4 than by killing ghouls and mutants in D.C?I rate this game a 9.5/10 . It has it's bugs and other little issues, but it is definitely worth every penny.Oh and since we're on the PC...you can mod the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game to your hearts content.			"

												Fallout 3 GOTY: How to install, fix, tweak & mod (update 12/15) by PrinzEugene for those of you doing a first time install, or those of you like me who are installing FO3GOTY afresh, is a finely written and thorough and uptodate piece.  This game takes time to study in order to make one mod fit with other mods and every mod to work together with only rare glitches. The information is out there as to how. It takes a human mind to find it all out and apply it without error. I spend a few days usually to do this, but then as it was before I stopped playing this game in 2011, it is now possible to play for hours uninterrupted by game crashes, thanks not to Bethesda but to the avid gaming community this game spawns year after year.

												Fallout 3, is one of the Fallouts, and it's a amazing Fallout at that as is the series, but Fallout 3 is 1st in my top list of games at the moment, Fallout 3 is better than alot of games today, and thats quite amazing considering that this game was released in 2008 and its 2014 when I'm writing this review, that's six years, and technology in the gaming industy has vastly increased since then and it's is still better than alot of games that are released today, so thats something to consider. I've played Fallout NV Game Of The Year, and of course Fallout 3 Game Of The Year, so which is better? Before I start my long winded rant keep in mind ultimately you decided wheter you get the game don't let me influence wheter you do or not, this is here merely as some experiances and information I have had.In my opionion I think Fallout 3 has the better story by far and I'm sure many people would agree with me, its twisted, well thought out, and exstremely emotional and one of the best, well the best I've played. The wasteland is very lonely when expolring the wasteland even with followers, this can be taken in two ways.The radio and the people is very envolving you will practically remember everyone you speak and sometimes you'll learn some life lessons, I know I have, like selflessness, sacrafice, and love. The radio really portrays the setting alot, and the radio changes depending on what you've done in the wastes which is really special and unqiue to the Fallout series, and its very interesting and makes you reflect on your previous actions which is a good things, when traveling the wastes and speaking to people and going to different enviroments and exploring different factions, you really notice the struggle and impact of Fallout, how desperate peolpe are and what lengths people are willing to go to survive, like taking lifes, causing trouble and stealing and drinking from irratiated water. And it's very realistic perception of how people are today, how people are, if they see someone do something they think its right, and how the enviroment has adapted, people living in the swerers and sleeping out side on sheets of cardboard. So a 10/10 on that point.And I like the different approaches you can take in Fallout and use your range of skills to change the outcome of a situation which is very good, you can use them for good or evil, and people will always hold it against you be it good or bad and people will mention it when you see them, and there will be certain things you can and can't acess depending on your repuation with certain factions.So to round up, 10/10 gameYou should play this prior to NV100000% Awesome game a must get to everyone.Add me if you have any queries. Hope this helps.Benji :)(It says 0hrs, I've player 300+ hours on most fallouts on a different pc)			"

												I find this game enjoyable and not too far from Oblivion. I purchased this when on sale and would recommend the same. The pros of this game: easier to get into role playing mood than Oblivion; weapons and guns are unexpectedly fun to use; atmosphere and mapping/world are good. Cons: similar to Oblivion -- the game engine still needs some work including the sneaking system, AI, movement mechanics, and character animations; the menu system isn't far off from Oblivion's and I would have liked to seen some better organization; can get boring.All in all, I think it's a great game but it could have been better with some core game changes.

												One of my all time favorite RPG's. I've put hundreds of hours into the console version, and have experienced all this beloved game has to offer. A few aspects of the game are a bit dated; the character animation is mostly what bothers me. But NOTHING compares to the atmosphere this game has created. The gritty post apocalyptic wasteland of a landscape is harsh and intimidating, with suprises around every darkened corner. Fused perfectly into the unforgiving state of post nuclear Washington DC is a 50's retro theme that gives this hostile enviroment an uplifting flare that comes off as increadibly eerie in the once thriving ghost town of a city. Combine these two aspects with the massive amounts of historical references throughout the DC area and what you get is the most unique, well thought out masterpiece of a journey in a place where i constantly feel the need to come back to. Crazy they call me, sure i'm crazy. Crazy in love with this game.			"

												One of the best games ever made but has technical issues on newer PCs. I run windows 7 and I was able to fix all my issues with config edits, but this may not be the case for win 8 or 10.With how low the price gets on steam sales, there is no excuse not to have played it.Don't let the play time fool you, I played on the version without steam, on Xbox 360 and with FOSE.

												This game is amazing :) It makes you feel so alone in the wasteland and makes you want to save as much ammo as you can because you need every bullet. The gameplay is the same as the elder scrolls series(because it is by the same company) but i would say that i love this game much more. The world is a destroyed, burnt, radiation-filled, and ugly looking wasteland..yet somehow it looks so beautiful :)  The best companion in the game is Galaxy News Radio. It has happy music that gets you through the tough parts of the game and doesn't leave dead silence whilst walking through the massive wasteland. I highly recommend this game if you love First Person Role-Playing games.			"

												Fallout 3 is an Open World, Post-apocalyptic, FPS RPG that I love to bits. Some may argue that Fallout 4 is better than this, but I have to disagree. I enjoyed this game more than I did Fallout 4, mostly because this game feels more like the RPG that the Fallout franchise is supposed to be, rather than something more alnog the lines of a Fallout setting, but a game that feels like a Borderlands game.In Fallout 3, you escape from a vault, a nuke shelter. But, not any vault; this is Vault 101. You are out to find your dad, who went missing without reason, in a wasteland once called Earth. It is a great setting, and great story. However, my only complaint about this game is it's lack of color. The game is mostly gray, with vauge hints of colors here and there, but the game was just a little too pale. Well, that is a bit of a lie, for there are some colors that are clearly visible all through out the game, but compared to Fallout 4, this game is a bit pale. But, beside that, Fallout 3 has some great features, and is a long game, with hours of content.  one of my favorite features in Fallout 3 is VATS, which is where you can target certain enemies, in certain places, for more damage.The main story doesn't take that long; it took me 10 hours to beat the main story line. But, there are a LOT of side quests, that actually have a backstory, unlike games like Skyrim.This game contains all the DLC for $15 less, so you already know that this is a good deal. The DLC themselves only activate after you beat the game. Well, that too is a lie. Only the Broken Steel DLC is activated after you beat the game. They are basically add-ons to the main story of the Fallout 3. And, the are really fun. but, they are also REALLY difficult. For example, one DLC mission has you go into a sewer, and that sewer is crawling with Deathclaws. And when I say crawling, I mean CRAWLING! Some DLC add on to the main plot of the story, and others are just plain fun to play. For example, one sends you into space to fight aliens, and another one sends you back in time. But, for Fallout 3 fans, this game definitly is the one to get over Fallout 3, mostly because you can save money by getting this one, rather than buying all the DLC's and vanilla Fallout 3. There are soo many new armors, weapons, and places featured in the DLC's, that make the game soo replay able. And if the replay ablity isn't enough for you guys, there are five DLC to play, each one unique from the rest. And they add sooo much more gameplay and hours spent playing the game, than just playing though the main story line, like I did. And if all the above don't sell you, in the DLC, you can controll a Deathclaw. Need I say more?Overall, I REALLY like Fallout 3. It is my favorite game, even surpassing Skyrim. And, yes, I would recommend this over Fallout 4, for this game is better than the 4th, in my opinion. It just feels more like an RPG, which is what the Fallout franchise  is supposed to be. I recommend this game to everybody, whose parents will let them play it. Because war... War never changes.			"

												This game really has one the most amazing atmospheres I've ever encountered. Listening to the wind whistling through the (seemingly) empty wasteland gave me one of the most unique experiences I've ever had conveyed to me through a videogame. It also helps that it's actually a fantastic game too, one that will stay with me as one of my all time favourite RPGs of all time. Seriously, Buy this game. Bethesda really hit the nail on the head here converting their game design to go with the post-apocalyptic setting of the Fallout series.5/5.			"

												A perfect balance between RPG and FPS. this game is plentiful when it comes to firepower and quests. solve a problem by either killing someone or you can persuade them with teh speech benefits you can upgrade. But whenever you are raiding or just wandering the Wastes you will be attacked and confronted by new beasts, from the ghouls to deathclaws to super mutants this game is still my favorite and one of teh best games i have ever played.

												To start off...Fallout is the game that you'll spend a lot of time playing while doing nothing but walk, talk, shoot and bash them with something or even punch it out with your own hands. For player who are similar to open world RPG (Skyrim, GTA) this is the game for you.The story set in the world after the nuclear war in the future and the protagonist was born and living safely underground after the war has ended. The father set out on a journey to recover the land and it is our job to find and help make it a better (or worse) place.The perk of playing this game is like any other open world series is that you can do anything and by 'anything' I mean everything. You can be the Good, the Bad or you can balance it out in your journey into the wasteland. There will be choices along the way which will make you say ""Seriously? Do I really have to pick?"" and then save at that point before making a decision and watch where your choices lead you.The outcome of the game is pretty much influent by how you play the game from the start to finish. There will be a lot of side quests which you can totally ignore them and still getting to the ending. (but they are worth it!)The combat system are not too chabby but not that great either. Since the game consists on the story more than the gameplay. Also, the difficulty of this game depends your your skills choice and how you manage it when when you level up. There will be many status like poison and radiation (it was a nuclear post-apocalyptic and all) .The AI or the enemies on this game are pretty easy to read (since they are only coming straight at you), but most of them are the hardhitters (mostly the non-human enemies) and they could totally whoop your butt into your last save in just a couple of hits (remember to save often!).The most important thing in this game is the soundtrack. It somehow became the best thing you can hear in the game while slaughter some radiated monsters. Also, the graphic might not be that great compare to these days' standard but there is nothing you can't fix with a little modding which can be found in many other reviews or community discussions.There are some downside of this game that many people are talking about like, can't play with windows 7 or higher but there are solutions. All you need to do is open up a browser (or two if you want) and type for ""fallout 3 fix"" or something similar to ""Fallout 3 window 7/8 fix"" and your problem will be gone in just a few mins. Other than OS problem the game doesn't have a cloud save which will be a problem because you will play this game for a long long time and you don't want to start over if your PC/Laptop just broken or you're changing them to a better one. But on the bright side, the game have save files for everytime you save during the game in your documents folder. I recommend you to make a backup once in a while or you will be just like me who have start all over again for 3 times already and it's pretty frustrating.All in all, Just buy it when it's on sales and play and I promise you won't regret it.

												1.6 hours doesn't say much, but I've picked this up (again) on PC (after playing 100s of hours on console) just for the modding scene. Sure, this is a hunk of a buggy mess, but that's because this was designed to run on WIndows Vista (and we know how much more steaming that is). Luckily, generous souls created freely availiable patches and resources to keep crashing and bugs to a minimum (which is surprising to hear from a Bethesda game). If you are interested more in map design, this is the game for you. If you are more interested in character and story, I'm pretty sure you should check Fallout: New Vegas. Don't worry, because both games take place in different places in a post-apocalyptic environment, the plot of one game will not reach the ears of the other coast in time to spoil the plot of the other game. TL;DR both games have an unrelated plot as they take place in different settings of the same universe.			"

There aren't many game developers that think so much of a player's health and wellbeing that they would make their game so bug ridden that the game would CTD every 15 minutes, thus giving the player's eyes a rest for a few moments and a chance to stretch their legs.

												A great man once said: ""All is fair in love and war, and Bethesda characters have dopey faces""Or was that just me? Anyways, this game has an interesting setting and great idea of idea execution and world building. Some things can fall flat at times (such as the terrible dialouge at the birthday party), but half of the time the humor and writing shine outwardly like a Supermodel at the International Hobo Convention of New York. Gameplay can get repitive and the long hikes through irradiated wastelands (Which usually end with you backtracking four miles while running from a horrific mutated monstrousity) can be boring, unlike say Skyrim. The exploration in this game is kind of boring because of the lack of locations and dynamic events that happen in the world. If you can get past that and you love the setting as I do, this game is a diamond in the rough for all FPS RPG fans.			"

												Best game ever. It has so many things to find, so many places to explore, and it's very fun too. You can kill almost all NPC if you want to, you can be a good guy saving everyone, you can be a slaver, a thief, you can play good guy and then drop a grenade into someone's pocket and see him explode. You can find tons of places and many deep metro tunnels.. On my third playthrough, the one I am playing right now, I found a crazy maniac family, who seemed harmless, however in their locked basement they had corpses of people, butchered, and their meat was their next meal (human leg stick in the fridge).  Then, after I found out, they attacked me. Of course I killed hem all. This game never fails to impress me. I wonder what I am going to find out next.			"

												This is the best game that i have ever played. One reason for this is that the story is just magnificent and there is always something to do so you're never board. The game is set in the capital wasteland which is the ruins of Washington DC and you set out on a giant adventure when tragedy strikes in you're home, I wont get into much detail but all i can say is that ""War, War Never Changes""One more thing the AddOns add hours of new content for you to check out so that yuou have even more fun.

												Beautiful story, immersive world, great gameplay, mod it once and it crashes 10/10 would drink from a dirty toilet to save my life again. In all seriousness though this is one of the most beautiful and immersive rpgs I've ever played. I can always gaze at the open landscape of the capital wasteland and enjoy it's destroyed beauty. I can always go back and play through areas of the game with a different approach for a new kind of expierience. I'm always find things I never found before even after spending hundreds of hours playing this game. So many characters stand out and are well defined in a way that it makes you feel such great emotion towards them whether it be positive or negative. This is truly one of my personal favorite games of all time and it almost never ceases to bore or disappoint me.			"

												This game is both my #1 favorite RPG and open-world game. In Fallout 3, you are a resident of a vault; a nuclear bunker sheltering people from the harsh Washington DC wasteland above. When your father leaves the vault for reasons unknown, you curiously follow, giving you the entirety of post-apocalyptic DC to explore. Discover the iconic landmarks like the Washington Monument and White House, or the civilizations that formed after the great war. It is NOT for children. Many adult themes are present, including slavery, prostitution, and drug addiction. Will you be experienced with computers or a savvy pickpocket? Will you use your skills for a righteous or wicked purpose? The choice is yours in Fallout 3.			"

												First and foremost, the game BARELY runs (on Windows 7), crashes constantly, doesnt EVER generate a key(which GFWL will ask of you, repetedly) and requires you to spend a lot of time modifying files just to be able to play it. I admit to have had ""borrowed"" this game from the internet before, that game only required installing and that was it. So I decided to support the devs by purchasing this and this is what happens. I am aware that it states that it's not optimized for windows 7, but neither is Diablo 2 and that runs perfectly on my PC.			"

												     This is without a doubt one of the most incredible games I've had the pleasure of playing. Its also one of the few games I can say I've ever deveoped an addiction to (seriously this game was like crack to me when I started playing it, the first week of me owning it saw maybe 18-20 hours of sleep).  The first time I played it was two years ago on the PS3, and replaying it again on the PC is so much better, mostly due to smoother gameplay and fewer bugs (special thanks to user BenWah for his amazing guide to not only making this game run properly, but the amazing mod community at the Nexus forums that he links in his discussion board posts for this game. Check it out and your experience with this game will be vastly improved/possible).      As far as the meat of the game goes, the story is centered around the quest for your character, the lone wanderer of Vault 101, to find his/her father who mysteriously leaves the Vault and stirs an uproar amongst the Vault-dwellers and the corrupt security forces that govern them. Along the journey you discover a greater purpose for delving into the wastes of Washington, D.C. as you unravel the conflict surrounding warring factions that inhabit the wastes vying for supremacy, whom you will ultimatley decide the fate of.      For those who played either The Elder Scrolls Oblivion or Skyrim, or have run through a story of Fallout: New Vegas, the game mechanics should be simple to familiarize yourselves with. For those new to Bethesda's brand of open-world RPG's, there are light survival elements (weapon maintenace, healthcare concerns, ability to sleep for resting bonuses to stats), a rather sparse but useful crafting system, and a wide variety of stealth and combat options that can be used to fit your own play style (heavier armor slows you down, leaves less room in your weight-based inventory, and impedes stealth abilities, but makes you much harder to kill and vice versa, things like that).      The Karma system does an interesting job of steering which companions you can recruit based on Karmic levels, and steers the outcome of future interactions based on choices made in conversation and dealings with other people. While they usually boil down to black, white, or grey choices, they have an amusing impact on conversations and how the denizens of the wastes react to your presence.An interesting mechanic  that I haven't seen outside of the last two Fallout games is the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S. Costing a regenerating supply of action points to use, it stops time and breaks down the major sections of a targets body and lists your chances to hit each part with your currently equipped weapon. This is especially convenient due to the fact that there is a zoom aim, but no ironsight aiming with anything but scoped weapons (there are mods that correct this issue, but the orginal game is ironsight free) which can feel a lttle disconcerting in the middle of combat for those who are used to the tight gunplay of shooter based games such as Call of Duty, Battlefield, etc.    What is perhaps the most incredible feature of this game, for me at least, is the vast, rich world that from the very first moment you leave Vault 101 you have complete freedom to explore at your own risk. The series beefy lore is expanded and integrated into the game in numerous ways, and is thoroughly fleashed out in documents, audio logs, and items that you can find scattered amongst the ruins of the wastes (if you're into that sort of thing). In almost every settlement there are secrets to uncover and quests to acquire from a desloate bandit hovel to the crumbling ruins of downtown D.C., which can quckly fill your menu into an extensive to-do list. The world itself would be interesting enough to pick through were it devoid of life, but an enourmous and entertaining variety of characters keeps the experience even more engaging, whether you're recovering the last remaining Stradivarius from one of the several Vaults available to explore in the world, assisting the electoral campaigns of the residents of the isolated Republic of Dave, or deciding the fate of the patron deity of a cult of wasteland tree worshipers.     The game has als ohad plenty of post-release support, with five DLC packs that expand the already lengthy base game with several hours of even more questing and exploration. Each pack takes you beyond the Wasteland to decide the fate of a slave colony in Pittsburgh, travel to Maryland to explore a mind bending and dangerous swamp, enter a VR simulation to re-live the events of a key moment in the Fallout mythos: the liberation of Anchorage, Alaska, take the fight against the Enclave further north to Addams Airforce Base to finish them off once and for all, and even miles above the surface of the wasteland to join other abductees in a despearte bid to escape an alien spacecraft. Each pack adds several new perks and weapons that even further enhance the game, and each one can be started at any point of progress through the main story (except for Broken Steel, which requires you to finish the main story before it can be started). Coupled with the incredible support of its dedicated modding community, there are almost limitless variations and user created mission packs to explore and waffle around with at your leisure.     As I mentioned before, the game is among the best I've ever played, and obviously there's something to it given its lauded reputation as one of the finest games of the last generation. If I had to rate this game in terms of a sandwich, it would be a Reuben; a seemingly odd combination of elements that are already pretty great on their own, but when put together, create a wonderful and satisfying product that leaves you hungering for more (and kind of lamenting the fact that you powered through the damn thing in the first place).

												Why Fallout 3 is better than New Vegas...Opening:What could be a better start to an RPG than being born? New Vegas uses a tired cliche about being shot in the head and asks the players to suspend their disbelief by telling them, like many RPGs before them, that they have lost part of their memory. With Fallout 3, there is no need for that suspension of disbelief, you know your history, you remember being born, you remember the big events of your childhood.Story: Your father leaves under mysterious circumstances and doesn't realize the danger this puts you in so you have to effect your own escape from your vault. Once you are out, are you going to track down the father who just up and left you without a word? Will you realize that he has a way to purify the water for everyone in the D.C area? Will you help him or stand in his way? These are all big questions you have to answer in Fallout 3. In New Vegas you are asked to decide between competing political factions as to who gets control of the Hoover dam.Locations: Sure, New Vegas has real cities that you can go and visit. You can go find Primm and see the roller coaster, you can find goodsprings and see the saloon, but Fallout 3 has one city built around an unexploded nuke, one city built on an abandoned aircraft carrier, and an underground city populated only by children.The only place where New Vegas is better is the DLC Dead Money and Old World Blues otherwise, Fallout 3 wins hands down.

												This game is good, if you're into putting hours on lengthy playthroughs in an RPG with lots of depth, then get this game. However, if you're going to get this game expecting it to be like the infamous Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (but with guns), then you should reconsider because this game is FAR from that kind of title. Firstly, this game is a walking simulator; unlike Skyrim which has all kinds of things to do while you're in a quest, you're going to be lost in lengthy walks from point A to point B while continously looking in the map while whispering to yourself: ""Am I there yet?"", but not to worry, once you get to your destination, you'll be able to use fast travel -- ""but isn't that like Skyrim?"" yes, but in Skyrim, you have LOTS of things to do while you're travelling from Point A to Point B, you might run into some bandit camps, some bears or some caves, but in here, you'll just look at a few landmarks and fight some enemies and that's it. Secondly, what I like about this game is the development of your character is very rewarding and the keen sense of survival is a need in this game.			"

												Fallout 3 is a great game filled with relateable characters, compelling story, great RPG features and the very intuitive vats aiming system. How ever despite all the good there is bad, the game is very unstable on PC constantly crashing and windowing you will have to fix these issues your self by deleving into the files and altering properties. Fallout is a solid good look game bought down by a plauge of bugs and glitches stopping it from being a perfect experience due to this and the somewhat confusing level design. Personally I would give Fallout 3 a 7/10 this could be a 9/10 if the bugs were fixed as they can be game breaking.			"

												Note that I only have 10 hours playtime on Steam, but I played the game much longer on Xbox 360.This game isn't optimized on Windows 7, as Steam mentions, but there's an easy fix to Fallout 3's configuration file taht you can find online. This fixes the inconsistent crashes of the game.Now that I've ENLIGHTENED you of that, Fallout 3 is an amazing RPG. If you don't like sandbox games, don't worry, there's a great quest with markers so you don't have to wander around for things. If linear storylines aren't your thing, you can wander the vast American Wasteland, pillaging shanty towns with an evil cohort, or helping the unfortunate as a lone altruist. The game's graphics, as some mentioned, aren't state-of-the-art to 2013's standards. However, one needs to realize that this game is from 2008 and using anti-aliasing will fix jagged textures. There are plenty of visual mods for the game outside of Steam as well (no Steam Workshop support for the game).The optional VATS combat system makes the game turned based in a sense. This is perfect if you aren't a great shooter, or you want to relax more while you play.There aren't any vehicles to drive in the game, but I don't think that's much of a missing feature because the atmosphere isn't meant for driving around the Washington, D.C. metro area. The Quick Travel function in your map saves you from the fear of having to walk across the Wasteland, so no worries!There are many trainable skills in the game that will keep you busy, ranging from Equipment Repair, Medical, Hacking, and of course, Marksmanship (not exact names, but in layman's terms). If you've played Runescape or the Elder Scrolls, the skills system is very reminiscent. In addition to this, the Perks system allows you to pick a special trait each time you level your character up.I give Fallout 3: GOTY Edition a legitimate 100% rating because I find no faults in it, hence my length review.

												To everyone who made the same mistake I did, yes, this game is not optimized for Windows 7 or later, that means it's also excluding Windows 8.Windows 7 users: You all have the ability to boot up Windows XP and Vista; that came with your computer. Just google how to do it, run it, and launch Fallout 3 there.Windows 8 users: Some of you, maybe even all, are unable to even start the game. You click ""Play"" and your game crashes. Read this, and trust his download. I downloaded the Windows Live he had, and installed it. The game runs perfectly now. I've clocked in a few hours already, and i've had no issues; other than minor visual glitches. Which is expected in a rather old, yet huge game.Otherwise, this game is awesome. I truly suggest buying it; no matter what platform.			"

												Fallout 3 is a masterpiece.  You get so much freedom. You get to do whatever you want, go wherever you want to go. Do you want to kill everything that moves? You can do that. Do you want to be a more peaceful player? You can do that too. There is so much to explore. There is so many things to discover. Finding and completing quests in the capital wasteland is immense fun. Defeating enemies and collecting their loot never gets old. The story is great. Something I will never forget. From the moment you begin the game through to the end, you will enjoy every second. The soundtrack in Fallout 3 is great. You will get these songs stuck in your head. With top notch talent such as Liam Neeson and Malcolm McDowell, the voice acting is phenomenal. What Bethesda has created here is a perfect video game. But don’t stop at what they give you. There is a very strong mod community that adds even more to the game. Bethesda put so much hard work in to Fallout 3. It would be a true shame if you didn’t experience it.			"

												I picked up and played Fallout 3 years after it was released, really, due to late discovery of gaming and *this* game. I wasn't really sure if I'd like it or not, due to the kinda intimidating heavy duty steel armor dude on the cover. I wasn't sure this game was for me. I've never been so happy to be proven wrong, and finding out that Fallout 3 is so much more than the power armor on the cover. LOL! You don't even have to wear it if you don't want to either. And that's the crux of Fallout 3  for me. Choices. Endless choices! I love this game to death. It has stood the test of time. It's just as awesome to play now like it was the first times I played it. I can play new titles, but I always come back for more Fallout 3.			"

												I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an open world game with a great storyline to it and the ability to go off from the main quests and do any of the side quests. With Broken Steel, the level cap is raised to 30 and the game continues past the ending of the standard game (which ends the game, no continuing) so a must buy.The world is full of characters you will come to love or hate and the way you deal with most of these can be from talking your way out of a problem to killing everyone in sight! The different perks you can choose as you advance through levels can change how you tackle problems and can have different outcomes.Although the store page says that the game is not optimised for Windows 7 and later it runs fine on Windows 8.1 after changing a line in the code (a quick google search of ""fallout 3 randomly crashing"" will lead you to a link which tells you what to add and where to find the file)Overall, Fallout 3 is a fun game with a good story and the freedom to explore anywhere in the game world and the DLC's only add to that experience. 9 out of 10 (because there are a few bugs but nothing seriously serious)Would highly recommend!

												I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an open world game with a great storyline to it and the ability to go off from the main quests and do any of the side quests. With Broken Steel, the level cap is raised to 30 and the game continues past the ending of the standard game (which ends the game, no continuing) so a must buy.The world is full of characters you will come to love or hate and the way you deal with most of these can be from talking your way out of a problem to killing everyone in sight! The different perks you can choose as you advance through levels can change how you tackle problems and can have different outcomes.Although the store page says that the game is not optimised for Windows 7 and later it runs fine on Windows 8.1 after changing a line in the code (a quick google search of ""fallout 3 randomly crashing"" will lead you to a link which tells you what to add and where to find the file)Overall, Fallout 3 is a fun game with a good story and the freedom to explore anywhere in the game world and the DLC's only add to that experience. 9 out of 10 (because there are a few bugs but nothing seriously serious)Would highly recommend!

												1.6 hours doesn't say much, but I've picked this up (again) on PC (after playing 100s of hours on console) just for the modding scene. Sure, this is a hunk of a buggy mess, but that's because this was designed to run on WIndows Vista (and we know how much more steaming that is). Luckily, generous souls created freely availiable patches and resources to keep crashing and bugs to a minimum (which is surprising to hear from a Bethesda game). If you are interested more in map design, this is the game for you. If you are more interested in character and story, I'm pretty sure you should check Fallout: New Vegas. Don't worry, because both games take place in different places in a post-apocalyptic environment, the plot of one game will not reach the ears of the other coast in time to spoil the plot of the other game. TL;DR both games have an unrelated plot as they take place in different settings of the same universe.			"

This game is so great and I love it and ♥♥♥♥. Like, really. This is my favorite game. I love the hell out of it. I would gladly give Bethesda all of my money for bringing a game like this into the world. This game was just ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.SO BUY IT, YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												I was born March 24, 2259, in an old hospital. My mother passed away when I was born. My dad always told me she was the most beautiful woman in the wastes. Sometimes, when Fawkes isn't around, I sit down with Dogmeat and play old tapes on my Pip-Boy where my mom talks a lot. Sure, it's the same few tapes, and I've remembered every word she says, but no matter how much I listen to the tapes, I never can imagine how it would sound for her to say ""I love you"". It's been hard since my dad died too. I watched him sacrifice himself for the greater good of mankind. Wherever my mom and dad are right now, I just hope they're proud of me. I didn't blow up Megaton, or Kill any human or ghoul from Tenpenny, and I even blew up two Enclave bases full of thousands of people. Though they might hate me because I eat human flesh for the glory of Satan...911/10 I'll mezz you and send you to Paradise Falls if you don't play it.			"

												Whether you're instigated by the lore of the series, the seemingly unlimited customization of your character, or that Medevil RPG feel to a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Fallout 3 is a wonderful game in almost all of it's aspects. You mold your character to whatever you wanna be. Do you want to be the charismatic smooth talker that is an expert in explosives, or do you want to be an Energy Gun waving psychopath that's also good with medicine? Any character with these you can imagine CAN BE YOURS! Exquisite voice acting is the cherry-on-top of this amazing game as well, with each NPC feeling almost unique in their own way. Definitley recommended, 8/10. This probably doesn't mean ANYTHING, but it gets the ""Mingow Seal of Aprroval""!			"

												[Review written 15,06,2015] [After Fallout NV]Minor disclaimer before the review; I have actually played around 30hrs of this game upon time of review, however steam doesn't count it as I run the game through FOSE launcher for windows 7 stability reasons. Fallout 3 is one of the most atmospheric games I’ve played. Fallout 3 unlike its Mojave counterpart describes a world of hardship and fear with a large emphasis on villainy and morality. Much like the people of the wastes the player too must choose how to play, either in self-serving villainy or selfless heroism. Choses can be made via dialogue options or real-time decision making. Combat in Fallout 3 is an excellent cross between fps and real-time strategy, as the player is able to battle using their own accuracy and skill or by entering VATS which pauses the game and allow the player to make precise shots at certain enemy weak points. Graphically Fallout 3 was a masterpiece of its time, however today Fallout 3 is showing its age as some ground and wall textures are looking quite muddy. The one gripe I would have to say about Fallout 3 is that it doesn’t give you an awful lot of direction in the beginning of the game which could turn off some first timers to the series. All in all Fallout 3 is still to this day one of the greatest RPG’s ever created with its enthralling atmosphere and solid combat system. I give fallout 3 a 9.5/10    "

												I've heard a lot of people call this game ""terrible"" in comparsion to the original Fallouts 1&2. While it is definitely not up to par, I wouldn't call the game terrible. I just finished FO1&2, as I am re-playing them all in chronological order, and so far this is a very enjoyable experience. Woulda been nice if they added an option to move kinda like Dragon Age though, that would have added a lot of spunk to the game. Giving the option of Freemode and Turnbased, bringing back some of the memories of old. Some of the quests and things definitely don't feel like Fallout, but most of the experience does. Add ENB and a few mods and the game is even better. Definietly recommended.I am playing with FOSE and a pretty extensive mod collection. That's why my playtime is at 0. If anyone is interested in my mod list let me know, they are good for a first playthrough or if your just trying to run through the core game. Not too much added to make it overwhelming.			"

												     If you never played a Fallout game before, try the original Fallout before picking this up.  Whether you enjoyed the first or not, and whether you tried the second as well, then see how long you can last playing this mess of a game.     I'll admit, when I first picked it up, I enjoyed it immeadiately, and binged it for hours.  It is quite a bit of fun, if not stupid fun.  As you play on, you begin to realize how loosely the story and world of the game is held together.  The plot is nonsensical, the characters are cliche as hell, there are strictly two sides (black and white of course) to the story, the weapons are uninspired and bland, and they, to say it in a juvenile fashion, feel like sticks with♥♥♥♥♥♥on the ends of them.  Not to mention the game's enviornment is spotty and dull.  That green tint can get ♥♥♥♥ing old quick, and oftentimes, you will have no idea where you are until you take a gander at the map.  It's like Bethesdashit just made a basic desert world on a piece of paper, tacked it to the wall, and threw a ♥♥♥♥-ton of darts at it to denote where they would put places, events, towns, and so-on.  No rhyme or reason as to where anything is.        This game also suffers from the same problem that a lot of Bethesdacrap games have, such as very poorly made animations, weapons that feel like cardboard sticks or airsoft guns, ugly as sin character models, a strong lack of voice actors to compensate for the vast amount of ""unique"" characters in the game, no vareity in clothing, and broke leveling mechanics.  Di I say the story makes no sense when you look at the big picture?  It's as if a pre-teen fanfic writer smoked some pot and wanted to make a Fallout story.       Despite these shortcomings, I rate the game a 4/10 for having a small amount of replayability, a vision that shines through the cracks of caked-on♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a very nostalgic and memorable soundtrack (not the terrible and generic OST created for the game, I'm talking about anything that plays on Galaxy News Radio, and not Three-dog's annoying vocal-chord vibrations he calls a voice).       Once you trudge through the wasteland, play every DLC (if you didn't max out your character's level by the end of the game) minus Mothership Zeta for something different, and then high-tail your♥♥♥♥♥to the Mojave in Fallout New Vegas, which in my opnion, is the true Fallout 3.  Do NOT skip this game if you intend to jump into New Vegas!  If you play this first, you will enjoy it a tad, and it will allow you to enjoy New Vegas a lot more due to the problems it fixes and the soul it has to offer.  If you play New Vegas first, you will not enjoy Fallout 3 at all, making both games seem kind of dull and leaving a bad taste in your mouth.  Just pray that Bethesdick collaborates with the guys behind New Vegas on the next Fallout.			"

												Fallout 3 - ah the red headed stepchild in fallout series. The elders scrolls: Fallout is a cliche name but so spot on. Also this is the reason while community is so torn about this game. Fans wanted it to be in line with it's predecessor, Bethesda didn't deliver, only used the IP.Still love it or hate it, Fallout 3 is a good game - IF you like exploration and loot hoarding. But it's a bad RPG - be it cliche story, odd combat or very streamlined stats behind. It does deliver the Fallout series feeling of the nuclear wasteland with buried civilization wonders. You explore the old Vaults and wonder what happened here?The DLCs aren't really groundbreaking, more loot, more monsters, more mini quests and locations. Mods are crucial part of this game, especially now when it aged and cause problem on newer PCs and operating systems.Also they do enchance both combat and too casual mechanics that made game too streamlined and easy. Can't really help with poor and old graphic or with poor role-playing side. Anything else you'll find at nexus mods.Despite this being a different approach to fallout series I do recoomend it to everyone, especially with all DLCs and various mods that help to customize it to your likings.

												After spending hours in this game and many more to come, I can easily say this is one of the best gaming experiences I ever had. You play as a child, living in the vault with your father. But one day your father leaves and you leave the vault looking for him in the big wasteland of Washington DC. On your journey you can decide how your character will react, do or what weapons he uses. The world is amazing, almost breathtaking for a wasteland. Not to mention the soundtrack aswell as the character you will meet with be stuck forever with you. The DLC for the game is also great and enjoyable, a little bit too short unlike New Vegas but still very fun. This game is simply Legendary and a must have in my opinion, also a plus is that you can mod it so be sure to check Fallout 3 Nexus for mods.P.S: Get Dogmeat.P.P.S: Don't mind the low game time, I'm using a special launcher for modding.

												One of the best RPG's of all time, just like the rest of the Fallout series. It is also the first modern Fallout title. Oddly Fallout 3 is critically acclaimed across the board as you can see with a 91 metacritic score, as well as overwhelmingly highly regarded by most RPG lovers, but is WOEFULLY underrated and under-apreciated by quite a few of the older fans of the Fallout franchise. It makes no sense to me, because I love all of the Fallouts and don't see this heavily exaggerated ""lore-bashing"" that apparently Fallout 3 has/does. In fact, I as well as most people feel Bethesda Game Studios did a terrific job setting the tone of the old Fallouts and staying in line with the lore with Fallout 3. Regardless, you're doing yourself a disservice if you're an avid RPG fan and not playing Fallout 3 or the rest of the Fallout franchise. They're all terrific RPG's that all offer an equally unique, darkly funny, retro-futuristic, bleak and twisted tone. Each quest can be completed in multiple ways. Fallout 3 is a great RPG, and you should definitely play it, as well as Fallout: NV, Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. Fallout Tactics ain't half bad either. Fallout 3 is a 10/10 easily for me. Great RPG, that is part of a great RPG franchise. Go play it.			"

												A flawed but amazing experience. Like any Bethesda game there will be bugs galore, all of which are hilarious. I don't think Fallout 3 is the best game in the serious, but it is still a strong contender. A great Post Apocalyptic RPG for the ages.It should be noted that there is some trouble shooting that needs to be done for FO3: GOTY to run smoothly on anything above Windows XP which is mildly annoying, but it's an easy fix.

I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire, I Just Want To Start A Flame In Your Pants - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]The jump from 2D to 3D can often times be a defining moment for a game series. The evolution of game mechanics and sometimes even the shift in genre can make or break its impact on old fans and new audiences alike. Some only play 3D Zelda games, some only play 2D Mario. Megaman Legends was something of an underrated flop, despite how much I loved it. That's just how it goes. And let's not even bring up Sonic. Sometimes the love for a particular franchise, a specific character or story, can't transcend the type of game. Some people are shallow♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥like that, only caring about their favorite game because of how it is on the outside. It's what's on the inside that counts. Just because your favorite series suddenly has different mechanics, you're gonna leave it for the next pretty game? How could you.Surprisingly, all these beloved childhood characters aren't the only ones with blood feuds going on in the fanbase. Sure, they're the ones that are deemed ""acceptable"" to argue about. For the most part. Except Sonic, arguing about Sonic just disappoints your parents.Fallout is another massive franchise with a split fanbase. Fallout 1 and 2 were highly acclaimed tactical CRPG's, with dedicated followings. However, after being acquired by Bethesda, Fallout 3 took the series in a new direction.Fallout 3 is an action-RPG, feeling more like an FPS at times than a strategy RPG. Some say Fallout 3 ruined Fallout, making it essentially an Elder Scrolls with guns. Some say Bethesda is what saved Fallout from falling into obscurity.While both are valid looks on what became of Fallout, I personally feel like they're both rather narrow-minded looks on the issue. Fallout 3 still manages to capture so much of the essence of Fallout, even if it's not a carbon copy of Fallout 1 or 2.Much like past Fallout games, there's a huge emphasis on character building. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system is back, along with all of the other classic Fallout skills and traits. Over the course of the game you'll be leveling up and allocating skill points to different skills to improve your ability to sneak around, wield different kinds of weapons, or even stuff like persuasion or bartering. There are no bad skills to focus on, as the game is balanced enough to allow any skill set to be viable. Bonus traits are also granted with each level and give you a selection of unique perks to choose from, boosting your combat ability against certain enemy types, giving bonuses to different skills, or even allowing you to choose special dialogue options or use special skills in certain scenarios.Fallout's karma system is back as well, allowing your character to be as unique as possible.My character was Captain Sugartits, unstable mass murderer and crazed drug and sex addict. Captain isn't a title or anything, it's just a part of her name. You know how people can have two first names, like Mary Anne or something? Yeah, Captain Sugartits. Her father chose the name himself.Her major skills were Sneaking, Lockpicking, and Science. She started out mild-mannered enough, but her thirst for science, blood, hard drugs, and violent lesbian sex drove her to massacre entire settlements. However, she gave like a hundred bottles of purified water to a homeless man overcome with radiation poisoning. So she was the murderous saint of the wasteland. She would enter any settlement and steal whatever wasn't bolted down, but the second someone talked to her with any sort of attitude she'd shoot up the town. She was quite unstable.Fallout 3 manages to capture the spirit of the original Fallout in a beautiful way. Exploration and discovery is not spurred on by curiosity, or by demand. No one tells you to go explore. Fallout 3 has a massive, open world to explore. There are side-quests everywhere, secrets and surprises tucked all over the wasteland. But it doesn't hold you by the hand and guide you to each of these. No, exploration is driven by necessity. You're helpless and weak once you leave your Vault, and the means to defend yourself isn't free. You'll need to forage for weapons and ammo, forage for food and medicine, and forage for any other items of value to sell for whatever necessities you can't find from foraging. And it never ends. Even after you've found a powerful weapon, you'll need money or parts to repair it as its condition wears down. And what you're fighting will only escalate in strength, from mutated insects to corrupt leftover government weirdos. The struggle never ends. The struggle is real.The karma system actually factors right into this as well. Before the Cap snapped and went on her rampage across the wasteland, staying armed and ready to fight was incredibly difficult. The only way I was able to arm myself to the teeth was from stealing everything, robbing and murdering whoever I could, and doing quite a bit of less-than kosher deeds. It really solidifies the idea of the world that you're in. It's hard to be good. There's not enough to go around, and it's a constant struggle to exist.Fallout 3 is a masterpiece of smart game design, and still one of the best open-ended RPG's out there. Getting lost in the world of Fallout 3 is a blast. And most of all, it still feels like Fallout. The same style and charm is still there. Except you can't kill kids anymore, no matter how annoying the little ♥♥♥♥♥ are.Not that I'D want to, I'm just saying. For realism's sake. If a deranged murderer hopped up on drugs and lesbians got talked down to by a little brat, don't you think she'd mini-nuke the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them? I'm just saying.When it really comes down to which Fallout style I prefer though, classic 1 and 2 or the Bethesda-style in 3, I prefer both because they're both fun. Stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing you nerds.			"

												Please note that some users have issues getting the game to run on Windows 7 and up, there are fixes available thanks to the community though.Ah Fallout 3, such a great game (I owned a copy 5 years ago that just used Games For Windows Live). Definitely one of those games that you will never forget, and worth every penny.Story takes place with you being born, from there you name your character and predict how you'll look in the future when you're older. Your mother dies due to complications when giving birth. The first half hour or so is you growing up over many years where you select your S.P.E.C.I.A.L abilities, get your pip-boy and BB gun, take the G.O.A.T test, and then eventually leave the vault you grew up in for 19 or so years to explore the wasteland and demolished Washington D.C. There are many great people you will meet along the way, but you will also make plenty of enemies. You truly feel in control with this game, there's nothing you can't do. Wanna blow up a town with a nuke? Go ahead! Wanna disarm the nuke and save the town? Go ahead! Wanna explore the entire world from top to bottom? Go right on ahead, nothing stops you. There's so many great things about Fallout 3 that you really should experience if you haven't already. Plus what's a better way to get ready for Fallout 4 than by killing ghouls and mutants in D.C?I rate this game a 9.5/10 . It has it's bugs and other little issues, but it is definitely worth every penny.Oh and since we're on the PC...you can mod the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game to your hearts content.			"

												Game of the year 2008, and surely not without reason. Fallout 3 might have a few bugs and other small flaws, but in the end it doesn't matter, because you end up getting sucked into the universe and spent more hours in this game than you can count on yours, your friends and maybe also your families fingers.Fallout, a series of games that have entertained me for hundred of hours, and Fallout 3 did 100 of them.I recommend the whole Fallout series.

												I played this game both on PC and PS3, and with a total of about 70 hours, i can tell MHO about this masterpiece of the old-gen games.In this game, the first of the saga developed by Bethesda (The original Fallout 3 was named Van Bouren by the original SH) you can basically do anything, from choosing the fate of a dweller, to changing the entire world, like destroying a city, or changing the president in a city.But the game isn't ""just"" that, it's basically a GDR mixed with FPS things.The Lone Wanderer can have lots of weapons, like blades, baseball bats, laser and plasma rifles, sniper rifles and more, and their unique variant.As weapons, lots of clothes/armors.So, Fallout 3 rests an unbeaten masterpiece of the old-gen games, with a addictive story, lots of side quests and choices to do, and a background lore that criticize the american warlike government aspiring at the oil supremacy. (Yeah, in 2077 oil wells They were completely dried up, so it started another war, against China)Anyone should play this game, really. "

All you have to listen to is Galaxy News Radio on your Pip Boy playing music from the 1900's, with Three Dog, (The Host), stepping in saying a few words. Needless to say, for a game made in 2008, it still stands as one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												The road so far......wasn't kind to me. It was full of loss and misery. Full of hopeless people and lost souls that stepped on this doomed wasteland.Yet, it wasn't only damnation that followed my steps. I found my father, my love Amata, a faithful companions... only to loose them the next second.If this was the road so far, what will follow it? I know you can't talk, my good, old, friend, dogmeat. Despite that, I know you can listen, you are the only one who does that. So, thank you, buddy.________________________After 95 hours I finally finished this unique game. It was a long journey that, sadly, or not, came to the conclusion.I have mixed feeling because I can not, but to notice, the flaws of this game.The combat is far from perfection. Constant invisible walls interfere in the shooting so that stealth and sniper headshot from a far is not an option. It is frustrating at times, but the VATS does a perfect job to overcome the combat flaws. It balances it.Writing of the main story. It's not good. It's average. It does the job to send you to a different locations and introduce the world, but that's it. I do like the small stories, though, which this world is packed to it's fullest and the enormous attention to detail. But the main plot... At the end, the feeling is that the bone was thrown and if we search enogh we can find it. In any case, sadly, it's not there. A mere feel of a presence of something epic is not what we want.Don't take me the wrong way. I like this game. It's good. Not perfect but good enough. There isn't any very good highlights but the mixture and huge diversity make this game a unique experience worth to check...if you push by yourself and force to go throw the tedious start that keept me aways the 2 past attempts to play Fallout 3.First 20 levels are a joy to play. You keep discovering new things and some quite memorable moments. A very simple details engage with a perfection to this unworthy world: A text based story about Grognak that you play on a terminal; Tranquility Lane; Princess who is secretly in love with the leader of Little Lamplight; Brother who got two naughty nightwear; A old man who I saved from suicide attempts.Despite the average writing of the main plot where it shines is in the clues of the past. There is no history in Fallout 3. Though, it creates an understanding of the past by the logs, terminals and documents. And it does the job like non other game up this date. The contradictive information, the vision of people of the those past events - at times I felt like archaeologist.There are a huge depth that you can completely ignore and focus on the aspects you like. Do whatever. The world is there. What do you gonna do in it?________________________It happened before and it will happen again.So many killed, so much destroyed... and yet it's not enough, it is never enough. Because war... war never changes.It is time, we need to go my friend. Our journey has just started.


Into the sunset. The last moment of my gameplay.

Still awesome 6 f'in years after it was released!  Oh, and grab the mods (too many to list, and they all work on Windows 7+ as well) -- they will make the game even better and you will have a hard time remembering that this game was released in 2009!

												***IMPORTANT: if you want to play this game on Windows 7 and newer versions of windows, you'll likely need to download the Unooffical fallout 3 patch. Otherwise you'll find out very quickly that the game crashes all the time, making it unplayable. Just go to Nexus mod website (just use google) to download this mod, it's pretty much mandatory. Don't spend hours on the internet looking for ways to fix the issue, this mod will fix it all and it's very simple. And while you're there, get some of the other top mods that will greatly enhance your playing experience.***It's an absolutely brilliant game, when playing this game you HAVE to do all the major sidequests to experience and appreciate it fully. Don't rusth through it, take your time. The graphics may look a little old nowadays, but you can enhance them greatly with mods aswell. The main story is very good, the lore of the game is fantastic and the gameplay is also excellent (although, again mods will enhance this).I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure games with an open world sandbox environment, but most importantly: I recommend this game for people who enjoy a great and emersive story. It's different than the Elder Scrolls but in many ways just as epic and emersive. If you like post-Apocalyptic settings like 'The Walking Dead' I'm sure you'll love scrounging through the metro stations and sewers of the DC area, encountering countless feral ghouls (zombies), Super Mutants and other mutated freaks! Extremely high replayability value aswell. "

Yes ladies and gents before you can even TRY and play this game you will have to solve it's annoying crashes only with your wit and some youtube guides. after learning more about your computer than you should ever need to for playing a game this old there is a chance it still crashes every 10 minutes or so! after this stage you will start to hate your computer and hate bethesda for not fixing this stuff!10/10 would spend 5 hours on youtube again			"

												A flawed but amazing experience. Like any Bethesda game there will be bugs galore, all of which are hilarious. I don't think Fallout 3 is the best game in the serious, but it is still a strong contender. A great Post Apocalyptic RPG for the ages.It should be noted that there is some trouble shooting that needs to be done for FO3: GOTY to run smoothly on anything above Windows XP which is mildly annoying, but it's an easy fix.

												I remember when my father brought this game when it first came out. I was playing C&C tiberium wars, GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City. That was all I would play, when my father brought this game I basically fell in love with it. I remember watching him play thourgh the missions and explore various locations from vaults to bunkers to destroyed buildings. All the while I was completely phazed by the shear opportunity this game has to offer. I remember playing myself I was using power armor and gatling lasers, miniguns, tesla armor and just murdering the ♥♥♥♥ out of super mutants, Enclave and just about anyone who ♥♥♥♥ed with me. I will give this game a 10/10 because it expects nothing but gives so much.			"

												-----TL;DR-----Buyer beware, Fallout GOTY edition WILL NOT work out of the box. Unless you know how to download, add, and/or modify files (to improve stability and performance). Then purchase at your own risk.If you do purhase the game, then for the love of god, TURN OFF AUTOSAVES! Turn all of them off and learn to manually save or it WILL corrupt your save files. So unless you want to wave goodbye to your 100 plus hours worth of gameplay, then do it!-----Review-----Fallout 3, good lord, this game was the pinnacle of it's genre when released. After all these years, oh how the mighty have fallen. Sure, the gameplay and story have faired pretty well and mods abound to enhance the experiance. But from a software standpoint, Fallout 3 has seen better days.I can't even begin to tell you the amount of time I have lost thanks in part to a fualty save system that was never really fixed as well as copious amounts of crashes and freezes thanks in part to a lack of compatability and/or optimization for newer systems. This isn't even taking into account the amount of time lost from trying to get the game to run.Now don't get me wrong, this game ran well for a while and I was able to put 20 hours into the game. Until, my save files become currupted. Yeah, technically, I could start again. But after losing so much, I just can't bring myself to continue this game.Now, I just feel angry and drained. All that wasted time just getting the damn game running and for what?! Just to get curbed stomped?! Why the hell is this abandoned product still allowed to be sold then? In conclusion, I cannot recommend this game in it's current decrepit state.(Note: Having to launch the game through FOSE or Fallout Script Extender did not allow for Steam to record total playtime clocked)			"

												Not a bad game  if you ignore everything else out there including the previous games and Oblivion but plagued with issues, bethesda has no idea how to release a proper game, so the players have to fix their games for them, still sort of playable and pretty long lasting for a first time. Voice acting is actually more than 4 actors this time around, but it seems like they lost themselves trying to pay for good hollywood actors and those ended up not being enough again. Too much RPG mechanic changes from Fallout, sort of an Oblivion with guns game, doesn't make it every innovative or worth it for old fallout fans			"

												This is my favourite game of all time. I have hundreds of hundreds of hours on this game from both console and when I had it installed as a non Steam game and I will have hundreds of hours more having just reinstalled it through Steam after losing my old version in a new Windows install.This game is pretty broken without some tweaking, but once tweaked it is well worth the effort and I found the DLCs to be enjoyable and a good value. I love the setting in this game and can just happily get lost for hours wondering DC.The game of course really comes into it's own after you've made your tweaks and start to install some of the many hundreds of excellent mods out there for this game, ranging from the smallest changes to huge DLC scale additions. There are a ton of guides and hidden gems to find which will teach you about the best way to tweak the game and install mods and after spending many (or few) boring hours reading and collecting your mods you will see for yourself that it is well, well worth it.This game is better now than it has ever been and a few hours invested in setting it up (I know this sounds horrible*) will really pay off.*You don't have to spend this long if you don't want to but to become really well informed on how to tweak and mod Fallout in an efficient and stable way then it will take this long but it IS worth it as it will completely transform the game in nearly any way you want.

												This game is outright one of the best games I have ever played in my life. This game I would still class as one of the best ever made. Just the atmosphere this game has compared to a lot of other games, which inserts unfitting music to try and set the mood. An example of this being the Call of Duty franchise, which lies with its trailers and advertising. Overall If you're looking for a game to keep you busy for a good few hundered hours of gameplay, replayability, and fantastic game play, this is the game for you. 10/10 - My honest opinion.			"

												Note that I only have 10 hours playtime on Steam, but I played the game much longer on Xbox 360.This game isn't optimized on Windows 7, as Steam mentions, but there's an easy fix to Fallout 3's configuration file taht you can find online. This fixes the inconsistent crashes of the game.Now that I've ENLIGHTENED you of that, Fallout 3 is an amazing RPG. If you don't like sandbox games, don't worry, there's a great quest with markers so you don't have to wander around for things. If linear storylines aren't your thing, you can wander the vast American Wasteland, pillaging shanty towns with an evil cohort, or helping the unfortunate as a lone altruist. The game's graphics, as some mentioned, aren't state-of-the-art to 2013's standards. However, one needs to realize that this game is from 2008 and using anti-aliasing will fix jagged textures. There are plenty of visual mods for the game outside of Steam as well (no Steam Workshop support for the game).The optional VATS combat system makes the game turned based in a sense. This is perfect if you aren't a great shooter, or you want to relax more while you play.There aren't any vehicles to drive in the game, but I don't think that's much of a missing feature because the atmosphere isn't meant for driving around the Washington, D.C. metro area. The Quick Travel function in your map saves you from the fear of having to walk across the Wasteland, so no worries!There are many trainable skills in the game that will keep you busy, ranging from Equipment Repair, Medical, Hacking, and of course, Marksmanship (not exact names, but in layman's terms). If you've played Runescape or the Elder Scrolls, the skills system is very reminiscent. In addition to this, the Perks system allows you to pick a special trait each time you level your character up.I give Fallout 3: GOTY Edition a legitimate 100% rating because I find no faults in it, hence my length review.

												This game, unlike the ElderScrolls Series, is not always for the casual player, even on very easy some enemies and places can be a nighmare of difficulty  if you dont have the right gear, or enough stimpacks of course, but saying that, I very much prefer this game to skyrim, possibly even Oblivion or Morrowind in the ElderScrolls series, and im very much anticipating Fallout 4 in the next year or two, People's faces and voices are much better in the fallout games than in the ElderScroll games, and you cant forget about 3dog, very good music, humor, quests, interesting things for people who love Washington D.C. as well and want to explore the radioactive wreckage of the capital, and the surrounding wastelands of course, It was interesting seeing the RobCo HQ, more vaults, and the Capital Itself, Very well made DLC, from aliens, to virtual reality, to slavers in pittsburgh, I would recommend this as a starter for Fallout games, even though it is the 3rd one, it is not very connected to the others, as it is from Bethesda, who did not make the first 2 games, although, the first 2 games excel in story and gameplay as well, and I recommend them as well, in the end its your choice, but if you have 20 bucks to spare, spend them on something that can provide limitless hours of entertainment, hundreds of locations, a good few laughs, good music, a Legendary Father, a few tear jerking moments, Horrifying Moral choices, and of course GARY! So yes, you should play this game, and talk about it, sing the songs outloud if you want, just have fun. Note, do not play this game just because you think, look, skyrim with guns, its alot more than that, and Warfare is slightly weak in this game, this is more for those Nerdy, Lore loving people out there, not the ones that claim to be real gamers, the ones who spend hundreds of hours finding every little secret, seeing every site, doing every mission, loading and reloading games to fix mistakes and prevent deaths, those people, those people are the real gamers, and the people who will enjoy this game the most.

												Do not be fooled by the amount of hours played here: I had never owned it on Steam previously, but I have honestly put 200+ hours into this in my lifetime. I played Fallout 3 when it came out on a whim, not being overly familiar with the rest of the Fallout franchise, and it was the best decision I ever made, to stick to it even though at first I was not so sure if I liked it or not. Then, as I advanced properly into the Capital Wasteland and the story unfolded itself, it became my second favourite video game of all time (alongside BioShock 1/2). Though the engine may be old in today's standards, it does not discount anything at all; the grimy Wasteland has become a sort of home to me, every single character I have encountered is likeable, even the baddies that go around killing♥♥♥♥♥♥ even the beloved cannibal-incestuous families of Andale that make you human-meat pies if you promise to stay quiet about their ways. This game shows you a portrayal of a world where the 50s never left it though technology went on, and accurately shows the progression of human survival after we succeeded at killing the world via nuclear warfare. There are so many heartwrenching moments, and just as many hilarious ones--all companions are likable, and every quest the Lone Wanderer undertakes is meaningful. Even the side quests serve good purposes, and I never tire of exploring the Wasteland though I may have scoured it from corner to corner by now. Like I've said, the Fallout world has become a very familiar place to me now, somewhere that is so replayable and full of vitality, ironically in a radiation-riddled landscape. I prefer it to Fallout: New Vegas only out of the story content, feeling the latter to be superior only by a hair. This was the first step of Bethesda's revival of the franchise, after all, and will remain forever in my heart as the best of the two. Please play this if you haven't, so that you can get a feel for the Fallout universe before Fallout 4 comes out. HYPE(my icon is actually of my Lone Wanderer, Eden, funnily enough)			"

												Fallout 3. My gosh, this game is near to perfection. This game is my favorite RPG at the moment, I mean, every RPG fan needs to play this game. NEEDS TO. Especially GOTY Edition, it's only $20 such a good deal. Lets sum up the story.You and your Dad lived in a vault, your Dad (played by Liam Neeson) leaves the vault, to find a water purifier called the 'G.E.C.K.' You also leave the vault, in search of your father. Now, let me tell you the pros and the cons of this game +DLCPros+Unlike Oblivion, Fo3 is a very immersive game+Lots of interesting characters as you progress through the game. +Most of the DLC (Except Mothership Zeta) is actually pretty good, my personal favorite is The Pitt+Lots of weapons and guns, lasers, and plasma rifles are awesome, and the Fat Man+The Soundtrack in this game is superb, I love the oldies music in this game.+ Interesting antagonist (The Enclave)+ The Power Armor (Whether BOS or Enclave) is freaking sweet+ Most of the Companions are interesting,and fun to use+ Lots of places to explore+ THe Perk System is great, makes the game more fun+ V.A.T.S. just makes this game morew fun than ever+ You can put a lot of hours into this game, and not get bored (I know at the moment it says i put 52 hours, but i put much more on the ps3.)Cons- Comanions die if they lose all of their health, luckily for the dog comapnion there's a perk to have him have another dog, but you can't get that perk until much later in the game.- The ending without the Broken Steel DLC, Sucks, once you complete the story, without the dlc, it doesnt let you go back- The DLC Mothership Zeta was a HUGE disappointment for me, you're not missing out if you dont play it. (except for the new guns)- Poorly optimized for Windows 7 and up, and Bethesda refused to patch it, you can get an unofficial patch that will fix this problem.So... Despite some of the Minor flaws this game has, it is still a fantastic RPG that must be played by anyone that calls themselves an RPG fanFinal Verdit: 9.5/10 MUST BUY			"

												Fallout 3 I first played this game when it came out on Xbox 360 in 2009. Back then, this game blew my mind and has since been one of my favorite gmaes to date. The add-ons were solid, and actually all of them added a fair amount of content, loot, and stories for your charactor to explore. Honestly, long story and review short, Fallout 3 will always be my favorite game of all time.			"

												I really love this game and recommend it any day. Period.If you're turned away by the age (8 years old, as of this review...my god I feel old), realise that there are always mods to do anything you felt was missing, or that you thought the game needed to compete with newer roleplaying games. Although the modding community is absolutely incredible, I recommend completing one playthrough without mods. Just to get the intended experience at least once. Now, as for what the game offers...I'll do this in a simple way that I've seen pretty often on here, so you should know it.PROS:+ Atmosphere is perfect. There's something about the look and feel of the wasteland that just makes you feel really immersed+ Soundtrack is very good, using classic songs from the 50s-60s era, which is a nice bit of irony. Cheery music, destroyed world+ Character building and connections are done extremely well in this game, which a few exceptions. I personally cared about many of the characters throughout my travels of the Capital Wasteland+ SO MUCH TO EXPLORE! There are just over a hundred (if my memory is correct) marked locations in the base game world, but so many more hidden in all of the nooks and crannies of DC. And often you'll find yourself learning more about what happened to people in those locations, which really helps establish the open world+ The player has many choices to make, some make subtle changes, while others completely change everything. Choose wisely+ Lots of variety and freedom. The quest design is done so that the player can take so many different paths to achieve something, which definitely adds to the roleplaying experience+ Incredible amounts of replayability. Tying in with the last two points, this game has so many things to do, it is impossible to see everything in just one playthrough+ Variety in weapons and armour. Want to deck yourself out in full power armour? Sure. Just want to chill out in pyjamas? You've got it. What about running around in a duster coat and a clown mask? I don't see why not. And as for weapons...there are dozens of weapons at your disposal, most of which have unique variants for you to collect+ So much to do! There are hundreds of quests to be completed, dozens of unique weapons and armour to be found, hundreds of locations to explore and learn about, and so much more. This game is filled to the brim with content+ If you want more, the Fallout 3 Nexus has thousands of mods for you to tweak your game with, allowing for even more replayabilityCONS:- Gunplay is horrible. You do get used to it after a while, but it still has a slight cringe factor- Some of the voice acting is a little weak. Given the scale of the game, I do give it a bit of a pass on it- Pretty annoying to actually start up. It took me a few hours of tinkering with files and downloading patches before it worked, but now it runs fantastic and I don't believe that it has crashed on me yet			"

												When I first played it I was blown away.+ the way you chose your skills at the begining was unconventional and not boring like in most games.+ the moment you left the crypt for the 1st time <3+ the dark atmosphere of a post-nuclear world+ ruined Washington is just so beautiful in its ugliness - its streets, metro stations and tunnels, a ""boat city""+ the story is surely OK. It's not bad, it's not super great but fun to play for sure.+ think It has a way better early game than New Vegas (which was freakin' boring at the begining)- typical Bethesda's bugs (but it didn't really affect my gameplay)- hm, for some diehard fans of Fallout 1 and 2 this game sucks BUT so does Fallout Tactics for them.. and I find it awesome, so don't listen to them ;)- the game gets boring in late game, but I mean after completing the game and a bit of DLCs- well, I don't know, I enjoyed it a lot ;)To me it's 10/10.... and yes, I enjoyed it a bit more than New Vegas ;) (great game, though!)

												UPDATE: So after having not played this game for almost a year now, and having since upgraded to Windows 10 since the original posting of this review, I thought it would be a good idea to see if Fallout 3 is still broken. After downloading the game and its DLC, installing all of it, and then spending about 2 hours modding the heck out of it, I can safely say that Fallout 3 is running (at least for now) absoulutely flawlessly on my Windows 10 machine! I cannot overstate how awesome this is! This is by far and away one of my favorite games of all time, and I am SO happy that it is working on the newest hardware! What are you waiting for?! BUY THIS GAME ALREADY!Fallout 3 is one of the best video games of all time.  Fallout 3 is one of my favorite videogames of all time.  Fallout 3 is also extremely broken on anything above Windows XP.  It pains me to say this because I absolutely love this game!  (Ignore my hours played I have spent at least 200+ hours in this game on the Xbox 360 version as well as the PC version) I have had a myriad of issues with the PC version of Fallout 3 ever since I upgraded to Windows 8.  I have tried various things to attempt to fix the constant CTDs I receive when playing this game all to no avail.  If you happen to have a PC that is running Windows XP (I also hear that Windows 7 kinda works as well) then by all means you owe it to yourself to play this amazing game!  For anyone using Windows 8 or the newly released Windows 10, you have been warned.Despite not working on my Windows 8 PC, I feel like I can still recommend this game because of all the fun I've already had.  If Bethesda decides to patch this in the future then I will certainly be redownloading and replaying Fallout 3.TL;DRFallout 3 is prone to constant CTDs when being played on a Windows 8 PC.			"

												Probably one of the best RPG/Sci-Fi/Open World games that you can get. Really great. If you have Windows 7 or later, then just get a patch on Nexus, that will fix it, the game (as far as I remember/know) has problems running on Quad Core Processor. And some more stuff. Just google ""Dansgaming - How to mod Fallout 3"" there you can get many great ideas, and a very easy tutorial to fix Fallout 3, the first video should be about the patch, if you only want that one.Besides that, I can say that the game has some great moments, you have no idea how satisfying it is to throw a grenade at a bunch of raiders in slow-mo VATS. Just great.The game comes with some great DLC/Expansions to the main game, that is really worth checking out. If you have earlier tried out games such as Fallout 1-2 and New Vegas, or maybe some other games in the same genre, like the other Bethesda games, like Skyrim, this is worth trying out, trust me on that. And also, if you have played it 1-2 times, then try modding it, it can dramatically change your experience and look at the game, the modding community of the Bethesda games a thriving, and there are no short of people that will happily help you get starting modding.All in all, probably the greatest game I have ever played.PS: The reason I haven't so many hours, is because I played a pirated version before (I know, hang me), and when I got it myself, I had problems with the optimization part of Fallout 3 for Windows 7, all fixed now ofc.If you are unsure, then get it on a sale.

												Very solid main story quests. Used to say nah to this game but learned to love it once I started playing it! I would definitely tell anyone to play this game if they haven't already. Getting ready to beat it only had for a couple days and ready for the next one!			"

I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire, I Just Want To Start A Flame In Your Pants - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]The jump from 2D to 3D can often times be a defining moment for a game series. The evolution of game mechanics and sometimes even the shift in genre can make or break its impact on old fans and new audiences alike. Some only play 3D Zelda games, some only play 2D Mario. Megaman Legends was something of an underrated flop, despite how much I loved it. That's just how it goes. And let's not even bring up Sonic. Sometimes the love for a particular franchise, a specific character or story, can't transcend the type of game. Some people are shallow♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥like that, only caring about their favorite game because of how it is on the outside. It's what's on the inside that counts. Just because your favorite series suddenly has different mechanics, you're gonna leave it for the next pretty game? How could you.Surprisingly, all these beloved childhood characters aren't the only ones with blood feuds going on in the fanbase. Sure, they're the ones that are deemed ""acceptable"" to argue about. For the most part. Except Sonic, arguing about Sonic just disappoints your parents.Fallout is another massive franchise with a split fanbase. Fallout 1 and 2 were highly acclaimed tactical CRPG's, with dedicated followings. However, after being acquired by Bethesda, Fallout 3 took the series in a new direction.Fallout 3 is an action-RPG, feeling more like an FPS at times than a strategy RPG. Some say Fallout 3 ruined Fallout, making it essentially an Elder Scrolls with guns. Some say Bethesda is what saved Fallout from falling into obscurity.While both are valid looks on what became of Fallout, I personally feel like they're both rather narrow-minded looks on the issue. Fallout 3 still manages to capture so much of the essence of Fallout, even if it's not a carbon copy of Fallout 1 or 2.Much like past Fallout games, there's a huge emphasis on character building. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system is back, along with all of the other classic Fallout skills and traits. Over the course of the game you'll be leveling up and allocating skill points to different skills to improve your ability to sneak around, wield different kinds of weapons, or even stuff like persuasion or bartering. There are no bad skills to focus on, as the game is balanced enough to allow any skill set to be viable. Bonus traits are also granted with each level and give you a selection of unique perks to choose from, boosting your combat ability against certain enemy types, giving bonuses to different skills, or even allowing you to choose special dialogue options or use special skills in certain scenarios.Fallout's karma system is back as well, allowing your character to be as unique as possible.My character was Captain Sugartits, unstable mass murderer and crazed drug and sex addict. Captain isn't a title or anything, it's just a part of her name. You know how people can have two first names, like Mary Anne or something? Yeah, Captain Sugartits. Her father chose the name himself.Her major skills were Sneaking, Lockpicking, and Science. She started out mild-mannered enough, but her thirst for science, blood, hard drugs, and violent lesbian sex drove her to massacre entire settlements. However, she gave like a hundred bottles of purified water to a homeless man overcome with radiation poisoning. So she was the murderous saint of the wasteland. She would enter any settlement and steal whatever wasn't bolted down, but the second someone talked to her with any sort of attitude she'd shoot up the town. She was quite unstable.Fallout 3 manages to capture the spirit of the original Fallout in a beautiful way. Exploration and discovery is not spurred on by curiosity, or by demand. No one tells you to go explore. Fallout 3 has a massive, open world to explore. There are side-quests everywhere, secrets and surprises tucked all over the wasteland. But it doesn't hold you by the hand and guide you to each of these. No, exploration is driven by necessity. You're helpless and weak once you leave your Vault, and the means to defend yourself isn't free. You'll need to forage for weapons and ammo, forage for food and medicine, and forage for any other items of value to sell for whatever necessities you can't find from foraging. And it never ends. Even after you've found a powerful weapon, you'll need money or parts to repair it as its condition wears down. And what you're fighting will only escalate in strength, from mutated insects to corrupt leftover government weirdos. The struggle never ends. The struggle is real.The karma system actually factors right into this as well. Before the Cap snapped and went on her rampage across the wasteland, staying armed and ready to fight was incredibly difficult. The only way I was able to arm myself to the teeth was from stealing everything, robbing and murdering whoever I could, and doing quite a bit of less-than kosher deeds. It really solidifies the idea of the world that you're in. It's hard to be good. There's not enough to go around, and it's a constant struggle to exist.Fallout 3 is a masterpiece of smart game design, and still one of the best open-ended RPG's out there. Getting lost in the world of Fallout 3 is a blast. And most of all, it still feels like Fallout. The same style and charm is still there. Except you can't kill kids anymore, no matter how annoying the little ♥♥♥♥♥ are.Not that I'D want to, I'm just saying. For realism's sake. If a deranged murderer hopped up on drugs and lesbians got talked down to by a little brat, don't you think she'd mini-nuke the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them? I'm just saying.When it really comes down to which Fallout style I prefer though, classic 1 and 2 or the Bethesda-style in 3, I prefer both because they're both fun. Stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing you nerds.			"

												I find this game enjoyable and not too far from Oblivion. I purchased this when on sale and would recommend the same. The pros of this game: easier to get into role playing mood than Oblivion; weapons and guns are unexpectedly fun to use; atmosphere and mapping/world are good. Cons: similar to Oblivion -- the game engine still needs some work including the sneaking system, AI, movement mechanics, and character animations; the menu system isn't far off from Oblivion's and I would have liked to seen some better organization; can get boring.All in all, I think it's a great game but it could have been better with some core game changes.

												First off I love this game, always have. I played it before for about 90% completion and sank my life into it. I get it on the PC and i get great things... The CRASHING though. This thing crashes more than NASCAR. I realize that I'm running windows 10 and the game is barly optimozed for 7 (from whit it says, could be wrong) you would think that for a AAA game like this they would keep it updeated. I find myself Quicksaving very often now because there could be a crash any moment. Besides the crashing this is an amazing game with great replay value, story, and just plane ol' fun. You can get play this game for hours and not even touch any quest, thats the way a game like this should be. Overall I give this game 10 NASCAR crashes out of 10.			"

			Nothing in life is guaranteed, but this might help. (Edit): What I said about it accessing the GPU (the graphics card), is wrong. This change allows Fallout 3 to access a multi-core processor.		

its a simple change to make and its clear on how to do, it stabelized the game for me to where I can run it four hours without it locking up on me.			"

												Note that I only have 10 hours playtime on Steam, but I played the game much longer on Xbox 360.This game isn't optimized on Windows 7, as Steam mentions, but there's an easy fix to Fallout 3's configuration file taht you can find online. This fixes the inconsistent crashes of the game.Now that I've ENLIGHTENED you of that, Fallout 3 is an amazing RPG. If you don't like sandbox games, don't worry, there's a great quest with markers so you don't have to wander around for things. If linear storylines aren't your thing, you can wander the vast American Wasteland, pillaging shanty towns with an evil cohort, or helping the unfortunate as a lone altruist. The game's graphics, as some mentioned, aren't state-of-the-art to 2013's standards. However, one needs to realize that this game is from 2008 and using anti-aliasing will fix jagged textures. There are plenty of visual mods for the game outside of Steam as well (no Steam Workshop support for the game).The optional VATS combat system makes the game turned based in a sense. This is perfect if you aren't a great shooter, or you want to relax more while you play.There aren't any vehicles to drive in the game, but I don't think that's much of a missing feature because the atmosphere isn't meant for driving around the Washington, D.C. metro area. The Quick Travel function in your map saves you from the fear of having to walk across the Wasteland, so no worries!There are many trainable skills in the game that will keep you busy, ranging from Equipment Repair, Medical, Hacking, and of course, Marksmanship (not exact names, but in layman's terms). If you've played Runescape or the Elder Scrolls, the skills system is very reminiscent. In addition to this, the Perks system allows you to pick a special trait each time you level your character up.I give Fallout 3: GOTY Edition a legitimate 100% rating because I find no faults in it, hence my length review.

												To everyone who made the same mistake I did, yes, this game is not optimized for Windows 7 or later, that means it's also excluding Windows 8.Windows 7 users: You all have the ability to boot up Windows XP and Vista; that came with your computer. Just google how to do it, run it, and launch Fallout 3 there.Windows 8 users: Some of you, maybe even all, are unable to even start the game. You click ""Play"" and your game crashes. Read this, and trust his download. I downloaded the Windows Live he had, and installed it. The game runs perfectly now. I've clocked in a few hours already, and i've had no issues; other than minor visual glitches. Which is expected in a rather old, yet huge game.Otherwise, this game is awesome. I truly suggest buying it; no matter what platform.			"

												Best game ever. It has so many things to find, so many places to explore, and it's very fun too. You can kill almost all NPC if you want to, you can be a good guy saving everyone, you can be a slaver, a thief, you can play good guy and then drop a grenade into someone's pocket and see him explode. You can find tons of places and many deep metro tunnels.. On my third playthrough, the one I am playing right now, I found a crazy maniac family, who seemed harmless, however in their locked basement they had corpses of people, butchered, and their meat was their next meal (human leg stick in the fridge).  Then, after I found out, they attacked me. Of course I killed hem all. This game never fails to impress me. I wonder what I am going to find out next.			"

												Fallout 3 GOTY: How to install, fix, tweak & mod (update 12/15) by PrinzEugene for those of you doing a first time install, or those of you like me who are installing FO3GOTY afresh, is a finely written and thorough and uptodate piece.  This game takes time to study in order to make one mod fit with other mods and every mod to work together with only rare glitches. The information is out there as to how. It takes a human mind to find it all out and apply it without error. I spend a few days usually to do this, but then as it was before I stopped playing this game in 2011, it is now possible to play for hours uninterrupted by game crashes, thanks not to Bethesda but to the avid gaming community this game spawns year after year.

												Once I got this game to work on my Windows 7 computer, (Not an easy task but I can walk you through it if that's of interest to anyone.) I thoroughly enjoyed this game. It is... vast. Nothing Bethesda does is small. There's so many things to do, it can make your head spin, The main quest and the side quests sometimes blurred together for me but that's ok. I'm sure I missed a lot of stuff so I may play through it again at some point. The story is very in depth and seems plausible. I found myself believing this could happen right now, if nuclear warfare ever became a thing. The end game was really incredulous but also lackluster. I wish the order of events was a touch different. For instance I felt like a badass when I blew up the President and the base but   felt like a complete dope when I was running along side a big dumb robot killing everything for me. I would've loved those events to be switched. I get why it didn't happen that way, but I like feeling powerful by end game. I didn't realize it was over until it told me so and I felt hollow and unaccomplished.One other thing I really didn't like about this game was the voice Acting. I didn't appreciate the recycled voices for different people and would have appreciated original voices. Even if they couldn't afford more actors, a slightly different voice would've been better than literally everyone having each other's voices. All in all though, I loved this game. I cried when my dad died. I squeed when I found Dogmeat. I felt like a badass when I used VATS. There were so many moments that made me feel, that even though the end game was♥♥♥♥♥♥ it didn't matter. This game is worth playing and I can't wait for Fallout 4.			"

												Due to the fact that I played Fallout 3 after New Vegas and Skyrim, I was really afraid of what I would experience in the game that's 7 years old and commonly hated in the Fallout fandom. As with all other games, I decided to play it COMPLETELY unmodded, in order to experience the very game Bethesda wanted us to play.I played New Vegas and simply loved it. Also, I played Skyrim and even today I consider it to be the best game I have ever played. Hyping myself for Fallout's 4th installment, I decided to buy Fallout 3 and ultimately decided whether it's so bad as many people say. Surprise, surprise - it's not! The beginning is very slow-paced, but it gives a nice touch to the whole story. But right after entering Megaton - boy, was I impressed. That was the very moment when I felt the ""Bethesda spirit"", because of which I love their games so much. Interesting backstory of the location, quite nice backstories of each character in the ""city"", a lot of interesting loot, nice dialogues and the big introduction to the essence of the game - BE GOOD OR BE BAD.The morality/consequence system in the game is based on extremities - there are just a few moments when you can stay neutral with your decision. Therefore, most time you decide whether you want to be good or bad. However, sometimes your seemingly good/bad choices can result in the opposite of your intention - that is why a player has to THINK while deciding - it pays off and it's really cool.Due to the common belief that F:NV is a better game than F3, I'd like to contribute a few words to the discussion. As a whole, I consider F:NV to be the better one, but my F3 playthrough was twice longer than any on my F:NV playthroughs. Draw some conclusions. Also, Washington in F3 seems to be much more affected by the atomic explosions than Las Vegas in F:NV. The whole world of F3 seems also to be more miserable and hopeless in contrary to the one of F:NV, which seemingly make it more suitable to the postapocalyptic vision, but I guess it's a matter of taste - personally, I still like more the atmosphere of New Vegas, but I completely understand why some people prefer the one from Fallout 3. The gameplay is rewarding and satisfying - every kill, succesful attempt of persuasion/lockpick/etc. results in earned exp, which just HAS to make you feel good - and it does. You can have your own home that you can upgrade with some Fallout lore technology, you can capture people to make them slaves, you can hunt slavers, you can help or kill almost any person that has his/her's own personality and habits. Oh, btw - habits. I love the habit system, as it makes the world feel ALIVE, and the immersion is the first thing that I'm looking for in RPG games. NPCs have their break-times, eat breakfast/dinner, sleep and have random conversations between each other. So, if you suffer lack of funds, why not steal from the cash register of some folk? You walk into the shop, but he observes your every move. Solution? Just break into the shop during the night time - he will be sleeping, so as long as you maintain to be silent, you're good to go. AWESOME.Now, some bad things. Unlike developers wanted me to, I completed all of the available DLCs BEFORE ending the main story. As for the DLCs - they are mediocre at their least. Some of them are even worse. Somehow, I regret my decision to play them instead of discovering the locations from the main map. Most of the DLCs are linear (""Point Lookout"" is the only exception) and - let's face it - just boring. Playing them wasn't a very good idea also because of one more reason - with little more than half of the game's locations discovered, I hit the 30lvl cap and the game became a dull chore - the character progression just stopped - no more perks, no more skills. Therefore, I was forced to install a mod which allowed me to raise the level cap. After 62hrs of gameplay, I raised almost all of my skills to 100 and raised all of my S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats to 9/10. I know that there are some mods that actually fix this problem, but I wanted to play the game itself, not its modded counterpart. Now, the only thing left is to discover the rest of the locations (20-30, maybe) and to finish the Broken Steel DLC (which is available only after finishing the main questline). Now, I probably need a short break before I complete the game in 100%.Also, the optimisation! It's... bad. Skyrim runs much more fluently on my laptop, and it's a game that is 3 years younger. And much bigger. And prettier. At the very start, the game was unplayable with its constant freezes and crashes. This solution fixed it for me, both on my desktop PC (i5, GTX 970) and laptop (i7, GT650M SLI):""Open up the fallout.ini file in: My Documents\My Games\Fallout3 Find the line: bUseThreadedAI=0 change it to: bUseThreadedAI=1 Add another line after it and insert: iNumHWThreads=2 This will limit the game to 2 cores and prevent the engine bug from causing the game to freeze.""Hope that you find it helpful!With all of its advantages and disadvantages, Fallout 3 is still a great action RPG.[EDIT]:I've just finished the ""Broken Steel"" DLC (same as the rest, linear and mediocre). The main good thing about it is that it's short. I visited couple more locations and lost interest in this title. Still, overall it's a great game that provides many hours of satisfactory and rewarding gameplay.			"

One thing make sure you have a good build on skills, perks, and special other wise it makes the game a whole lot harder.

												My review was originally negative because you buy the game, then have to figure out how to get it to work on your computer without help from bethesda. I found a wonderful video on youtube that is for us people who don't like to mess around with files too much and often get scared of messing up a game file and being screwed. You donwload two things, and paste over a game file which is all explained and shown. It takes about ten minutes max if your going very slowly and will get you into the game bug and crash free.


YouTube™ Video: Fallout 3 GOTY and (Steam) Windows 7/8/10 New Game Crash Fix 

			Views: 79,776		

			Download - http://adf.ly/1hvnLq You will need to have Games 4 windows live installed http://adf.ly/1RtZok FAQ: This will work on windows 8 If you can not find the Fallout.INI it may just be a file...		

Once you do play, it's impossible to say getting it to work was not worth it. I've barely scratched the surface of the game because of how overwhelmed huge games like this make me. But in the dozen quests and what feels to be endless hours exploring. I can gladly say this game is gold and is worth the rage I experienced while trying to find a solution to the crashes. I hope this saves many of you the problems I faced and hopefully the comment gets liked so the poor fellows who are like me, get a quick solution as opposed to scavenging online and through comments.

												This game, unlike the ElderScrolls Series, is not always for the casual player, even on very easy some enemies and places can be a nighmare of difficulty  if you dont have the right gear, or enough stimpacks of course, but saying that, I very much prefer this game to skyrim, possibly even Oblivion or Morrowind in the ElderScrolls series, and im very much anticipating Fallout 4 in the next year or two, People's faces and voices are much better in the fallout games than in the ElderScroll games, and you cant forget about 3dog, very good music, humor, quests, interesting things for people who love Washington D.C. as well and want to explore the radioactive wreckage of the capital, and the surrounding wastelands of course, It was interesting seeing the RobCo HQ, more vaults, and the Capital Itself, Very well made DLC, from aliens, to virtual reality, to slavers in pittsburgh, I would recommend this as a starter for Fallout games, even though it is the 3rd one, it is not very connected to the others, as it is from Bethesda, who did not make the first 2 games, although, the first 2 games excel in story and gameplay as well, and I recommend them as well, in the end its your choice, but if you have 20 bucks to spare, spend them on something that can provide limitless hours of entertainment, hundreds of locations, a good few laughs, good music, a Legendary Father, a few tear jerking moments, Horrifying Moral choices, and of course GARY! So yes, you should play this game, and talk about it, sing the songs outloud if you want, just have fun. Note, do not play this game just because you think, look, skyrim with guns, its alot more than that, and Warfare is slightly weak in this game, this is more for those Nerdy, Lore loving people out there, not the ones that claim to be real gamers, the ones who spend hundreds of hours finding every little secret, seeing every site, doing every mission, loading and reloading games to fix mistakes and prevent deaths, those people, those people are the real gamers, and the people who will enjoy this game the most.

												Do not be fooled by the amount of hours played here: I had never owned it on Steam previously, but I have honestly put 200+ hours into this in my lifetime. I played Fallout 3 when it came out on a whim, not being overly familiar with the rest of the Fallout franchise, and it was the best decision I ever made, to stick to it even though at first I was not so sure if I liked it or not. Then, as I advanced properly into the Capital Wasteland and the story unfolded itself, it became my second favourite video game of all time (alongside BioShock 1/2). Though the engine may be old in today's standards, it does not discount anything at all; the grimy Wasteland has become a sort of home to me, every single character I have encountered is likeable, even the baddies that go around killing♥♥♥♥♥♥ even the beloved cannibal-incestuous families of Andale that make you human-meat pies if you promise to stay quiet about their ways. This game shows you a portrayal of a world where the 50s never left it though technology went on, and accurately shows the progression of human survival after we succeeded at killing the world via nuclear warfare. There are so many heartwrenching moments, and just as many hilarious ones--all companions are likable, and every quest the Lone Wanderer undertakes is meaningful. Even the side quests serve good purposes, and I never tire of exploring the Wasteland though I may have scoured it from corner to corner by now. Like I've said, the Fallout world has become a very familiar place to me now, somewhere that is so replayable and full of vitality, ironically in a radiation-riddled landscape. I prefer it to Fallout: New Vegas only out of the story content, feeling the latter to be superior only by a hair. This was the first step of Bethesda's revival of the franchise, after all, and will remain forever in my heart as the best of the two. Please play this if you haven't, so that you can get a feel for the Fallout universe before Fallout 4 comes out. HYPE(my icon is actually of my Lone Wanderer, Eden, funnily enough)			"

												Fallout 3. My gosh, this game is near to perfection. This game is my favorite RPG at the moment, I mean, every RPG fan needs to play this game. NEEDS TO. Especially GOTY Edition, it's only $20 such a good deal. Lets sum up the story.You and your Dad lived in a vault, your Dad (played by Liam Neeson) leaves the vault, to find a water purifier called the 'G.E.C.K.' You also leave the vault, in search of your father. Now, let me tell you the pros and the cons of this game +DLCPros+Unlike Oblivion, Fo3 is a very immersive game+Lots of interesting characters as you progress through the game. +Most of the DLC (Except Mothership Zeta) is actually pretty good, my personal favorite is The Pitt+Lots of weapons and guns, lasers, and plasma rifles are awesome, and the Fat Man+The Soundtrack in this game is superb, I love the oldies music in this game.+ Interesting antagonist (The Enclave)+ The Power Armor (Whether BOS or Enclave) is freaking sweet+ Most of the Companions are interesting,and fun to use+ Lots of places to explore+ THe Perk System is great, makes the game more fun+ V.A.T.S. just makes this game morew fun than ever+ You can put a lot of hours into this game, and not get bored (I know at the moment it says i put 52 hours, but i put much more on the ps3.)Cons- Comanions die if they lose all of their health, luckily for the dog comapnion there's a perk to have him have another dog, but you can't get that perk until much later in the game.- The ending without the Broken Steel DLC, Sucks, once you complete the story, without the dlc, it doesnt let you go back- The DLC Mothership Zeta was a HUGE disappointment for me, you're not missing out if you dont play it. (except for the new guns)- Poorly optimized for Windows 7 and up, and Bethesda refused to patch it, you can get an unofficial patch that will fix this problem.So... Despite some of the Minor flaws this game has, it is still a fantastic RPG that must be played by anyone that calls themselves an RPG fanFinal Verdit: 9.5/10 MUST BUY			"

												A fantastic Action RPG, Fallout 3 combines all the best elements from first person shooter games with all the RPG from a game such as Oblivion. (Both games run on the Gamebryo engine which is highly moddable.) The base game was fantastic alone, but with the DLC's, the level cap and ending are both enhanced. I won't go into detail, because this review is about 7 years late. One thing worth noting though: THIS IS NOT THE SAME KIND OF GAME AS FALLOUT 1 & 2. ALSO WORTH NOTING, THE PC VERSION OF THIS GAME IS ALMOST AS UNSTABLE AS THE CONSOLE PORT. THIS GAME IS FILLED WITH BUGS, AND WON'T EVEN RUN ON ANY OPERATING SYSTEM WITH MORE THAN ONE CORE. IT ALSO REQUIRES GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. THERE ARE GREAT GUIDES ON STEAM, HOWEVER, AND THESE WILL GET YOUR GAME RUNNING. Guide:

This game is brilliant in so many ways, and I am very glad for the update that no longer ended the game so suddenly after the final storyline mission. I was among one of the first people to beat the game in the time, so I found out the hard way. Fortunately, the game is well worth playing again, which I did multiple times. This game is worth playing for nearly every person's playstyle, minus the carebears and dancing ponies.			"

												I played this game both on PC and PS3, and with a total of about 70 hours, i can tell MHO about this masterpiece of the old-gen games.In this game, the first of the saga developed by Bethesda (The original Fallout 3 was named Van Bouren by the original SH) you can basically do anything, from choosing the fate of a dweller, to changing the entire world, like destroying a city, or changing the president in a city.But the game isn't ""just"" that, it's basically a GDR mixed with FPS things.The Lone Wanderer can have lots of weapons, like blades, baseball bats, laser and plasma rifles, sniper rifles and more, and their unique variant.As weapons, lots of clothes/armors.So, Fallout 3 rests an unbeaten masterpiece of the old-gen games, with a addictive story, lots of side quests and choices to do, and a background lore that criticize the american warlike government aspiring at the oil supremacy. (Yeah, in 2077 oil wells They were completely dried up, so it started another war, against China)Anyone should play this game, really. "

												This game is good, if you're into putting hours on lengthy playthroughs in an RPG with lots of depth, then get this game. However, if you're going to get this game expecting it to be like the infamous Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (but with guns), then you should reconsider because this game is FAR from that kind of title. Firstly, this game is a walking simulator; unlike Skyrim which has all kinds of things to do while you're in a quest, you're going to be lost in lengthy walks from point A to point B while continously looking in the map while whispering to yourself: ""Am I there yet?"", but not to worry, once you get to your destination, you'll be able to use fast travel -- ""but isn't that like Skyrim?"" yes, but in Skyrim, you have LOTS of things to do while you're travelling from Point A to Point B, you might run into some bandit camps, some bears or some caves, but in here, you'll just look at a few landmarks and fight some enemies and that's it. Secondly, what I like about this game is the development of your character is very rewarding and the keen sense of survival is a need in this game.			"

												I picked up and played Fallout 3 years after it was released, really, due to late discovery of gaming and *this* game. I wasn't really sure if I'd like it or not, due to the kinda intimidating heavy duty steel armor dude on the cover. I wasn't sure this game was for me. I've never been so happy to be proven wrong, and finding out that Fallout 3 is so much more than the power armor on the cover. LOL! You don't even have to wear it if you don't want to either. And that's the crux of Fallout 3  for me. Choices. Endless choices! I love this game to death. It has stood the test of time. It's just as awesome to play now like it was the first times I played it. I can play new titles, but I always come back for more Fallout 3.			"

												Due to the fact that I played Fallout 3 after New Vegas and Skyrim, I was really afraid of what I would experience in the game that's 7 years old and commonly hated in the Fallout fandom. As with all other games, I decided to play it COMPLETELY unmodded, in order to experience the very game Bethesda wanted us to play.I played New Vegas and simply loved it. Also, I played Skyrim and even today I consider it to be the best game I have ever played. Hyping myself for Fallout's 4th installment, I decided to buy Fallout 3 and ultimately decided whether it's so bad as many people say. Surprise, surprise - it's not! The beginning is very slow-paced, but it gives a nice touch to the whole story. But right after entering Megaton - boy, was I impressed. That was the very moment when I felt the ""Bethesda spirit"", because of which I love their games so much. Interesting backstory of the location, quite nice backstories of each character in the ""city"", a lot of interesting loot, nice dialogues and the big introduction to the essence of the game - BE GOOD OR BE BAD.The morality/consequence system in the game is based on extremities - there are just a few moments when you can stay neutral with your decision. Therefore, most time you decide whether you want to be good or bad. However, sometimes your seemingly good/bad choices can result in the opposite of your intention - that is why a player has to THINK while deciding - it pays off and it's really cool.Due to the common belief that F:NV is a better game than F3, I'd like to contribute a few words to the discussion. As a whole, I consider F:NV to be the better one, but my F3 playthrough was twice longer than any on my F:NV playthroughs. Draw some conclusions. Also, Washington in F3 seems to be much more affected by the atomic explosions than Las Vegas in F:NV. The whole world of F3 seems also to be more miserable and hopeless in contrary to the one of F:NV, which seemingly make it more suitable to the postapocalyptic vision, but I guess it's a matter of taste - personally, I still like more the atmosphere of New Vegas, but I completely understand why some people prefer the one from Fallout 3. The gameplay is rewarding and satisfying - every kill, succesful attempt of persuasion/lockpick/etc. results in earned exp, which just HAS to make you feel good - and it does. You can have your own home that you can upgrade with some Fallout lore technology, you can capture people to make them slaves, you can hunt slavers, you can help or kill almost any person that has his/her's own personality and habits. Oh, btw - habits. I love the habit system, as it makes the world feel ALIVE, and the immersion is the first thing that I'm looking for in RPG games. NPCs have their break-times, eat breakfast/dinner, sleep and have random conversations between each other. So, if you suffer lack of funds, why not steal from the cash register of some folk? You walk into the shop, but he observes your every move. Solution? Just break into the shop during the night time - he will be sleeping, so as long as you maintain to be silent, you're good to go. AWESOME.Now, some bad things. Unlike developers wanted me to, I completed all of the available DLCs BEFORE ending the main story. As for the DLCs - they are mediocre at their least. Some of them are even worse. Somehow, I regret my decision to play them instead of discovering the locations from the main map. Most of the DLCs are linear (""Point Lookout"" is the only exception) and - let's face it - just boring. Playing them wasn't a very good idea also because of one more reason - with little more than half of the game's locations discovered, I hit the 30lvl cap and the game became a dull chore - the character progression just stopped - no more perks, no more skills. Therefore, I was forced to install a mod which allowed me to raise the level cap. After 62hrs of gameplay, I raised almost all of my skills to 100 and raised all of my S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats to 9/10. I know that there are some mods that actually fix this problem, but I wanted to play the game itself, not its modded counterpart. Now, the only thing left is to discover the rest of the locations (20-30, maybe) and to finish the Broken Steel DLC (which is available only after finishing the main questline). Now, I probably need a short break before I complete the game in 100%.Also, the optimisation! It's... bad. Skyrim runs much more fluently on my laptop, and it's a game that is 3 years younger. And much bigger. And prettier. At the very start, the game was unplayable with its constant freezes and crashes. This solution fixed it for me, both on my desktop PC (i5, GTX 970) and laptop (i7, GT650M SLI):""Open up the fallout.ini file in: My Documents\My Games\Fallout3 Find the line: bUseThreadedAI=0 change it to: bUseThreadedAI=1 Add another line after it and insert: iNumHWThreads=2 This will limit the game to 2 cores and prevent the engine bug from causing the game to freeze.""Hope that you find it helpful!With all of its advantages and disadvantages, Fallout 3 is still a great action RPG.[EDIT]:I've just finished the ""Broken Steel"" DLC (same as the rest, linear and mediocre). The main good thing about it is that it's short. I visited couple more locations and lost interest in this title. Still, overall it's a great game that provides many hours of satisfactory and rewarding gameplay.			"

												WHERE HAS THIS GAME BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!A good friend got this for me, and this...holy crap...this has to be one of my most favourite video game experiences. The game has it's buggy problems, but nothing that hinders game play experience when fixed.Pros:+ Prepare to invest some good time into this game. It's addictive and the open world is filled with quests and decisions to be made. You will have long game sessions in this game.+ The game really lets you embrace being a good/bad person, along with diverse dailogue choices. Karma system is one of the best I've seen and what you do effects the world around you. You can literally kill anyone you want in this game ._.+ The game has a targeting/aiming system called VATS which is really cool and useful against enemies, for a game where aiming normally could use some improvements.+ There's a lot of interesting characters in the game that really makes the game wasteland setting more lively. + This game immerses you. It really feels like you're someone in a hazardous wasteland trying to survive and helping or killing folks. Not just the game itself, but the story also immerses you into the role of your character really well.+ MODS! There's a mod for everything! X_X+ My Dad in Fallout 3 was a better father to me than my IRL Dad lol XD Why isn't he real (╥_╥) ""Be careful, sweetie"", ""That's my girl"". Kindest words any father figure has ever told me.Cons:- Getting this game to work on the first try. Prepare yourself for Do-It-Yourself fixes. There's a guide with fixes fortunately that makes the process more smoother.-  No sprinting option is silly, considering the character's speed would test the patience of the most impatient of us. (Luckily there's a mod for this too if you're curious).- Stealth in this game sucks...or it tries, but comes up short. You can't get too close to an enemy (even from behind) or they notice you immediately. Sniping from afar is almost useless because there is no steady aim. Other than skill, sniping requires luck and tolerance.- Third-person view in this game is kinda...awkward. Character movement looks and feels stiff. Camera isn't great in third person either. You can't even see your character's face without it feeling like a struggle to turn the camera. My suggestion: Playing in first person felt much better to me, and that's coming from someone who prefers third person view any day. Your aim is also much more accurate than in third person view.Oh,  and watch out for jump scares in first person view lol.My Rating: 9 out of 10. Just by solving the few cons I mentioned, I would definitely give this game a strong 10/10.			"

												First fallout game I ever played was Fallout: New Vegas. Some people say that Fallout 3 is better than F:NV some say otherwise. I can't really tell wich one is better. They are both awesome and unique. In Fallout 3 I felt like I was in danger all the time and just fighting for survival. It has awesome story. There is lot to do in the wastelands, lot of enemies and quests. About story... there was lot of sad parts, sometimes even happy... and decissions hard. But one thing is for sure... When you begin playing main quest line, you are going to be very excited to see what happens next, and it will keep you playing. There is also karma. Evil or Good. It might have big impact on the world and also some companions request certain status to be recruited...By being evil, you will make more money, but by being good, people will like you and may even give you gifts. It really is awesome game.			"

												No doubt one of the best games of apocalyptic theme ever made. After an entire life living in the Vault with your dad with a peaceful life under the circumstances of the results that the nuclear war left on the country, some day everything changed. The Vault is opened, your dad escaped, terrible things happen and the blame fall over you two. With no other choice, you have to leave the Vault and look for your missing dad. What I can say is that the game is funny, tense and stressing when it has to be. Killing with the craziest weapons ever made and even dress yourself like a rebel. Cutting, beating, ripping, shooting, blowing, smashing, all the kind of things can be done with basically everyone. You can be a good or a bad guy/girl, depending of your Karma. So take your Fat Man, make bandits, giant insects and mutants fly in pieces, whatever cost to find your dad!			"

												Fallout 3 is one of the best games I have ever played.It is an interesting game due to its main story; finding your dad who ran off out of the 'Vault'. This game allows you to make rather big decisions and it also supports mods.I personally find the leveling system quite unique, there are all kind of perks that you can apply to your character to make them stronger.Unfortunately the game might crash sometimes. If anyone is wondering how to fix this then attempt following these instructions; http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/201495-fallout-3-crash-fix-guide/Regardless of the con, I strongly recommend this game as it is an unforgettable experience in an Open World. -Update- Fallout 4 released!A game made by Bethesda.

												When I first played it I was blown away.+ the way you chose your skills at the begining was unconventional and not boring like in most games.+ the moment you left the crypt for the 1st time <3+ the dark atmosphere of a post-nuclear world+ ruined Washington is just so beautiful in its ugliness - its streets, metro stations and tunnels, a ""boat city""+ the story is surely OK. It's not bad, it's not super great but fun to play for sure.+ think It has a way better early game than New Vegas (which was freakin' boring at the begining)- typical Bethesda's bugs (but it didn't really affect my gameplay)- hm, for some diehard fans of Fallout 1 and 2 this game sucks BUT so does Fallout Tactics for them.. and I find it awesome, so don't listen to them ;)- the game gets boring in late game, but I mean after completing the game and a bit of DLCs- well, I don't know, I enjoyed it a lot ;)To me it's 10/10.... and yes, I enjoyed it a bit more than New Vegas ;) (great game, though!)

												I really love this game and recommend it any day. Period.If you're turned away by the age (8 years old, as of this review...my god I feel old), realise that there are always mods to do anything you felt was missing, or that you thought the game needed to compete with newer roleplaying games. Although the modding community is absolutely incredible, I recommend completing one playthrough without mods. Just to get the intended experience at least once. Now, as for what the game offers...I'll do this in a simple way that I've seen pretty often on here, so you should know it.PROS:+ Atmosphere is perfect. There's something about the look and feel of the wasteland that just makes you feel really immersed+ Soundtrack is very good, using classic songs from the 50s-60s era, which is a nice bit of irony. Cheery music, destroyed world+ Character building and connections are done extremely well in this game, which a few exceptions. I personally cared about many of the characters throughout my travels of the Capital Wasteland+ SO MUCH TO EXPLORE! There are just over a hundred (if my memory is correct) marked locations in the base game world, but so many more hidden in all of the nooks and crannies of DC. And often you'll find yourself learning more about what happened to people in those locations, which really helps establish the open world+ The player has many choices to make, some make subtle changes, while others completely change everything. Choose wisely+ Lots of variety and freedom. The quest design is done so that the player can take so many different paths to achieve something, which definitely adds to the roleplaying experience+ Incredible amounts of replayability. Tying in with the last two points, this game has so many things to do, it is impossible to see everything in just one playthrough+ Variety in weapons and armour. Want to deck yourself out in full power armour? Sure. Just want to chill out in pyjamas? You've got it. What about running around in a duster coat and a clown mask? I don't see why not. And as for weapons...there are dozens of weapons at your disposal, most of which have unique variants for you to collect+ So much to do! There are hundreds of quests to be completed, dozens of unique weapons and armour to be found, hundreds of locations to explore and learn about, and so much more. This game is filled to the brim with content+ If you want more, the Fallout 3 Nexus has thousands of mods for you to tweak your game with, allowing for even more replayabilityCONS:- Gunplay is horrible. You do get used to it after a while, but it still has a slight cringe factor- Some of the voice acting is a little weak. Given the scale of the game, I do give it a bit of a pass on it- Pretty annoying to actually start up. It took me a few hours of tinkering with files and downloading patches before it worked, but now it runs fantastic and I don't believe that it has crashed on me yet			"

												I have to congratulate Bethesda on how innovative and considerate they have been with Fallout 3. There aren't many game developers that think so much of a player's health and wellbeing that they would make their game so bug ridden that the game would CTD every 15 minutes, thus giving the player's eyes a rest for a few moments and a chance to stretch their legs.

Go to http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/? and download what you like.. free acount!If you however actually get an account there, the mods you like/download will be listed for easier re-installing the whole game (or mod lists) on another system or something like that..

												I was wandering to a minefield to do a quest Moira gave me, when, stoping by a junkyard, i found a dog fighting some raiders. I helped him kill'em, and he joined me.    We were happy for some time together, killin' raiders and protectrons and exploring. And then we got to Evergreen Mills.    I told him to get me some ammo while i was freeing slaves. He somehow managed to open the gate that was holding off a freakin' mutant behemot, that proceeded to tear him apart in a few hits.

												Fallout 3 is the first Fallout developed by Bethesda and to be quite honest they did a damn good job with it. I mean, just look at the amount of locations in the game and try and tell me it isn't impressive for 2008 game. The story is rather lackluster and of course there are still a tonne of bugs but what really stands out are the RPG elements (the perks in particular.) However, this is a Bethesda game so the ladies and gentlemen of the modding community have been working hard to make this game even better.Would I recommend this? Absolutely, but you have to do some tweaking to get it to work with windows 7 and higher			"

With DLC I don't think I've ever experianced a game that gave me so much enjoyment over such an extended period of my life. But do keep in mind that this game will still work on Windows 8.1 (My operating system) assuming you install the doppleganger for Windows live and change the core number in the ini file. Getting the game to run on Windows 8.1 will take under 15 minutes of your time. "

												Fallout 3. My gosh, this game is near to perfection. This game is my favorite RPG at the moment, I mean, every RPG fan needs to play this game. NEEDS TO. Especially GOTY Edition, it's only $20 such a good deal. Lets sum up the story.You and your Dad lived in a vault, your Dad (played by Liam Neeson) leaves the vault, to find a water purifier called the 'G.E.C.K.' You also leave the vault, in search of your father. Now, let me tell you the pros and the cons of this game +DLCPros+Unlike Oblivion, Fo3 is a very immersive game+Lots of interesting characters as you progress through the game. +Most of the DLC (Except Mothership Zeta) is actually pretty good, my personal favorite is The Pitt+Lots of weapons and guns, lasers, and plasma rifles are awesome, and the Fat Man+The Soundtrack in this game is superb, I love the oldies music in this game.+ Interesting antagonist (The Enclave)+ The Power Armor (Whether BOS or Enclave) is freaking sweet+ Most of the Companions are interesting,and fun to use+ Lots of places to explore+ THe Perk System is great, makes the game more fun+ V.A.T.S. just makes this game morew fun than ever+ You can put a lot of hours into this game, and not get bored (I know at the moment it says i put 52 hours, but i put much more on the ps3.)Cons- Comanions die if they lose all of their health, luckily for the dog comapnion there's a perk to have him have another dog, but you can't get that perk until much later in the game.- The ending without the Broken Steel DLC, Sucks, once you complete the story, without the dlc, it doesnt let you go back- The DLC Mothership Zeta was a HUGE disappointment for me, you're not missing out if you dont play it. (except for the new guns)- Poorly optimized for Windows 7 and up, and Bethesda refused to patch it, you can get an unofficial patch that will fix this problem.So... Despite some of the Minor flaws this game has, it is still a fantastic RPG that must be played by anyone that calls themselves an RPG fanFinal Verdit: 9.5/10 MUST BUY			"

												This game, unlike the ElderScrolls Series, is not always for the casual player, even on very easy some enemies and places can be a nighmare of difficulty  if you dont have the right gear, or enough stimpacks of course, but saying that, I very much prefer this game to skyrim, possibly even Oblivion or Morrowind in the ElderScrolls series, and im very much anticipating Fallout 4 in the next year or two, People's faces and voices are much better in the fallout games than in the ElderScroll games, and you cant forget about 3dog, very good music, humor, quests, interesting things for people who love Washington D.C. as well and want to explore the radioactive wreckage of the capital, and the surrounding wastelands of course, It was interesting seeing the RobCo HQ, more vaults, and the Capital Itself, Very well made DLC, from aliens, to virtual reality, to slavers in pittsburgh, I would recommend this as a starter for Fallout games, even though it is the 3rd one, it is not very connected to the others, as it is from Bethesda, who did not make the first 2 games, although, the first 2 games excel in story and gameplay as well, and I recommend them as well, in the end its your choice, but if you have 20 bucks to spare, spend them on something that can provide limitless hours of entertainment, hundreds of locations, a good few laughs, good music, a Legendary Father, a few tear jerking moments, Horrifying Moral choices, and of course GARY! So yes, you should play this game, and talk about it, sing the songs outloud if you want, just have fun. Note, do not play this game just because you think, look, skyrim with guns, its alot more than that, and Warfare is slightly weak in this game, this is more for those Nerdy, Lore loving people out there, not the ones that claim to be real gamers, the ones who spend hundreds of hours finding every little secret, seeing every site, doing every mission, loading and reloading games to fix mistakes and prevent deaths, those people, those people are the real gamers, and the people who will enjoy this game the most.

Living in a Vault your whole life doesn't ever prepare you for the world outside, despite what all of Vault-Tec's instructional material tells their residents. So when the Lone Wanderer was thrust through that four foot-thick steel door with a mission, it's hard to say they were ready for what came next...War, War Never ChangesIt's been two-hundred years since October twenty-third, 2077, the day of the two-hour Great War, when atomic fire consumed man and animal alike - ashes to ashes, alpha to omega. One-hundred and sixteen years since the Vault Dweller left V13 to find a water chip. Thirty-five years since the Chosen One departed from tribal Arroyo to find a cure for their famine. 2277 is when your journey begins, just beyond the door of Vault 101...You are the Lone Wanderer, child of James and Catherine, two residents of the Capital Wasteland in the late twenty-third century. You've lived your whole life in Vault 101 with your father. Educated by a long-dead company of a long-dead nation. You don't even know what it looks like outside. But when your father leaves unexpectedly and the whole Vault turns on you, the Wasteland becomes your new - and only - home.So now you're gonna find out what has been kept from you all your life.- -Hey! Be sure you have Games For Windows Live installed on your PC, otherwise Fallout 3 will not run. Even though GFWL isn't supported anymore, it includes a file that Fallout 3 searches for on start-up. Without this, it will crash before loading fully.Fallout 3, the title of the Fallout franchise that brought it back from the swampy depths of point-and-click and issued the title a new life as a first-person RPG. It takes the original grit and grime and hilarity of Fallout 1 and 2 and tries to implement it into a totally new world, to varying degrees of success, but stands as a proud GOTY from Bethesda Game Studios for no bad reason.Being a Bethesda title, Fallout 3 plays much like any other Bethesda game. Oblivion, Skyrim, and of course New Vegas. Floaty controls with problematic UI layered with comfortable RPG elements and a semi-unique targeting system that makes up for the horrendous gunplay.Again, though, Bethesda excells at worldspace design and creates an attractive landscape to look at, but oddly fails to capture a fun landscape to play in. DC is annoyingly traversed by underground subway tunnels, and the rest of the wasteland is empty and bland. Some landmarks are enjoyable, like the Washington and Lincoln Memorials, while the Capitol Building is unfortunately a simple combat center with no real rewards.Combat is bad. Not as floaty and slow as Oblivion, but nowhere near as responsive and dangerous as New Vegas at lower levels. Guns seem to lag after the fire command is given, melee is low-damage and unresponsive, and unarmed is neglected in all fronts. Enemies become bullet sponges as the player levels up, which causes the already slow combat to drag on. New Vegas' redeeming inclusion of a wide variety of weapons is sorely missed here, too.Fallout 3's story is decent but tired. Unlike other Fallout games, there's little-to-no choice of faction and only one major choice in the outcome of the story. There are some side-quests, of course. They usually are unique and interesting - ""You Gotta Shoot 'Em In The Head"" being one that comes to mind - but there are not very many. While this all might comparably make Fallout 3 seem the worst of the Fallout line-up, it is still a fun experience to ride through.There are two major factions in the game, the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave. Both are branches of west coast goliaths featured in Fallout 1 and 2. The player takes the side of the BoS for almost all of the story, even while given options to betray them. The Enclave hold their same goal of eradication of all 'mutants,' or everybody that isn't one of them. The BoS takes a much more humane approach to the local wastelanders than their western counterparts. Both factions are trying to take control of Project Purity, a water decontamination mission housed in the Jefferson Memorial spearheaded by two local researchers, James and Catherine.The plot revolves around the player's character, the Lone Wanderer, a Vault dweller out of 101 in search of James, their father, who has left without giving reason or getting permission. Aside from the Vault now not wanting a criminal's child, the Lone Wanderer must leave 101 to learn why their father has left. This story collides with the Brotherhood's mission in the wasteland just before the Enclave reveal themselves, and so begins the conflict.Fallout 3 hosts a variety of unique characters, both inconsequential and companion type. The regular NPCs are mostly unfortunate in both writing and voice acting, being either unbelievable or ear-grating, a particular Moira coming to mind. Companions are generally more tolerable, with Dogmeat - a long-standing icon of Fallout - returning. Most companions rely on the game's Karma system, some refusing to serve or leaving the player's service should this level change too much.Karma is the game's way of keeping the player's actions in track, rating them as 'evil,' 'neutral,' or 'good.' This effects companions, some quests, perks, and other elements of gameplay. It is affected by stealing, murdering, donating, and finishing quests.Being a Bethesda RPG, the game gives the player the chance to create their own character. Looks is what is obviously thought of first, but being part of the Fallout series, SPECIAL stats are all customizable and have the largest impacts on the choosable perks, which take the roll of traits and perks from older games, and skills.Perks are bonuses for the player character chosen on level-up while skills are a 0-100 rating of the player character's ability with everything from guns to medicine to bartering. These work in tandem to let the player develop a unique experience for themselves through their characters.I personally didn't like Fallout 3 as much as the original Fallout or Fallout New Vegas, and updating this now I feel I enjoyed Fallout 4 even more. But it's a solid game without the Fallout branding, just somewhat derivative and poor on the shooting aspect. My hours played in comparison to NV and 4 should reflect this.Get it on sale!- -Because this is the full-package GOTY edition, I'll also review the DLC here.Broken SteelBroken Steel allows the player to continue playing after the main story ends, seeing the results of their choice at Project Purity and learning that the Brotherhood of Steel may not be totally made up of just causes. It adds a few more hours of quests and minimally connects to New Vegas and 4.Good if you think you'll be playing the game for a while, or if you have the other DLC and finish fast.Mothership ZetaMothership Zeta is a semi-decent throwback to campy sci-fi films of the 1950s, taking the player aboard an alien spacecraft with a ragtag crew of other abductees in combat with their alien captors.Get Old World Blues for New Vegas over this. It has no aliens, but is better at the same theme.The PittAn adventure to the remains of Pittsburgh, now operated by Ashur and a civilization of slaves, with a plan to rebuild America's infrastructure, but plagued by a mysterious sickness that mutates anybody who stays in the city.A very different feeling from the rest of Fallout 3. Much grittier, but a slow grind otherwise.Point LookoutMetaphysical journey to Point Lookout State Park, Maryland, heavily laden with a mysterious cultist overtone while focusing on a single conflict straight out of James Bond. A swampy, chilling environ lends nicely to the overall feeling of a dreamstate, and history plays into all of the quests bigtime.Probably my favorite DLC for F3, though certainly slower than the others.

												Fallout 3 is a wonderful open world game that only realizes it's full potential when heavily modded.  To get to to run properly on Windows 7 x64 without crashing at startup or upon loading a new game I had to:1. Add the following line to the Havok section of the fallout.ini:iNumThreads=22. Install and run FOSE (http://fose.silverlock.org/download/fose_v1_2_beta2.7z) instead of the Fallout exe, and install the New Vegas Anti Crash plugins( it works for Fallout 3 as well as New Vegas, and the Dl link is http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635/?)The GFWL Disabler (http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/1086/?) might also help, and enabling the 4GB flag on the game's executable should reduce crashes if using 2K HD retextures like NeilMB. ENBoost could help as well.For modding the game, a good base to start is: http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3Improved textures, more weapons, more enemies, better lighting, new houses and companions, more interiors, increased difficulty...It will take at least a day to download and set all of those mods up though.

												the first fallout game i played, Fallout 3 incredible main story, awsome side quests, and massive nonlieniar atmosphiric open world make this one of the best games i've ever played. After playing both new vegas and fallout 4, i found that in terms of story, atmosphere ,and side quests, fallout 3 is the clear winner dispite in my opinion not being as overall good as fallout 4 (but still 500x better then new vegas, seriously i have no idea what obsidian was thinking when they implemented ceasars legion or thought that the game had an acceptable main quest.) The only true flaw i find in fallout 3 is the actual writing and dialoge that goes with its incredible story, at times its has that nice simple feel to it that might remind you of dialoge beween saturday morning action cartoons (childish, but at the same time awsome,) other times it just is downright childish and rather lazy (seriously, one of the many ways to kill the main villan is to convince him that he is insane, and he just kills himself, yeah its very hard to pass the speech check, but its still rather silly way to destroy a rather awsome villian.) Overall fallout 3 is a gameing masterpeice, combining rpg elements from the first 2 games with (at the time of its relese) modern fps mechanics to bring a new standard to the fallout franchise, a standard that set the foundation for fallout new vegas and Fallout 4.

												It has been a while since I have actually sat down for a playthrough, however the times that I have were unforgettable moments. This game admittedly has a fairly short campaign once the player is aware of the certain courses that need to be taken; this does not limit replayablility, however. Although the campaign itself is fairly short and straightforward, the gameplay is a whole separate story. With Hub locations across the map, several factions to join, as well as a myriad of perks to choose from as the game progresses, different quest outcomes based on your responses, and a wealth of quests included in the main campaign, side campaigns, quests in add-on packs, as well as the occasional single side mission.  There was never really a dull moment for me in this game. Occasionally the game will minimize with no hope of re-opening, but I am also running on Windows 10, which is a fairly easy scapegoat at this point.  I only have 73 logged hours, but I have so many uncounted hours within my Xbox playthroughs (I happened to acquire that version for free) and I have fallen in love with the game and franchise.  This game will not disappoint.  I give this game 10 Bobbleheads out of 10.			"

												Pain to set up worth only getting if you really love the fall out series. I played New Vegas before this and it was an improvement on this i have to say. My Dad is Liam Nesson so he is Quai Gon Jin, Raj Ah Gaul, Taken my daddy i will find you and i will kill you. Alot of the times people like the first fallout they play because that's where they made all their memories with the game. But i gave this game a fair go and i have to say the slightly minor improvements such as proper ads in NV made the game much more fun an enjoyable because i could actually hit things despite having bad aim. GOTY Edition is worth it because the dlc's add so much more even tho i don't think i can be bothered to finish the game because if i do i would still be writing this review. If you want to play a Fallout and you don't have the money for 4 play NV. If you have time to play both fallouts play 3 and then New Vegas. Fallout 3 had a better storyline and some better quests than NV. 8/10 Press Vats to Kill			"

												I'm honestly not a huge fan of Fallout 3. I see why people like it, but after multiple tries, I still can't get into the game.Combat is very clunky, the pacing is very slow and drawn out, movement is slow, and it just bores me. I've tried to keep pushing to complete the game, but it is very boring to me. I see why people like it: It's a huge world, with lots of characters and quests, but I just don't feel like it is fun. However, I will still try to keep playing it to see if I can get into it.EDIT: I have sunk a long amount of time into this game, and let me tell you, the game gets a lot better. The pacing is still kind of odd in my opinion, and at some points the game feels very slow, but after playing for a while, I really do enjoy it, and I can't wait to play it again.			"

												I was always one for dystopia and post-apocolyptic games! Sadly, there wasn't many I had known of at the time. Thats until I saw the trailer for a game called ""Fallout 3"". I was like: OHHHHH MAHHH GOSHHH! FALLLOUTTTTTTTTTTT! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKKKKKKKKKK! My dad and I bought the game about two years later and it exceeded my  expectations! Now, of course I was like 7, so I had no idea what I was doing. I also died to the first radroach I saw in the game HAHAHAHA! When I got, older I replayed it and seen things that I haven't seen before. Probably because I would like punch everything in the game when I was younger. LOGIC! But not the point! For any of those people who wanted to play Fallout 4 like I did, I would suspect that you would have upgraded to Windows 8 or Windows 10 also, right. Thats where the problems come in! The newer windows don't allow Fallout 3 and New Vegas to be played! But WHY! I think Microsoft should fix this problem. This is a wonderful game too, so I can't wait untill it will be adressed and fixed! Besides that, it is still a great game even if it is starting to age. I give this game 10 Nicolas Cages riding Yao Guais!			"

												A fantastic RPG from the best makers of RPGs.  Fallout 3 is a masterpiece, and anyone who is a fan of RPGs will love it.*Note: Don't be fooled by my steam hours, I have WAY more console hours.*Gameplay - 8.5/10:The combat is really good, but don't expect it to be like a regular FPS.  It's a lot more tedious and rewarding.  The V.A.T.S. system is great and makes the combat unique from other RPGs and shooters.  It would have gotten a 10/10, but the stupid zoom in feature can get quite irritating.  Since you can't aim down your sight, you just end up looking down your hipfire a little more.  And sometimes it barely even zooms!  The interactions are good, like persuasion and bartering.  Within the gameplay, you will also have to make certain choices.  These choices vary from good to evil, and let me tell you, they can get pretty sickening.Atmosphere - 8/10:Bethesda truly creates a weird, yet richly crafted world.  The whole 50s vibe clashing with the nuclear apocalypse is awesome!  Post-apoctalyptic Washington D.C. looks good, but it is a pain in the neck to get around in.  And the wasteland, while being a fun place to wander, can sometimes feel empty a lot in areas.Class/Leveling System - 9/10:If you are familiar with any pre-Skyrim Bethesda games, you know how the class/leveling system works.  It's very well structered and it truly gives you the freedom to make your own character in the wasteland.  Oh, and the karma is a great system also!Story - 8.5/10:For a Bethesda game, the story is a 10/10, but compared to some other RPGs, it gets an 8.5/10.  This is the best Bethesda game story-wise, and it is quite interesting.  You end up searching down your father after he left the vault that you grew up in, and the story really has meaning.  With the sidequests, I was really impressed.  Each of them had a unique theme and some had twists and turns.  I really felt like I was making a difference with some of these side quests.  The only side quests that sucked was Moira Brown's.  Nobody wants to help make your stupid book, Moira!Verdict:I give Fallout 3 a strong 9/10.  It truly is a great game and is a must own for anyone who enjoys RPGs or post-apocalyptic themes.  Bethesda created a gem of a game with this, and I can't wait for Fallout 4!Also, I have Windows 7.  No problems on my end.  And even if there are for you, there are many ways to fix them.  Just google it. "

												This is absolutely the best RPG in existence. This game is a must buy and the DLC is well worth it. I love fallout and had bought it for the xbox in 2010. On a steam sale i shelled out another 10 dollars and bought it again, to fall in love with the game play all over again. This is a humorous and thrilling free roam RPG that is a must buy.NOTE: do NOT activate Windows Live because it crashes the game randomly and frequently!			"

												One of the best Post-Apocalypse game universes you will ever have the fortune (or misfortune) to be in. Set in the late 23rd century (With a 1950s era vibe). Welcome to the Capital Wasteland (previously known as Washington DC, USA)... One of the best RPG's you will ever play. This is a Bethesda game, expect bugs/crashes. It happens with ALL of their games... Even Oblivion/Skyrim.You can also add hundreds (even thousands if you love overkill) of mods to the game to change pretty much everything. It's so easy to make mods for!			"

												I remember when my father brought this game when it first came out. I was playing C&C tiberium wars, GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City. That was all I would play, when my father brought this game I basically fell in love with it. I remember watching him play thourgh the missions and explore various locations from vaults to bunkers to destroyed buildings. All the while I was completely phazed by the shear opportunity this game has to offer. I remember playing myself I was using power armor and gatling lasers, miniguns, tesla armor and just murdering the ♥♥♥♥ out of super mutants, Enclave and just about anyone who ♥♥♥♥ed with me. I will give this game a 10/10 because it expects nothing but gives so much.			"

												While FO3 might not retain all the story-like details of its predecesors, it definitely has a feeling that integrates perfectly with the Fallout universe. The desolate ruins of what once was a power center give you a good image of how ravaging the human thirst for blood and destruction can be.Don't be fooled by the old graphics or the bugs the game has - you will love the game. And the modding community took into its caring hands to make of a good game a brilliant one.What can a new player expect? Hours and hours of addicting exploration, looting, shooting, killing, blowing up and generally, the wet dream of the scavanger. You will run around, get lost, shoot raiders, talk to strangers, loot, repair, search chests and desks, gaze at the sky, fear the darkness and forge alliance with the most unlike of the people. You can be the shining light of the Wasteland, a beacon of sanctity and a symbol of all that's hollier out there. OR, you can be the worst of the scum, the embodiment of evil, slaving and killing left and right. You can just go alone, re-enact the Lone Wanderer's path. Or, bring friends and shoot stuff together like a happy fellowship!There are, of course, downsides. There isn't much to the main story - it's has a definite mass effect feeling to it. But who comes to Wasteland to play the main quest? You came for the loot and the fights, for all the stories they can make.There are bugs, of which the worst is the CTD. Something unavoidable... but you can get over it and, with a bit of care, achieve a almost stable game that will let you play for hours.All in all, get this game. It's a classic by now, and the low price screams ""get me, get me!""			"

												An old classic, but still as fun as when it was released; from the backstory to the combat, to the interactions, whether it's the Brotherhood of Steel or the Children of Little Lamplight.I loved every second and played it over and over. Whether you play as someone with good karma, evil, or even keep it neutral, it's always different, and always fun. Megaton or Tenpenny?While it's not as diverse as New Vegas, or as customisable as Fallout 4, it's a place to start. Besides, Fallout 3 is like the origin story for so many characters, and is referenced so many times. It's good to know where they come from, isn't it?			"

												Coming back to this game after putting 800 hours into fallout 4, i gotta say, this is a much superior game. Yeah, maybe the graphics and the gunplay isn't as good but as following, these are the things i felt excelled in fallout 3. The roleplaying/character development, skill system, the dialogue (in which skill checks play a part in which makes the skill system and character development feel much more...'rich'), the repair system which fits well into the post apocalyptic feel and is one of the things i greatly missed in fallout 4. Being able to actaully visibly see your holstered weapon (another thing i grealy missed). The enemies, i loved the super mutants and the feral ghoul, while in fallout 4, the super mutants felt...goofy and the feral ghouls felt cartoonish. The guns...(looking at you combat rifle, combat shotgun, and assault rifle from fallout 4). The vaults, the characters, the towns, the scary subway tunnels, the atomsphere, and generally, the world.I could go on and on but then i would just be nitpicking at fallout 4. Now i may be biased because of nostalgia but here it is....my evil....evil nostalgic filled opinion.For the people who are thinking about buying this game but have a windows 7 or 10 computer and are worried this game won't work. You just have to disable the built in ""games for windows live"" (wish bethesda removed this in the first place) by downloading ""fallout 3 script extender"" (just google it). fallout 3 also has issues with running on processors with 3 or more cores which you can fix by downloading ""UPDATED Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch"" (again just google it, it fixes over a 1000 bugs in the game so doesn't hurt to get it either way). Now before installing these two, make sure you start up fallout 3 at least once to the start up menu where it will auto assign your settings (low, medium, high, ultra etc.). Make sure you set the resolution setting to your native resolution (it doesn't set it automatically for some reason).Another warning if you're trying to play this game off of a integrated graphics card it will cause some issues. Crashes etc, in which you can probably find a fix on the internet.Hope this helps =)			"

												     If you never played a Fallout game before, try the original Fallout before picking this up.  Whether you enjoyed the first or not, and whether you tried the second as well, then see how long you can last playing this mess of a game.     I'll admit, when I first picked it up, I enjoyed it immeadiately, and binged it for hours.  It is quite a bit of fun, if not stupid fun.  As you play on, you begin to realize how loosely the story and world of the game is held together.  The plot is nonsensical, the characters are cliche as hell, there are strictly two sides (black and white of course) to the story, the weapons are uninspired and bland, and they, to say it in a juvenile fashion, feel like sticks with♥♥♥♥♥♥on the ends of them.  Not to mention the game's enviornment is spotty and dull.  That green tint can get ♥♥♥♥ing old quick, and oftentimes, you will have no idea where you are until you take a gander at the map.  It's like Bethesdashit just made a basic desert world on a piece of paper, tacked it to the wall, and threw a ♥♥♥♥-ton of darts at it to denote where they would put places, events, towns, and so-on.  No rhyme or reason as to where anything is.        This game also suffers from the same problem that a lot of Bethesdacrap games have, such as very poorly made animations, weapons that feel like cardboard sticks or airsoft guns, ugly as sin character models, a strong lack of voice actors to compensate for the vast amount of ""unique"" characters in the game, no vareity in clothing, and broke leveling mechanics.  Di I say the story makes no sense when you look at the big picture?  It's as if a pre-teen fanfic writer smoked some pot and wanted to make a Fallout story.       Despite these shortcomings, I rate the game a 4/10 for having a small amount of replayability, a vision that shines through the cracks of caked-on♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a very nostalgic and memorable soundtrack (not the terrible and generic OST created for the game, I'm talking about anything that plays on Galaxy News Radio, and not Three-dog's annoying vocal-chord vibrations he calls a voice).       Once you trudge through the wasteland, play every DLC (if you didn't max out your character's level by the end of the game) minus Mothership Zeta for something different, and then high-tail your♥♥♥♥♥to the Mojave in Fallout New Vegas, which in my opnion, is the true Fallout 3.  Do NOT skip this game if you intend to jump into New Vegas!  If you play this first, you will enjoy it a tad, and it will allow you to enjoy New Vegas a lot more due to the problems it fixes and the soul it has to offer.  If you play New Vegas first, you will not enjoy Fallout 3 at all, making both games seem kind of dull and leaving a bad taste in your mouth.  Just pray that Bethesdick collaborates with the guys behind New Vegas on the next Fallout.			"

												Good storyline, decent graphics, it's an open world game with a lot of variety and extra quest, the only flaw is the combat system, it's ment to be a turn based system, however it dosen't work well with the overall gameplay, it feels terrible and slow, the AI's combat is also unresponsive and slow, but since most of the combat is long or mid distance it dosen't really matter that much.

												I'm just getting my review out there now—I'm also one of those typical players who hasn't even made any progress since I [left the Vault and became a wanderererere going all over the place]I also decided I would review this game, as I've selected it for the 2016 Steam Awards; in the 'Game within a Game' category. Though, looking past what you might be thinking—the text-based game inside of Hubris Comics—this is obviously a game about harsh survival; in an even harsher, post-apocalyptic world with an amazing backstory to it [I can assume, as I've forementioned that I haven't made any progress with the game's story]It's a personal story for me, the idea of a 'Lone Wanderer'—a hero among the world that's left. It's amazing, and just so facinating to me. And the Karma aspect of the game really enhances the experience for us gamers, and there are way too many games out there nowadays that restrict you into playing a set character profile and stuff [looking at you, Fallout 4]. Sure, there aren't that many options in this game where you can customize your character, but, with the kind of game this is, you don't need to be a loud-mouth, drunk-off-your♥♥♥♥♥kind of guy/girl, or whatever. You can either be a hero or a villain; silent, at that.Anyway, the 'Game within a Game' comes from nowing how to survive out there. Yes, I know it's a game, and you can just reoad your last save if you screw up, but I'm one of te few who NEVER do that, because, as with real life, you can't just turn back time and forget about a bullet lodged in your shoulder, or a sledgehammer right to your skull. I love challenging myself like this: it makes the experience all the more real and authentic. In a war-torn land, you must do absolutely everything you can just to make it past a group of bandits. There are also too many recent games that rob the player of this particular experience—the true survival apect of a game. You might look at Fallout 3 and instantly compare it to something totally outlandish like Call of Duty 'Zombies' being the definition of hardcore, or Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode in Borderlands 2 [which actually is VERY challenging and rewarding], but for a game that has rightly earned a 'Game of the Year' tag, you need to try Fallout 3. It's one of the most authentic games from the last generation. ^w^			"

												Fallout 3 is definitely a good game, but whether or not you think it's one of the all-time greats will probably depend on whether you play it or New Vegas first. If you played New Vegas first, Fallout 3 will initially be a little bit of a letdown. New Vegas is definitely the better designed game overall. Better game mechanics, more options, more nuanced, and better overall design. Fallout 3 can sometimes feel like a generic FPS, with all of the ""closed space, tons of enemies, just keep attacking dozens of times and repeatedly using stimpaks"" design that you encounter in about a third of the map. That flaw doesn't really exist very much in New Vegas, so it can initially be offputting when you repeatedly encounter it in Fallout 3.However, if you played Fallout 3 first, you'll probably think it's one of the greatest games ever made. It was the first Fallout game that really showed that ""wow"" factor and hinted at just how great the franchise could be. Plus, you'll be really impressed by the one thing that Fallout 3 does better than New Vegas: emotion. In New Vegas, you are basically a mythic character, with little back story. You don't have that much in common with the NPC's, who are basically mere mortals while you are pre-destined to be a god. I mean, the game starts off with you shrugging off a point-blank shot to the head. The courier might as well come from a different planet than all of the NPC's. In Fallout 3, however, you really get emotionally pulled into the game. You're just an ordinary person who takes it upon themself to do great things. Your whole backstory is very fleshed out, and pretty heartrending. Karma plays a much bigger role in this game than in New Vegas, and makes the playing experience that much more immersive. Family plays a huge role, as do genuinely good NPC's such as Three Dog. The emotional depth of Fallout 3 is some of the best you will ever encounter in a game. If you played New Vegas first, you won't even realize that emotional depth was missing. If you played Fallout 3 first, you will be disappointed by New Vegas' lack of emotional depth, despite the fact that New Vegas is superior in pretty much every other way.In the end, you'll learn to appreciate each game for what it does best. You'll probably wind up preferring whichever one you played first, but you'll still really enjoy both of them. If you already have New Vegas and not Fallout 3, I definitely reccomend purchasing this, just be aware that you'll have to adjust your expectations a bit and look for different positives in this game than you found in New Vegas.PS.- Be sure to adjust some of the game files after you install the game. Once you do, the game seldomly ever crashes. Until you do that, it crashes every few minutes. See this thread for details, and also look up a fix regarding Games for Windows Live, which drastically affects the performance of Fallout 3: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2814142 "

												My stats are slightly confusing as they don't seem to count timing correctly. I must have played about 50-60 hours by now or so which is fair enough to make a review. As reference I finished the game once with a few side quests (about 30-40 hours, and made another build to do a casual powerrun which finished the game in 10-11 hours. Faster is possible obviously but you'd miss the entire idea behind the Fallout games if you did.Compared to New Vegas, Fallout 3 is a lot more straightforward as less speech options really determine how the game flows, however at the same time more survival/radiation build. You get less traces on your map, less evident companions, you're more left to yourself basically. Which is nice too, it's just different from New Vegas.Of course you'll always have Three Dog and a friendly reminder that not everyone wants to set the world on fire which is conforting in its own right.All in all, a very decent RPG game that I can fully advice to anyone.BTW, if you only have a dualcore but you have windows 7, the game will run just fine ;)			"

												This was my second playthrough. First time was in 2009. All told I think I have about 250+ hours into FO3. The first time through I was about 100 hours in before I finished the main story. This time I finished the main story in about 20 hours. I think it felt better this time to stay on track before going out and exploring the wastes. I mean, I needed to help my dad! Last time I was so distracted and I think I even forgot about helping him. This time I played on hard. It was a lot of fun, and way too easy after level 18 or so.. I still ended up always looting too much and being overloaded. Games with a lot of stuff to loot and keep track of really help me see my obsessive nature. This time I didn't use VATS so much, and I got to experience what a poor shooter the game is. The weapons suck and are always breaking. So early on I put all my skill points into repair skills. I loved having well-maintainted gear, and it made it easier to immediately make use of stuff that was loading me down.The Pitt was the most memorable for me.I felt so conflicted by the quest's ultimate decision. Am I wrong for choosing to side with the ex-brotherhood dude despite him enslaving people? I trusted his ultimate intentions, and his vision seemed more broad than the slave's. I supposed he could possibly have the means to carry out his intentions and that maybe the wastes would benefit. The slave seemed to be acting mostly out of anger, and he lacked information to tell me why I should help him. But.. He was a slave. I naturally wanted to help him.Mothership Zeta was maybe 10% interesting and the rest was just mundane and boring. And why where some of those alien dudes so so so tough? That was crazy.Operation Anchorage was nice because the simulator had blue sky.  The color was nice. The story was easy.Would I recommend a second playthrough?I don't know.. I had fun. But I think it was better back in the day. This time, I enjoyed more the way that I played it. The order of the quests made it much more interesting. "

												Great storyline. Have to admit, there's a REAL lack of diffrent weaponry which can make the game quite boring because you're using the same weapon from the beginning till the end. And there's a lack of diffrent armors too. But like I said great storyline. And the story is better then armor or weapons. And one other thing; Buy the game of the year edition. The standart one is quite boring.			"

												It's Fallout. That means you know 3 things right off the bat:1. The game will be beautiful, incredibly detailed, and rich in a way no other games can be.2. It's going to be insanely buggy, generally in a hilarious way.3. You already own it.Seriously, if you're even remotely interested in first person RPGs you already have this game. If you don't... Go get it. Seriously, it goes on sale pretty regularly and the Fallout games are solid gold.			"

												fallout 3 masters 3 of my most favorite things in video games, the gameplay is rediculously fun, the story is good, and the one thing i love most in games is the atmosphere and the atmosphere in fallout is amazing its just so great, fallout 3 is much like skyrim its very open world and has so much to do and the gameplay is similar but i consider this game better than skyrim, why because it masters  a greater story and cooler concept than skyrim, and this game is fun to replay, this game is very challenging to the point of where you truly need to conserve stimpaks and its not easy and they are very expensive, i can go on and on about how amazing this game really is though i will just shorten the review and give this game a 8.2/10 if you love first person shooters you will like this if you love zombies and nuclear war you will be addicted to this, if you like turn based then you will kind of like this, if you like a good story you will like this, if you like challenge look no further unless your looking for extreme raging challenge where there is no difficulty level then obviously just look at dark souls			"

												A player's experience in Fallout 3 is one that is different for every person. No two playthroughs will be the same. Unless... your just that type of person. I know your thinking ""Why should I listen to this jackass, he only has 7 hours logged on this game."" You are right to say that, but your also not. If you combine my time on the PC version, along side with my time on the xbox 360 and ps3 versions of the game, I've logged in around 400 hours. I am just now playing on the PC version because.. I just bought a PC! Fallout 3 takes you into the Capital Wasteland, a place that is mostly avoided despite it having such a lovely name. You are put in a chair and spun around untill your too disy to think, in a good way. You are literally born in the game, you then decide your gender, and your appearnce. You are then thrust in to the life eof an average child as you make your way from being in diapers, to your birthday party, and to taking you G.O.A.T which is a test that decides what position you will fill in the cault you live in when you grow up. This doesn't last long however when one day you wake up and chaos has struck. Vault 101 was your home, but it becomes a madhouse once your father escapes the vault. (No one's supposed to do that. Overseer's orders) This is now a madhouse that you try to escape in order to pursue after your father. Walking out of the vault and taking in the masssive view of the wasteland is breataking. You gaze among the surounding suburbs and the washington monument way in the distance. After you complete the breathtaking campaign, theres a total of 3 DLC's to extend you gametime. After you complete a DLC, you are free to return to the wastes with the treasures, and memories (both good and haunting) to use on your enimies you've made throughout your journey. If your wondering about the notice saying ""It's not compatible for windows 7 or later."" that's because it's not. The game won't literally work unless you fix it. And that's putting it lightly. The amount of steps you have to do really depends on what processor you have. If you have something such as an AMD (Which is what I have) You will have less steps than someone who has an intel processor. The lucky owner of an intel will have to do only a few more minutes worth of steps, but it's worth it in the long run. Saldy I can't find the video that helped me get my Fallout 3 working a week ago, so you'll have to find it yourselve's :/ Believe me, I looked for 20 munites jus now D: I would post all the steps, but sadly I don't remember them (There was that many)Fallout 3 is a must play, and deffidently belongs on all PC's gamers hardrive. This is truely on of the best games ever created.10 out of 10, would wasteland again.			"

												Hiking simulator and open world game!  This game is full of crap, literally. Seriously, there's crap everywhere and that's supposed to be the driving force of the immersion in the game.  You're supposed to collect this crap, apparently.  Early game is mildly taxing compared to late game, at which point you become an unstoppable force of maxed out in everything as per every single Bethesda game ever.  The game is also pretty polarized in regards to said morality, as well.  There are no hard choices.  The game copies the *VISUAL* sense of desolation from Fallout 1 well, but lacks the black humor in the writing, factions, music, voiceovers, and the quality of interactions between the PC and environment.  Fallout 1 was short and sweet.  This game is drawn out and full of crap, and not the high quality crap that filled up Fallout 1, 2, and New Vegas.  I don't regret playing this game for 50+ hours, but I don't exactly celebrate its release as game of the year.			"

												This is without a doubt one of the best RPGs I have ever played, tailing just behind Skyrim. Thought if you have newer (or just relevant) versions of Windows you will have to install some user made content to make the game run, the 30 minutes doing that is absolutely worth it, as this amazing game offers countless hours of content and an amazing open world that you can freely roam and help your fellow survivors. The campaign is the best in the series and is compelling as you play as the Lone Wanderer who leaves his vault and goes out into the wasteland to find his father and finish the goal his parents had created years before. All-in-all this is an amazing game that everyone deserves the chance to try. [CAN'T WAIT FOR FALLOUT 4]			"

												This game is like a baby, you raise it, care for it and let it suckle on the sweet taste of the radioactive wasteland. As you embark on your epic quest over a dream world you discover things about yourself that you never knew, for example: how much toilet water you can drink, how fast you can murder a town full of innocent, unarmmed civis. As well as these brutally glorius things you also find that little speck of goddness you have buird inside your dark heat (no emo), you get many choices in the sence of karma and well just being a♥♥♥♥♥or being a saint. Not only is the story line amazinballz because it gets you engrossed the DLCs are also worth all the moneh ever the world + 7. The DLCs are just extra fun with like 7 times the amount of fun because there are SLAVERS and ZOMBIE TINGS and LIBERTY PRIME and ofc the one the only....Operation Anchorage which if the baby of the wasteland. You think 'oh its a open world but a mmo like WoW' HEY YOU, YH YOU WHO SAID THAT GET A JOB FOOL. Anyway past that guy you should totally get this game and steam should give me some stuff cus i did such a amazining review yh.... ANYWAY super srs get this game if you enjoy open world games with a solid story and good♥♥♥♥♥DLCs.			"

												UPDATE: So after having not played this game for almost a year now, and having since upgraded to Windows 10 since the original posting of this review, I thought it would be a good idea to see if Fallout 3 is still broken. After downloading the game and its DLC, installing all of it, and then spending about 2 hours modding the heck out of it, I can safely say that Fallout 3 is running (at least for now) absoulutely flawlessly on my Windows 10 machine! I cannot overstate how awesome this is! This is by far and away one of my favorite games of all time, and I am SO happy that it is working on the newest hardware! What are you waiting for?! BUY THIS GAME ALREADY!Fallout 3 is one of the best video games of all time.  Fallout 3 is one of my favorite videogames of all time.  Fallout 3 is also extremely broken on anything above Windows XP.  It pains me to say this because I absolutely love this game!  (Ignore my hours played I have spent at least 200+ hours in this game on the Xbox 360 version as well as the PC version) I have had a myriad of issues with the PC version of Fallout 3 ever since I upgraded to Windows 8.  I have tried various things to attempt to fix the constant CTDs I receive when playing this game all to no avail.  If you happen to have a PC that is running Windows XP (I also hear that Windows 7 kinda works as well) then by all means you owe it to yourself to play this amazing game!  For anyone using Windows 8 or the newly released Windows 10, you have been warned.Despite not working on my Windows 8 PC, I feel like I can still recommend this game because of all the fun I've already had.  If Bethesda decides to patch this in the future then I will certainly be redownloading and replaying Fallout 3.TL;DRFallout 3 is prone to constant CTDs when being played on a Windows 8 PC.			"

												Awesome game one of the best RPG's ever made IMO. It will crash even after all the tweeks need to make it run on Windows 7 and later.It doesn't happen often but still more than your standard ""game"".Steam has my hours wrong. I'm at 69+ hours for my 1st run through. Play it now and get ready for Fall out 4!			"

If that doesn't help, check out the full guide I found (the link for ""Games for Windows Live"" is there as well). https://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/828937546147175081/ "

												If you are going to get this game for Windows 7 or 8.  Do know that it will not work for those operating systems. Though do not lose hope.  There is a way to get it to work for those as I have been playing it on Windows 8 the past few hours.  This is a very fun game and even better doing a playthrough with only 1 intelligence.  It has run smoothly.  This is a really good game.  If you do have Windows 7 or 8, then I recommend to use this to help make it compatible with your OS system http://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/864956555011164413/ "

												A player's experience in Fallout 3 is one that is different for every person. No two playthroughs will be the same. Unless... your just that type of person. I know your thinking ""Why should I listen to this jackass, he only has 7 hours logged on this game."" You are right to say that, but your also not. If you combine my time on the PC version, along side with my time on the xbox 360 and ps3 versions of the game, I've logged in around 400 hours. I am just now playing on the PC version because.. I just bought a PC! Fallout 3 takes you into the Capital Wasteland, a place that is mostly avoided despite it having such a lovely name. You are put in a chair and spun around untill your too disy to think, in a good way. You are literally born in the game, you then decide your gender, and your appearnce. You are then thrust in to the life eof an average child as you make your way from being in diapers, to your birthday party, and to taking you G.O.A.T which is a test that decides what position you will fill in the cault you live in when you grow up. This doesn't last long however when one day you wake up and chaos has struck. Vault 101 was your home, but it becomes a madhouse once your father escapes the vault. (No one's supposed to do that. Overseer's orders) This is now a madhouse that you try to escape in order to pursue after your father. Walking out of the vault and taking in the masssive view of the wasteland is breataking. You gaze among the surounding suburbs and the washington monument way in the distance. After you complete the breathtaking campaign, theres a total of 3 DLC's to extend you gametime. After you complete a DLC, you are free to return to the wastes with the treasures, and memories (both good and haunting) to use on your enimies you've made throughout your journey. If your wondering about the notice saying ""It's not compatible for windows 7 or later."" that's because it's not. The game won't literally work unless you fix it. And that's putting it lightly. The amount of steps you have to do really depends on what processor you have. If you have something such as an AMD (Which is what I have) You will have less steps than someone who has an intel processor. The lucky owner of an intel will have to do only a few more minutes worth of steps, but it's worth it in the long run. Saldy I can't find the video that helped me get my Fallout 3 working a week ago, so you'll have to find it yourselve's :/ Believe me, I looked for 20 munites jus now D: I would post all the steps, but sadly I don't remember them (There was that many)Fallout 3 is a must play, and deffidently belongs on all PC's gamers hardrive. This is truely on of the best games ever created.10 out of 10, would wasteland again.			"

												This was my second playthrough. First time was in 2009. All told I think I have about 250+ hours into FO3. The first time through I was about 100 hours in before I finished the main story. This time I finished the main story in about 20 hours. I think it felt better this time to stay on track before going out and exploring the wastes. I mean, I needed to help my dad! Last time I was so distracted and I think I even forgot about helping him. This time I played on hard. It was a lot of fun, and way too easy after level 18 or so.. I still ended up always looting too much and being overloaded. Games with a lot of stuff to loot and keep track of really help me see my obsessive nature. This time I didn't use VATS so much, and I got to experience what a poor shooter the game is. The weapons suck and are always breaking. So early on I put all my skill points into repair skills. I loved having well-maintainted gear, and it made it easier to immediately make use of stuff that was loading me down.The Pitt was the most memorable for me.I felt so conflicted by the quest's ultimate decision. Am I wrong for choosing to side with the ex-brotherhood dude despite him enslaving people? I trusted his ultimate intentions, and his vision seemed more broad than the slave's. I supposed he could possibly have the means to carry out his intentions and that maybe the wastes would benefit. The slave seemed to be acting mostly out of anger, and he lacked information to tell me why I should help him. But.. He was a slave. I naturally wanted to help him.Mothership Zeta was maybe 10% interesting and the rest was just mundane and boring. And why where some of those alien dudes so so so tough? That was crazy.Operation Anchorage was nice because the simulator had blue sky.  The color was nice. The story was easy.Would I recommend a second playthrough?I don't know.. I had fun. But I think it was better back in the day. This time, I enjoyed more the way that I played it. The order of the quests made it much more interesting. "

												I've finally got to play Fallout 3 and you know what? It is an amazing skydiving simulator! From an experienced skydiver and as someone who has played Fallout New Vegas I can say I don't miss the views of New Vegas as Fallout 3 has so many more places to view and skydive in, the level of detail that has went into this game is brilliant! Compared to the other games you can actually fail, not in the sense of not landing on target, but in the sense if you don't check your gear properly before hand it can fail! Really is a game I would recommend to people who are considering skydiving! I've startred using it for training at my work. For those of you who don't have the guts to jump from a plane, this will give you the experience without the danger! (Maybe put a fan on for wind and an oculus rift)Anyways, amazing game, I will give my review if I ever get to play Fallout 2, but I am worried this game has now spoiled me!			"

I loved having well-maintainted gear, and it made it easier to immediately make use of stuff that was loading me down.The Pitt was the most memorable for me.I felt so conflicted by the quest's ultimate decision. Am I wrong for choosing to side with the ex-brotherhood dude despite him enslaving people? I trusted his ultimate intentions, and his vision seemed more broad than the slave's. I supposed he could possibly have the means to carry out his intentions and that maybe the wastes would benefit. The slave seemed to be acting mostly out of anger, and he lacked information to tell me why I should help him. But.. He was a slave. I naturally wanted to help him.Mothership Zeta was maybe 10% interesting and the rest was just mundane and boring. And why where some of those alien dudes so so so tough? That was crazy.Operation Anchorage was nice because the simulator had blue sky.  The color was nice. The story was easy.Would I recommend a second playthrough?I don't know.. I had fun. But I think it was better back in the day. This time, I enjoyed more the way that I played it. The order of the quests made it much more interesting. "

												The landscapes are ugly and grey, the wastes are desolate and depressing, the music is dated and the art style old. Everything is as it should be. Other games in the Fallout series, to me, seemed a bit too inhabited for what they should be. They seemed too colorful and too re-established. Fallout 3 does a good job of mixing the overrun downtown setting with the empty, fire-swept forests of the DC area. I thought this wasn't as good as New Vegas, but still deserves its own merit. I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more if I hadn't fired up Operation Anchorage and gotten the best armor and weapons right away. All in all, however, I found the story a bit short-lived and rather disappointing. Apparently being a good guy and sacrificing yourself at the end is the wrong choice. I gave it a hard time, but everyone else seems to absolutely love everything about it. Go see what they have to say.TL;DR- great game, cliche story. Don't play the Operation Anchorage DLC until later on.			"

												  Even though my STEAM account doesn't show a lot of hours compared to other titles in my library Ihad a retail copy of this when it was released.. WAS great game, it just made action adventure games so much better. Probably contributed to the expectations of games today. NOT the only contributor, but a major one.  Graphics very outdated? Yes. BUT the game world is very detailed and full of character, ambiance, interesting locations and quests. If you like interesting characters and exploration and can overlook the outdated graphics I'd say there's a good chance you'll love this game. I don't play it anymore, because I played it long before the STEAM release.    "

												Fallout 3 is definitely a good game, but whether or not you think it's one of the all-time greats will probably depend on whether you play it or New Vegas first. If you played New Vegas first, Fallout 3 will initially be a little bit of a letdown. New Vegas is definitely the better designed game overall. Better game mechanics, more options, more nuanced, and better overall design. Fallout 3 can sometimes feel like a generic FPS, with all of the ""closed space, tons of enemies, just keep attacking dozens of times and repeatedly using stimpaks"" design that you encounter in about a third of the map. That flaw doesn't really exist very much in New Vegas, so it can initially be offputting when you repeatedly encounter it in Fallout 3.However, if you played Fallout 3 first, you'll probably think it's one of the greatest games ever made. It was the first Fallout game that really showed that ""wow"" factor and hinted at just how great the franchise could be. Plus, you'll be really impressed by the one thing that Fallout 3 does better than New Vegas: emotion. In New Vegas, you are basically a mythic character, with little back story. You don't have that much in common with the NPC's, who are basically mere mortals while you are pre-destined to be a god. I mean, the game starts off with you shrugging off a point-blank shot to the head. The courier might as well come from a different planet than all of the NPC's. In Fallout 3, however, you really get emotionally pulled into the game. You're just an ordinary person who takes it upon themself to do great things. Your whole backstory is very fleshed out, and pretty heartrending. Karma plays a much bigger role in this game than in New Vegas, and makes the playing experience that much more immersive. Family plays a huge role, as do genuinely good NPC's such as Three Dog. The emotional depth of Fallout 3 is some of the best you will ever encounter in a game. If you played New Vegas first, you won't even realize that emotional depth was missing. If you played Fallout 3 first, you will be disappointed by New Vegas' lack of emotional depth, despite the fact that New Vegas is superior in pretty much every other way.In the end, you'll learn to appreciate each game for what it does best. You'll probably wind up preferring whichever one you played first, but you'll still really enjoy both of them. If you already have New Vegas and not Fallout 3, I definitely reccomend purchasing this, just be aware that you'll have to adjust your expectations a bit and look for different positives in this game than you found in New Vegas.PS.- Be sure to adjust some of the game files after you install the game. Once you do, the game seldomly ever crashes. Until you do that, it crashes every few minutes. See this thread for details, and also look up a fix regarding Games for Windows Live, which drastically affects the performance of Fallout 3: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2814142 "

												Awesome game, period.I have put many hours into this game (more than what Steam says) and the ending cutscene (of the base game) always gives me the feels. The DLC is also great (even though they can be pretty though sometimes). While this game is great on it's own and has great mods for it, having FalloutNV and installing the TTW mod for it enhances the experience of playing through this game. At then same time If somebody asked me if they should buy Fallout 3 or Fallout NV, I'll tell them to get Fallout 3.Great game 10/10.			"

												Fallout 3 is a wonderful open world game that only realizes it's full potential when heavily modded.  To get to to run properly on Windows 7 x64 without crashing at startup or upon loading a new game I had to:1. Add the following line to the Havok section of the fallout.ini:iNumThreads=22. Install and run FOSE (http://fose.silverlock.org/download/fose_v1_2_beta2.7z) instead of the Fallout exe, and install the New Vegas Anti Crash plugins( it works for Fallout 3 as well as New Vegas, and the Dl link is http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635/?)The GFWL Disabler (http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/1086/?) might also help, and enabling the 4GB flag on the game's executable should reduce crashes if using 2K HD retextures like NeilMB. ENBoost could help as well.For modding the game, a good base to start is: http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3Improved textures, more weapons, more enemies, better lighting, new houses and companions, more interiors, increased difficulty...It will take at least a day to download and set all of those mods up though.

												I'm honestly not a huge fan of Fallout 3. I see why people like it, but after multiple tries, I still can't get into the game.Combat is very clunky, the pacing is very slow and drawn out, movement is slow, and it just bores me. I've tried to keep pushing to complete the game, but it is very boring to me. I see why people like it: It's a huge world, with lots of characters and quests, but I just don't feel like it is fun. However, I will still try to keep playing it to see if I can get into it.EDIT: I have sunk a long amount of time into this game, and let me tell you, the game gets a lot better. The pacing is still kind of odd in my opinion, and at some points the game feels very slow, but after playing for a while, I really do enjoy it, and I can't wait to play it again.			"

												the first fallout game i played, Fallout 3 incredible main story, awsome side quests, and massive nonlieniar atmosphiric open world make this one of the best games i've ever played. After playing both new vegas and fallout 4, i found that in terms of story, atmosphere ,and side quests, fallout 3 is the clear winner dispite in my opinion not being as overall good as fallout 4 (but still 500x better then new vegas, seriously i have no idea what obsidian was thinking when they implemented ceasars legion or thought that the game had an acceptable main quest.) The only true flaw i find in fallout 3 is the actual writing and dialoge that goes with its incredible story, at times its has that nice simple feel to it that might remind you of dialoge beween saturday morning action cartoons (childish, but at the same time awsome,) other times it just is downright childish and rather lazy (seriously, one of the many ways to kill the main villan is to convince him that he is insane, and he just kills himself, yeah its very hard to pass the speech check, but its still rather silly way to destroy a rather awsome villian.) Overall fallout 3 is a gameing masterpeice, combining rpg elements from the first 2 games with (at the time of its relese) modern fps mechanics to bring a new standard to the fallout franchise, a standard that set the foundation for fallout new vegas and Fallout 4.

												It has been a while since I have actually sat down for a playthrough, however the times that I have were unforgettable moments. This game admittedly has a fairly short campaign once the player is aware of the certain courses that need to be taken; this does not limit replayablility, however. Although the campaign itself is fairly short and straightforward, the gameplay is a whole separate story. With Hub locations across the map, several factions to join, as well as a myriad of perks to choose from as the game progresses, different quest outcomes based on your responses, and a wealth of quests included in the main campaign, side campaigns, quests in add-on packs, as well as the occasional single side mission.  There was never really a dull moment for me in this game. Occasionally the game will minimize with no hope of re-opening, but I am also running on Windows 10, which is a fairly easy scapegoat at this point.  I only have 73 logged hours, but I have so many uncounted hours within my Xbox playthroughs (I happened to acquire that version for free) and I have fallen in love with the game and franchise.  This game will not disappoint.  I give this game 10 Bobbleheads out of 10.			"

I have bought it, selled it and bought it again---several times. I can not get enough of this game... Uuuh, the love I have for it:') With hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play time on a large number of playthroughs. The longing for yet another playthrough is still within me---but I'm sick of going through the hassle yet again to get the game to run properly on PC.You have to literally mod the heck out of this game to get it to run smoothly, and that's not at all what I want to do (yet again). I look forward in due course to play a remastered 64bit version, one which would make the game run nearly flawlessly---fixing ~all errors, patching the game, make it as compatible as possible for PC---That's the dream.Please BETHESDA, hear my cry of distress!

												Reasons to play this game:> Get to blow up mutant cows> Your dad is Liam Neeson> Get to blow up a town cuz a rich guy on the other side of the map wants a view> It's Fallout> Liam Neeson> Bugthesda made it, so (despite the bugs) its content is rich enough to rebuild the Ethiopian Economy> Can tell that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hagrave kid in Rivet City that nobody loves him and he should run away then laugh your way to hell with the knowledge that he'll hate himself for the rest of his life and probably follow the homeless man everyone forgets to save and swan dive off a cliff somewhere> Can take drugs while sitting in a church and blow up my dog with a mini nuke, noone cares. But the minute I accidentally nick a bottle of scotch off a table in the Bar - everybody in town wants my head> Even the robotic janitor> What the ♥♥♥♥ > Liam Neeson again> and this time his family's chasing himI can't think of anything else, it's really great thoughBasically 11/10ALSO it DOES work on windows 10, or at least its possible to get it working*chucks this at you* http://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/828937546147175081/Just look at that			"

												I'm just getting my review out there now—I'm also one of those typical players who hasn't even made any progress since I [left the Vault and became a wanderererere going all over the place]I also decided I would review this game, as I've selected it for the 2016 Steam Awards; in the 'Game within a Game' category. Though, looking past what you might be thinking—the text-based game inside of Hubris Comics—this is obviously a game about harsh survival; in an even harsher, post-apocalyptic world with an amazing backstory to it [I can assume, as I've forementioned that I haven't made any progress with the game's story]It's a personal story for me, the idea of a 'Lone Wanderer'—a hero among the world that's left. It's amazing, and just so facinating to me. And the Karma aspect of the game really enhances the experience for us gamers, and there are way too many games out there nowadays that restrict you into playing a set character profile and stuff [looking at you, Fallout 4]. Sure, there aren't that many options in this game where you can customize your character, but, with the kind of game this is, you don't need to be a loud-mouth, drunk-off-your♥♥♥♥♥kind of guy/girl, or whatever. You can either be a hero or a villain; silent, at that.Anyway, the 'Game within a Game' comes from nowing how to survive out there. Yes, I know it's a game, and you can just reoad your last save if you screw up, but I'm one of te few who NEVER do that, because, as with real life, you can't just turn back time and forget about a bullet lodged in your shoulder, or a sledgehammer right to your skull. I love challenging myself like this: it makes the experience all the more real and authentic. In a war-torn land, you must do absolutely everything you can just to make it past a group of bandits. There are also too many recent games that rob the player of this particular experience—the true survival apect of a game. You might look at Fallout 3 and instantly compare it to something totally outlandish like Call of Duty 'Zombies' being the definition of hardcore, or Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode in Borderlands 2 [which actually is VERY challenging and rewarding], but for a game that has rightly earned a 'Game of the Year' tag, you need to try Fallout 3. It's one of the most authentic games from the last generation. ^w^			"

												I got bullied often in an underground vault, by these guys that like to call themselfs the tunnel snakes.They even bullied me on my birthday. I was so sad. It ruined the whole thing for me. My dad got me a bb gun, and I kept it since I was 18.I woke up one morning, and that's when everything happened. My dad just left the vault. Everyone was going crazy.This hot chick tells me ""Come on, you've got to get up!"" so I get up.She tells me my dad escaped the vault. She hands me a gun, with some bullets and tells me to screw off and go find my dad. In the process, I run into my childhood bully. He is begging me to save him mom. I tell him to f*** off. I tell him his moms done for. He calls me an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I pull out my gun.

												Looking back, I am honestly surprised as to how much time I spent in Fallout 3 considering the amount of cheating I did with the console for lols.Now, I did not play this game back when it came out, in fact I first played this after playing Fallout 4 on the PS4. I can see why people loved this game so much, and it will have a special place in my heart, however there was some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttery to get through.I first got this game during a summer sale, when I was still using a laptop with integrated graphics. The amount of pain and suffering I had to do to make Fallout 3 work, while in retrospect not much, but I spent minimum 10 hours googling solutions. That aint right. Half the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t was with the game not launching if you do not have Games For Windows Live, the other half is the incompatibility with integrated graphics and windows 8.1 and 10. Once I managed to make it work on my laptop, I had a blast. When I made my PC and attempted to play this game, I had the old batch of problems, a whole NEW batch of problems because of windows 10 issues, and crashing whenever I exited the game or used the ingame steam overlay. I mean, I have played older games with no problems but Fallout 3 chooses to be one? Does not add up in my mind. Once I managed to get through all the problems however, it was a really enjoyable experience. Buyer Beware, THIS GAME WILL MAKE HEADACHES AT FIRST.Now on to the review:Pros-The Roleplaying And Development Of The Protagonist Was Fun-Wandering Around Killing♥♥♥♥♥♥Felt Awesome-The Atmosphere, While Gray And Drab, Was Spot On For A Post War World-The Little Stories Here And There Were Intriguing, And Made Me Think About Them For A Long Time-CharmCons-Initial ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-Voice Acting Could Have Been More Varied-The Main Story Was.... Meh-The Shooting Mechanics Are Horrid-Ending Feels Off Without The DLC Broken SteelThere is a lot more to it, but I would give it a 7/10. Get it on sale, not full price			"

												Fallout 3. Immersive, intriguing, and badass. The story is one of the best stories in gaming. I find it to be just as good a story as BioShock. You may hear,""Oh it's just you tryna find your dad. It's really not that interesting."" To HELL with that. You need to actually expirience this game in order to truly and fully appreciate Fallout 3's story. Three issues I have with the game. Number one, the game will not work properly on Windows 7 or above. Now this CAN BE FIXED. If you cannot figure it out, message me because I want you to enjoy this game. Number two, the visuals are not impressive. This was to be expected with a huge open world RPG such as this. Like most other games, you can modify this game.  Taking the visuals to a whole 'nother level. It rivals SKYRIM and BIOSHOCK INFINITE. That said, you need a beefy graphics card to handle the visual mods. With advanced shaders, blue skies and better looking textures, this game looks phenomenal. I don't enjoy the fact that you have to modify the game to make it prettier, but what has to be done must be done. Having siad that, the game isn't unbearable vanilla. I said the visuals are not impressive, not that they are bad. Number three, Fallout has a reputation for being one of the BUGGIEST PIECES OF LOVELY♥♥♥♥♥♥ It isn't as bad as DayZ but the fact that the two can even be compared is saddening to me. Fortunately, most common and random bugs disappear when playing on pc. They occasionally occur and most are easy fixes. Most. Crashing is eliminated with a 4gb patch and stuttering is solved with a simple mod. At long last you can enjoy your childhood once more at 60fps (good graphics card) and no crashing as it did on console. I rate 10/10 vanilla on PC, 9/10 on console and with mods 11/10. I would recommend this game a million times if I could.			"

												the first fallout game i played, Fallout 3 incredible main story, awsome side quests, and massive nonlieniar atmosphiric open world make this one of the best games i've ever played. After playing both new vegas and fallout 4, i found that in terms of story, atmosphere ,and side quests, fallout 3 is the clear winner dispite in my opinion not being as overall good as fallout 4 (but still 500x better then new vegas, seriously i have no idea what obsidian was thinking when they implemented ceasars legion or thought that the game had an acceptable main quest.) The only true flaw i find in fallout 3 is the actual writing and dialoge that goes with its incredible story, at times its has that nice simple feel to it that might remind you of dialoge beween saturday morning action cartoons (childish, but at the same time awsome,) other times it just is downright childish and rather lazy (seriously, one of the many ways to kill the main villan is to convince him that he is insane, and he just kills himself, yeah its very hard to pass the speech check, but its still rather silly way to destroy a rather awsome villian.) Overall fallout 3 is a gameing masterpeice, combining rpg elements from the first 2 games with (at the time of its relese) modern fps mechanics to bring a new standard to the fallout franchise, a standard that set the foundation for fallout new vegas and Fallout 4.

												It has been a while since I have actually sat down for a playthrough, however the times that I have were unforgettable moments. This game admittedly has a fairly short campaign once the player is aware of the certain courses that need to be taken; this does not limit replayablility, however. Although the campaign itself is fairly short and straightforward, the gameplay is a whole separate story. With Hub locations across the map, several factions to join, as well as a myriad of perks to choose from as the game progresses, different quest outcomes based on your responses, and a wealth of quests included in the main campaign, side campaigns, quests in add-on packs, as well as the occasional single side mission.  There was never really a dull moment for me in this game. Occasionally the game will minimize with no hope of re-opening, but I am also running on Windows 10, which is a fairly easy scapegoat at this point.  I only have 73 logged hours, but I have so many uncounted hours within my Xbox playthroughs (I happened to acquire that version for free) and I have fallen in love with the game and franchise.  This game will not disappoint.  I give this game 10 Bobbleheads out of 10.			"

												Pain to set up worth only getting if you really love the fall out series. I played New Vegas before this and it was an improvement on this i have to say. My Dad is Liam Nesson so he is Quai Gon Jin, Raj Ah Gaul, Taken my daddy i will find you and i will kill you. Alot of the times people like the first fallout they play because that's where they made all their memories with the game. But i gave this game a fair go and i have to say the slightly minor improvements such as proper ads in NV made the game much more fun an enjoyable because i could actually hit things despite having bad aim. GOTY Edition is worth it because the dlc's add so much more even tho i don't think i can be bothered to finish the game because if i do i would still be writing this review. If you want to play a Fallout and you don't have the money for 4 play NV. If you have time to play both fallouts play 3 and then New Vegas. Fallout 3 had a better storyline and some better quests than NV. 8/10 Press Vats to Kill			"

												Fallout 3 is a wonderful open world game that only realizes it's full potential when heavily modded.  To get to to run properly on Windows 7 x64 without crashing at startup or upon loading a new game I had to:1. Add the following line to the Havok section of the fallout.ini:iNumThreads=22. Install and run FOSE (http://fose.silverlock.org/download/fose_v1_2_beta2.7z) instead of the Fallout exe, and install the New Vegas Anti Crash plugins( it works for Fallout 3 as well as New Vegas, and the Dl link is http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635/?)The GFWL Disabler (http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/1086/?) might also help, and enabling the 4GB flag on the game's executable should reduce crashes if using 2K HD retextures like NeilMB. ENBoost could help as well.For modding the game, a good base to start is: http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3Improved textures, more weapons, more enemies, better lighting, new houses and companions, more interiors, increased difficulty...It will take at least a day to download and set all of those mods up though.

												I'm honestly not a huge fan of Fallout 3. I see why people like it, but after multiple tries, I still can't get into the game.Combat is very clunky, the pacing is very slow and drawn out, movement is slow, and it just bores me. I've tried to keep pushing to complete the game, but it is very boring to me. I see why people like it: It's a huge world, with lots of characters and quests, but I just don't feel like it is fun. However, I will still try to keep playing it to see if I can get into it.EDIT: I have sunk a long amount of time into this game, and let me tell you, the game gets a lot better. The pacing is still kind of odd in my opinion, and at some points the game feels very slow, but after playing for a while, I really do enjoy it, and I can't wait to play it again.			"

I recommend playing this one first.Better yet, I recommend you play the first three games before even making that jump to true 3D.			"

												Honestly, this was my first game in the RPG genera, as I had not played any other RPG type games, and this title was recommended to me by a friend. It took me a long time to get used to it, as I based my videogame experience around the call of duty style, run and gun type action games. I dont know where this game has been all my life. This game consumed so many hours of my life on console, I felt kind of obligated to buy it on steam when I got the chance. It not only introduced me to my first RPG game, but the first game series that I spent countless hours exploring the lore and events. No game since captured my attention and hunger for exploration, role play, and overall immersion. I would recommend any RPG lover like myself at least give this game a try. You'd be doing the genera as a whole a huge disservice if you skip out on this title. Hands down a masterpiece. Hats off to bethesda :)			"

												  Even though my STEAM account doesn't show a lot of hours compared to other titles in my library Ihad a retail copy of this when it was released.. WAS great game, it just made action adventure games so much better. Probably contributed to the expectations of games today. NOT the only contributor, but a major one.  Graphics very outdated? Yes. BUT the game world is very detailed and full of character, ambiance, interesting locations and quests. If you like interesting characters and exploration and can overlook the outdated graphics I'd say there's a good chance you'll love this game. I don't play it anymore, because I played it long before the STEAM release.    "

Fallout New Vegas and Fallout IV have both come out since, but this one still has a compelling story and fun enough gameplay to make it worth a pickup - and you can probably get it at a very low price. Be sure to head over to Nexus Mods. There's a learning curve if you've never modded a game before, but its well worth it. Its like playing your favorite game again - for the first time.			"

												This is my favourite game of all time. I have hundreds of hundreds of hours on this game from both console and when I had it installed as a non Steam game and I will have hundreds of hours more having just reinstalled it through Steam after losing my old version in a new Windows install.This game is pretty broken without some tweaking, but once tweaked it is well worth the effort and I found the DLCs to be enjoyable and a good value. I love the setting in this game and can just happily get lost for hours wondering DC.The game of course really comes into it's own after you've made your tweaks and start to install some of the many hundreds of excellent mods out there for this game, ranging from the smallest changes to huge DLC scale additions. There are a ton of guides and hidden gems to find which will teach you about the best way to tweak the game and install mods and after spending many (or few) boring hours reading and collecting your mods you will see for yourself that it is well, well worth it.This game is better now than it has ever been and a few hours invested in setting it up (I know this sounds horrible*) will really pay off.*You don't have to spend this long if you don't want to but to become really well informed on how to tweak and mod Fallout in an efficient and stable way then it will take this long but it IS worth it as it will completely transform the game in nearly any way you want.

												Considering the age of this game, there is nothing new, innovative or otherwise interesting that I can say about this game that hasn't been said a million times before, so I'll keep it brief. This game is great. You should play it. Your friends should play it. Everyone you know should play it. Your dog should grow opposable thumbs and learn to play videogames just to play this one game. It's that good. I mean sure, running around a desolate wasteland looking for stuff to do isn't everyone's cup of tea. If you don't pay attention it can be hard to know what you're meant to be doing. It consistently crashes on my computer. It's buggy. But despite all that I'm reccomending the game. Why? Because it's that good. The story's good. The voice acting is a solid 8/10, the environments are lovingly - if drearily - crafted, the combat is well designed and intense, the exploration is genuine, the emotions are deep and the controls are intuitive. If you're on the fence, just get Fallout 3. Or wait until Fallout 4 comes out, then it'll probably be cheaper			"

												I own two copies for PC and one for PS3, hundreds of hours lost through several playthroughs over the years, all of which were worth it.Amazing open ended RPG with endless flavour of choices. You start out in the sealed Vault 101 from the post apocalyptic  where you've lived all your life until your dad, voiced by the amazing Liam Neeson, suddenly ups and leaves the vault into the wasteland. You decide to follow him. Now what you do in the DC wasteland is 100% up to you, have fun. Pros: Main story voice actingInteresting main story lineOpen gameplay optionsEndless of character customizationCharacter ProgressionFun radio system that tracks your actionsModding community keeps the game alive for PCCons:Repetitive minor questsShort DLC questsDLC story plots were a bit weakBecomes relatively easy after a certain point.NOT optimized AT ALL for Windows 7 and up (crashing, freezing, etc)... (can be fixed through tweaks and mods). However I can't fault Bethesda too hard for this, it's an older game and when I hear Microsoft I also hear BSOD by default so give them some slack for this.Pros definitely outweigh the cons, and if you're not afraid of getting your hands dirty with the modding community you can even make this relatively older game seem like a newer release as I feel it's still a fantastic game overall. 9.5/10			"

												The game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, but for some reason, all the hours I clocked in on this game are not being counted. It only counts the time on the launch screen. At least it's not crashing every one or two hours. :^)			"

												The game is awesome! Although, It did crash quite a bit during some areas... But I am running Windows 10 so I guess that's the price you pay. But they did put a ""Notice"" about it not being optimized for Windows 7 and later... But all in all one of the best games gaming has ever made... ""and war; war never changes"" "

												This is a wonderful game, the only problem? Well, for a completionist like me, you end up with so much money, stimpaks, ammo, etcetera, ectetera, that the biggest challenge in the game is trying to find a merchant that you haven't sold all your loot to.Also; the orig. ending sucks♥♥♥♥♥ You really need to get the GOTY edition.

												This is without a doubt one of the best RPGs I have ever played, tailing just behind Skyrim. Thought if you have newer (or just relevant) versions of Windows you will have to install some user made content to make the game run, the 30 minutes doing that is absolutely worth it, as this amazing game offers countless hours of content and an amazing open world that you can freely roam and help your fellow survivors. The campaign is the best in the series and is compelling as you play as the Lone Wanderer who leaves his vault and goes out into the wasteland to find his father and finish the goal his parents had created years before. All-in-all this is an amazing game that everyone deserves the chance to try. [CAN'T WAIT FOR FALLOUT 4]			"

												It's post apocalyptic mostly open world and it's pretty darn well done. (Warning) Fallout 3 does indeed have some technical issues with Windows 8 that you will probably have to work on to get it playing ""reliably"" on the operating system. The annoyance requires you to be a bit techie but this game is worth the effort once you get it playing.			"

												Tis a purrty nice open world rpg game, the second similar genre i played after skyrim, and honest to say i really loved the apocalyptic wasteland environment area they threw me in, the option of picking between different old fashioned rifle or advanced weaponry and the moral choices you make that affects your karma and such, i liked it. Companions are a thing in this game including a loyal dog that follows you around although the AI might be buggy sometimes and there would be random crashes occuring every now and then it's still an experience considering how old this game already is. This might be close to what would happen if a world war 3 would occur in real life with all the nuclear warfare and such that our neighboring military government is pumping out, hopefully not the case cause id just die on the spot considering how close my home is to some of those controversial countries, a hint: im in Asia, you catch the gist.

												I have spent much, much more time than indicated on Fallout 3; I often play with mods to help modernize the game a tad, and when I launch it through the mod manager, Steam doesn't log my hours for whatever reason.  I'm not going to write some massive, long review, I only want to say one thing.  The game is just a tad dated, as it did come out in 2009 on engine that was already beginning to show its age.  This doesn't mean it isn't fantastic, though; even without mods it is worth at least one playthrough for sure.The main reason I wrote this review is because yes, the game will not run on Windows 8 or older.  However, fixing it is extremely easy (there are many videos and steam guides to help with this) and shouldn't take longer than fifteen minutes tops, unless you don't know even know how to turn your computer on.  It isn't that hard, and this should not be responsible for dragging down the rating of such a fantastic game!!!			"

												The best game I have ever played and probably will ever have played, and that is not an exaggerated claim.I have so many lovely things to say about this game. I have bought it, selled it and bought it again---several times. I can not get enough of this game... Uuuh, the love I have for it:') With hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play time on a large number of playthroughs. The longing for yet another playthrough is still within me---but I'm sick of going through the hassle yet again to get the game to run properly on PC.You have to literally mod the heck out of this game to get it to run smoothly, and that's not at all what I want to do (yet again). I look forward in due course to play a remastered 64bit version, one which would make the game run nearly flawlessly---fixing ~all errors, patching the game, make it as compatible as possible for PC---That's the dream.Please BETHESDA, hear my cry of distress!

												Fallout 3 is a stellar game whose value is not diminished by the years that have passed. The game is tailored to your choices and personal playstyle, has an enormous and incredibly detailed map with endless exploration, a great main plot and plenty of meaningful and deep side quests, realistic AI and cities, more lore than you can handle, and is worth hundreds of hours of playtime. The game is an RPG, adventure, horror, FPS, survival, and open-world game rolled into post-apocalyptic masterpiece. 9.5/10			"

												An old classic, but still as fun as when it was released; from the backstory to the combat, to the interactions, whether it's the Brotherhood of Steel or the Children of Little Lamplight.I loved every second and played it over and over. Whether you play as someone with good karma, evil, or even keep it neutral, it's always different, and always fun. Megaton or Tenpenny?While it's not as diverse as New Vegas, or as customisable as Fallout 4, it's a place to start. Besides, Fallout 3 is like the origin story for so many characters, and is referenced so many times. It's good to know where they come from, isn't it?			"
