Early Access Review
								I remember when I first got this game, back in summer of '13. I had started out with nothing but the clothes on my back, some cash, and a rusty sword. First thing to do was to find some buddies to help, and so I went to the nearest town. In a tavern I met a short bald man (though we were all bald back then). His name was Dirt, and this was my new best friend. Dirt and I did some pretty bad things then, luring guards to get killed by starving bandits, and then stealing all of the gear. This changed when we both got a little close one fight, and got chased by bandits all the way into the entrance of town. There weren't enough men to hold them all back, so I went into a tavern to see if anyone could help. I found a huge man, named Vedi. Vedi was willing to help for a price, and after paying him he went out there with a rusty sword and killed 3 of the bandits before he passed out from blood loss, effectively saving the town.It was the three of us for a good, long time. We killed many a cannibal and a bandit, and soon enough came upon the idea to make our own outpost, a safe haven to keep us secure and resupply when the going got tough. There was a town nearby, so all we had to do was get a few materials here and there and after a week maybe it would be set. By this time all three of us were pretty decked out, myself having a good long coat, Vedi with a huge cleaver, and Dirt with a tricorn hat. Most cannibals were either afraid of us by this point, or dead, there wasn't much worry of our safety by now. We had almost finished the small base, with Vedi and I working on some some construction, so it was Dirt's turn to go get the materials. We had both finished our construction, and so had waited for Dirt to come back. A day had gone by, we were starting to get worried. By noon the next day, Vedi and I had decided to risk it and leave the base, to go see where Dirt had gone. The next town over must surely know where he went?We didn't even make it halfway across when we found him, laying on the ground. His hat and sword weren't far from him, and there were two dead bandits next to him. Incisions and cuts were all across his body, bones broken and blood everywhere. Vedi cried, I stared for a good long time, before getting his hat and sword. I walked to the nearest bandit encampment, which some members looked wounded, and slaughtered them all with Vedi, after he finally caught up.Time has passed since that day, and the small base we had thought of originally is now a bustling town, with nearly eight residents there, all dressed and ready to defend their home. These people are the best I could have asked for, and I still keep the tricorn hat as a symbol of office, with Vedi forgoeing his cleaver for that sword, as his symbol of guard captain. But as much as I love these people, and would die for them, they will never be that man whom Vedi and I came to know as our best friend.R.I.P. Dirt.10/10			"

								Hour 1: Ugh.. man... this one might be a refundHour 2: Yah... this is silly, running around in a low res desert, wierd glitches, just ain't a good game....Hour 3: I mean.. this is silly, running from more bandits, scrapping stuff...Hour 5: I've got to keep this unit together while they mine, I'll have my auxillaries patrolling,Hour 10: Jeez? It's been a whole RL day of this? This.. wierdly horrible game... wierdly.. amazing...Hour 20: My outpost lives on the edge of the sands and death, traders come now and then, but overall we maintain neutral relationsHour 25: I hope nobody visits me RL today, so that I don't get interrupted as my settlement flourishes in the wastlands.There you go. It's a tough start. It's an ugly start. It's a painful start. But every inch after that is pure glory.  If you ever loved squad based rpg, tactical fighting, (think semi-baldergate-esque) well this takes it and throws in crafting, slavery, factions, squads, crafting, and it looks like a whole lot more in the future. I understand that development has been slow on this game, so if you are not okay with Bugs / Early Access, then hold on for now. There are definitely bugs. Some of them F stuff up. None of them have stopped my constantly growing love/enjoyment of this game.AFAIK there is no story of any sort yet, it's left completely open world, open ended, create your own story.6/10 - Graphics6/10 - Sounds6/10 - UI9/10 - Gameplay10/10 - Replayability			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi is a game where you start off feeling small, incapable, and alone. From the get go, you are basically a nobody; just another face in the crowd, another cog in the machine, another meatbag for the grinder - but it's not what you are, but what you would rather be, and how you get there that makes this game enjoyable. The journey to the ultimate destination of your own choosing is where the fun lies. Will you be a lone trader, looking to accrue the greatest mountain of wealth the post apocalyptic world has ever seen? Or a wandering swordsman who hides their true strength to dispatch armies with relative ease? Perhaps a general at the head of your own personal body guard? Or the mayor of a little tiny village just beyond the next dune? Regardless of what your goal is, it is exactly that - yours.When I started playing Kenshi, the one thing that first struck me was the graphics. Relatively blocky, and a bit funny to look at in some cases, i.e.: buildings clipping in a sand dune, or walls built at unreasonable angles. But, I don't play a game for graphics; to me that's just a secondary benefit. What I'm after is the gameplay, and what I was in store for really put a smile on my face.My character started out in a small town on top of a mountain range. I could see another down off in the distance, and figured that I'd walk there after exploring this little fortress in the sky. Did I mention that the towns are more like fortresses? I didn't? Well, imagine a town surrounded by walls taller that the highest in-game building, with a group of 20 or so very heavily armed and skilled guards for it's protection. That's what constitutes a town in Kenshi. 'Relative' safety, but I'll get to that in a minute.Heading towards the other town, I noticed that a group of bandits had started charging up the hill at me. I thought, ""A group of bandits? Looks like fun, let's try out the combat!"" and to my astonishment, I was obliterated. Beaten to within an inch of death, bleeding out in the beating sun, unconscious. My stomach had taken massive damage, and one of my arms was pretty much useless. I had been surrounded, beaten up, and left for dead. And my assailants? Took off to raid the town. Luckily, the city guard switfly dispatched them, but I was left on the hill. So, fast forward about half an in-game day, and I limp back to town (of course, I looted those bandits that attacked me and left them for dead; take that!). After patching myself up sufficiently, I take to luring bandits to town to enjoy the fighting with the guards and levelling myself up.Now, speaking of levelling up, skills are sorted into multiple sections: dexterity, strength, the various weapon skills, just to name a few. You gain proficiency by performing the tasks. You get stronger by carrying heavy objects around, not by killing a few rats like some other games, but not like there's anything wrong with them. You develop your character through hard work and dedication. Want to become better at running? Take off your heavy equipment and do a few laps. Don't know how to swing your weapon? Engage a training dummy or another person for all that matters. Even your ability to widthstand pain can be increased. How? By losing. That's right, you are rewarded for losing. Those bandits didn't kill you when they had the chance? Sucks to be them, because now not only are you angry, but you're also more accustomed to the pain. The next time you see them, they may well be on the losing side of the fighting. Kenshi rewards you for survival and practice, much like the saying: whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.So back to my little tale to attempt to capture the game a bit more - After fighting a couple of fights with the city guard as backup, I tried luring a group of bandits back to the town only to my surprise - the guards at the gate weren't there. Either they left on a patrol, or were fighting another battle elsewhere, I had no time to check. The bandits were hot on my tail, and the only chance I had of survival was to either lead them away from town, or take refuge and hope to escape while they killed all the civilians. And in that moment, I saw a few brave men - shop guards - rush from the protection of their walls, and stop the bandits in their tracks. A bandit or two slipped by, and I gave chase. Unfortunately while I spent a good while fighting one, the other slayed an innocent civilian, and I was happy to see that the population count in the town had actually dropped. Protecting the towns actually has an incentive - no population = no trading. The bandits dispatched, the guards returned, and I resigned to head off towards that other town in the distance.Now, as I could see the town, it didn't seem far. Plus, I had enough gold to recruit a new person to my little gang of righteous corpse theives. With some new equipment, a little bit of extra knowledge of how the world works and a new companion, I set out for the town. I travelled for at least two in game days. Two. I saw the sun rise, and set, then rise and set again. Such is the scale of Kenshi - the world is an open sandbox (quite literally at this point - no grass, just sand and rocks), and things that look far off in the distance are far off. And as I mentioned before, zooming out - I became a speck in the desert. The only that that kept my position known was the damn name tag floating above my head.Kenshi may not be a game for everybody, but if you enjoy a bit of realism, and quite a bit of freedom, it may be worth it. It's still early access, which means that there are quite a lot of glitches, issues, bugs and crashes (I haven't encountered anything severe however), you may want to pass the game until it's more stable and developed decendant comes about. What appeals to me the most is actually two things: one, you are rewarded for winning, and are rewarded for trying. So long as you aren't dead, the game isn't over. It makes for one heck of a story if you keep little notes about what happens to your character when you play. The second thing is the scale and immersion of the game. Beyond the glitches sometimes breaking the immersion, I actually felt like a lone survivor in a desolate world, where people preyed upon the weak, and civilization may take days to reach on foot. Since I just recently bought the game, I can't say much about the developer, except that from reading what their vision is, it really is a grand one and has a lot of potential. Kenshi has lots of potential, but it also has lots of work left to be done. So pass it if you're looking for a more fleshed out game, but definitely get it if anything in this review has a major appeal to you. As for me, I'll be wandering the desert with my small group of companions trying to make a living in a world where death can come from even a small group of ill-trained, ill-equipped people. Afterall, you may know how to fight, but if a knife cuts you, you'll still bleed.			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi. Where do I start. It's about how the game feels when you start it for the first time. This is a game in development and somehow I just love it. When it's done, how I interpret it and see it, it is the ultimate RPG game. In a rich and huge (can't underline, but I would) world, filled with cities in biodomes and people, trees, water, dirt... In this world you can become a trader, a looter, a scavanger, but you can also found your own town, find new people for the party (very large parties) and become a power of your own. This sandbox RPG does sound a little too good to be true, but I don't know, it already delivers a lot and I recommend you come and see for yourself. Me and a lot of others are already enjoying Kenshi. I can recommend this game to people who also like traditional RPG's, but also RPG's like Fable for instance (there are characters, they grow, and there are factions, you are one), people who liked building the village in Assassins Creed 3, people who like minecraft (the playthrough is what you make of it), even people who like Settlers or even Age of Empires! I recommend this game basicly to everyone who plays other games then Call of Duty, as long as you can live with early-access situations in which you play a bêta or even alpha of the end result though. But getting it now if you're interested does save you money in the (very) long run.There are factions that all have their own diplomatic stances towards you and eachother, there are bandits raiding unprotected people. You can do whatever you want. So if you want your faction (you are your own faction) to become powerfull, train your party and have an army. If you want to become a trader, train them strong so they can pack a lot of stuff, if you want your own city... start building! The characters do not level up as is tradition, you train each skill by training that skill specifically by doing things that require the skill. Which according to me works. The game is really hard, especially at the start. You start with almost nothing and you have to struggle for survival. I usually start with luring bandits to patrols and towns to get them to fight (and die) to then pick their bodies clean like a damned vulture. Sell their stuff at a merchant, buy new equipment, repeat, get a teammate or two and start to choose a place to settle down.I played the game for the last time at version 0.62 and I have to say: it was an improvement over 0.50. It still feels the same (unpolished, cheap), but with the added notifications of approaching bandits, audio signals when under attack, female characters and at least some means of negociating with bandits I can only say: good work the last few months! Hair looks great, bodies look good, the rack on one of my partymembers is really too big, but looks good (not trying to be a sexist here, pointing out a detail) even beneath armor. I just wish someone would come to my stores to buy my goods, I don't want to walk to towns to sell them anymore ;)I again had a good time, so I'm sticking with the good review.The thing is though that you do have to create your own adventures and the world isn't alive enough yet to fully appreciate this. However, after playing with the same guys for over 30hrs, having built a town, having been in quite some sticky situations... my party did kind of grow on me. With the latest patches I did miss some of the buildings to build, but it was a step forward and I enjoyed myself.Kenshi began for me when I read about it in March 2013 (who knows how long development will take), and read about a game about a man with a sword (the title translates into the swordsman, I believe) in a world. And he can do whatever he wants. The world is still empty, but it's more of a playable techdemo. In the end it will be a beautifull world, the graphics already are worth showing. So I tried it, lost a few hours immediatly. Later I found it again on Steam and decided to buy it.A part of the experience now is that you are able to see a game being developed by a very small team. As I learned through the fora it was being made by one man. Just one man, this sounded like the late 80's and early 90's and I loved it. And by being able to sell this on Steam he made enough money to hire people and it is becoming very nice. The money is really being put to good use!!! I have checked out the roadmap and the website and trust me, this game is good and will be better sooner then I might have expected.Besides this curious development by first one man, I have never seen this much fan-made artwork for any game of this magnitude, and the game hasn't even been finished yet! There already is a lot of content available ingame, some maybe replaced and a lot more will come, but I wouldn't worry about the amount of game you're buying. Especially if you find this game on a sale and you're into sandbox games, I would go for it! I'm not even an RPG fan, but I did go for it and I'm happy I did.Usually with playtesting a game, there is room for feedback. There is no room for that here, the developer is too small to answer. The fora are spread over several locations and the information freely available may be confusing. But the price goes up as it's being patched towards a release candidate so spend the little the game costs now and join the ride. It's going to pick up speed very soon, everything looks promissing. With every patch the game is one step further, and you can actually feel it. There is a demo available on the website of the game, or you can download the torrent (you'll get the demo, nothing illegal herI've seen the development go slowly at first, many patches but all small ones. Then after the steam-release the hiring of people and the patching slowed down a bit. Now there are 6 people working on this game and I'm all psyched again!!! I can't wait to start another playthrough! But I'm waiting for the next patch, it has been due for a while now and they promissed a big one. I will amend this review when I've picked it up again. My last play was in februari and a lot has improved. Also a new gameworld is announced, ingame animals and more. Even though they may still take a while to implement, these implementations would require a amendment to the review as well.			"

Early Access Review
								I just would like to make a few changes to my old review: -So this is my review for Kenshi. I have played 74 hours(57 hours before) and I can say that right now, there is a lot of new content (and old content improved) that really cheered me up to keep playing, such as new races, new mechanics & skils (assassination, martial arts, dodge, swimming), new interactions with factions and creatures, new weapons and some VERY OP BEAKY CREATURES OMG SO BROKEN DKLGIAHOJKRHIDWGCHF. The point of this update in my review is to reinstate that Kenshi is a really good game worth buying, as it moves away from the boring and plain view and tries to be something unique. These updates also prove that Kenshi is alive and going just fine.-Slow development CAN'T be used as a negative trait, because Kenshi producers are not a big company like Ubisoft or EA, in fact they're only 6 ! (here's proof http://lofigames.com/about/about-us/ )Also, if you think that a game this creative and complex can be easily made, programming is not as easy as you think.TL;DR-If you want to buy Kenshi now: You'll have a lot of well spent hours after you get the hang of it, for that you could look on the game's wiki or/and watch some videos on youtube.-If you want to buy a full game: Wait patiently. They are working really hard and I'm sure that it will have enough content for you in the next updatesOh, I almost forgot, you can download a demo on kenshi's website. I don't know how much content is there, but it's probably enough to convince you into buying (or not).			"

Early Access Review
								So after playing Kenshi for about 50 hours with a few playthroughs I thought it would be time to write a review.  Kenshi is mainly a openworld RPG with a bit of base building and strategy, as listed in the tags for the game.  The character customizations go way in depth.  Everything from eyes to hair, to the length of you arms and legs.  I've seen some messed up people on the screenshots and just about laughed myself off my chair.  The fighting is amazing.  It's realistic.  You try taking on a group of raiders 1v7 and you WILL lose if you haven't trained your person to be a great fighter.  You can hire others, or go at it alone.  The amount of things you can do now, is awesome.  Anything from wandering around from city to city or building a home for you and your allies.  Keep in mind, the game is in Early Access so there are plenty of bugs and random glitches.  Things like out of this world rag-doll, people being stuck inside of each other (kinda funny at first, but can be a pain) and raiders spawning inside of your base.  I have a little list I made that I write down everything and with this last update, a few of the things were fixed.  I'm glad to see this game still being worked on and I can't wait to see this game fully built.  I will keep playing this for a long time to come and I'll keep updating the review.As always,  keep on gaming!EDIT:  I forgot to say anything about crashes.  This game does crash with me.  I do also get the ""Super Crash"" every 5 hours or so.  Playing the game for long amounts does trigger this and I hear that a number of things can also cause it to crash.  Save everytime you do something that is major like buliding a town, buying a bit of really good armor, or even when you're on the move.   I also have read a few reviews and I have noticed something.  The game starts you out as a normal person.  You are not all powerful, Dragonborn, The Arison, or somone else who matters.  You start out with almost nothing.  You pick a fight early on, and will be killed.NEWEST EDIT:  I wrote that review at about 50 hours into the game, several months ago.  I figure its time to update it after no having 200+.  The dev have been pushing updates and fixes out at a nice rate. So in other words, this game isn't dead.  A lot has changed since I first played this game.  There's a new race to play as, more starting stories, animals.   The list goes on.  That's the plus side of this new edit.  Downside includes coming across new glitches and crashing games.  Kenshi isn't as stable as it was a few months ago.  In fact, I've had the game crash about 3 times in a little over an hour.  The Devs are working on this, and I'm hopeful for this game and it's future.  OVERALL RATING AS OF 1/2/2016Still a good game, with it's problems.  Research the game before you buy, But keep an eye on this one if you don't get it now.   7.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								I'm going to state my opinion straight out so you understand where my reviews coming from before reading it... I already love this game. I find it challenging, immersive and immensely satisfying. I can't wait for more content even though I think what's currently there makes it a worthwhile experience for the price tag, any game that can have me put 45 hours in without even realizing it is going to be worth twenty-ish dollars in my book. Also, this game is absolutely not for everyone. That can not be stressed enough, if you don't like struggling in the beginning of a game you probably won't make it very far, it can be tough as nails if you aren't careful and even if you are you'll probably end up suffering through a few coma's in the early section while you're trying to make your character not useless. There, now that that's out of the way let's talk about the actual game.The gameplay is kind of a mix between a diablo-style dungeon crawler and an RTS. Every character has their own stats that can be levelled up through using them, every character can be as strong if not stronger than your starting character. In fact the only real difference between them and your starting character is that you didn't start with them. The movement and combat are fairly basic, there's not much in the form of tactics yet. Other than ganging up on specific units and some limited flanking ability you can't control much more than who attacks who. The path finding can sometimes trip up in the more hectic battles (more on that later) but it is early access and that stuff is being ironed out.The RTS elements shine through a bit more in the base building aspects, you build preset layouts for houses and fill them with various different things like work benches, beds or storage for materials. So far there's farming and resource mining as well as some crafting for weapons, armour and clothing. This will be a lot more balanced when things like hunger get implemented, right now there's not much to point to a farm other than making money and there isn't much to spend the money on other than materials and blueprints for items. You can also build defensive walls with gates and mounted crossbows for defense (and you'll need them, believe me) but these things can trip up the pathfinding again (still more on that later). Considering how unbalanced the economy currently is it still took me a while to get a base I was satisfied with and I enjoyed building it. It's only getting better as well.The world is both great and not so great all at once. I found myself heavily immersed in the world, I love the style and the sense that you're picking through the bones of an advanced civilization that's been long ruined, the atmosphere is just fantastic. The aesthetic is my kind of thing with obvious asian influences and you can really feel isolated and threatened in the early goings until you have a decent squad, then you feel like you're a match for the world and that's a really satisfying moment. However... as much as I love the feeling of the world, sometimes it can feel really empty. Yes, it's a wasteland and it's meant to feel that way, but if that's not your kind of thing it will really turn you off. I feel like the addition of small bandit camps to go along with the roaving bands and some oasis-like areas where more plants grow would really do a lot to help that. There's also some work happening on adding creatures to the world and I think that will do wonders for this particular problem. My bar for a well done isolated setting is set really high to be fair, once you play S.T.A.L.K.E.R: shadows of chernobyl it's hard to settle for anything less. The fact I'm even willing to compare the two is very telling about just how great the atmosphere is here.Now, on to the bugs (disclaimer: I haven't played for a while so some of these may have been fixed since my last session, I'll explain in a bit). You get to hear about the pathfinding which is my main issue. It's kind of broken. It's serviceable for the most part, they can manage to traverse long distances and only rarely do they get stuck, however they still get stuck and that's pretty annoying. I use the ""bodyguard"" command to make sure my squad moves at the same speed (an option to just make them do that would be nice) but the pathfinding for that is far worse than the regular stuff, they match speed and stay at the same relative position to the character they're guarding and don't realize if they're about to walk into a wall, this is where they most often get stuck because for some strange reason edges like to grab hold of characters and they get stuck in the ground. Also, I've never had them defend anything while under the bodyguard command. Frequent quick-saves make this a mild irritation at worst and if you ever get really stuck and haven't saved for a while there's an option in the menu to pick up and drop all your characters on the center of your camera to unstick them, but it's still a bug and it needs to be mentioned. The other issues with it are also minor, in a big fight sometimes units can get confused about what they should do and end up standing around with their finger in their nose while their buddy is fighting three bad guys at once but they eventually get it together. The last issue I have is that closing the gates breaks the pathfinding when your units are outside, if you close the gate no matter how far away they are or where you tell them to move they will turn around about half the time and walk back to the gate to maually open it. It can be really frustrating but the only time you need the gate closed is when bandits are attacking and they give you advance warning so it can be pretty easily circumvented.Aside from the pathfinding there's an odd (yet hilarious) bug with picking up and putting down characters, if you do it on the ground they pop up into the sky and get sent flying. They only stop if they hit a mountain or you use taht un-sticking method I previously mentioned. Again, it's just a minor annoyance and it doesn't happen if you put them in a bed or jail cell which is where you should be taking them anyway, but if you get attacked you can't put down whoever you're carrying and you run the risk of getting knocked out yourself.This is less a bug and more of a flaw with the system itself, and it's also the main reason I haven't played in a while. There's a serious memory issue, the game runs on a 32-bit engine and it doesn't have a high enough memory limit for extended play. I'm not sure if everyone has this problem but I can only play for about ten minutes at a time now, it's progressively gotten worse the bigger my base got and the more people I had control of. It used to take a number of hours to crash on me. This could be my fault, I haven't exhausted every troubleshooting option yet, but all the same it's an issue that needs to be addressed. There's also talk of transferring to a 64-bit system which would probably eliminate the issue, but as of my last play session it wasn't implemented and I can only talk about my experience.TL;DR, this game is an extremely rewarding and challenging experience if you're willing to stick through it and are a fan of post-apocalyptic worlds or deserts in general. If not, there's very little in it for you. The early game is pretty slow and it relies on you enjoying the world around you more than the gameplay, afterwards they both work together and that's when the game shines. If you can't handle crashes or potenitally broken AI then hold off on your purchase but definitely keep an eye on this, when all the issues are ironed out this game will be phenomenal. If you don't mind crashes or other early access problems then this game is worth the money as-is and will only get better with time.			"

Early Access Review
								Not many games get this type of attention from me. even in Alpha ( when i wrote this review ) this game is awesome. it has quickly taken over as my favorite game right now besides Civ V, KSP and Planet Explorers.Kenshi will be awesome once its done. wait even not finished its still awesome.two paws up for this game.Edit 2/13/2014Females are in the game at last! New factions, Gameplay, diplomacy, bandit raids, Cannibals or as also known ""Bacon Cultists"" With more coming soon. and a new AI being worked on for those pesky super crashes and pathing issues.The game music is moving an wonderful, first game ever where i did not mute the music while playing the game. or kill sound effects along with it. It adds just the right amount of mood to the game.Why buy the game? Well for one its not like any other game you have played before. its a original and still developing and after each core update it gets better with more items added to expand your gaming experience. A original RTS, sandbox game. If your tired of starting a game where you can go out and kill people in one hit from the start! Then this is your game. It will challenge you, you have to fight to survive, living long enough to train yourself from a nobody whom everyone could beat up, to a legendary Hero or Heroine depending on your Gender. It is not a quick game, there is no ending, It is moddable even in its current state.Why not to buy this game?It is Alpha Stage Development game. If you don't like dealing with bugs, core game play content thats not added yet, then this game is not for you. The game is not complete, so do not buy the game thinking it is. Some bugs (depending on the computer) can render the game unplayable for a short while. If you're still interested in the game, then wait and watch. Come back in a year ( From this rewrite posting  2-13-2014 ) then give it a try. Until then pass it up and leave it on your wish listEdit 6/11/2014Would like to add a useful page to visit for those reading reviews.Useful Information and links For KenshiIncluded is a link to the Demo.A report on the super crash thats in the game. it is being worked on to be corrected, that update should be out in 2 weeks or less ( from when i edited this post ) barring any problems. The prospecting thats now in the game is  very good, with a high science skill you can easily find hotspots to build your bases. no more turtling up in one spot. The NPC squad slider was adjusted down, ( From 4x to 2x ) for everyone put it at max then complained their FPS went to He** double hockey stick.Total time the Dev has said it would take to complete the game. he is shooting for the end of 2014, but its possible it will actually be some time late in 2015. personally i think it will be late 2015 mostly because there is still a lot more to be added. but we will see once the 64bit Conversion and new pathing Engine are added.Edit 12/25/2014Version 0.70.x is now in the beta testing stage before public release. it was released early and full of game killing bugs, which have been ironed out to a point. so should be ready for public release soon.We now have animals, Leviathans, Pack Gar's, Dog things, and beak things. new factions though the actual people in them are not in yet.Prisoner Cages are back in police stations, though been having issues with those.The Memory Leak is gone. though the game is running rather rough at the moment due to it being released too early. but things should smooth out soon and look much better once Directx 11 is added.We still have the 1 biom but that won't change anytime soon.Bandits no longer attack you on sight but now chase after you tossing insults and if you just keep running they eventually stop, leaving you to your own shenanigans.Multi levels to buildings has been added, and looks like the GUI will be redone soon. no more badly fitting text or buttons will be coming with that, plus the squad sizes are supposed to be increased in a couple updates from now.At the time of this edit, v0.70.x is only open to beta testing opt in. so things will change once its released to the general public.General Info.I am one of the Admin for the Kenshi Forums, the other is Gmat.I write this review based on me being a regular gamer like everyone else. I personally think this is a great game and just getting better, but i also know its not for everyone.There is a lot of links and information in the forums, including a link to a Demo ( link added on 6/11/2014 )I can not stress enough to try the demo first before buying.

								If you wanted to be a samurai or something else, kenshi is your thing. You can create your own story, manage your squad, build your city and so fort. Kenshi is an open world sandbox game the map/world will grow with next updates but even now, it's still ""big"". It's of course currently in alpha stage so you have to wait for updates but, you can still enjoy the whole game until it's grow up. There are people with over 700+ hours gameplay currently so you can spend many times in it.I highly recommend this game those who also enjoyed games like Mount&Blade. But you should consider it's still alpha and there are bugs in this game. And please watch some gameplay videos before so you can see how is it.			"

								edit: this review is very out of dateBought this during the summer sale not really knowing what to expect and was totally taken by surprise. Even though the game is in an Alpha state, it feels very well put together with features such as mining, farming, and research. It took me a couple hours to get the basics down, and a couple more to get over the fact that my puny characters could be bested by even the lowliest bandit, but one I got a feel for the gameplay I haven't looked back. Definitely one of the more interesting games I have played in a while. It was developed by ONE dude. That is damn impressive.Some tips for starters:- Research mining before farming (trust me, mining pays for itself)- Make sure you have a guy or two living in town in case your group gets ambushed and overwhelmed.- Lead bandits to a city, let guards kill bandits, loot corpses, profit			"

								I wish I hadn't spent $20 on this. Months ago, before I uninstalled this game, the developer was only putting out new content patches instead of fixing bugs which have been present since I purchased the game in Jan. 2013 (according to the forums there's still pathing problems with buildings, it's not getting fixed any time soon). Dare to bring this up in the forums, or any other criticizm for that matter, and a legion of fanboys will troll and drown your complaints out regardless of how you present them. The excuse that the game is in the alpha stage is used quite liberally, as these bugs go unaddressed most updates. And even when bugs are addressed the game developer takes a tone announcing it as though it's a waste of his time and he doesn't really want to do it. In fact, the new content and features updates seem to compound bugs which go unaddressed. I could maybe forgive this, if  the game were entertaining. But it's not, it's just miserably tedious and boring. The combat is slow and pointless, as you watch twenty men surround one for each to take turns swinging one weapon at a time at the target. Once you tire of that, spend hours on end standing around, researching new technologies to craft buildings and weapons and armor and other stuff all to... go out and watch twenty men surround one for each to take turns swining one weapon at a time. I highly recommend this game - to be removed and for everyone who purchased it to get a refund. Side Note:Oh, and the forum moderator is either a paid troll for the game developer or a rabid dweeb trying to get in on the ground floor of what he percieves to be another game sensation like WoW. Either way, eventually anyone who speaks ill of the game gets their thread locked and buried. To me, that's the most frustrating part of the game; you can't even bring up a reasonable grievance against it, let alone warn others away. I hope this review gets around that hurdle.			"

 This game is in Early Access.  It is NOT finished.  Anything I say may, and most likely will, be changed as development continues. MANY OF THE BUGS I LISTED WITHIN THE CONS HAVE BEEN PATCHED.  DO NOT LET THE ONES I LISTED RUIN THIS GAME FOR YOU, THEY TEND TO BE QUITE RARE.  EVEN WITH THEM THIS GAME IS STILL AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE AND WAS VERY ENJOYABLE.*TL;DR at the bottom of this review* Kenshi.  This game is brutal.  I seriously had more moments in this game where I wanted to yell at it for being so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard, yet if you look on my profile it's currently marked as my favorite game.  The reasoning behind that is simple, this game offers 0 in the way of hand holding.  If you want a good, long, tutorial that explains every single detail to you in a nice format then Kenshi is not your game.  Wiki?  Don't bother, honestly it kinda ruins the fun of this game.  Kenshi is one of the few games where I can say that I never watched a single tutorial, and yet I felt like by 40 hours I knew some pretty advance things in the way of base building and combat tatics.  This game will suck you in, it'll FORCE you to learn the game.  You'll change your tatics, your starting locations, your ordering in what you need, the way you simply play the game will evolve as you learn, as the game makes you learn.  I loved it.  Every second of it.  Even when I wanted to scream at my computer, I still couldn't help but love this game for what it is.  With that said, pro's and con's time.Pros- The devs care.  If you EVER run into an issue within the game, you can post in the discussions and I bet you $100 that atleast one of the admins or mods will respond.- Many different playstyles.  This game can be an RTS, a squad based rp, a city builder, it can be so, so much.- Landscape is amazing, and the next update will overhaul this.  The biomes, textures, and pretty much everything about the look of this game is pretty amazing.- Combat system is nice, isn't perfect, but it's very nice none the less.- Medical system is also really cool.  Got hit in the leg?  You're limping your way back to town now, bud.- Base building is some of the best i've seen.  The job system and resouce refining is overall very good for its current state.  It has some issues, but that'll be seen in the cons.- Trading system is simple and works, though I found a few exploits- Farming system is simple but very effective, some bugs will be disscussed in cons- Factions are pretty diverse in armor, items, etc.  Cannibals are really fun, some issues with factions in the cons.- Smithing and crafting are really simple but work pretty well.  Could be more complex or diffucult, but it's still fun.- Training system, once again, very simple.  Not much could be improved here, it works very well and theres not a whole bunch you can do to change it.Cons- Medical system is lacking.  It's way more simple than I think it should be.- Combat can get boring very quickly as it's more stat based than anything else.- There are items within the game that are simply better than any other item.  I remember at one point samuri armor or whatever it was called was simply the best you could get.  For me this kinda ruined the feel of being able to have so many different build paths, each to their own.  Be super slow but super tanky, be super fast with TONS of damage, but super squishy, etc.- Floating trees, enemies not spawning, falling through world.  These are somewhat rare bugs, but they do happen.  Remember, it's an early access game.- Combat system is buggy in some cases.  Weapons can hit or miss when they don't appear they did, sometimes your character appears to have his/her weapon equiped but...doesn't use it?... It's like the models there but the hitboxes arn't?  Wierd.- Base building.  99% of my bugs are here. I'll be making a list for this one. 1.- Sometimes you can place a wall down, and even though it allowed you to place it your units simply cannot reach it to build.  2.- There was an old bug where building the tier 3 walls would crash you game if you placed many of them at once. 3.- Some gates, when placed, would never lock/unlock.  You could never open them or close them. 4.- Some buildings can be built on slight hills, and yet it'll let you build it while your units cannot get into them 5.- Some buildings, once built, would be unable to open or go up the stairs.THERE ARE MANY BUGS, I AM SIMPLY LISTING THE MAJOR ONES THAT KINDA RUINED THE GAME FOR ME DURING BASE BUILDING.  REMEMBER, MOST OF THE GAMEBREAKING BUGS ARE RARE AND WILL MOST LIKELY ONLY HAPPEN TO YOU ONCE OR TWICE, NOTHING A QUICK LOAD BACK TO A CHECKPOINT FROM 5 MINUTES AGO WON'T FIX.TL;DRThis game is great.  It's hard as steel to learn, but amazingly fun once you do.  You will not suceed on your first try, nor your second or third.  It'll take time, but once you do it is AMAZING.  I reccommend this game to anyone who is willing to put up with a few bugs for an RTS, Squad-based RP, City Builder game, all meshed into one.For an Early Access game, I would recommend you pick it up.  You will not be dissappointed. "

								This is the game I’ve been looking for!The following is coming from a total noob, that hasn’t researched the game whatsoever. This is 5 hours of gameplay.Day 1. I create a female wanderer, and I run around town, in and out of buildings looking for something to do. (20 minutes later I’m thinking, what’s the point in this?) Day 2. It’s time to leave this town, and venture out across the wasteland, this town sucks. I travel at night, with 900 credits (cats) and a loaf of dry bread, and bare feet. I decide to erect a small shack in the desert, and after doing so, I realise I’ve build a useless unfinished concrete structure, with steel reinforcing jutting out all over the place. I move on towards the next town, leaving the unfinished building to ruin.Day 3. I arrive early morning to a group of people killing dogs, just outside the town’s entrance. I avoid the people, and try looting a dog’s corpse. I get nothing. Once again, I move from building to building, finding nothing other than a few people offering their services for 700 cats. I decide to hang onto my 900 for now. I find a dummy in one building and decide to hit it, soon realising this is the way to raise my attack points. I do this until I’m at level 5.Day 4. I’m a hard♥♥♥♥♥ now I’m level 5. It’s time to venture out into the wilderness again to kick a group of dude’s brains in! I run out into the desert and soon see a gang in the distance. They spot me and shout “get the prick”. I decide to run instead. They’re faster than me, and soon catch up. They kick my♥♥♥♥♥bad. Breaking my left leg, stabbing me in the stomach and putting me in a coma, they leave me for dead face down in the sand, in my underwear. Day 5. Is spent in a comaDay 6. I drag my broken leg, limping back to the town.Day 7. I can’t do this alone, and decided to spend 700 cats on hiring a girl in the local bar, to join me. She heals me, but I’m still limping bad, so I find a bed nearby and pay 100 cats to bed down for a while and heal.Day 8. An outside gang try entering the town, and the fighting kicks off! I’m recovering in bed, but the girl runs outside, looting as many corpses as possible. She puts some of the armour on, gets instantly attacked and hobbles to the bed next to me, to recover.Day 8. The fighting is still going on outside, and it’s escalated into gang warfare. Both fully recovered, we ditch the gangs’ outfits (so we don’t get our heads kicked in again!) and begin looting and selling. We decide to hire another member to our gang, and turn him into a tank of a man, (with a hunchback). Together we loot every corpse and finally raise around 15k cats. Day 9. After some serious dummy training and some more members, it’ll be time to head out of this town again, and back to the shack I began on day 1. We’ll try and get the building completed with a working generator, build a few mines and see what happens next. To summarise:Yeah it’s in development still, and it’s got bugs, but it’s totally playable and worth every penny.The developers seem to working hard on updates and deserve  support & money on this great little gem.

								UPDATE:I did not realize this review would get so many votes. This review as of now is quite outdated, but I have not redownloaded this game to test the new contents. The devs seem to be updating the game quite frequently, so take it as you will.HOWEVER, DO KEEP IN MIND THIS GAME WAS INITIALLY RELEASED ON EARLY ACCESS OUTSIDE OF STEAM ON SEPTEMBER 2009. This game does not play like an old school RPG game that was made in 2015. It feels like a 2009 game with some graphical updates. You will probably never see this game released in your lifetime. At least, not with the complete functionalities that were promised.-----------------I can't believe how many positive reviews there are for this game. Yes, the game has potential. Yes, the game is in alpha, and therefore can be judged based on the potential, but this is a game that has been in development for an incredibly long amount of time without significant updates. I even retried the game today to see if there were updates added. Sure, the game is an open world, but there is still not much to do in the game. Dialogues are sparse and uselss at best, Combat is clunky, the UI is horrendous, pathing is bizarre and unexpected. Even building a city and grabbing a squad of your own feels tedious rather than fun. Character models are ugly, and though the devs are going to be coming out with a new GUI soon according to their announcements, it does not appear to be a significant upgrade from the current system. Landscapes and cities look great at times, but not enough to actually immerse you into the game.The game itself is challenging, but not in a particularly fun way. Yes, everyone is stronger than you, yes, the game makes you work your way up in the game, but by the time you do, you've inevitably lost interest in the game, or it has crashed on you about a dozen times. It's a game that I really want to like as I enjoy open-world, sandbox RPGs, but there is simply nothing to do other than wander around, get pummeled, wait to be rescued or recover, and repeat process. Avoid this game until it leaves Early Access, if it ever leaves early access. The game does have a strong (almost fanatic) fan-base, and the devs do listen to their fans, but the development is so slow, it makes almost no difference whether they do or not. And most negative reviews, whether warranted or not, will get torn apart by this crazed fan base.			"

								Kenshi is a game of overcoming failure. Mainly, failure that you seek out; in the game I am presently playing, my group has been destroyed and left for dead bar one lone survivor. Not bad for fighting over one hundred battles. Unlike most grinders, losing makes the character better. Each blow suffered, each failed defense helps each character grow stronger. On the same hand, each use of an attack does the same for one’s melee attack. Strength requires either using a heavier weapon in combat, or dragging heavy gear and materials across the sandy wastelands to become stronger.My character started out with a group, fed up with stifled city life and taxes. We gathered together to head out and found our own homes and lives. After days of preparing our small mining camp, the group is capable of carrying out a full scale mining company, selling goods and creating a faction to be reckoned with. The grind is rewarding, since the humble beginning of this rag tag group.All of this is earned through hours, upon hours of grinding. Kenshi is not a game for the light of heart; the grinding will try your patience, and the music, while atmospheric, is ambient and tends to get grating after a while. Blood will spill. Arms will be broken. The crafting system, powered by choice of end product and the speed of production depends on the skill of the creator. Quality has no bearing on the skill, thankfully, considering the hours necessary to craft simple weapons and armor.There are presently only five styles of attack available to train in as well as craft. Hackers, Cleavers, heavy weapons, and a variety of katana, and wakizashi. Thankfully, this is all mitigated, in part, by a speed up function that speeds up the world to further reduce real crafting time.Enemies in the current version are made up of Starving Bandits, Dust Bandits, Sand Ninja, and Cannibals. You will end up fighting these enemies over and over, until your skills are good enough to defend yourself and your allies. Depending on start, the other notable factions (United Cities Samurai, Mercenaries, and Holy Nation) will be your enemies as well, presenting a higher difficulty for your characters as they are highly armed and dangerous.The wound system is one of survival, with the game tracking wounds to different parts of the body. Head, stomach or chest area, are required to stay conscious . The other limbs if injured come in the form of inability to use the limb or slowed movement, which may make fleeing difficult. Kenshi is unforgiving in this respect.Base creation is RTS style, requiring building materials, time, and a builder. The overall process is the same as weapon and item crafting, with a number of buildings available for crafting or research.The game’s research and science is also time based; Purchasing blueprints is a matter of heading to stores that sell similar products. Researching requires leaving a team member behind a workshop table to learn new construction.Now, considering the game is in alpha, it’s unsurprising that the models start off simple. With recent updates you are given the ability to manipulate and change the character’s features, with the ability to manipulate even height and weight. This all comes with a warning; at present, many of the combat animations do not work with some of the more extreme body shapes, with super small or super tall, or super wide characters having difficulty meshing with the animations. This presents mostly when using female models, which were recently added.Graphics are the other issue; the game’s atmosphere is post apocalyptic, this makes the the surrounding environments tame continuous desert. The occasional greenery pops up now and then helping to bring some colour.There have been many updates since Kenshi was released an Early Access Game, with changes and updates coming roughly every month or so. With new updates come new clothing, changes to models, landscape changes and many more. Game saves are not compatible between versions; however, there is an option to Import characters from earlier saves.There are also quite a number of bugs, mostly to do with path-finding and other commands. As this is an alpha, expect to see them.SO WE COME TO THE ENDAfter unfathomable hours of game play, Kenshi drawn me back again and again to it’s blood soaked desert. The game offers an huge amount of freedom. It’s a game of growing numbers and seeing their impact in a world that is filled with danger. It is a game that is hard to get into but once you have the basics say goodbye to real life. It thrives off of swift and brutal combat with only the best surviving to the end, and the weak being cut down dead; the lucky laying unconscious. It is unforgiving, and at the same time, for those who are willing to put in the time, rewarding.It is a vicious and simple game, that has a full save/loading system. The grind is punishing; enemies constantly challenge you to grow and adapt, to survive, and eventually conquer those around you. Yet it is just lenient enough for your characters to survive.The game is still in development and is missing many features. Expect crashes and bugs at this stage. But remember in development games receive regular ongoing updates and improvements, by purchasing at an early stage you get the game for a reduced price and can watch it gradually grow and improve!

And maybe a little bit creative... you'll not only survive, you'll thrive.Kudos to the designers, they could have upped sticks a long time ago through all the difficulty and bugs but nope.

								To counter the negetive reviews. Most large companies don't even attempt to make a game such as this because it takes a lot of money and time to develop. Now remember this isn't a large company with 1000 people that own 10 studios around the world. Time is essential to fix bugs and add new content to an open world sandbox so many things can break.  Just sit back and wait for the updates to get released, The wait for this amazing game to be completed is well worth it!I give Lo-Fi Games massive credit for this game,Keep going.			"

								great game! followed it for over 2 years i think now way before sound and construction was ever implemented! the only way i can describe it is think fallout 1/2 but in a map size of elder scrolls: daggerfall along with construction from c & c except a little more controled and less ""1 click to build then wait"" the combat is fun the controls are fluid the a.i can be very derpy somtimes which is freaking funny but this game is still only in alpha. if i had to rate it out of 10 easily an 7.5 but only because it has still some stuff to add but i give it a 10 for what it is trying to do in terms of bringing back sandbox squad based tactical rpg's except squad can range from 2 to 300! (or 22 is the current maximum as of 25/11/2013) keep an eye on this one it will go very far! give it love and support it deserves!			"

								So, this is probably going to be one of my favourite games of all time. Despite the game being not having half the features that are planned for it, I'm hooked, because what it does contain is fantastic, and the potential of it excites me beyond belief. Quality:As it is currently, there are some minor annoyances bug/glitch wise (I.e wall/gate placement in base building, items dissapearing when dropped, and people being launched into the sky when put down) but with a pinch of salt and frequent quick-saving, it's nothing that will spoil your experience and the game is very playable as it is. Value: (I paid £12.99)For your money, you get to support the development of a game that will hopefully set the standard for future RPG's, as well as many, many, hours of what is currently very enjoyable Alpha gameplay. And if you're like me, and are really excited about where this game is going, you get to feverishly await the addition of future content!I've clocked just over 60 hours on this playthrough and feel like I've more-or-less plumbed the depths of it by exploring most of the map, filling up my sqaud with people, doing 99% of the research and getting my main guys to be pretty good at what they do. However I could probably wring another 10-15 hours out of this playthrough easily, and the game has the potential to be infinitely replayable. I'd happily start over right now.Brief Overview:Until you can build your first outpost, you'll spend most of your time roaming around a vast and empty desert. I s**t you not. But trust me, you'll love it, because it's so atmospheric. Also, you will be very, very, very, cautious, hopping between the safety of city walls until you can toughen your guy(s) up. or you WILL get destroyed by ne'er-do-wells in the desert.The thing I love most about Kenshi, is that it doesn't need quests or missions (although these may be implemented later), because it's an epic story that tells itself, and you make it up as you go along and become immersed in the story that you create. Conclusion:If you love RPG's, katanas, epic journeys, and immersive, open-ended, gameplay, then Kenshi is a no-brainer. The vast amount of potential this game has is a bonus. I wish all Early Access titles were this promising.For a forcast of Kenshi's future development, check out this handy-dandy Roadmap: http://www.lofigames.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:roadmap&Itemid=71 "

Early Access Review
								Whatever ""it"" is...this game has it: the ""it"" that I've all but given up looking for the past 15+ years. I originally bought this game purely on the basis of a vaguely promised potential stemmed from the fact that a single person had so fully and passionately invested in her/his singular dream. I admired that and felt it was worth my acknowledgement as a born-and-raised gamer-at-heart. Admittedly, I was not impressed at first.  It was bare on all levels. Yet, I felt something; something trying to be realized; a seed trying to find ground. So, I let it be without judgement. For whatever reason the cosmos deem fit to define, I recently felt it was time to test the presumably deeper waters that have been forged since I first endulged to witness the extent of that ""something"" that had or had not been realized. Much to my not-so-dubious pleasure, my hope was revived to spark another true flame of that ""it"" I've so patiently searched for. Granted, I found it beneath hours upon hours of fumbling and keyboard-shattering crashes; but, honestly, at this point, the game's faults have become part of its charm. Which is really what adds that extra spice to give it that ""it"" flavor. Despite all of its admittedly glaring short-falls, it prevails with the potential for which it strives. Like every truly meaningful vision, its success is in its unrelenting ambition. And it only reveals this to you if you are willing to see it; willing to want it; willing to give it more than a glance of your attention. If you are, and if you do, this game will abide. It defies the shallow, heartless, financially-infused delusion that is the instant-gratification platform of gaming today. It is an uncut, unpollished, diamond-in-the-rough, poised to rise beyond one's incredulity into the veritable heart of imagination that so desperately seeks that ellusive sense of perpetual satisfaction afforded only by the so-called immersive gaming. No doubt, it is not for everyone. It is only for those willing to see what it wants to be; willing to see where it is headed and how far it has come at the hands of someone who seems to truly understand, if only on some unintelligible level of consciousness, what is starving the hearts of the angst-filled cynics that are today's gaming community. TL;DR : This game is for those who appreciate gaming as a form of art. It is indeed a work in progress; but a glorious one. In my opinion, it is worth the purchase on merit alone. The more people willing to see the potential, the greater the potential that will ultimately be realized. I am a believer. Are you?Either way, happy gaming.			"

								Although it's not finished Kenshi is a unique and interesting game which offers quite a challenge and requires players to really think about what they do and don't purchase, where to start your own outpost, what to build, and whether to run from a group of bandits (9 times out of 10) or stay and fight with a chance of walking away with some valuable loot.Kenshi does have its fair share of bugs, multiple times i have found my soldiers merging and teleporting from one point in my outpost to another, and having men on both sides freeze during combat, these usually sort themselves out in the end.Overall i believe Kenshi is a great game for all people to pick up and waste time with, just don't be surprised when a massive bandit group just waltzes into your shack and slaughters everyone.

								This game... I don't know if it will ever be finished but it is soooo addictive. It's my dream game for so many things. I always wanted a game where your character would evolve and xp according to his actions. Fable had that promise but it was fake. Morrowind and the elder scrolls saga pretended to be that but it was fake as well (still these level and point attribution thingy)Here, getting hurt makes you stronger. Literally.Being overburdened will develop your muscle, but will you make you run slower, and running faster can mean survival.Don't know how to describe this game properly, but there is so much potential here... I play several hours every 6 month, to see what is new and everything, and always get sucked back in.			"

A little way's away from the village I spotted a goat, and thought it was the perfect target to test out just how good this sword I spawned with was.Turns out the stuff I thought was grass around it was actually ten other goats.

								As many people have stated there are plenty of bugs and the development is incredibly slow.  I still love this game.  I have, I think, 110 hours of playtime and a majority of that is on one playthrough.  The combination of survival, builiding, combat, squad play, and an intricate stat system keeps me coming back (even if a lot of that list doesn't work properly).  If this game is ever completed, it will be one of those games that sticks around my library forever.			"

								This game is a beauty.GAMEPLAY :The default start is a RPG with the classic inventory and stats (old-fashioned stats).But with some time, you end up getting ingame currency and you can recruit a new character, which also has its own inventory and stats.By the time you get to understand the game, you can end up with 50+ characters (form up diferent squads), and then it can become an RTS kinda game. Yes, you can build stuff, and all the cities you will see in the game, you are able to create by yourself. You can prospect the land to see if it is good to grow stuff, make bread, and open a baker shop; or if it's better to mine, make a weaponsmith and open an armory.  Each character can be an Engineer, Merchant, Medic, Swordsman, Gunman (turrets and Xbows) etc.....There are mutiple factions which have unique laws and goals in the world. Of course, it is a dynamic world, and if you place your city well enough, you will get more and more travelers stopping by, renting beds or buying stuff; or you can get known by the closest bandits faction and they will start bullying you to pay taxes.To wrap it up, this game is absolutely incredible for the possibilities you get. BUT, it is not for everyone. Actually, the guy (GENIUS) behind this game wanted to create a game where you are not special. You ain't the last dragonborn, nor a mighty knight that will demolish every ennemies. You are a simple wanderer, so at the beginning of the game, literally ANYONE can kill you. + the health system is very complex. Each part of your body has a healthbar, which affects your total blood bar.Obviously, if you suffer heavy injuries, your character will go to Coma state, and eventually die.. forever (permadeath).So again, it is for gamers that are looking for challenge. I myself was quite horrified by this game at the beginning, but now I understand most of its content, I can make really decent games where I am able to create an outpost with a production and shops, and a little army to defend myself. Finally, this game is in alpha state. It is a project that is made by one person to begin with, but now it is a team.It has a slow progress, but has never been abandonned. Plus the price is really fair.Recently they worked with amazing musicians that play crazy instruments to make a unique and amazing OST,And the game is getting a major update soon enough since the map will  change for a randomly generated map with diferent biomes and wildlife. Sorry if this comment is too long, but I almost never comment games, and this one really deserved my thumbs up.18/10.  "

 Actual Review Down Below! Update 5/25/2015I got sidetracked with lots of review, the preview is gonna wait till i get that performance patch they were saying.Update 5/17/2015 Experimental UpdateHo boy this is.... this is awesome! The old GUI is gone and for the first time ever it looks neat! holy crap. holy holy crap. You should have seen the character creation menu. It looks so clean! And gosh from the last time i played this the game looks a bit better now. I did freeze up here and there but it is the experimental build after all. Will update once i actually starts killing sand ninja. Game Detail Name: KenshiDeveloper: Lo- Fi GamesGenre: RPG, Simulation, Trading, Strategy, Squad Management KENSHI *Sigh*. I'll be straight with you, this game once consume me for a while. Therefor when I was chosen to do a review on KENSHI, i was rather taken aback and did everything i could to avoid doing it. But the time has come. And now i ask you the question, do you know what is KENSHI? Most likely not, it's not a mainstream game nor a very well known indie for that one but those people who had the chance to try it will usually exclaim that it is better than most of the RPG on the maker and yet here i must make my statement regarding this game: It's not for everyone. Certainly not for me after i tried it. Ok so what is KENSHI? RPG game, with a dash of realism. That is to say it is still in early access and i had tried years ago the alpha build before it went on steam and i have to say improvements have been made after all this years. It's an eastern style RPG set in a apocalyptic world where sands rule the land and law and order are determined by might with roaming bands of brigands out for your blood everywhere you go.It's a very atmospheric world. You can be beset by cannibals, saved by the Holy Empire Patrol, loot dead bodies and equip yourself and after months of training and war you started killing settlements. The tables have turn. And that my dear reader is what KENSHI embodies, symbolizes and make you experience. You are a human being, in a world where other people are often times better than you. You will bleed in the middle of the desert before using your last medkit to bandage your arm and hobble slowly back to the city. At the end of the day, life goes on. Why the bravado? Simply because reviewing this game is subjectively hard. That and because i liked it. On with the review i suppose. Many parts of KENSHI will be miss however simply due to the scope. Gameplay You can choose to start with several preset such as having a good weapon, having trade goods [the goods are cheap, the bag however is not.] having a good weapon, having good combat skill [recommended for beginner.] or having several dudes in your party at start. Which i do not recommend. Anyways customize your appearances, choose a name, gender [Race is coming. Not very soon however since the updates are slow but big.] and then *BOOM* You are drop into the magnificent world of KENSHI. With only a very brief tooltip to get you started on your journey.The game is an open ended RPG meaning you can do pretty much what you want without any objective save for those you set yourself. Therefor people who enjoy reading story instead of making it should probably not find it very enjoyable. Anyways you can do a lot of things in the game but lemme just use the very rarely used bullet point instead of typing it out. Start your own town. Become a master of arms. Become a bounty hunter. Become an anarchist. A blacksmith even! with upgrades and blueprints! Or my personal favourite: Wandering the waste, getting into fights randomly healing people or breaking their bones. Then you become a warlord and do all of the above. Nothing really stopping you to be honest.And here is where the gameplay gets fun. You see KENSHI utilizes a unique RPG system where instead of skill points you actually perform the action to upgrade your corresponding skill. System like Carrying extra weight to train your strength, running without any loads to increase your running speed. And actually fighting to increase your fighting skills because you truly suck at the beginning where even a small bandit can make you into coma.Speaking of coma this game HP system should be utilize into more game. For example your limbs have individual health bar and each of them can bleed out individually reducing their effectiveness and preventing you from using two handed weapons and sword for examples. But that is not all! Wound your opponent enough on the head and they will faint, on the leg and they will hobble, on the arm and well.... have fun. Meanwhile you also have a blood meter! Lost too much and get coma and die. Subject to everyone. So everyone has an equal chances of dying with only their martial art skill being the tie breaker.There is also the element of trading, by buying trading bag which reduces your speed and make you more susceptible to bandits you can buy trading goods and trade stuff from town to town. Then all those training carrying sacks of metal made you stronger so you can then beat up bandits!The game is hilariously open is what i am saying. That is not even accounting for squad formation, squad order. create-a-town mechanic function and all the other things in this world. It's the tip of the iceberg. Graphics Compare to years ago the graphics have improve substantially although in 2015 its not really something to write home about. You can even sometimes see graphical glitches from time to time although seeing as this is a rather massively scope game such a thing are understandable. Sound While atmospheric the ambient sound is best turned off, the game set to windowed mode and you play supplied with your own music. Trust me the lonely landscape takes time to transverse even at top speed so having your tune would supplement it quite well. Conclusion My review will never do KENSHI justice, it is a game of such openness and it provides you with the mean to experience that everybody will play it differently. For me it is the ever path of the wanderer [And the warlord once I figure out how to actually kill someone with this metal rod i call a sword.] Scoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: S-Rank [So long as the update is stable otherwise it's an A-Rank.]Protip: Try the demo floating around the internet before you commit. The demo is rather old though with many new features have been implemented into the game. Still a long way before release though.  Early Access Hiccups? Plenty. Many features are experimented on all the time on this game. And as such it breaks easily during update. Does not stop you from enjoying it though.EDIT 4/20/2015: I should really clarify something, i wont ssay this game has potential but it does [hypocrite] but the thing is about this game is that i got my enjoyment out of whatever update it already has so further progress is merely bonus at this point. So dont wait for the potential, just enjoy the now. Check out the Original Network Groups. Win free games, make new friends on Steam, & more!

								A warning to a potential buyer: the game is still very much early access, crashes are frequent (thankfully an autosave is already implemented) and many of the features are incomplete. If you don't enjoy seeing a game through development, this is not the game to buy.Preamble warning aside, Kenshi has a lot of interesting features, not the least of which for me is the crafting system, especially being able to gear your party with hand made items. That said, while some aspects of the game aren't as intuitive as you could hope, the scope of the game and shear number of features is exciting, and reminds me of of a scaleably third person team based Morrowind.If the developers continue to work on this game steadily, I could very easily see myself going back and continuing to play. With as much potential as this game has, I really hope they complete it, because they will have produced a very unique and enjoyable game.			"

								I give this game an 8.5/10.Be warned, this game will not be for everyone. It is still in Early Access, so a there are missing features, bugs and glitches (but that's to be expected). If these things strike a nerve, wait until the full game is released. Most of the glitches and bugs are easily avoided though; just use the F5 (quicksave key) often. Then when something does go wrong, you can automagically timewarp back and do it all again :)How I would sum up the world: Think Tatooine landscape filled with sword-wielding samurai and ninjas. No magic, no fantasy. It feels like it could be real (assuming it's on another planet :P).I love this game because of the grind. Sure, you have to sink in a lot of hours to get anywhere, but nothing matches the feeling of sheer satisfaction when you've built up a strong party, a well defended base and little stands in your way as a threat. The game was tough to learn, so you'll need to lean on the wiki for support for the first few hours at least. But once you've found your way it's all smooth sailing.My only real dislikes about the game are the bugs. The one that annoyed me the most was the teleporting 'dead' bandits. Watch out for these bad boys because despite being 'dead', they will teleport closer and closer to your storage buildings then loot your stuff. And no matter how many times you go to loot the stuff back off them, they will always win. F5 is the only way to save the day.Yet some of the bugs are more amusing than annoying... Like men sleeping like bats, hanging upside down off the sides of beds. Or shopkeepers within shopkeepers so they look like they have two faces, four eyes, two noses and four ears :PAll in all, if you like games that require a grind and can put up with weird stuff happening, dive right on in. It's worth more than you pay for it. If you like a grind but don't like glitches or blank buttons, wait for the full release. And if you don't like a grind, then this game is definitely not for you.			"

								ALPHA PREVIEW REVIEWAside from some crashes I had playing this title, This is a great concept in the work mainly done by one person so the updates can be a little slow but the game is awsome.Its basically a free roam survival rts with samurais and desert. I started off as a lone wonderer in this world before I was able to construct an entire squad each character named after the people who watched my stream, I had to be careful not to kill off my members as I work on them to become stronger so we can take on the cannibal village. In order to keep myself going the first thing I had to do was lure people to thier death and use town guards as my shield, eventually i built a mine, did some recruitment, and assigned people jobs, soon I had a full functioning village selling items from and creating weapons with close to 20 people. Training for our attack on the cannibals.With more work this game will be more and more amazing but it will not be done anytime soon. Its slowly getting better and better as time progress and is worth the value, I hope with support the author can focus on this game 100% full time and get things going because this is a real gem of an idea he has here+Samurai Squad base survival+recruit players, customize em and name them+awsome music+This game is plain fun watching your squad roll out in army+create your own town, start selling from your town, start a business from your town (still in the works but works really well)+the world is quite big and it all takes place in the desert+The animations during the combat is pretty sweet-Theres no real story to the game yet-Could use alot more buildings and thing sto do-Cant wait for more factions. need moar!-Bugs and crashes atm which causes me not to be able to progress too far when I have huge samurai battles-The graphics isnt the best thing in the world but he fun makes up for it.-Sometimes graphic and ai glitches out, like buildings halfway in sand etc+- This is a working title, my review and opinion will change as the game progresses but this is basically my ALPHA PREVIEW REVIEW "

								As a child, I improved rudementery reading skills with classic RPGs like Dragon Warrior 3, Shining Force, and Fire Emblem. These games were amazing, because in adition to cementing a sense of justice in a 5 year old, they presented a memorable plot, different forms of character development (DW3 with the personalities, where the personality determined stat increases, and was determined by initial stats. Shining Force with the stories told by your squadmates in the various bases found over the 8 chapters, as well as themes of amnesia. Fire Emblem for being, well, Fire Emblem.) None of that is in this game. Which makes it perfect.""Why would you tell that story to point out what it doesn't have?"" Simple: Kenshi has everything else that made those games personally iconic. From Dragon Warrior 3, you have each squad member being completely unique from creation, with nearly endless possibilities for customization, with an open world. From Fire Emblem, you have that strategic element, same with Shining Force. But with no 'level' or 'class' system, there are no restraints. I'll admit, I plan after writing this to re-create Shining Force in game, by creating each of the characters in order of appearance. That'll be fun!But it doesn't stop there. The combat is fluid, and the AI is great. Giving each limb, and core parts it's own hit points, and changing gameplay according to damage (and changing DAMAGE based on how you choose to heal it) is something more in-depth than most heavy LARP systems I've seen. You can build a base and be a group of peaceful farmers/traders (not that you need to eat). You can start a war with one faction (though I wouldn't reccomend it... ever), or become a group of mercenaries. The sandbox element is strong in this game.While the game is still in alpha, the groundwork has been set for so much more than is already released (as a player, I'd be fine if I had to deal with what i've got.) The few bugs that are in the game are minute and are easily bypassed with frequent quicksaves and game imports. The dev, while a little slow in getting the game out, is very careful to minimize bugs. A perfectionist, if you will.And this brings me back to that 5 year old playing those games for the first time, because while I can't play through those stories again, every click is another element that goes into a script playing in my head. While the characters may not interract on screen, they can be in the player's mind. As an adult, I've been a DM for a few years now, but Kenshi gives even more creative freedom to the player, which is the ultimate goal of an RPG. The only thing you can't do multiplayer, and i'm sure that by the time it gets to full release, it will have addressed that.This game can only be catagorised as a Sandbox/RPG/RTS/Simulation/Open World/Base Building Awesomeness. This is better than most games released today, and for the price, you'd be a fool NOT to pick it up. The true brilliance of this game is that there is a start point, but it is infinite. The end is wherever you choose to stop.			"

								""Toughness Stat - How to train:-Not wearing armor; armor is for wimps.-Getting hit for high amounts of damage, like a man.-Get up and fight when you should be playing dead.""Sold.You probably shouldn't play Kenshi. It is going to suck you in. Just walk away.JK... but not reallly.The thing crashes semi-frequently, and there are bugs such as the path-finding and character edge-sticking which reviews have mentioned, but these don't ruin it by far and are still in development (if your character is stuck in a wall, just tell another character to pick them up). Gameplay took some getting used to, as did the interface. Kenshi has a very balanced mechanic between RPG and RTS without feeling like either. More specifically, it somehow manages to combine the feel of Mount & Blade and Dwarf Fortress, with a little influence from Bioware-style party-management, into one intelligent video-game-gasm with some serious yet subtle attitude and atmosphere.The new content being talked about is going to expand upon what is already hours of playability. Apparently there are going to be new maps, beasts, quests, and I could even see more Mount & Blade-like politics with faction leaders (you listening, devs?), and mounts, or vehicles, and other characters, and maybe even a storyline, and then there's the modding community, and... and... let me stop.Enter the desert.

								This game has serious potential..  I've been playing it for a while now, and it's just gotten better.. great soundtrack and sounds have been introduced, more creatures and factions, excellent armor and clothing additions..  The creator seems genuinely passionate about his game..  I think this could be the real deal as far as early access goes.. (unlike MANY games out there just to make a buck and bail.)The game updates tend to take a while, but they're pretty keen on the news updates and where they are in development.The ""new"" map is HUGE(and it's less than half finished!).  Much larger than the original they came out with which was a bit overwhelming in itself, but they've included tons of stuff to keep your exploration bug at bay.If you're patient enough and up to the challenge and don't mind antiquated graphics, The real fun of this game is working yourself up from a nothing weakling loser getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked at every turn into a decked out, rich badass with one or several towns or cities to your name and an army to back you up.It still needs work of course.  I have a mental laundry list of stuff that could improve it, but if you're into this sort of thing, it's well worth checking out.			"

You walk 5 feet, hellhound, you die. You walk the other direction, bandits, you die. 7/10 Harder then Darksouls.//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////1/14/2016 The game is creeping along in development but still (in my mind) it has at least 3 more years before it can be relesased as a compelte game. Only Buy it if you wanna help the developers. As it stands you might get 4-6 hours of gameplay out of it before getting bored. I wait with my fingers crossed for more updates and nice tidbits of info.			"

								TL:DR, 10/10 well worth playing.. and playing again... and again.If Mount and Blade and Shogun: Total War had a baby, and that baby grew up to have a baby with Age of Empires 2... it would be close to this. Kenshi is gripping, it feels slow at the start but it's an amazing game once you crack the egg. Updates are coming thick and fast (at the time of writing) and it is a promising framework.			"

								This game is for RPG-Players. This game is for those who love Strategy games and building their own town. This game is for people who like freedom and a sandbox to live in. It's special, but if you really are a fan of all the above, you should get this game! First of all, in my opinion the graphics are pretty decent, especially for this type of a game. I know it's far beyond those knock off titles upcoming like Witcher 3 and Inquisition, but keep in mind it's not a pure RPG, you build your own cities and there can be way more NPC onscreen at the same time than you would imagine( I had a realy big battle with like 50+ NPC's, all fighting at the same time). The Audio is well...improvable to say the least, but hey it's still early access. Story: there is none! Or to explain it better: think of your own story, why are your characters here? What do they want to accomplish? And the most important question: why are they doing, what they are doing? Right now there are no quests, but they will be implemented, just like several guilds/parties/groups you will most likely be able to join(if I am not mistaken). The landscape of Kenshi is...monotous right now. You're traveling a pure desert, with many high mountains, but also some dunes. There are many cities controlled by NPC factions, most of them small, some are bigger.But for me the most interesting part is the sandbox part. You can litteraly build everywhere! I am not kidding. Only restrictions are terrain such as really high mountains and you're not allowed to build too close to an NPC city. So ever wanted to write your own story? Build your own little kingdom? Craft your own gear to quip your fighters? To send them on a conquest to foreign lands or people you do not like? Or do you just desire to trade peacefully? Or maybe, maybe you're the type of guy who wants to stay alone and take on a huge challenge by fighting all on your lonesome against hordes of bandits? Get it!			"

								This game is one of the most addicting games ive ever played. I got home from work and played for 7 hours straight without even realizing it. At first its weird and confusing with the whole ""No man character"" thing. But it grows on you an eventually it becomes normal. This game plays like no other game ive ever had. It mixes real time strategy with building, advancing characters, free roaming, trading, pretty much anything you imagine. Capture slaves and force them to work or sell them off, Create a legendary samarui squad, create a steel fortress, get eaten by cannable, anything you want to do is probably going to be in this game. Absolutely get it.			"

								This game has a LOT of people either in love with it, or not understanding how anyone could enjoy it.  Both ends of the scale have pretty good reasons for their decision.  The word potential gets thrown around quite a bit with this game, that's because it does have absurd potential for being massively awesome, but let's just focus on fixing the crashes first (they are much less frequent than they used to be, but still).  Crashing out of the game isnt that bad, the game autosaves already fairly frequently, and you can even increase how often it autosaves.  The combat is quite unique in that you dont directly control your squad while they fight, but their skills dictate how well they do.  Once you see a couple of well trained soldiers quickly work through an army of low skill bandits, you understand how awesome fighting can get.  But I do mean ""can get"", as you have to work your♥♥♥♥♥off trying to not get the crap kicked out of your guys until they can hold your own even against a few other enemies.  The game also has a basebuilding mechanic, with research and crafting, but in all honesty I haven't attempted it beyond ""I'm gonna build a house on this lovely mouintain"", so I don't really know how it all plays out or if it's even working.  The game has a cool trading method, go from town to town buying things for cheap and reselling them at the next town over where they don't have those items so you can sell 'em for a higher markup.  There are multiple starts in Kenshi, from being a naked man with a roughed up arm in the middle of the desert to 5 guys wanting to start a town, there are multiple fun ways to start the game off.  Character creation in Kenshi is interesting to say the least, it's not awful, but a lot of the sliders you just don't want to touch for risk of making your character very disproportionate so the armours and weapons dont look quite right.  I once made a midget named Hugo who wielded the biggest blade I could find, it always hovered near his hands and not in them.  Out of 352 games I can honestly say this game is one of my favourites, Kenshi is quite the experience and I feel like I didn't do the game justice with this review, because its either a game that you will love, or you'll disregard it forever.

								This is THE game for a gamer who is seriously into strategy/simulation.  I bought Kenshi on the steam sale, and instantly became hooked.  There is no friendly, happy, bunny mode.  You begin in one of the scenarios you choose. i.e. your starting squad and loadout, and instantly begin in an unforgiving world of sand ninjas, samurai, and desert drifters.  How you choose to proceed is up to you, and if you choose unwisely, you will die/fail.  No one to blame but your past.  If you don't rush into the desert wastes, put some thought into you development, and plan, there is a great chance you will succeed ... or at least not be bludgeoned too bad by hungry bandits.  Wait and admass a squad and income before trying to form your own town and you will be okay; if not you will have to fight like clint eastwood in an old western, but without the guys.  Great game for those with the patience to play it and overlook the occasional bug.  On this issue, updates are constantly coming out, and fixes come out even faster.  The Dev is doing a great job for it's small operation, and if you can handle the occasional stress of dealing with a bug and at the worst having to revert to the newest save or auto save, there is nothing too flawed about the game.I highly recommend it for any serious gamer.  If you can handle anything but immediate gratification, don't buy it; plain and simple. Just call downstairs to your mom for some more soda and pizza bites ... everything will be okay snookums’.			"

								Ok this is my first ever review. Normally i just let others do this for me but i like this game to much not to voice my opinion.I'm totally hooked on this game, it is very addicting. I like the whole explore and survive aspect of the first few hours as your building your squad. Than picking a spot to build your town and building and crafting it up is also very fun. There is a definate progression to all your skills that is satisfiying. I find the game in its current state to be completely playable for hours and am very excited for all the future game features to be added.  I've had minor problems with crashes and bugs and have found the import function on the load screen to be a very useful tool for resetting and eliminating most bugs.  All in all cant recommend this game highly enough.			"

								I discovered Kenshi five days ago. I have only been playing Kenshi for five days now.First and foremost: the game has many flaws. It's in beta and the bugs are numerous. You'll need to restart the game to alleviate some of these bugs, while others will need to be remedied by verifying the game cache.But it's all worth it.Kenshi draws me in and tickles a nostalgic part of my brain that is still in love with Star Wars Galaxies (pre combat revamp of course). The combat seems clunky at first but really just takes time to appreciate. You are not spoon fed. Your characters will be wounded, ensalved, imprisoned and killed. And you'll continually become stronger and smarter because of it.Building your own camp is fun. Turning that into a village is great. Becoming the architect of your own city that can be seen from the alien horizon is what it's all about.Buy this game at full price. Have some patience and allow Kenshi to grow on you. This is a special title. Don't miss out on it.			"

								Wow, that guy has a 5000 cat bounty? Alright, I just recruited 2 people from a nearby bar and outfitted them with armor from that group of desperate, starving bandits. Its time to make some money!It's just one dude, we can take him.""Retreat! Retreat!"" as I fall with a katana buried in my back, blood staining the sand.Hours later, I awake. It's dusk. One of my companions lies merely a dozen yards from me, barely breathing. The other is no where to be found. I grit my teeth as I throw Brigand over my back and silently pace towards the city with as many samurai as citizens. The city lights are guiding me. I'm nearly there. I can see the light glint off of the helmets of the samurai warriors. Behind me, I hear footsteps. Many footsteps. As I turn, fifteen screaming bandits are taking positions around me. I drop Brigand to the sand and unsheath my rusty sword. In a moment, I feel a myriad of blades tear into my flesh. My vision started to swim and I could feel death creeping upon me, slowly yet surely. Another moment later, the bandits are routing as the Samurai crash into their ranks. With my last breaths, I carried my companion to the inn, and placed him on a bed. I didn't make it more than five feet before I feel to the ground. There just wasn't enough blood to keep me standing. May Brigand find better fortune than I in this world.			"

								Why should you get this game? 84 hours in six days is not enough reason?Then let me tell you my Kenshi story:I never buy games which are not as special somewhere.So when I wanted to try Kenshi - again like some months or years ago - I got the demo from the website of the developer.When a demo exists it normally means that the developer thinks peoplewill like his product even after trying it. Self confidence.I tried the demo and played it for - I don't know - two or three days.Then I realized, I want the whole game, the actual update, I got the game,even if there was no special. I don't do that. Never. Normally.Demo play:I already know that I am not the hero in this game. So I know I have to take it slowly.I start in rags in a large desert. I run around until I get to a small village in the mountains.With all my money I hire a guy to follow me.Now we hang around town and whenever the town gets attacked we loot the bodies and sell the stuff.With the money I get more guys and some backpacks.During one of attacks one of the police officers dies.I take one look at his armor and weapon and decide: MINE!When I bring back the loot, walking proud in my new shiny armor a police officer yells at me:""Where did you get that armor?""Then he attacks me.My friends of course try to help me, but we are no match for the police officers of the village who regularly defend the village against large groups of villains.We lie there unconscious and bleeding with many wound to different parts of our bodies.After a while one of us becomes conscious again and treates himself and all of us until we are not bleeding anymore.Then he takes one of us on his shoulders, carries him to the next inn and puts him into a bed.Then he does it for the rest of us and at last puts himself to sleep too.The beds are kind of costly for me at this point so I decide I want my own house with some beds.The next days we just loot and save the money until we can buy a small house and put there some sleeping bags.Now we can use the accelerated healing rate of sleeping in a bag without having to pay for it.It is time to expand. We are so arrogant, we have no idea what we are going to get into.We take the best loot of some days as armor and weapons and some med kits and venture towards another city.Some time into the desert a horde of bandits comes running towards us.Ha, small game, we think. We saw them slaughtered on a daily basis at the village gates.They slaughter us. We lie there unconscious and bleeding with many wound to different parts of our bodies.Again.So, again the first of us who can move again starts healing the others.Then the bandits come back.They hit all walking guys again until they walk no more and start looting us.They take nearly everything.Then they march away.One comes running back and takes some more stuff from us before he follows his friends.We nearly don't make it back to the village. Some have to be carried, some can only hobble because they have serious wounds at their legs, some can not carry others because they have wounds at their arms.We were defeated but we are better in some areas like fighting and toughness.When we are able to move again I decide to go back to looting but I will send one guy without armor or weapons to run as fast as possible to the next city to start a second base there.While he is running down the next mountain some dogs start to chase him for a while and I am thinking I'll lose him.But he gets to the next city.I decide, I need the full game....The real game.Grass! Trees! Animals!Man, the difference is stunning.I start in a very small settlement of the Holy Nation, just two houses, some fields and a well.I have nothing and can't do a lot here but steal or attack and I want to be nice.So I decide to go to the next village.I wander the street when I encounter a patrol of the Holy Nation. Looks nice and powerfull that patrol.They approach me: ""What god do you worship?""Me: ""none"".Wrong answer. They beat me senseless and continue their patrol. At least they did not try to loot me.Even if I have nothing, I don't like to get looted.Now I am angry. I limp parallel to the path back to the settlement.When I get near the settlement, I start to sneak and check for guys with weapons.I get back into the settlement, always ready to run, aehm limp, away.Everything is allowed now. I steal everything I can. I see one guy with a backpack. I want it. So I can steal more!Hitting people when I am sneaking gives me a chance to knock them out.That is the skill assassination. I am very bad at it.But the peasants of this evil religion will be the first receivers of my wrath.I train knocking people out until I am very good at it.Then I get my backpack. My first backpack. All mine.I gather (steal) some more things and again decide it is time to move to another location.This time I stay away from the street and move carefully through the wilderness.When I get to a village it is not a village but a city. Large walls around lots of large buildings and many heavily armed and armored guards at the entry.I approach them, fearing the worst. This time no questioning and no attacks.I move into the city and sell my stuff at the first vendor I find.Big mistake.He recognizes the stuff as stolen from his own empire and calls the guards.They beat me senseless AGAIN and put me into prison.A cage inside one of their military buildings.I pick the lock and run away.I hide from the guards until I am no longer ""escaped"" but just someone with a bounty.Not everyone reacts to bounties every time.For some money a guy will join me.Silly me. The first guy I hire is not a human so the whole ""Holy Nation"" hates him.Very often we get insulted, traders don't trade with him and sometimes he will just get attacked and imprisoned for not wanting to be rebirthed. No idea what it is, but it does not sound good.I started to live in this city but the racist religion here got on my nerves, I decided to get to another race which was supposed to live in the south.So I ran south, swam in the river, outrun bandits and animals.When I was out of food and my swimming skill had reached level 30 I reached the border of the currently reachable area. No other race. Via forum I found I had to go west. So to the west I went.Hills, deserts, bandits. The bandits got me. I survived and hobbled towards the area where I thought the other race to be.On the map I got a marker for a village of the other race. I was nearly there. Then I got attacked by a group of animals which ate me....New life.I am this time near a even smaller settlement.Nearby is some iron, so I decide to start a small settlement here.First I will need building materials.So I create a stone mine and start to build a machine which creates construction material from stone.Not enough construction material for the machine.I need money. I mine the ore mine and sell the ore to elder of the nearby settlement.The settlement is attacked very often by dogs and bandits, I just loot the bandits and dogs and cook the dog meat so I don't get hungry and everything is kind of right.While mining some ore I get attacked by two dogs, they make me bleed so bad, my status changes from ""bleeding"" to ""dying"", all the while being unconscious.A patrol of the Holy Nation marches on the nearby street, but I am out of sight for them. They march on.I die....New life.Because of the size of the story I have to link to a post, so if you wish to continue reading, go there:http://steamcommunity.com/app/233860/discussions/4/343788552533488306/ "

								Disclaimer: as soon as the devs have finished this product, I will most likely change this recommendation to a whole-hearted ""Yes.""Kenshi is a game that contains much of what I've been wanting to see combined in open world rpgs for years: a totally open world, completely freeform squads, strategic gameplay with limb-damage, character progression, and the ability to easily break up or become seperated from your units. Actually, that last one was something I didn't even know I wanted until I played this game. In a game like Mount & Blade, failure means capture and the loss of most of your equipment and probably all of your units, and you are tied to the unit that captured you without options or variation. When my characters were knocked out by cannibals in Kenshi, my main character was left behind while the two units I had aquired by that point were taken to the cannibal's camp. Eventually, my character recovered enough to limp towards the nearest town, while my units were forced to despirately try to pick the locks of thier cages. One unit escaped, one didn't. The world of Kenshi allows for variation in losing, including the possibility of death for your main character if too much damage is taken. The result is strangly thrilling, and as I watched my unit desperately flee the cannibal camp with enemies running after her, I knew I had stumbled upon a game of great possibility.Unfortunitly, Kenshi remains too unfinished a possibility. The event I just described was the highlight of my several hours of playtime. At the moment there are no quests in Kenshi. You can build buildings, but there is no guarentee that the buildings will carry over to new versions of the game. My only goal is to build up the strength to get revenge for the unit that was killed by the cannibals. After that's done, I'll simply have no reason to keep playing.Buy only if you want to support the developers.Gameplay:

								My first adventure in this game was one with lots of questions and involved a lot of reading on my part. Though the mechanics of  this game seem cruel I feel greatly rewarded when I survive an attack against bandits or get my characters' skills up.I had started as a survivor, looking at my war buddy as I woke from a losing battle. Though he looked to be healing alright he was still unconcious and we where a long ways from any city. It took some time for me to manag(figure out) how to carry the larger man but I had managed and began walking my way towards a city. I had noticed two bandit groups skirmishing just a little distance away from me.After getting to the city I was able to buy a mercenary to help me go and pick up some salvagable equipment from the battle that I had seen on the way over. WIth the money from that equipment I hired a medic and we waited for my friend to wake up. Two days later he wakes up and we set out for another town. Two more people joined up and we moved on to another town. After fending off some badits and sand ninjas he limped out way into the Holy City of Sharks where four more people joined up. We had a large group now so we thought it would be  smart idea to build our own city. Two days later in the middle of the desert we where lost to the sands.Though my group met a tragic end at the hands of cannibals I was still able to enjoy the hours long playthrough. I learned alot abou thta tfirst one and am going to put that to good use in my next playthrough. I would deffinately recommend this game to hardcore RPG and stategy game fans.Edit:PLaying this game on and off and loving every minute of it. The game gets better and better each time it's updated. Though I will say that I wish they would bring back certain scenarios such as the survivor one where you and an ally survive a fight. I found that one to be the most fun but I still enjoy the new content to a great deal. Keep up the good work and listening to the players!			"

								They just did a fairly decent update, but after many months i'm not impressed.  Now if they ever fix it so npcs spawn in towns so you can hire more squad members instead of having to import to a new game everytime and then bugging your town such as the walls allowing npcs to walk through them after you import for example, would be a great first start. Until then, however....NO.  They said they plan to polish it and work on stabilizing soon someday, so maybe when they start doing that i can change my review back to yes as I had it when i first got the game and ignorant of how long this game has been in development, thinking it was just a couple weeks old and not 2 or 3 years at the time. So now we are heading into year 5?  I do like the game concept,gameplay and the genre of this kind. I believe this game is more likely to become abandoneware than a finished game as slow as its getting developed.  That is why I say NO.6/3/16. The last month included a lot of fixes and such, you still have to import your game to new game if you want to hire more squad members.  Prisoner cages are still bugged, you can pick lock them with prisoners, and they still ask to be set free even though its unlocked. Most of them don't even talk to you.  I just crashed the game by dismantling a small shack.  So although they keep adding new content, which is a plus for any game, except when they ignore fixing what they already have. So I must keep a no recommendation, until they show development that counts.6/15/16 New map, hurray! Now if you only play the game without it crashing. I can't say much for this update, since the game crashes soon after you start playing it. Maybe in a month or two or this fall they will have a fix for it.			"

Early Access Review
								From what I've consistently seen from early access games, as soon as they go on special, the creators lose any financial motivation to continue development. I rarely give bad reviews, but there's no way in hell I'm letting them get away with this.Conceptually, this game is amazing and full of potential. It's the closest thing we have to a Mount and Blade clone. However, with so many years in development and such trivial updates, I've come to realize this will never be a finished, quality product, ESPECIALLY now that it's on special, and it's nothing more than a buggy sandbox with few ways to interact with the world around you. I haven't seen such terrible development constipation since Cortex Command.Please do NOT encourage such dishonest business practices.			"

								Built new city in the 0.90.x beta. Got attacked by bandits. A lot. Slavers found my recovering squad members. Forced to watch as the characters I affectionately named after family members were taken away in chains. Goodbye, Ryan. Enjoy your time in the minesMade new game as a wanderer. Turned him into a Master Thief. Robbed every store in town. Stole Arms and Armor off guards and racist Paladins. Hoarded supplies and money in a Thieves Den (S****y little shack I bought for *almost* as much as a loaf of bread). Hired Mercs with thieving profits. Built new town with stolen supplies. Recruited army and Hired more Mercs.Battled first slaver patrol I found. Stole all their s**t and dragged their bodies into the river to drown.11/10 would thieve and murder again.			"

The best part is where you can build up a settlement and hopefully they will add onto that aspect, which im sure they will. For me Kenshi is a all-around fun game to dive into adventures, base building, trading, and anything you can think of doing!			"

They started with the sandbox (which is where they could have stopped as far as I'm concerned) and then started adding stuff! Grow a farm, mine for ore, learn how to make stuff, wander around and kill bandits, do whatever you want! Lo-Fi games is very good about updating fans, and they listen to comments. So check it out! Get in on the ground floor! Enjoy!			"

Early Access Review
								When I first saw this game, thought it was gonna be a M&B: Warband clone, only in a Asian setting, and that sounded great. But what this game is, is so much more, or at least potentially.You create a character in a post apocalyptic feudal Japan-ish world, and from there your on your own. You can be a merchant, thief, shop owner, start your own town/outpost, craft your own weapons and armor, build different kind of functional buildings, research technology to build/craft even better stuff. You can train in fighting, stealth, repairing etc. by doing what ever you want to train in. Recruit squad members as bodyguards or as part of your personal mercenary group/army and control and train each person individually.At first the game had sub-par GFX (It still not great, but aesthetically pleasing) and no sound, but bear in mind it was still in pre-alpha (currently in alpha), the graphics have improved since, and there is sound now. On top of that new major features keep being added every few months.I bought the game when it was still $10, and it feels like an investment. I play it for a couple of months, when I come back after, say six months, more features are in and feels more polished every time. A few new major features (64bit engine, dialogue, overhauled pathfinding, animals/beasts and a new larger map with biomes) are planned for the near future. They already mentioned the beta in their latest progress update, price will probably go up again. In its current state (28/09/2014) the game is already very enjoyable, so buy it now while it's still in it's alpha pricing $20.PSI only started to play the game on Steam recently, my actual playtime should be more than 100 hours, maybe way more, I don't keep track realy :)			"

								Kenshi is pretty fun, once you get into it. There is plenty of RPG-like qualities to Kenshi. A number of startup scenarios/ character equipment loadout, can push you towards certain playstyles:   Wanderer is the basic default character.   Settlers begin with a group of different characters together, along with building materials to start your own town.  My personal favorite has to be the Ninja/Thief: the game starts you off as a ""Hungover"", pantless Thief, who has been sold into slavery while you were passed out from a night of binge drinking. In essence you need to breakout of the labor camp and steal stuff to pay off the slavers to become a free man/woman.			"

There aren't any spiders in the current map, I just wanted to mention it.			"

								I'm writing this for the beta version 0.91.4Now that a small part of the new world map is out I can say that this game is starting to be very fleshed out and there is more land and features to be added (diplomacy being a big one) that will make this even greater game.In the beginning you are weak, unskilled and most often alone. You will be caught stealing or end up pummeled by even lowliest of bandits or beasts. You can even starve to death or be kidnapped by slave traders if you get unlucky. In the worst case you may even end up being eaten alive.If you or whats left of your squad survive you may eventually develop to become strong adventurers, skilled thieves or rich enought traders to hire mercenary squad to protect youself. Eventually you may be able to set up a base of your own where you can farm your own food (if animals don't eat it and you're able to kill them), build walls around it and craft your weapons and armor.I recommend this for anyone interested in a survival game in a fantasy world with added RPG elements.

Early Access Review
								Within the cesspool of Early access rubbish we get over the recent years, the ugly cash-ins and depressing situations whereby a game is never fully released ever.. Comes this little gem in a desert of emptiness that is Kenshi.Honestly I don't even know where to start. So I shall just wing this. Been playing it for awhile now, a long while and I honestly feel this deserves my personal recommendations to anyone who loves this genre. Let us get down to it, firstly with the cons of the game.1. There's barely any story.Over time, more and more things are added, dialogue bits and now little things here and there, but in a story perspective, it's still very little. Things are getting more fleshed out overtime so we will see things get better in that regard.2. Can still be a bit buggy.It's still early access, things are being added, things get glitchy after being added, balancing still needs some tuning but all is to be expected. Stable version is as expected more stable. (The trespassing of property still needs some work!)2. No multiplayer.This is a single player game, I'm only putting this here for two reasons. One, multiplayer would be quite awesome. Two, I'm lacking of cons to write!Now for the pros of this game.1. Very well done sandbox.It is a sandbox through and through.. You can do almost anything within the game mechanics limitations. You can kill anyone, you can steal from anyone, you can just be a trader, you can essentially be many things or nothing at all! Hell you can even build your own city!2. Combat is straight forward and fun too.Straight forward in the sense you click, and you attack, kind of like diablo without any skills. But your attacks are all sweeps and it's range is dependant on weapon of choice. big♥♥♥♥♥weapon slows you down, slows down your attacks but you hit more people with each swing! Your defense/offense/dodge all grow as you fight more! Your strength grows if you keep carrying heavy stuff! 3. Skills!All your skills grow with more usage! The more you do the same thing the better you are at it in most cases. Though contribuiting factors come into play. Your speed is slowed down by weight, your strength grows by carrying heavy things.. Your offense gets better the more you attack, the defense gets better the more you defend, ectera!4. Choices.A plethora of choices for you to pick, all of which comes around. Do you want to be purely a trader and rely on hired guards? By all means! Do you wanna be a warrior of the lands, heroically killing bandits!? Or become a bandit yourself! All of which requires some kind of sacrifice. A trader sacrifices the money to hire in trade for their safety through the lands. A warrior needs to go through a lot of training to get anywhere decent! And an army of bandits = bad news anyway. In the end you can sort out your group of folks for some to be good at something and others to be good at other things!5. Survival.It is hard, the world is harsh. Wild animals will kill you, bandits will kill you, all of that adds up. But you may not die when you get defeated! You have a blood pool, and every limb has an amount of damage you can take. If you were completely healthy, 90% of the time you don't die, you just pass out. To which you can play dead, or wake up and make a run for it! Just becareful of animals, slavers or cannibals. Animals will nom on you like cannibals. Slavers will enslave you! Training is crucial, so is running! But you can check out the guides for more details! 6. Mods and modding kit!I'm always supportive of mods and modding communities, they make the game different with mods and you can pick whatever mods to suit your game! :DAll in all it's an amazing game that proves there's hope in the industry for something cool to come out! :D "

								One of the best sandbox Squad Based RPG's ever made. I've put over 200+ hours into this game so far and I feel like I'm just getting started!In Kenshi, you start out by yourself or with a few others (depending on your game start), hungry, and alone in one of the largest hand crafted game worlds I've ever seen. Your first priority is to find food. Steal it, hunt for it, or trade for it. Encounter a vast population of creatures some of which are docile, and others who are aggressive and will eat you! With currently over 30 factions some larger than others, all who have their own personalities and goals. The Holy Nation hates any non-human race. Be prepared to fight their enslavement if you are of another race in their territory. Travel to the swamplands, and find yourself battling Swamp Ninjas, and other factions fighting to control the area. Travel to the far south, and encounter mercenaries that will rough you up if you don't pay them.Hire new companions, equip them with weapons and armor, and train their fighting skills to survive in this world.Become a slaver. Capture enemies, and sell them as slaves. Slavers will slave you if they find you knocked out, and you are forced into slavery until you escape.Become a warrior/ninja, conquer all who oppose you or die in the attempt.Become a bounty hunter, and find bounties worth a lot of money and bring them to justice.Become a thief, and steal from everyone. Get caught stealing, and get thrown in prison. Escape prison, and become wanted. Fight off bounty hunters that will eventually hunt for you.Become a farmer, and sell produce, or illegal goods to other factions. Get caught smuggling into a city and you'll go to jail.Build multiple bases anywhere! Choose from a large amount of buildings, do research to build new buildings and items. Craft your own weapons and armor. Create high walls with turrets to protect your base from attacks from rival factions.Or:You can do all of the things I listed in the same game. You can do whatever you want, but be prepared for the consequences!Kenshi is truely a unique, and remarkable game that deserves your money.			"

								Man I hate this game, It's soo good I can't stop playing... there is so much depth to Kenshi that no video or review will ever do this game justice.If you are on the fence about buying Kenshi and consider yourself to have a medium level of patience, just go ahead and do it.. you won't be sorry.Make no mistake... Kenshi is a hard mistress, she will beat and enslave you... a lot, She will starve you and steel all your♥♥♥♥♥♥when you're laying there dying... a lot, She will surround your small outpost with religeous fanatics who will call all your females harlots and require them to perform ""special"" services in their temples... a lot.But hey, what doesn't kill you can only make you stronger right? - and that's where this game shines for me, knowing that while all this crap is raining down on you that your revenge is going to be ah so glorious... if you survive.Lastly, I have to mention the Devs at Lo-Fi are amazing and the support they offer the (also amazing) Moding community here is exceptional "

								Kenshi is a massivly open world RTS/RPG hybrid that brings to the RTS genre what I've always wanted to have.  I have been following the progress of this game for a long time now and I can tell you the developer is not giving up on this game.  In fact, the game has grown from beiing produced by a one man team for the first 6 or more years (Chris The Great A.K.A. Captian Deathbeard) to a full fledged indie studio.  Progress has picked up a lot recently with the new AI, Creatures, and a new World Map 4X bigger than the current one (which is massive already) with much much  more than just the desert and mountains biomes we have now.  Each character in your crew levels up differently, has their own inventory and skill levels and can be fully controlled seprately.  You can fight stuff, start a village, mine things, research new buildings and things to put in buildings, keep training your men (or an awesome team of Charlie's Angle style girls with a mysterious leader who they've never seen like I did).  Your village can grow into a massive city through tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of work, but it's all worth it in the end.  Have a lone solider or command an army of unstoppable awesomeness (or sexiness).  Don't let the low number of hours fool you, I must have had over 100 hours on the pre-steam alpha release.  I haven't been playing it too much lately mostly because I'm going to do a brand new start when the new massivly updated map comes into beta in the summer, and the fact that there is currently an annoying random crash bug that happens when wandering far distances, so keep hitting F5 to autosave every few minutes.  Those things aside, this game is definately worth $20 and I suggest you get it now because I have a feeling when the new map comes out this summer, the price might raise to $25-$30.  I got it when it was $10 and it was the best 10 bucks I've ever spent online.   Just remember to have patience, and death is permanent.			"

								Great for those that enjoy a true sandbox RPG with plenty of swordfighting and a large amount of city-building available.Updating this review now that I have more time dedicated to write it.This is going to be a very patchwork comparison of Kenshi to other games that a potential buyer may, or may not, already own, and I will detail my personal experiences for you all to read, or not. :DSo, Kenshi is a squad-based RPG (think of Dawn of War 2, but each individual character in the squad has their own D&D-style character sheet) with some RTS elements (specifically the capability of building structures and researching technologies to unlock new structures, items, and upgrades) that puts a strong emphasis on open-ended gameplay (many puns to be had playing a sandbox game set in the desert).The Kenshi-verse (name of the world chosen by several members of the community, including myself) is an original creation with influences from the Edo Period in Japan (weapons and armor models are influenced by the samurai of that time, and it has been confirmed there will be no weapons relying on gunpowder or later technologies, just pure swordplay with some ranged combat and unarmed combat to come in the future).You, as a new player, get to choose from one of multiple starting points (i.e. a trader, retired soldier, etc.), and each starting point essentially grants the player a specific character(s) that have certain advantages and disadvantages.Keep in mind that there is a very strong emphasis on open-ended gameplay, so any of these starting points can be molded and shaped to create the character(s) that you will enjoy most.Regardless of the starting point chosen, your character will start at, or close to, rock bottom with little more than a rusty blade and the clothes on your back.The point of this is that your character(s) will grow and gain experience in the numerous skills and attributes (the # of skills and attributes currently available (17) appear to be about half of what is planned for the final release) by performing activities that are related to that skill.Things such as carrying a heavy load or swinging a heavy weapon in combat will improve your Strength, whereas wielding a lighter weapon will increase Dexterity.Even at the farm, crafting weapons/armor, picking locks, or simply running laps around town will increase their corresponding skills (btw, each of these actions I listed apply to unique skills).Once your starting point is chosen, you are then introduced to a rather in-depth character creation screen.This character creation screen allows you to choose either gender as well as modify hair, eyes, skin, muscle tone, height, weight, girth, bust, and most importantly, facial hair.After creating your character, it is possible to find an NPC called the Plastic Sugeon (should be at least 1 in every NPC town) that will allow you to modify any character in your squad using this character creation screen (it goes without saying this emphasizes the sandbox part even more).After you're satisfied with your character, then explore the Kenshi-verse to your heart's content!I say this because the current world (which is nothing but desert) has been confirmed to be less than 1/4 of the actual Kenshi-verse, AND this new world map is currently in the works as I am typing this.Some basic control shortcuts to help new players get started:Shift+LMB stack of multiple items = Allows player to pick up whole stacks of itemsHold RMB over any character = Brings up a list of all the actions that can be performed on this character (NPC or PC)The rest of the basic controls are either given to you at the start of gameplay or can be found, and rebound, in the Options -> Controls menu.Another HUGE part of Kenshi that I haven't even touched yet is modding.Kenshi has been developed from its core to allow extensive modding so that each player can have an even more unique experience.To my knowledge, there are mods available that:Add new weapons/armor to the Kenshi-verseAdd dialogue, and dialogue trees, to NPCs (which bring a large variety of things from quests to mercenaries, and I think its also possible to edit existing dialogue to read in other languages)Add structures to Kenshi and modify their functional components (things such as a structure's capability to receive an item to Input and produce an Output from it or to allow the mass Storage of a certain item)Modify components of NPCs in various ways (things such as # of bandits in each squad, add entire NPC towns, change ownership of an existing town from one faction to another)Among many, many other mods that have already been produced by the Kenshi community.There are also numerous, well-detailed tutorials available for any user to learn how to mod Kenshi in less than a day's worth of time.Anyone that has read this far should go to:www.lofigames.comand check out all of the information available there.Be sure to click on the Roadmap tab at the top to see everything that is planned and when it will be implemented.Oh, and you should totally join in the conversations on the Forums (I'm on there a lot ;D).Chris, THE dev and programmer of Kenshi, also posts regular updates to his twitter page as well as screenshots at:www.twitter.com/lofigames "

								As much as I want to like this game, after so many years in development and the current state it's in I'm done hoping. The idea is great and the style is there, but that's where it's ended and stayed practically from the get-go.Let's face it - Kenshi has been in development for about 10 years now and it's still riddled with issues. Crashes, poor UI, lack of versatility (can't even change font size), and instead of working on these basic issues the devs re-design the entire map, which is arguably no better than the original. I know the dev team is tiny, if not just one person, and they are consistently working on the game, but after such a long time in development I was hoping to see some polish. Instead it feels just like when I first bought it.Suggestion to the dev(s) - I'm sure the money must be drying up now and this suggestion is probably very late, but money makes money and you have to invest to do business. Hire someone else that's good at what you're not, or you are never going to finish this game.			"

								Look, you either like open-ended, experimental sandbox games or you don't. If you do, you'll be able to look past this game's bugs and its current lack of content. If you don't, stop reading and go back to COD. Contrary to what some other reviewers are saying, this game is updated regularly, but you might have to opt in to the unstable build to see it. They've also been working on an entirely new world map which is due out soon. Over the past year they've added animals, slavery, formations, a new race, and many other systems and features, not to mention improving the pathfinding dramatically. The game is very different from when I purchased it a couple years ago and I think it shows a ton of promise.			"

								I've been following this game since before it was even on Desura, and I was excited for the longest time. I waited and waited and waited for significant changes to the playability of the game and have had a lot of fun in Kenshi. Sadly, after so many years I have to say that I do NOT recommend this game. Until the creator decides that fixing longlasting bugs and upgrading the animations, graphics, and UI are more important than adding broken features like slavery and thievery, I will continue to not recommend this game. The fact that he has made so much less progress on this game than others I have followed for the longest time is honestly depressing.I don't know if this game will ever reach the potential I hoped it would. Stay away.			"

								So.. Kenshi.I've been following this game for a while now that I completely forgot that it existed and also forgot how long I've been waiting on this game.I remember a time when the game was bugged when your desert turned into grass for some odd reason, weirdly deformed bodies using the character editor, green American football-looking gear as armor and even using building blueprints as walls because walls didn't exist.So how is it now? Amazing. This game now looks bloody amazing when I had a look, the desert looks a lot like a proper desert now. There's better buildings to construct, its got better stability and less bugs. You can steal, build proper fortresses, hire many more squad members into your empire. Heck, there are even animals in the game added in.The gameplay itself is.. A little bit repetitive(Note: only a little). You charge a bandit down, watch the fight, get absolutely smashed, get back up again, then charge a different bandit until you get strong enough to beat them down. However, this is not the whole game. In Kenshi, there are quests to do, stuff to loot, civilians to save from cannibals, cities to pillage, robbing dying people in the desert then patching them up etc. There's plenty of things to do, you just have to decide which ones you want to do. It's free-roam after all.Now this game isn't complete yet and even if it is has less bugs that doesn't mean it doesn't exist but it at least means there's still progress within the game. The developers take their time in this and I admire them for taking it slow, albeit a bit too slow. But the fact that I still see progress in 4? 6 years? is simply a testament to the love they have for the game and developing a game itself.Seriously, thank you, for being one of the Early access games that I've bought and still not abandoned after all this time.P.S. I voted this for the 'I thought this game was cool before it won an award' award on this. Partly, the reason why I made a review just now. :P			"

								Where to start. I can honestly say Kenshi is an addiction for me. It just keeps pulling me back in. The devs have taken the effort to keep this game user firendly all through the development and updates by providing an import feature. Even with the addition of the new world I was able to import and to this day I am still running the same squad I started with countless moons ago.Yes, it is early access.Yes there have been times where It has been very frustrating because I need my Kenshi fix but the latest patch crashes on game start. ( usually fixed very quickly and often even on weekends)Yes the optimization is pretty poor depeneding on the in game viewpoint. (Top down view runs fairly smooth on my rig while traveling across the map)Yes there are issues that come and go regarding AI pathing and implementation of the crafting tasks.BUTIs there anything I just mentioned that you wouldn't expect from an Early Access game?The devs always keep a stable branch available that you can play if the experimental branch is too annoying for your tastes.The modders have done a fantastic job of filling in with content that that hasn't been implemented or has changed, sometimes not for the better during  development.it IS difficult and testing of your faith in the beginning. There is no hand holding and your character is no born hero. Just a lowly Joe and everyone will hurt you. But that's the hook. As your character begins to grow and learn there is great satisfaction when you take down the first bully and take all his s**t for your personal use.Satisfaction building your first outpost building.Satisfaction when your researcher discovers a new technology.Satisfaction when your armorsmith or weaponsmith finally creates a noteworthy item.Satisfaction when you complete the last wall and lock your base gate feelling you have created a secure home for your squad.I say this because none of it will come easy and after all of the hours invested you begin to care for your squad. They have worked to become something possibly great and when they get hurt there is a real feeling of anxiety when a member is on the verge of death, laying unconcious and being eaten alive by cannibals or local wildlife.It has been a long drawn out process and the development still continues. There is no story, you become what you choose. Befriend factions, make enemies with entire factions, your choice.If you like long term gameplay (like Eve online) where there is no quick win and you  take pride in what you can achieve over many, many hours then I say by all means it's worth every penny.  If you have no patience and are easily pushed to rage quit, then please purchase to support the devs for ME! and play something else. hahaGood Luck in the world of Kenshi "

								This is probably one of the most unique games on steam because of the endless choices given to the player and the amount of reward and punishment that come with each choice, I'll give a few examples:-If you decide to hone your combat skills choose carefully who you pick your fights with, the stronger your oponent is the faster you will gain on skill, infact losing the fight will make you tougher and stronger than winning it, but this is not always the smarter choice since the world is filled with cannibals, slavers and monsters that prey on laying bodies, so getting knocked out sometimes means you will lose more than the fight (kidnapped,chained,sold off, eaten alive, etc).-If you decide to settle down and build a base learn who and what roams around the territory where you build, you might get harassed by racist/sexist factions who want to take your non-human and female workers as slaves and will raid you if you don't cooperate, or you might have bandits and monsters trashing your gates and slaughtering your workers and farms constantly. (this made me rage quit a few times, but it is so rewarding when you finally get to stand on your own and hunt down all these mother***ers.)-If you become a trader and make enough cats(ingame currency name) you can hire really powerful mercenaries to act as bodyguards to keep your business clean, and have a slave serve you some homemade sake and rum at the commodity of your tower while someone else run your bar, shop, armory or whatever business you own.-If you just want to live as an adventurer and explore the world you might find hidden ruins with unique treasures and weapons that sell for insane prices or an outpost at the ends of the world owned by some most wanted criminal that has an outrageous bounty on his head.The list goes on but is hard to describe everything you can do in this game because it is almost up to your imagination, mechanic-wise it has few limitations. I started the game in 2013-14ish but it became unplayable because of the constant crashes, now that the crashing and most of the bugs are gone the game it's starting to show it's true potential,  if you are a fan of this type of game you are missing on a lot even though it's still on beta. The game has a steep learning curve, I recommed watching some of the recent tutorials and gameplay videos on youtube because those on steam are outdated and don't even show half of the things you can do in the game mechanic-wise.

								0.92 version patched ---the current versionKenshi is a different kind of game. It's a a squad based survival type game in a different land. Players can start in different game options but the main idea is to aquire other squad mates ( 30 Max. More with mods ), train is skills, research new technologies, build bases, farms, ore processors *er* processers, make weapons, armor, clothing....etc. You can even build booths for NPC's to buy your stuff. And of course new technologies mean new buildings and things to make. All the while, their are various factions that are either neutral to you or are trying to kill you. Combat is realtime with small battles up to huge armies (well like hundreds * w/ mods*). Various body parts can become injured and it will have a real effect ie. leg badly damaged? your character limps..arm nearly cut off? it dangles on your body. Your characters will lose conciousness before dying and depending on the severity of the wounds may just bleed out. However someone may heal you or pick up your unconcious body. This may be a bad thing. See, there are slavers and cannibals. If slavers capture you, you'll be hauled off to the nearest city and put in a cage, or forced to join another groups faction (as a slave). If cannibals capture, you will also be put in a cage...but they plan on eating you. Its not game over here in either scenario as you may be able to pick the lock and sneak out of the cage and make a run for it. Better find some food though, your characters can and will starve. A neat graphic here is if your character starts to starve...you will start to see the physical effects on them...ie ribs start showing, arms and legs start to get skinny...Now keep in mind you may have many characters, so if one gets hauled off to a slave camp, your other characters can go free him. Also characters can be assigned jobs, which the AI handles quite Nicely. A farmer may plow a field put the farmed material (there are several things you can grow) in a container, obtain water from a well, water the crops, and resume farming if there are still plants to be reaped. And thats just one job. Impressed? Thats not even close to all you can do in Kenshi.As read my review I realize I sound like a DEV of the game. I can assure you I most certainly am not. I am not exaggerating one iota about the tons of stuff you can do.Note: Kenshi has been in development for a long, long time. I have had this game for over 2 years. Things didn't always work right. Because of this there are some bad reviews. But I encourage anyone who played in the past to pick up on it again. Gone is that slow laggy game, replaced with a smooth as silk gaming experience. Still lags when changing regions though.The one negative comment I have is there is no verbal dialogue. It's not terrible or anything but it makes the world kinda flat. Now I'm 50 years old so of course I've played tons of great games with no dialogue. It's just a wish of mine to enhance the world. Also quest would be nice, but I LOVE sandbox games.I STRONGLY reccomend this game. It's really fun and different and coming together nicely now. For me 9/10.So thats it. I'm going back to the land of Kenshi now.....Cheers all			"

								I've been waiting on this game to become playable for like 4 years now. The developer obviously has never had any clear direction in mind for this game. It's just a case of throwing random♥♥♥♥♥♥together into one hideous abomination. There is no consistency to anything in this game. None of the features feel like they work well together. You start the game and immediately ask yourself ""Okay, what is there to do?"" I still don't have an answer for that. Build a house I guess? But why bother? Get money maybe? Oh that way I can get that one expensive sword at the shop. To do what with? Oh, kill the same old bandits you've been seeing right from the start that use the same old rusty pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥swords.Kenshi never progressed from feeling like a tech demo into feeling like an actual game. There is no feeling of progression in this game. There are no goals that feel worth working towards. None of it is satisfying. There's no point to anything. This is not a sandbox game, it is a tech demo at best.			"

								Not a full review just a few words.IF and when this game leaves development I will give a solid review.I have played Kenshi for nearly 130 hrs.. The game has a great foundation, several mechanics that could become inovative in their form and a nack for me to continue to check the developers progress. Unfortunatly, the progress is far and quite few between. I will have to no longer recommend this product to anyone who would be interested until the game reaches something beyond an alpha state.My personal message to the developer: I tip my hat to you and want to thank you for your work on putting this project together. If I am not mistaken, I belive you were the only dev for the game for the greater part of the game coming to life and that in itself is a feat. Keep it up man and show us a major benchmark!-EDIT- 20160120Beta... Soon (TM)... Seriously, this sounds interesting and I am very interested to see the deployment of Kenshi Beta!			"

								Allow me to say this: If you do NOT have a large amount of patience, this game is not for you, at least not yet.Kenshi is a wonderful game, I've sunk days and days of my time into this Early Access, and I love it. The feeling of being horribly puny in a world that seeks to better itself , and then becoming strong enough to crush the world is a feeling only comparable to doing the same thing in your everyday life. That is Kenshi. You write your story, you act it out. Crush your opposition, or bankrupt their pocketbooks? Annihalate the bandits, or help them take over cities? You are, or will, be asked these questions over and over.Another of the great things about Kenshi is that it takes the motto of Urbanprophet; Unfair, Random, Brutality; and takes it to the next level. The game is exceedingly Unfair. You will probably lose men. That one-man army you really want to be? Well, he's lying on the ground, dying slowly after being attacked by 30 bandits. It's a painfully wonderful experience. It is Brutal, the enemies do not go easy on you- You just killed those Samurai's buddies? The entire faction wants you dead now, and you have armies of some of the strongest people in the game after you. Oh, now you can watch your 12 man squad rot slowly on the dusty desert. It is Random. No two people are the same unless they're twins or you made them that way. Every combat experience is utterly random. Yes, there's SOME consistency, as a soldier with 40 combat skill and 40 Defense skill probably won't get taken out by a couple of hungry bandits, but lucky hits DO happen. It can be frustrating to see that up-armored beast get KO'd by some thugs with sticks, but even SAS Operatives get shot by untrained Guerillas. You almost have to be a masochist to play Kenshi. Almost.Unfortunately, the game is consistently buggy, whether it be from minor graphics glitches caused by saving/loading, upto pathing issues that can be game-breaking. It's painful to be forced to watch your men die on the sands, and the fact that the game can't recognize your men are all pretty much dead and allow you to start a new game is a little offensive. The lack of a ""Return to Main Menu"" button is a little disconcerting in itself.In addition to that, it lacks a lot of diversity in its content. The ""Music"" is virtually nonexistent. It almost makes it difficult to want to play the game. Almost. Weaponry and Armor for your characters has a distinctly Asian flair, but doesn't deviate far from that. Combat animations are virtually the same for all people and weapons, and Melee combat is currently all there is. You buy Mercenaries. You kill things. You might even build a base. It's easy to become disillusioned if you aren't patient, or a good role-player.At the moment, the one game I can compare this to is a 3D Version of Caravaneer, without guns, and that is a very good thing. What the developer here tries to pull off is an extensive trade network with fluctuating prices; towns that have surplus stocks and will pay desperately with whatever they can to get what they're on a shortage of. That doesn't happen.Despite all of its flaws, Kenshi is a masterpiece. While dated in its mission, lacking in content, and occasionally utterly monotonous, Kenshi delivers the ultimate RPG experience that even real life cannot give you: The chance to write your own story, completely unfettered by society. The only problem you have left to figure out is: Do you cut your path into the ground, do you line it with the ruins of empires, do you gild it with coin, or do you merely walk it? It's upto you to write the story; it's upto you to buy and play Kenshi.			"

								Kenshi is a refreshing, challenging, and unique sandbox game where there is no main story, no main character, and certainly no friends. That is, unless you make those things happen. But to create that story blood, sweat, and tears must be shed for the bustling town that you build from the ground up or the greatest warriors the land has ever seen to be created. The first few hours of this game are hard, very, very hard. You typically start off with rough spun pants, a medkit, a few hundred Cats (the currency), and a stick in a city within the wasteland. And off you go. No tutorial, no hand holding, no direction as to what you should or can do. There are certainly in-game Help menus you could look through, but you yourself have to discover how to make money for food, where you should avoid going, and how best to survive in a wasteland where you're nothing more than another grain of sand in the dessert, just as easily treaded over, discarded, and forgotten. You can't even kill a lone animal, much less another person, for survival. At least initially. Kenshi is a game where stories, your stories, are made. There are no scripted events, no unkillable NPC's, and plenty of random events that you encounter travelling the wasteland for adventures to happen. I left my base once to explore, found a ruin, almost got killed in it, half my squad limping away carrying the other half of my unconscious, but alive, team. Limping home through a forest before Bam! I got attacked by twenty or so cannibals and somehow, by some miracle, held them off with my wounded, conscious members. The moment when the walls of my base rendered on my screen was filled with so much joy, relief, and amazement that everyone somehow made it back alive still makes me shake my head in disbelief that a game made me experience that.This game is all about growth and development, discovery and adventure, survival and death. It does a remarkable job of invoking the doubts involved with exploring the unknown. Everytime I send out an expedition with enough food and supplies to last a week or more to bring back new trade items or rare treasure I worry whether or not everyone, or anyone at all for that matter, will make it back alive. I don't know what I'll find, what I'll encounter, and if the journey will be worth it. And that's an incredible feeling.This game is still being developed and still has tons of things to improve, but what they have now is a fun, albeit challenging and buggy, squad based, sandbox game where it's you and the world. Is Kenshi, an Eary Access game, worth the $20? Having played almost 52 fun, stressful, amazing hours at the moment of writing I'm very much inclined to say yes, absolutely. A good chunk of time has to be invested to actually experience everything Kenshi currently has to offer and considering that the game isn't even complete yet pleases me, knowing that there's that much more for me to discover.

								I bought this game in 2014. I played it for a little bit, but I couldn't really get into it, and it seemed that the devs had gone awol so I stopped.last weekend I was feeling really burnt out on my go to games and wanted something new, and I spotted Kenshi in my game library. Kenshi was that game that I really regretted buying, but I held on to a hope that I would one day get my money's worth out of it. With this in mind I decided to see if such a day has come, and started her up. I no longer regret getting this game. The devs are updating it, a community has gathered behind it, and it's gameplay is absolutley golden. I've gotten used to the graphics, and even kinda like em now(objectively they are crappy though) and the interface could use some improvement. Once you get used to the controls, and begin to see how things work in this unique world the devs have created, the rough edges start to fall away.I've never been one to write reviews, but I felt that I needed to share because there are definitely alot of people like me who picked this up in the earlier days and abandoned it to what we thought was going to be a silent death. If you are one of those fellows I recommend you give the game another try.			"

								If Mad Max, Samurai Champloo, and The Dark Tower had a weird kid that ran around shirtless with nothing but a rusty katana and an empty stomach, then it would be this game.The setting is unique, taking place in a varied post-apocalyptic enviroment that's soon to be expanded with a shiny new map. Combat is dangerous and every encounter has the potential to be your last. Numerous factions have their wars and alliances, and you can participate if you want, or just loot the corpses like a gross human vulture that has no honor.The problem with the games are thus: The engine isn't the best in the world, so graphically it's rather unimpressive, however the artists have done a great job with worldbuilding and locations look unique enough that graphical limitations don't hinder the game at all. Another possible gripe is that the early game's combat is very, very hard. You will be knocked out for most of your time with Kenshi without proper preperation. It's stupid to brave the wasteland alone, you aren't the Dragonborn; you're Jeff from accounting who's decided to become a vagrant warrior with little to know chance of survival. That being said, a larger party and training vis a vie the practice dummies can make combat easier.All in all Kenshi has been developed slowly over a long period of time, and it's clear the developers have put love into their game. Updates are progressing steadily and adding in new content and features. Kenshi's a good game now, but it'll be a great game when it gets released.			"

								I don't write reviews, infact this is the only one i've done or probably will do because this is my favorite game on steam.Pros:-The ability to customize units is what sold me on this. I've always loved being able to make my own stories and characters within a game and it works well in this.-There is always a new story to tell with your character(s). Example: Getting kidnapped by cannibals and barely escaping(if at all), then building/training an army and taking your revenge on them.-You can mod the game, however it isn't the most straight foward and there are not too many made for it yet. You can find some on the nexus, if you know what you are doing.-Updates. The makers of this game DO release updates and patches even if they do take a while, adding new content that stack layers of gameplay. If you do some research you can see the guy who made this game loves it and truely wants to see it finished (even hired more people to help build it).Cons:-Like I said, the updates can take a long time to come out but they do.-Some people experience bugs and crashes while others do not.-Once you get your characters up to a certain level in combat it may become a little too easy. However, they are adding new stuff to keep it challenging.If you enjoy these games you may enjoy this one:X-com, Age of Empires, Mount and bladeOver-all I give this game a 8.5/10 in the experimental beta build. Like a fine wine, it gets better with time.			"

								As an owner of this game for nearly two years I can say that it has come a LONG WAY from when I purchased it. I rarely write reviews but after reading the negitive ones below I felt compelled to add my two cents. While development has been slow, it has been consistent. For me I purchased this game because I liked the concept and I wanted to support its development, not because I wanted to play it (yet!). I would say that while buggy, the game is fully playable now, and really stands apart from any other game I have played. If you enjoy a CHALLENGING RPG/Open world steam punk sim, and you want to support the developers who tackled this very ambitious project, then BUY IT!			"

Having said THAT, I just cant stop playing it! If you are on the fence just wait and see what it becomes.

								This is a great game, I understand some of the basics but it would be easier to play with a few more instructions or tutorials. I've had this game for almost a year I think but it seems like out of all the other games I play, I would rather play those. This game need a few minor bugs fixed and needs to have a few more additions to it that capture players into playing it more. Other than this I don't really have anything bad to say about it. This game is unique and creative but like I said, there needs to be a few more ways to seem interesting to more people. "

								This game is so original it is teeming with potential - I mean it is like a clash of Samurais in an apocalyptic setting and - SOON TO BE - Deus Ex kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥going on (Robotic Limbs). Though if you dislike a game with a medium learning curve you'd have to dump that habit and have patience with this game, because this game, Kenshi, is a game worth playing.			"

								This game...I have lost 18 hours within 2 days to this game so far, and no change in the pattern in the foreseeable future.Its intensely hard and unforgiving. Fierce battles and insane slavers and cannibals. Most of the situations you will get into are outside your control.This game ****s me... just the way i like it.			"

								Well Ive been playing this for a few days and I love the game, as long as it works. It bugs out 70% of the time.I understand its an alpha game. Its been six years, so I figured Id try it out.The experimental mode is very unstable and game over before you can get too far in your quests.I don't recommend getting this game until they do more work on it. Not playable in my opinion.Lots of hoping and wishing here because this game has a lot of potential.			"

								It was "" 29 Oct, 2013 @ 12:07pm "" when I created my review on the game, I praised it with such adoration but times change and thanks to the sales it has been brought to my attention. My first question is; why hasn't this game been completed yet? I shall now answer my own question with: it is because of you, the loyal customer, only you the ones who have been active in the forum have interfered with this game being completed the way it was intended. How? You ask? People like to demand that the developers include everything under the sun they desire, pointless trivial things such as 'race' and I recall someone mentioned 'hot-air balloons' and so on and so forth. Let us all remind ourselves that this is a post-apocalyptic world that thrives because of its realism, now then, I've had this game since it came out and I am certain this game was never supposed to go down the road of 'races' and the mystical such. If you are angry that this game is not complete like I am, it is because of said developers not having a clear focus and an active forum. Now I am not saying it is a bad thing that the developers are allowing their customers to influence the game I mean, we paid for it, we should be allowed to have a say, yes that is good practice but what annoys me is when the game starts to spin off into a half complete spiral of forever being at 50% because people keep asking for 'cool' stuff and as a result unforseen bugs occur that require manhours to fix which all builds up and here we are. Now they have added cannibals, and I think great, something to keep the player focused on their...well, squad I guess, this might have been a player-suggested idea although from the general feel of the game when I had first made my review I could have predicted a group as such existing. My only main issue, is that the game often finds itself struggling to balance the micro-management aspect and the combat aspect of the game, for example, at the beginning of the game, you are by your own (assuming you picked either the merchant or the default spawn), you have to survive and learn, you lure some bandits into a city they get violently murdered and you sell their stuff, get some more squad members, rinse and repeat, it's great fun, I'm sure each player would agree. THEN we are tempted into creating our own city.The city building is a fun aspect but it simply becomes a process of just sitting on your♥♥♥♥♥♥staring into nothing watching your members work away for hours on end until you travel back to sell your wares, remember that there are bandits, end up having to sacrifice a slower member for the 'greater good' and then get back into the combat aspect, bored of base building. All-in-all I'd still actually suggest that you buy this game but just don't expect too much clarity in where this game will end up.  "

								In 2016 I can safely say that abandoned games get updated at a faster rate. You know those games that sound very, very good? Kenshi is one of those games. Unfortunately, Kenshi has sounded very good for a long time now and hasn't actually had much added to it. You'll spend most of your time watching a character walk from place to place while keeping the game on fast forward. But perhaps the combat is redeeming, you say? Nope, you fast forward that too. In fact, there's very little reason to not just play this game on fast forward the entire time. It's basically a watching simulator. But the fun doesn't end there. The forums are rather heavily censored and anything that isn't praise toward the developers is deleted and followed by a ban. As of now, I don't think people who don't own kenshi can even post there. This is clearly just an attempt to censor the forum more heavily.So, why should you consider kenshi? Well, if you like games that have been in development for years with minimal progress it's right up your alley! If you like games where you hit an endgame with almost nothing to do it's perfect as well!And if you go to the forum for tips you'll be told to ""make your own game(Within kenshi)."" Yup, the consistent suggestion on the forum is to make your own little game, with your own rules and a load of artificial difficulty that you impose on yourself.  The reason for this is, of course, that there's absolutely nothing else to do. You make a little base, get a few guys, and that is it. That is completion of the game. It's not even a matter of ignoring a bunch of features. That is all the features right now(and has been for a very long time).			"

								Kenshi, Kenshi, Kenshi you are like a mistress on the side of real life. I wish I could put more time into you but things (work, child, fiance) keep getting in our way of eternal love. I know I keep promising that I can just leave them and we could spend the rest of our days frollicking in meadows of beautiful flowers, desert landscapes and the occasional cannibal lair. I know we could be happy together taking on adversary and even build a place we can call home from nothing but the goods we traded from our previous lives. I feel like I am at war with some holy group telling me my feelings are false and us being together serves a dark purpose. I shall enter you and end up leaving just before we get to the fun stuff while I am seen by prying eyes behind my back and whispering voices telling me this is not real and I shouldnt be spending my spare time with you. I hope you can understand that I am torn in every direction but yours as I know you do not judge me for letting you sit idle while I create false memories with people who will never understand me like you do. Maybe someone else will pick you up and have the wonderful times we have had, I would be sad to see you with someone else but happy that you get to have the adventures we have spent those dark nights dreaming of together. Kenshi if this is our last moments, I would like you to know that I rate you a solid 8/10 although I know you are currently just a bud on a bush about to blossom into a beautiful flower and will only increase in enjoyability.

								Why you should buy this game?I actually bought this game many years ago off the lofi website as i really liked the concept of what he was trying to achieve. The game had no sound. Was totally empty, but somehow seemed really cool still.Many years down the line we now have this beauty of a game! Its not what i would call a mainstream game. Kenshi is hard and if you mess up it punishes you for it. It still has some bugs yes, but there is enough content and a big enough world map to really get stuck in and explore and do what you want. There are frequent updates, usually once or twice a month that add significant content. Only half the actualy map is currently in play. Its huge, so dont worry about ever running out of things to do.Buy this game. For me, its the only early access game i have not been dissapointed in.			"

								I've had this game before it even came out on steam, it has come such a long way since then. A lot of people complain that the dev team isn't working on the game enough but the dev team is a long list of roughly 3 people last I checked, it began as a one man project so updates are slow to come out but thats because there's such a small team. The big draw to the game is seeing how far you came. When you start you are the suckiest person in the game, and there is no better feeling than seeing the character you start with be able to take on 4 guys at the same time because you know how much work you put into that character's growth. If you don't like games that require a huge amount of investment this is not for you because it takes hours to understand why the game is great. 5/7 perfect score "

								TL;DR: Yes.As of this current day (2nd of March, 2017), I can honestly say Kenshi is worth it, after a long period of ""not quite there yet"". But for the love of everything that is good and decent, INSTALL THIS GAME TO AN SSD! Seriously! The loading times and the general performance are still awful!I've been game since the 0.2x alpha, can't exactly remember which exact version, but it was the one before the first foliage update. Back then, the game was pretty barebones. All you could do was to wander around beating bandits or the members of bigger factions up, until your character became a god of war. The game had so much potential, but little to do in terms of diversity. The game also crashed constantly, the pathfinding was abysmal and everything was generally clunky and frustrating, so I couldn't really recommend the game.Now, the performance is still crap, the pathfinding is still occasionally annoying (although much more tolerable than what it used to be) and everything is still quite clunky. But the game has so much to offer, it packs in so many great details, and it's all-around a completely unique experience!Kenshi is an RTS sandbox, with relatively heavy emphasis on RPG elements, one which absolutely doesn't hold your hand with pillow-padded tutorials and scaling levels of enemies. It drops you to a cold, incredibly merciless and unforgiving world, where your survival, a pathetic little weakling that you are, is tough! You need food, you need weapons, you need armor, you need a MUCH higher skills to do anything, you need allies... even the lowliest of bandits will beat your starting character with ease, and don't except any kind of one-on-one action, as these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will outnumber you ten-to-one! And when they beat you senseless, they take loot your body and take your precious food - and that's the best case scenario! If your opponent happens to be a fogman, a cannibal or a wild animal, it will probably eat you as well!But the beauty of Kenshi isn't just the magnificently cruel, beautifully crafted game world with tons of places to explore and millions of incredible little details that no other game offers, it's when you FINALLY make it! When you finally recover from the beatdown, when you finally rebuild yourself stronger, when you finally get back to those #¤%&/! bandits and shove their rusty sticks down their throats, when you finally save your tortured comrades from slavery, when you finally have a place of your own, when you finally make your base self-sufficient... that's when the game feels like an accomplishment! This trick is hard to pull off by a game, but Kenshi absolutely nails it.Unfortunately, the game isn't without its flaws. The unforgiving nature of the game can be a turn-off to some people, so if you expect a relaxing base-building game, look elsewhere. As mentioned before, the game absolutely requires an SSD at its current state, or else you can expect hideously long loading times ALL THE TIME. Some UI elements, as the game mechanisms in general, are incredibly clunky and probably will always be. But if you can look past its flaws, Kenshi is an incredible experience, one which I can definitely recommend! :)			"

								Kenshi, holy ♥♥♥♥, where do I start with this one? Hmmm, how about my experience on my first proper playthrough(s).....I started with a new playthrough after re-installing this game yesterday, as the default wanderer. All was well, at first. I spawned in Blister Hill. I mined some iron, sold the iron to a trader in Blister Hill and got a fair amount of money doing so. I built a small outpost with a shack, farm and a well down near the river, just outside of Blsiter Hill. My crops were growing fine, I had a fair bit of money but I needed some materials, so I mined more iron and made more money in the easiest way I knew how, MINING!!! After I arrived back from Blister Hill I noticed all my crops had dissappeared, ""what?"" I thought to myself, ""How?"" I originally thought the starving bandits had knocked me over, so I replanted my crops, mined more iron, sold more iron in Blister Hill and after arriving back for the second time....my crops where missing, again. So I re-replanted them, headed to the Holy Farm to get some stuff, come back and my crops had gone AGAIN. At this point I was just baffled, ""a glitch maybe?"" I re-re-replanted my crops, waited in my shack and nothing.....then I see my character yell out ""BY OKRANS HAIRY NIPPLES"" he draws out his sword and sprints out of the shack, I pan the camera and a dozen of these rat creatures with 2 legs are eating my ♥♥♥♥ing crops. ""No match for me"" I thought, wow how I was wrong. I get completley destroyed and killed by these creatures. RIP Zan.Second playthrough, this time as a trader with a pack bull, seems fun! I spawn in some remote area with a few buildings dotted around the place, I decide to head to Blister Hill and sell my luxury goods that I spwaned with. Less than 5 minutes in, I get ambushed by cannibals, my bull gets killed and I get kidnapped. Then, the cannibal just stops walking, glitches and I am stuck like this for around 10 minutes, dying on this skinny cannibals shoulder. ""♥♥♥♥ sake, new game it is...again""RIP Bill.Third playthrough, this time as the retired army captain, ♥♥♥♥ yeah dude. I chose him due to my 2 previous characters being absolutley dreadful when it comes to combat. I spawn in The Hub, a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ full of low-lives and outlaws, I find an iron vein, so I repeat the mining method in order to get some money. I have 5 raw iron ore, I see a building just outside of The Hub, I walk in, sell my iron and buy a nice sword to go with my other one, I step out of the building and BAM, badnits do me over and loot my weapons......""This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke"" I shout out loud. Fortunatley, I recover and the traders kill the bandits, unfortuntaley the one who robbed me, took off with my swords. I loot an iron club off one of the bandits, buy some food and set off. I approach a hive village, BAM. Ambushed by cannibals and kidnapped again.....""Wow, what the ♥♥♥♥!?!!?"" I exclaim, fortunatley I am saved by these bug looking ant men, who are actually rather nice! I set up camp outside of the hive village, mine some copper, sell to the trader, make some more money and set off to greener pastures. BAM, ambushed by fogmen, kidnapped and hauled around the fog islands for about 20 minutes until cannibals attack and kill my kidnappers. I play dead, then immediatley run for the hills. I run into a cannibal, who is not attacking me. ""Talking meat?"" he says, I ask him not to eat me due to my body being diseased with plague ""STILL HAVE TO EAT"" he yells back at me, BAM, his posse attack me, kidnap me and again I am hauled around the map, knocked out cold, then, starving bandits save me! ""OMG Saved again, thank ♥♥♥♥"" I say to myself......no, the bandits then knock me out, steal my food and take off. I wake up from a recovery coma, heal myself then limp off toward Mongrel, A town located in the fog islands. I arrive, and to make more money, I mine a nearby iron source. I go to the weapons trader with my recently aqquired iron, ""OHHH a smithing machine, I'll make armour plates and get♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of money"" I work on the armour plates in the shop, then I take my armour plate, a message pops up ""Caught stealing"" I get attacked by 20+ guards and arrested for taking an armour plate that I MADE.....""♥♥♥♥. THIS. GAME.""Kenshi is a nightmare, its harder than life, harder than dark souls, but it's actually fun to play. You arent a god, you are a weak, feeble character looking to make a name for themselves, and man it is hard. The graphics are bad, the performance is awful at times due to poor omptimization but the gameplay and replayability of this game is outstanding. The world, that seems to be a mix of Japanese culture mixed in with some steam/cyber-punk aspects, has an interesting story with weird characters inhabiting it, what a strange yet good game Kenshi is.I hated this game at first, which is why I ultimatley uninstalled it a few months back. The game just needs time for you to grow attatched to it, which bizzarely, will happen. "

								The game I've always wanted. Kenshi is a genre-defying game that's quarter RPG, quarter City-Building, and half Action. You can start anywhere from a group of settlers to injured, starving, and penniless and work your way upwards from there. Unlike most games, Kenshi sees no difference between the player and NPCsYou are not The HeroEvery action has consequencesDefinetly the most underrated game in Steam.			"

								TL;DR:It's a true to the word Alpha so it crashes and there are clearly parts of the game that do not work yet. However, the greater vision for what the game will be is clear and it clearly is going to be a game of epic proportions with plenty of replayability.Full Review:The game lets you play as you wish. Want to be a BA swordsman with an elite squad of goons? Done. Want to be tader making your way through the waste lands? Done. Want to settle your own town and be the greatest blacksmith in the land? Done. Want to by a sleezy tief in the night? Done.The game has a fantastic engine that allows you level your character based on the actions he takes. If you fight a lot, he will become better at fighting. If you run around a lot he becomes a faster runner. Carry heavy things - builds strength. Unit growth is very organic, though you can also setup tasks to help power level guys as well.The main game, which is not completed yet, will allow you to effectively build your own clan. You will be able to raid other towns and even take them over. If you do not want to run your own clan with towns then you can try your hand at being a merchinary in one of the many conflicts that will going on around the map.The game is also introducing multiple races and ambient creatures that will kick your butt!!All the fun stuff aside there are some drawbacks. At the time of the post this is still very much in Alpha. The game crashes regularly, your save files become outdated or unable to be retrieved often, and your are constantly tantilzed by the features you can see but not use. For an Alpha it is pretty playable though and the dev makes balancing changes every so often so that the game remains fun to play.If you cannot handle losing your entire saved game or getting randomly kicked this is not the time to buy, wait for the proper release. If you can't wait to be a steampunk samuri in a desert wasteland then by all means get it!			"

								This is roughly how it went for me. The first 10 hours I was just running away from things and reloading, cursing at the game and wondering how you were supposed to play this if you just got jumped all the time. The next 10 hours was spent discovering things, some on my own and some from searching. I got a small group of people together and saved up several thousand working resource nodes outside the cities. Whenever I had to travel though I was just running away from things and reloading, cursing at the game and wondering how you were supposed to play this if you just got jumped all the time.Then I started to get my bearings in the game. I learned that losing is part of the experience, literally part of the experience. If you pick an even fight and don't come out on top, you've still gained big defensive stats on anyone that didn't die. At that point, about 30 hours deep into the experience, I realized I just started. Game mechanics start springing up and spider-webbing outward. Character advancement, technology research, crafting, settlement management, supply runs, training, assaults, battles, wars. Now every time I assemble my elite crew of four to the gate, I get excited that I have so many options to choose from. We go to a city, make some money, recruit more people for the town, work their strength up a little to make some more money nearby, buy some supplies and sneak them back up.The game creeps up on you and owns you with complex, interesting things to do. The mechanics, dialog, options and behavior of npcs are deep and seem very well thought out. I often find myself doing something I fully expect to result in losing something and figure out the game already thought of it and provided an option. And if you're worried there may not be enough RPG in it for you, each and every character you recruit is playable, equippable and trainable independently. The vanilla cap is I think 30 right now total recruitable, but there is a mod already that increases it to 256. Give it some time and you'll be hooked.			"

								So with the latest 20 hours added to the timer, i think i get the main idea of what the game is so far, please do pay attention to the date of this review as this is to the corrisponding version, now to give a short summary, the game has bugs, it has memory leaks, so expect to restart it a few times a day if you're limited to 4 gigs of ram like me, it looks okay in graphics department, nothing amazing, but i would rather have this then games that pose the best thing in it is the graphic's, because Beautiful looking Crap is still just crap... this game poses as a Sandbox Survival RTS that i suggest you only play if you're ready for some depressing notions of racism in it's own sense... the rest will explain but for those who just want the short review, i DO suggest this game, but to a rather... certain audience...Pros:-Customization, Most RTS games just give you a set number of looks and style and that's just it, while this game HAS that, you can make ""Your"" characters look however you want, 4 races, plenty of attributes from facial to physical body, this game let's you make your team as unique as you desire.-No levels, Just skill and survival, and this can be an issue in some cases, the game has added a hunger meter (and also a mod to remove it for beginners, just look through the workshop.) and note, most things you fight one on one, WILL kill you, now note, this game has factions, and there far, other people will join the fight, if it's against you however, you may be rather... dead, in the next few seconds, you're NOT the chosen one, you're a new person in this harsh world, and you have to EARN your power the obvious ways, running around will make you run faster, carrying heavy stuff will make you stronger, taking hits will make you more durable... if you survive.-The whole world is free to Roam... Granted if it's Not Owned... i say this because this game goes on common sense in that, if it's there, you should be able to go there, BUT it also knows that, if it's someone's home... well you're not link are you? this is'nt hyrule, this is a game that makes common sense REAL common real fast, and the open world outside towns is open for more then just combat...-Base Building, want to build a town? Have the recourses, go ahead, but make sure you know this location is ideal for what your setting up, because this game won't hold your gand in this, it's either you get ahead, just get by, or get dead... and this does have it's pros, but don't think just having a place to call your own makes you safe, if fact... it can attract some... unwanted attention-Time, and Pause, this i feel is a requirement, if a game as relentless as this DIDN'T have this? well... it's a small note, but deffinitely still worth noting, it atleast let's you think about what you're gonna do next...-No Story, Exept Your's, this game has no story mode, it's you, the world, and whatever you do in it, or don't do, and quite frankly, i feel for a game like this, is a good thing.-Multiple ways to start, start with a group, or alone, start with a dog, or as a slave, or a prisoner, it give's many ways to play, most however, WILL be a challenge...-Character Value, a jack of all trades is a master of none, not to say you can't train all character's in everything, but you'll be spending a few months to try with just a couple characters... overall, this game makes you pick and choose of your own will what person will do what, by this i mean, you can have everyone fight with no healer's or anyone building a bse, BUT you will die very fast, there's also permadeath... so yeah, once they die, they're gone...And now the notes i'm affriad count against this peice...Cons:-Memory Leaks, as said before, this game has issues with even the 5required specs, after 3-4 hours, 4 gigs will be lookin... bare... and the game will lag to the point it'll be getting difficult, but then again, any game that tries this WILL run into this, so this is really more of a given...-Almost Depressing, this game can be rather... Depressing, so anyone with the idea that they can feel better from playing this game when you're in a bad mood, unless you're a masochist and even then... the game has a nation, known as the ""Holy Nation"" that hates anything and anyone who is NOT human, and will either demand you die by them on site while sparring those who are human, or just downright kill you and the other's, it gives that sense that ""Are you different? Die For it!"" that makes it kinda feel difficult to...well yeah... i'm not gonna ask them to change it by any means, i just can't recommend this for a certain audience or two...And now things that are both or neither good and/or bad that are still worth noting,Nuetrals:-Early Acess, this means the game still has a way to go before saying it's finished, so if you buy this expecting a finished game, then don't buy it until the early access catagory disappears from the named tags on this game, it's still subjected to change, be updated in major ways, and over all, it's NOT a finished game...-Bugs, i place this in nuetral because, YES it's bad, BUT they WILL be fixed, and as such as of the current time, there is a bug that annoys me a bit but i beleive it can be player fixed by rebuilding nav mesh in game, in the notion that if you put your character's in a closed space, they will stop moving and if you try to move they will go to the gate you just close and open it before moving to the designated spot...Overall, yes i recomend this game, but i would like to note, Not for it's ""Fun"" factor, because it CAN be fun, once you find a correct way to do thing's your way, there is not a ""set in Stone"" correct way to do things because this is a sandbox game in it's fullest extent, but positive and negitive are in this, if you want a challenge in sandbox survival RTS, this is the best one Iv'e found, just be ready to die if you are'nt ready to fight...

								9/10! I love this game! I am not usually one that enjoys really difficult games, but there is something about the brutal difficulty of this game that actually keeps me around. It's not like ""Oh I'm not good enough..."" kinda hard, it's more ""I need patience and dedication to prevail"" kinda hard. Basically, you start as a nobody. There are different backgrounds and starts, which I love, but I also love that the game is unforgiving. You can't just kill a group of raiders, hell, you probably can't even kill one at the start. The difficulty of this game is appropriate, and lends to the brutality of the harsh reality in which your characters live. With time, one can really succeed and have fun with this game. The challenges along the way, those are really the best part. I am a self-professed save-scummer when it comes to many games, but despite saving very often, I find myself reverting to old loads less often in this game than others. Devastating things occur to my party, but the way it happens... most of the time I just roll with it!This game features multiple ways to play, perhaps one of it's coolest features. You can get by as a lone wolf, stealing and killing while living on the run. Perhaps you yourself wish to organize a group to raid cities and farms. Maybe you wish to raise an army to do with what you please as you traverse the wastelands... in any case, you have a great deal of freedom. Basically, you can play it like a single player RPG, or more like an RTS, city builder, merchant goods management, etc. There are a few bugs, but nothing really gamebreaking. Another feature I love is that they allow you to import your old characters/buildings and so on into new versions of the game as it approaches release. There are factions in the game, and it is particularly interesting when you get involved with any of them. The factions are all unique and have interesting relationships with one another. Luring that band of bandits up to that Holy Nations City you visited may be the perfect distraction you need to rob them blind.As I mentioned before, this game is BRUTAL! My beloved characters have been enslaved, tortured/forcefully starved to death, murdered in cold blood and even eaten alive... that's right, I said EATEN ALIVE!!! Normally in games when my characters get, let's say, eaten alive, I save-scum to the save before that happened. This game encourages me to go along with the brutality though. I had a party of 17 characters or so, while running to a certain city, we were attacked. We fended off the Fog Men at first... but they kept coming... hoardes of them! All but two of my characters were left standing, carrying the wounded bodies of two other characters to safety (which in itself had my blood rushing!). As 4 of my characters got to safety, rested up and healed up, 3 were EATEN ALIVE by the Fog Men. I used what little money I had and sold everything to hire 2 more characters to join the party. We went out and managed to pick off the Fog Men that escorted our friends by setting up ambushes at tactical points. Thus far I have saved all but 1 of the captured members of my party (minus the 3 that were EATEN ALIVE), doing tactical stealth missions, solo runs and distraction assaults.Overall this game is outstanding! The aesthetic feel of it is perfect, mixing the feel of like a sumurai feudal system in the post-apocalypse. The difficulty of the game can make it a tough pill to initially swallow, but it is well worth it. The characters and races are unique (I love the Hive characters and the robotic mechanid ones, sooo cool!) Everything is fitting for the environment, nothing stands out as too high tech or too low tech. You can tell that this is the remnance of a world that once had tech, but that technology is long forgotten. There is electricity to some extent, but only what windmills and such can generate. Think Mad Max and/or Waterworld tech. Despite the brutal difficulty and the patience/sacrifice needed to succeed, I would give this game a 9/10 (as of patch 0.93 or so). I anticipate my score my go up when the game reaches full release.			"

								great game. constantly being updated with new features and huge bug fixes. you can build up a huge army or keep a small party of warriors, builders, doctors, etc and build your own city where NPC's will come and visit and buy items that you manufacture. Great game and get a lot of time out of it. I recommend looking up other reviews as well as youtube videos because it is a unique type of game, not everyone will love it.I can not recall any games being anything like this, and for that reason it offers great releif from the average game genres that can eventually get old, no matter how fun the game is. I am very much looking forward to see what new features will be added on when it reaches it's complete state, as I'm sure everything that will be added will be very new concepts and things you just don't see or do much of in other games.

								This is seriously one of the coolest games I have played.  The whole game is based around you and your sqaud, wait...  Scratch that...  This game hates you...  You aren't the biggest baddest guy in the world, you aren't going to be able to defeat an army by yourself, you can't do shiznit in this game...  Unless you work for it...The only way to get anywhere in this game is to work for it.  If you want to be the strongest man in the game, you have to train long and hard.  If you want a giant city, you have to get the resources, and build it by hand.One of the coolest parts about this game is the work mechanics.  Say you want one guy to be your engineer and build all the buildings and such.  Well, you aren't always going to be building things, are you?  No, so you set engineering as your permanent job, which means that if there is a building job going on, then he will do it.  And then his second job may be researching, so when there is no building going on, he is researching more buildings.This game may be an alpha, but I have played 25 hours and it seems like there is still more to research and build.  There is no sound, but the Torchlight 1 soundtrack sounds pretty good in the background!  So yeah, if you want a game where you aren't the biggest baddest guy in existence, get this game...			"

								loads of reviews as well as you tube videos tend to share player stories about their game. That's because Kenshi leaves the story up to you in a way many games fail to do these days.You could lead the life of a simple farmer, or rise up to warlord and face the holy nation, be a trader, slave, a bounty hunter or just a scum bag scavenger making a living off loot from the dead. It's a game you put away and come back to later on again, and for that reason alone it's worth the money.			"

								I found Kenshi to be quite the enjoyable game that you can use to immerse yourself for hours in without realising that time has actually passed. even though it is still in the alpha stages it provides the player with with challenges right from the get go no matter the starting that you choose it never fails to force the player to resort to obtaining help from the city guards in quite a number of larger scale engagements. it allows the player to travel a quite literal sandbox world finding their own goals and objectives from the singular large time bounty hunter to the creation of new settlements and factions that can be used to take over the entire world, and with it still in alpha stages the developers (Lo-Fi games) are still releasing bits and pieces of the game as they slowly make their way to obtaining their finished version, I for one am excited to see the end result from this ambitious company just knowing how good the game currently is and the possible amazing outcome that awaits it in the end. 9.5/10			"

								Kenshi took me by surprise i thought it was going to just be okay but man i love this game and have put 26 hours into it over 3 days The game has a lot of content for an Alpha like farming crafting cooking weapon and armor  smiting and a lot more to come. it is an open world squad RPG where you can build you own towns and bases. it has a cool  skill system where you person gets stronger just by walking around carrying a lot and gets faster by running more.  the game forces you to do nothing, don't want a squad you don't need one, don't want a base you don't need one!In the begging i was horrible and it took me around 3 tries to start a game where I didn't die in the first 30mins and even now i have close calls  This is by far the best Early Access game i have played!! highly recommended!!!!The developers are in touch with the community and have a clear road map, that this game will follow and its posted in the forms now Go!! look up some videos and read some more my fellow gamersI hope you will one day be wondering the sand covered dunes of Kenshi very soon			"

								TL:DR? Buy it, would lay unconcious being robbed by bandits again.As I write this I lay unconcious with my face in the desert sands after being mobbed on a lone trade run by hungry desert bandits.  They taught me not to run over burdened.Kenshi is Warband+1.It will take time to get to grips with the UI - which is improved from some of the youtube videos I watched before buying it.I'm playing it on an i5 1.8mHz laptop with nvidia 710M, and it insits on using the cruddy inel graphics card.  But this doesn;t affect gameplay for me.Returning to the desert to wait out my survival coma.  On the plus side I am not bleeding.  Though the bandits took all my inventory - including a sword which I aqquired from a samarai who was erm, sleeping face down in the desert!Love the game, give it some time.If you like warband you'll love this.  RPG/business/hack/slash.Though all I've done so far is get beat up and turn in a dying man for a bounty :)			"

								Kenshi is a fun game, but there are a few deal-breakers that I hope get future attention:-No way to recruit new guys (in the latest version) without forking over thousands at a time. There is maybe one character I've encountered that is willing to join you, and he costs 6000 in game currency.-And you're gonna need some help, because the game is irritatingly difficult when beginning. I know it is supposed to be a challenge, but the only way to level your guy is to follow around a patrol which may or may not encounter hostile groups. Even then, expect to get only a few hits in before the patrol wipes out the enemy.-Getting your character to attack is a hassle. Right clicking works some of the time. Other times you have to hold right click over an enemy and tell your character to attack him.-The staggering animation after being hit often leaves you open to another attack, which can stagger you again. Kinda lame considering that...-The punishment for losing a fight is way too severe. When you get KO'd you can be waiting upwards of 300+ seconds to have your guy wake up. After bandaging yourself, you must limp/walk to the nearest city to sleep if you don't have the materials to make a camp bed. Getting to the nearest city can take long enough, but sleeping till recovery takes waaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy too long considering how the rest of this recovery process goes...-If you do make a camp bed, because limping to the nearst town takes too long, I hope you don't mind spending the night with bandits or dogs, who will stand over you until you wake up. And then kill you. And if it was dogs instead of bandits, then you might as well make a new game, because they're not going anywhere after you get KO'd.-Poor optimization in its current state.A lot of people enjoy the game, and for good reason. Just be warned that you might find this game to be pretty tedious, frustrating, and possibly unplayable. I'd say to wait a while before buying.			"

								Not to bad for a little EA. Seems my library is filling with those. Not a whole lot to do at this time except roam the waste and find new members, and sadly they dont respawn, so once you empty a bar out of potentials thats it. Otherwise its about build your base / manufacturing facility and then set out to make money. The combat is rough at first, your so overclassed, but just because your team is beaten down does not mean its over, sometimes some wake up or are just playing dead and will get up after the bad guys leave and you can save your team with them. Its also persistent in damage, if a guy has a bum leg, he will limp, and slow the party down. Having the best weapons and armor wont save you either, you can have it but if you dont know how to use it then its just a burden and for show. Lots of fun though. I dont feel like I wasted anything on this one.			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi as an idea has taken me in a way that most largely produced titles haven't been able to.  Having played just above 80 hours I feel I can write a decent review of this game.  Having bought the game almost a year and half ago and seeing short progress I was worried; however, it's good to see that there are dedicated people still out there not just trying to get their quick cash and move on.  Kenshi offers you a vast empty (which is good)  desert world where you must fend for yourself and that's as far as the story will take you at this moment in time.   The choice is yours, what do you do? Read a bunch of f**king guides is what you do, or at least myself, but I digress.  Throughout gameplay you must make decisions where to incoporate your time....as in...do I take my only 2 soldiers to escort my 3 traders to a town to sell Ale/chainmail/katanas/fragaxes/medkits/etc, or do i keep 1 soldier at the outpost guarding 2 of those traders while they continue to produce while only sending 1 soldier and 1 trader....which could possibly be attacked by a multitude of people (have fun with that population setting!)  At the same time you must research and dedicate certain squadmates to certain jobs where they will become more proficient as such.  Efficiency is key in Kenshi especially when you just start your outpost.          Base building is relatively smooth with only minor bugs which can be avoided by a quick save and reload  (applies to entire gameplay as well), and although there aren't uses for many of the items currently ingame besides monetary value there is much promise for the future.  The core buildings on the other hand are useful and there are many of them with industry like processes to advance your small faction as such.            As far as skills go Kenshi has many of the same skills you find in any other RPG game out there, the difference is that these skills actually have a real-time effect in gameplay.  What i mean by that is that if you have low strength, good luck carrying that backpack full of steel, wearing durable heavy armors, and larger weapons all while slowing you down becoming cannibal food in the process......AND making your Attack say (-14) because you dont know what you're doing with said weapon......fool.         So the game hits on the saying ""practice makes perfect."" in a nutshell in all skill-like aspects.  The unfortunate side is that there are still a considerable amount of skills ""greyed"" out not finished yet (awesome when finished)  but do not let that take away from this light of a game in this dark re-hashed titled clone world of ours.  It's EA and for as imperative as the devs made the skills (not just stat raises) is something fresh, oh what else is fresh that i forgot..LOCATIONAL DAMAGE!  wut, indie game? Naw that's unheard of...WRONG.  You get your leg beaten to a pulp?  Well I hope you can afford a walking stick Mr. Gimpy until you treat it medically.  The best part is that you don't die instantly, you bleed, you fight, pass out to wake and fight again! then pass out! and die.  Game over unless you have meds.           Visually, the game remains desolate yet somehow pleasing.  It actually feels like a post-apocalyptic world that you were just thrown into with the sole goal to survive however you see fit.  Some of the structures do look a little edgy at times, and not everything lines up 100% but the end result is fair enough.  Things look as they should....In conclusion, because I'm mediocre at reviews,  I find Kenshi very immersive, well thought and executed, and a challenging game considering the dev's choice of realism.  That's saying a lot for those indie's and with this one you'll dump hours into it without even realizing once you understand the concepts.  Honestly, I can't wait to play this thing once it's finished....seriously.  There's nothing else like it right now.  For how much this game costs and for how much content you get it's a decently fair price, try to get it on sale if you can.  Plus, I totally believe in supporting devs that change the industry with great ideas like this. Keep it up!Gameplay:    8/10Visuals:         7/10Updates:       6/10  (steadily increasing)Overall quality:    7/10Progress?   I'd say it's around 60% done overall (don't murder me it's an educated guess)P.S.  The bugs (not crashes) i've personally found to be more amusing than not most of the time.  Watching bandits and sometimes fellow squadmates violently ragdoll into the sky for a brief moment when are knocken unconcious can somewhat take me by surprise.  Or when the ai gets stupid and bunches up for a massive aoe 1 hitter with a frag axe. KO mother*****  "

								Used to be my favorite game of all time.  Now I find the map & content to be cluttered.  It used to be about samurai, and now it's about something I don't understand yet.  The game expanded too much on too many different things & themes at once, which took away its main appeal to me.  If you're looking for a samurai game, then this isn't it unfortunately.  I bought it when it was a game about swordsman traveling the land making a name for their self.  Now there's monsters, the map is too big, overpowered NPC's in large massive groups and despawning NPC's.  I feel like every single update for the past year or so, has not made the game any better, if anything.. all of it feels random to me.  Why are there monsters?  How do they make the game any better?  What's the point in the map being so large when the game insists that you build a base and just turtle your entire playthrough.  Things like being a merchant is really dumb now with how large the map is and so on.  Seems like the only ideal way to play this game is to turtle at a base, and bait enemies into your harpoon nest.  Game used to be more of a ""do whatever you want"" now it's just a RTS survival game.  Having enemies in a massive group (like 20+) teaches you that you should be prioritizing getting the largest squad, not attacking anyone, and baiting bandits into them for the first 20+ hours.  NPC's need to be more scattered, not only are these NPC's capable of soloing 10 of your dudes, but they also have to be in a large group?  There's nothing you can do other than cheese it with harpoon nests, play it like a base building simulator and hope you don't get bored by the time you get strong enough to engage in the content.  All the other NPC's are turtling also, some of the races have like 50+ or something NPC's all cluttered in a single town.  So attacking a single one will get you mobbed quickly.			"

								Actual Review after the first chunk of Text.I've been reading quite a few Negative Reviews about this game complaining about how it's bugged and how slow the development on this is, though I do not find this negative, especially since this game Is in Early Access and in it's Alpha Stage. People complain about games not being Bugfree while they are still in Early Access, which is meant to help the developers to improve the game by finding said bugs and reporting them to them. About the development being slow though, yes i have to agree the development is quite slow, with the game being in Early Access / Alpha for over 5 years now, though they do release updates quite regularly most of the time. well now that this rant is over on to the Actual Review.Kenshi is a Squad Based Open World Role playing Game that is currently in it's Alpha (for over 5 years now).The Game in it's current version has already quite a lot to offer, especially with some of the bigger updates still coming up. The Development on this game can be quite slow since it is being produced by a small Team consisting of 6 Actual members and a few Volunteers and Freelancers.Positives about the Game:+ You currently have quite a Huge map that you can explore and build your base on with more and different Land to be released in a future update.+ You aren't god in this game, you are a basic human (or group of humans) that has to survive in the desert (maybe other places in later updates), not more, not less.+ The game is actively being Developed even if it may be slow, the game has been receiving updates for over 5 years now so I'll doubt that the studio has any plans on abandoning it.+ Has great music (not too much different music but great music)Negatives:- You won't get a full on Role Playing feel yet as the game is still in development.- A bit hard to get into at first- Kinda slow development though i don't blame them, I have enough respect for them for even trying to make a game like this.- Obviously, you will experience Bugs since it's in Early Access.Final Verdict:This Game is already great and shows potential to become one of my favorite Squad Based RPGs. If you are a fan of games like these go ahead and buy it, but be aware that the Game is still in Early Access / Alpha which means you won't get a full on ""Finished Game"" experience. Early Access is here to help Developers find bugs and help them find ideas not for actually playing the game early. So if you want to help the Development (even if it is quite slow sometimes) go ahead and get it. But if you want a full game experience wait until the Game gets out of Early Access somewhen.			"

Early Access Review
								As it stands now in Early Access, Kenshi shows a lot of promise as a hit game.  I play with experimental patches enabled, and I get to see the latest additions to the game- bugs included.  If you're a fan of participating in the course of a game's development, your input can- and will greatly impact- the course of the game's development.  This is one everyone should get onboard for!For starters, I'd like to thank members of the development team and their forum moderators for being so involved in discussion.  Many of the threads created in both the Steam forums and the Lo-Fi Game forums end up with answers from members of the team, and what you say can and will make an impact.  To be able to get in touch with someone heading up the game and recieve a personal response is both uplifting and noteworthy.  For me, this game gets high marks for this level of involvement in the community, as for many other development teams, such close coordination has been too much to ask for!On to gameplay; Kenshi is an interesting mesh of Real Time Strategy, base-building, caravaneer mechanics, where you have many choices of how to make your living.In terms of RTS, you can choose from or mod your own Game Start that allows you to pick a set of characters or character, and enter the game world to begin an adventure.  Mechanics are simple:  Using the Numpad or your mouse, you select your character and order them with a click to move.  You can do this to adjust your active navigation, taking detours where you need to, or you can rely upon the surprisingly competent pathfinding AI, which can take you from one side of the map to the other appropriately if you let it, though sometimes patches make this feature a bit fragile.  There is no first person or third person play, it's really a game of watching and hoping you've trained your guys enough that they can handle themselves in a combat situation.Your life revolves around your squad, and what you choose to do with them.  You will, at some point, be attacked, and you will have to fight back, so it's best to train up your brave men and women any way you can to keep yourself above the frey.  At lower levels, combat can be hard, if not embarassing.  You can be slaughtered and not even see a rational reason why (other than your guys just suck at swinging a weapon).  Currently, swordsmanship is the big deal going around, granted the namesake of Mortal Kombat character Kenshi (literally; swordsman), though turrets have been added to the game and ranged weapons are expected in the future (no muskets or revolvers, though modding will make that quite easy to do once ranged mechanics are in, so look forward to it!).The real fun in Kenshi is in what you decide to do with yourself once you're in.  Bounty Hunting, Raiding, Murder and Looting are all part of the possibilities, but more than that, you have the option to become the target of such things.One of the lifestyles you can fall into is a sort of wandering trader, or caravaneer.  Basically, you throw backpacks on a few of your squad members, put the best weapons in the hands of your best muscle, and send your people from town to town crating goods for sale.  Each town hosts a unique set of prices for certain goods; Chainmail can be worth 76% of it's base value one place, and 130% of that value in another, allowing you to invest a lot of money that makes a good return.  All that matters is that you don't oversell to the extent that it breaks their bank.  Being a traveling merchant grants many benefits, and it's a good way to get a leg up in a new game, as running builds strength and athletics, which aid in fighting, running and hauling later on in your lifecycle.Alternatively, the player can create their own town and have the merchants come to them.  Now, this is a fantastic feature, the construction mechanics of the game are pretty solid, even in it's current state.  If you see a man-made structure in the game, chances are that you'll be able to build it.  You start with a decent shack or house, build a research table, set up a farm, and start work on learning new things and stockpiling new resources.  It takes a while for a town to become self-sustaining, but when it does, you can feel free to hermit it up.  You basically have the same tools at your disposal as the developers do when it comes to construction, and you can make the same quality of layout if your talent allows.  Setting up shops and resource centers allows trade and storage, and building walls and turrets keeps out any unsavory individuals that you might find in the wasteland.  Yes, sometimes a world without borders can be a dangerous one.If being a nice guy minding his own business doesn't suit you, or if the Holy Nation stumbles upon your town of peaceful Shek peoples, becoming a more hostile force is also an option.  You even get the option to be a little creative...  Building cages and holding areas for the people you knock out on the battlefield gives you the option to take prisoners, and there'll certainly be more that you can do with this mechanic as the game progresses.  The Role Playing options offered in this game exceed those offered in many others, and the style of gameplay isn't just fun, but addictive.With this said, there are a few downsides to the game that you would probably want to know about before buying.For one, Kenshi seems to be set-in-stone in terms of what lore it will follow.  This is no problem to most people, but to some, it's pretty concentrated on one Apocalyptic Eastern theme.  I've found that the concept the game follows is a bit rigid, as it celebrates the way of Eastern warriors, yet, leaves out the opportunity to equip shields for added defense, neglects any Western-style weaponry (no Claymore, Gladius, Spear, or Cutlass styles), and the story behind it all can be a bit confusing, at times, with regard to finding a point in it all.What bugs me about the weapon variety is partly explained by the fact that I'm more familiar with Western swordsmanship than Eastern, and I feel that these arts are something that the game is missing out on in a great opportunity.  As it stands, there are a limited number of weapon classes and they're pretty much wide-spread, though manufactured by different ""companies"" and distributed across the world.  There's a lot of room for far more variety, and it'd help a lot to convey the differences in design between factions if these weapons weren't just different shaders and colors, or cousins basically (different but the same).  Don't get me wrong, there's like 12 separate weapon types in the game, but they're all pretty closely related.  If more varieties were included, you could see a stronger divide between each faction, and one sword from Holy Nation could convey an entirely different culture than a sword from the United Cities.  That's the biggest thing about this metal craftsmanship; it makes unique combat styles for unique cultures.  More weight should be placed in this category of diversity.The next thing is definitely the lack of shields.  Blocking is done by swords, and if you've studied metal, you know at some point it'll give out.  Eastern warfare did involve the usage of shields in battle at times, and they really do deserve a place in the combat dossier.  Additionally, including shields would open up a new realm of possibilies for modders possessing the talent to model new designs for inclusion in the game.  Imagine having an entire Roman Legion patrolling the game world, the possibilities are endless.When it comes to the background of Kenshi, I feel that it might be set in stone, and since I don't know what's written on that stone, it leaves me unsure of how the development will play out.  I am confident in the team's ability to carry out their mission and bring this game to completion, but I do worry that some ideas might not see the light of day.All said, this game is well worth buying!

I wouldn't recommend this to the casual gamer as the learning curve is kind of steep but if you enjoy open world sandbox games with RPG elements then this game might be for you.			"

								After searching for a game that even resembled Mount & Blade. I was able to find this gem of a game. I have played way more hours then what is currently said on steam, I had the game before they even put it on steam but I don't recall how long ago that was. Anyway this game is amazing and I love how unique it is from every game. The game first will first ask what gameplay do you want to start was and the option was wanderer and something else. Then you got thrown into game and had your character customize screen show up to change the way your character looked and name him as well. Then it would make you feel that you could not fight alone in the game and that you were just weaker then everyone since they've been through experiences that you haven't even experienced yourself like fighting. Since then they've added tons of new features like farming, mining, and crafting, as well as a lot of new defensive weapons at our disposal. They haven't done an update in a long time though since the next one is supposedley the 64-bit build, new pathfinding engine, and the map too. So i'll update this review when it comes out.			"

								A great sand box game, with a promising future. An interesting progresion of your characters, they dont start as powerfull as is the nowadays norm, infact they are really weak and have to be really carefull and lucky. But suriving long enough in this game brings great joy. The only game i can compare with Kenshi would be dark souls series. They are both really hard, and involve a lot of deaths. Althrought the game is still in alpha/beta stage, I believe that if your searching something new and refreshing, you should try this game. I dont think that everyone will love it or like it but nevertheless its quite a good game with dedicated creators who try to improve the game as fast as they possibly can and give it a lot of love.

								Kenshi Is a fantastic idea but is one of those gruesomely Beta/Alpha games that we all know steam to be a hub for. There is still alot of work to be done on stability (The experimental version is very prone to crashing) and aspects of the game are still in progress of being developed. So if you have a short temperament you may wish to wait till it's finished.That being said it's very difficult drawing yourself away for it. Creating your charaters from hair to feet then training them up in whatever respected fields you wish them to delve into from farming to swordplay to thievery . Beautifully thought out landscapes and structures to explore and the abusive bandits that wander there. Once you make enough of a living from selling your scraps to traders in towns, you can even build your own settlement from scrach and make a town of your own.Hopefully if and when the game is finished being fiddled with, this can be an amazing game giving players the full freedom every RPG deserves.

								After waking up in the desert with nothing besides a stick and some pants I decide to wander to look for someone who can help. I come across a small fort that was well off and had slaves gathering materials. When I approached them they did not seem to mind me. Knowing this, I enter one of their buildings and try to steal some Sake. A guard quickly knocks me unconscious, puts me in a cage and strips me of my belongings, which were already next to nothing. After weeks of trying to pick the lock and attempted escapes I manage to sneak out close to 3am in the morning when the guards were asleep. I swiftly and silently steal some clothes and a sword, and when the time was right I legged it out the compound. After a good hour of fleeing the compound and its many guards, a group of bandits attack the guards, allowing me to escape into the distance. I am now a free ex-slave that is trading items to try to make enough money to survive.Edit1 (hours later irl);I have now established a thieves den hidden near a lake in the desert. I frequently travel to cities to collect ""pre owned"" merchandise and resell this to another village deeper into the forest. Good game/yes			"

								Kenshi is a squad based open world post apocolyptic RPG, but you probably knew that already. When I forst bought this game like maybe one odd years ago it was rough, but I could see the potential and managed to enjoy almost 50 hours of it. I was coutious to recommend at the time because I wasnt sure if development would be dropped or not seeing as it was slow and economically unstable. Recently I checked back and was thrilled to see development is continuing and significant progress is being made. With these doubts out of the picture I am confident in recommending this game. It has alot of charm and is well thought out, A truly free RPG.			"

								Brilliant game. When I bought this game quite a long time ago I had originally thought the developers had bitten off more than they could chew as the sandbox feel, and being able to do almost anything you want with AI reacting accordingly seemed ambitious, but its coming together now and they are pulling it off as promised. There are still a lot of things that need to be fixed but so far I am having a blast and am glad I re-installed the game to give it another go.Build a massive town, recruit people to help you run it efficiently and have them setup for certain tasks so you dont have to micro manage them. Steal, kill, kidnap, do whatever you like to get ahead. Just be cautios of the reprocutions of your actions. There isn't to much of a story line that I have found, but that doesn't really matter as you are essentially creating your own story. It seems as if only a 1/4 of the world is done and can be explored, but its big enough to keep you busy for quite some time. Once the other 3/4 are done it will take you quite some time to thouroughly explore all that the world has to offer. Setup your town almost anywhere, just can't set it up to close to another town. It seems like there are well over 100 different things you can build in your town, and that is not including the massive amount of things you can craft. Setup a shop and sell your wares to passers by even. If you are into well thought out sandbox RPG style games, you wont be dissapointed unless you are not someone who can get over little quirks.The Devs seem to be throwing in updates way more often than I remember and I think that had something to do with them changing engines or re-writting things back in the day which held them up. I am hoping they can get to more content and features soon, but am satisfied at the pace they are going as of now.Right now my character has a $23,000 bounty on his head, is hated by half the map, and I am loving it. It makes it challenging and then doesn't make me feel bad when I sneak up, knock someone out stealthy, take their stuff and throw them in a cage.I must say this game is a buy, and once it has been completed I would pay at least 2.5 as much as what the game is selling at now. Nice Job Devs!			"

								Well..................I bought this at the end of Crimbo 2016 as the writeups were quite good and seemed like a challenge from what I was reading. + I was bored to tears.And.............in the space of 3 weeks I have racked up 146 hours!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-O I got over 300 on Fallout 4 for over 3 months playing it on and off, so this has been a real developer achievement to me!!!!Okay, so yes, it's ard! It's bloody ard to begin with but once you start realising that being beaten the s*it out of is actually good for you and that selling iron to shops for supplies until you can buy your first companions to speed up that process then go on to building a base and farms and producing weapons you can sell for huge profits instead of lumps of iron.........everything develops really fast and the exploring can commence!Pros: Base building including trading for food or developing your own farms and power systemsMicro management from the ground up (But not TOO much and can get 1 person taking up several jobs simultaneously)Fair and realistic levelling system for your troopsLive how you want to live: Be a thief, be a farming community, be a bandit community, be weapon/clothing/armour smiths or be all of that in one go as long as you dont pee too many people off as they dont forget (I was friendly with Holy Nation only until I knew my peeps were geting ard and could rip them new a** holes when demanding I follow their ridiculous religion every single time I went near their camps.....better not say much more......)Enjoy exploring a relatively huge map which is overwhelming to begin with, but feels small after sploring every corner looking for artifacts. < There is a shaded out part that is to come in the future and it's HUGE!!!!!Cons:Not optimised enough for anything under the ""recommended"" system requirements in my opinion and my rig is slightly better than those specs and still have to run this in low settings. (It's still beautiful though!)Annoying saving timesAnnoying loading timesSome infuriating glitches exist such as people becoming stuck and brainless but a long save and load cures this.It's got me hooked and I have a fully self sufficient town with 10 ""Homesteads"" (Farmers, smithys creating 6k garments and weapons, water collectors, miners etc etc) 10 ""Warriors"" who are only defeated in this game by Leviathans (You will see, but if you do manage to kill a ""Baby"" you get a very pricey artifact :-/) and finally, the ""Legends""......erm....Hercules, Iolus, Xena, Gabriel and Maximus.....and they are still sh*te, ha ha ha ha. Oh and a massive ""Elder"" Mountain Dog I started with that tears everything apart like a rabid rhino, 3 bulls for trade caravanning which also ram attackers flying into the air or many meters away which is amusing, and a seriously leary Bonedog. Yeah.......this game is a great world to escape to.......and even cancelled a couple of real world adventures because of it in December.Highly recommended, and it's still under development with continuous and steady updates!Be aware though, if you are like me, you may start off and think OMG this is terrible and request a refund, but I followed the advice of other reviewers and gave it a couple of hours.....than BAM, glued like a ladys six toy to the clat.

This hearkens back to early RPGs like Fallout 2, Balder's Gate etc. You are the story, you make the story. It's similar to mount and blade warband in that respect. You can choose to do anything however its a time sink.You can play it like the lone wanderer, group of adventurers, or you can play it like age of empires.The choice is yours			"

								Of course trhere need a lot to be done.. On the other side: this is a realy great game with a lot more potential for the future! Worth to buy and play it now allready; in my opinion YES !!! With the start as 'wanderer' you have to do it all the way, and this is very nice to play. My first money i spend on good boots and an extra backpack, with a bit luck i found 2 dead body's and take there cloths & weapons.. so good enough to equip at the moment.. Then i found a group of bandids, i run back towards the city i started and let them killed by the guards there.. did enjoy the battle myself also, and making progress in attack & defend that way. With all those loot i found on there body's ik make nice money and could hire the first 2 members of my group..Did this a couple times and could hire 2 more (already trained) other members + better gear. Start to get building on my self.. started with my 1st settlement with a little barack and a stone mine.. Now after +- 30 hrs playing time i have 8 members (3 last recruited in the second city i visite), upgrade the stone mine, build also 2 power-generators, a stone working machine, build the 1st house with 4 beds and training body + first city walls build to protect my 1st settlement a bit and.. All members well equiped for there level. Some little inside story's.. : After several fights with smaller bandit-groups (i can take them down) and bigger groups of sand-bandits (witch i take after me to the city-guards, to fight them together and take there loots.. + selling the gang-boss for good money to the head guards).. ..then there came a group of 'cannibals'.. to my little settlement.. they take 2 of my members down, picked them up and running away with them.. omg.. lol.. bud, they run into the arms of a walking patrouille from guild guards.. they take the cannibals down and my members could struggeled back to our settlement... pffftttt.. end good :P In all the time i played till now, i only have 2 crashes (saving regulary is always the better thing to do), so that's not so bad for a starting game i suppose. There is a well done balance between the attacks from the (4 differend types) of bandids walking around and the time you can spend on selling, buying, training, building).. That's very satisfied to play like this in a game like this!Conclusion: Like i say at the beginning, there is still a lot to do.. but for sure it's worth to buy and play! For now allready nice playing and we hope it will be more and more in the future.. All by all; Thanks to the maker(s) : nice & good work allready, hope a lot more to come.. Have fun by playing this xD  "

								I bought this game early Alpha on steam and from then up until now i have not once regretted that decision, I have played countless hours of the game and every time i pick it up to play/start a new game i find myself locked into the world of Kenshi for countless hours without realising just how much i need to get away from my PC. Since Beta the amount of content added has been amazing, the game has progressively gotten better without breaking away from what makes the game gorgeous. The game is immense in terms of how you can play it and what you can do within it, the quality of the content is in no way lacking and neither is the replayability because of it. Starting as a lone wanderer and deciding to build a town or village from which to build your own trade empire has such a wonderful feel to it as you slowly watch as your carefully maintained entourage survive and grow stronger. The only reason i cannot give this game 5 stars is because the game is of course in early access and thus prone to bugs, of which I have experienced none, and constant change. I find it exciting as more get's added, starting fresh never feels boring as every new game can be played wildly differently and watching my main character grow stronger, and with the combat your successfull battles actually feel thoroughly fulfilling, never seems to grow tiresome. I highly reccomend this game, it is not like most top down Sim/Rpg ish game's are and it's definitely tough to get a handle on at first but twice as rewarding once you start to understand the hidden beauty behind this game. Even down to the music and plentiful subtleties that can be found within the game, i found the experience and continued experience of playing this game to be unchangingly pleasant. Most definitely worth far more than they are asking for price wise.			"

								I love this game!I'd say Kenshi is a one of a kind, a bit of a niche game.. there are very few you can compare it to.The learning curve is steep, but the mountain top is not too high!Because it is a open world sandbox game you can play Kenshi in so many different waysEverything from being just a handful of very highly trained ninjas to a big warband of mercenaries, or perhaps you want to be a merchant, set up shop inside a city ? or build your very own city and bring trade to you!I have 140 hours on record all played with the same savegame and i consider myself having reached 'end game' if that term even applies to a game such as this :P and what I will say is there are end game features missing, such as proper diplomacy, ways of making your own actual faction/kingdom, waging war + the fact that only half the map is playable. So I feel like I am out of things to do on my current savegame because I am strong enough to assult cities and wiping them out, but it doesnt lead to alot currently..but trust me when I say the journey there was SO enjoyable I can't even.. and the devs do work on it and update it frequently adding in all these things that are missing!Very much reccomend this game!

I appreciate that this is a small dev team (1 guy?) but people should know that it will (based on current trends) take years for this game to finish, if ever, by which point you will most likely be playing something else as you will have done this to death.

								Kenshi Is one of my favorite games of all time. The free roam combined with the ability to play however you please is great. The sword fighting is smooth and feels like a action movie. Your always determined to get more powerful and in depth base building so your rarely left wandering around with nothing to do next. The game has multiple starting back storys to choose from and after you spend a good bit of time completing those you can mod the game quite easily. The ability to create and mod the entire world of kenshi after watching a 10 minute youtube video is amazing. Ive spent close to a hundred hours just modding kenshi the way I please. Anything in kenshi I think is to hard or easy I can fix. You can also create custom armor,weapons and pretty much change the entire world in anyway you want. I only wish more games would give there community the ability to do this so easily. Kenshi gets a 10 out of 10 in my book.			"

								I've actually created a video for this game if anyone is interested in viewing it. It is more of a collections of musings and my thoughts on the game as well as whether I think the game is worth the purchase. In the video I say 15 dollars when the actual price is 20. My recommendation still stands. Watch it if you want and let me know if you agree!

								155 hours of play and climbing, this game is a great combination of player punishment and self driver objective gameplay. Do I want to farm? Do I want to fight? how do I know I'll even survie this fight? que the lone medic picking up their kin from the floor and dusting them off before the scavengers arrive. Such a great game but not recommended for people used to being spoon fed virtual achievements. This game is a slow crawl to the mountain top, clenching your teeth the whole journey, only to know that one mistake will throw you back down again.			"

								This game provides all the elements I look for in a game if any of the following apply to you, you will enjoy this.1. Micromanagement; As your group grows the functions for each grow and multi tasking stays fresh, you wont go long before a bandit attack. There's always work to do, training to be done the tasks never end. Making your party run laps in their precious down time, training your combat skills on captured prisoners, producing gear or buildind/researching the list goes on.2.RPG; Each character has its own stats, the time it takes to get anything to level 20+ is abit time consuming, but it gives a sense of satisfaction as you make another character a mighty warrior in the wasteland.3.City Building; Build your own city! it takes time, but building your own utopia complete with shops, workshops, homes, outposts, defense walls, mounted crossbows, the only limit is how long your willing to spend preparing your characters for the coming construction.4.Crafting; At first its more about gathering gear from fallen foe's outside the city gates, but once you begin teching and producing your own gear, a high quality katana compared to a rusty one is a beautiful sight, you can also produce all the raw materials needed for self preservation which is tougher, but for some more rewarding.5.Diplomacy; Want to be friends with a certain group of bandits? Heal some of their fallen kin, eventually they will stop attacking you and come to your aide. (This takes time, I also assume in the future there will be many diplomatic aspects, but have yet to be added).6.Permanent Death; Think your starter character is a badass? wrong. Each unit becomes precious, you grow attatched as they become valueable, and then at the worst moment a critical strike leaves them stranded far from a safe location, too far to carry safely without a character with strength above 30... you keep watching hoping the bleeding stops and he'll enter a recovery coma but no his status switches to ""dying"" and you panic, time to decide if your capable enough to make the rescue, because even if you are, a large enough band of bandits/cannibals could strike you all down, and end your game. (Also note, the cannibals will take your people prisoner and amount of time you have to wait for a distraction is FOREVER, but its great).7.Travel/Relocation; Making it town to town in the begining is thrilling, as your group grows and you safely reach each destination, perhaps traveling with a caravan or a squad of UC/HO troops for safety, or braving the journey alone it's deadly every time. Also, the town you're in could be overrun. (I've seen it happen twice lol)8.Huge Replay Value; Start in a new town, new conditions, different starting squad, death at the start, who knows? The randomness is astounding, you could find ""wingman"" at the start, walk out near ""Shark"" and get hacked to piece by roaming sand ninja. You've read enough. Buy it, before it gets better and you feel like an idiot for not have gotten it sooner.			"

								I played this game for over a year on Desura before it came to Steam and let me just say, if you're looking for a fun tactical-strategy-rpg-citybuilding extravaganza, look no further. Kenshi has the most open playability of any game I've played since Ultima Online. If you want to develop a trading outpost into a bustling town, you can. If you just want to be a bunch of nomad bandits, have at it!Pros-Such Depth! Much Fun!-Deep Character Progression-Develop your faction into whatever you want from honored to infamous and enjoy the faction effects it has toward every other group in the game.-Awesome Music, but it gets a little repetitive after hours.-Fun Crafting and Construction System!Cons-There's a bit of a learning curve and -Unrealistic combat. The best way to grind skills is to walk fights and just kite the enemies to a town to level up your fighting which gets monotonous and doesn't make any sense. Were I a bandit, I doubt I would chase some nobodies to my doom, but that's just me.			"

								GOD I want to love this game. I really want to. I've played over 40 hours in an absurdly short amount of time trying to love it and make it work. I know it just went Beta, but this is one of the least playabe Betas (or even Alphas) I have ever taken part in.Pathfinding is absolutely terrible. The worst of any RTS I've ever played. If you build a wall, plan on randomly getting stuck on terrain and having to deconstruct part of the wall so your resources are *poof* gone. Oh it's not over there - good luck trying to get the two parts of the walls to attach again, because there is random wall collision detection that prevents you from attaching the two pieces of the wall, so there's a good chance you'll have to start over on a huge section of wall. There have been modest improvements to pathfinding, not least of which is your squad tries its best to use the road rather than going offroad. This seems to be a hasty workaround, because going offroad seems to get you stuck for no apparent reason a lot of the time. Also plan on reversing your path and straightening out an approach on one squad member when going through gates into cities. The devs have the best intentions by attempting the following:- Auto-hauling- Priority queues- Clicking on a point on the map and having the squad automatically go thereThe problem with these is the execution. Auto-hauling works alright, but you have to have a specific box for the item. For example, autohauling stone has to go to a stone box. So you're taking up a ton of space with storage boxes. This leads into priority queues, which only show 5 of the tasks you have lined up even though you can have more. So if you have 10 resources you want to haul to 10 different boxes for efficiency's sake, you won't see the 5 tasks in the bottom of the queue so you have no idea if you actually have them queued or not. So you might have to deleted and restart your entire queue if you forget.When going to a city by selecting a point on the map, there's a good chance your squad will randomly stop and just stand there because it doesn't know where to go, even though you selected a point on the map. This map feature is very new, so I'll give it a pass. It just needs some polish. It works a lot of the time.Whoamygod crashes. Pre .90, crashes used to be once every 5-10 minutes (so lower your Autosave threshold unless you want to constantly lose progress). Patch .90.11 made the game literally unplayable (crash shortly after load every time, regardless of whether you start a new game or not).  However, since then the crashes have gotten LOADS better. I just hope this continues.The devs try hard (it seems) but it feels like they're playing a game of whack-a-mole. They squash a bug, another bug (or two, or three) appears in its place. I just hope to god it gets a lot more polish in the automation and pathfinding departments. Micromanaging to this degree and especially with this much frustration is not fun. If these key areas improve, this will turn a messy, bug-ridden game into a GREAT game.All that ugliness aside... I will continue to support the game (because it's the only one of its kind really right?) and will likely change my review if there's a lot of polish. Right now it's not lookin good though.			"

								I have played this game since version .15 or so, back when it was nothing but a desert and black portraits for characters. Having said this, the game has come a long way since then. However, after the version that added the first new expansion to the north of the new map the additions are trivial and ""same old"" as the ones that came before them. While some bugs have came and gone no actual meaningful features have been added just new areas to do the same old things in.I've played this game on multiple different saves, some with huge squads, some with just 4, and on steam here this many hours was put solely on a single character. I mention this because playing with a single character will allow you to see the overglaring flaws that this game has fundementally. I loved Kenshi, when the first map expansion came out and I ran into the armor king I couldn't wait for chris to add more depth to the story or even special characters like him but I've been let down every single update since then as I said previously any new expansion is just additions to the same old routine. At this point in my solo playthrough I can kill anything without much effort, even being hopelessly outnumbered. Most of the main draw of the game *was* the difficulty for me, that has now been shattered. It took over 100 hours to get to that point but the fact it exists and any new content is null because of it shows that this game will not be anything more than it is currently. It lacks depth it lacks character. Even if they throw the rest of the map together I'll just roam aimlessly to find all markers and slaughter the highest stat enemies I can find but none of it will bring the fun back.You can steal things, why bother after the 2nd or 3rd town sack? You can kill things, why bother after 80+ stats, you can trade, why bother when you don't even need cats unless you need material from shops. That is the current feature list as it stands. You cannot meddle within the current factions, you cannot influence them in any way, you cannot help them against eachother in any way. In short, the only decisions you have to make seem rather dull and tiny compared to when you let your imagination run free and fill in the gaps for you. There's no doubt that anyone who first loves this game as I have will do that very thing. In the end it comes down to this; Is Kenshi worth 20$ as it stands? Yes, it is. even playing as I did, 100 hours is easily worth the money, I've spent far more on far less gametime. But do I recommend it to others? No, it's a love-hate relationship for me. Once you see the game for what it really is it's a shell of what could have been. I can only imagine how chris will decide to salvage what tiny bit is left to finish and tie it all together. Unless he's hiding some major features that he has yet to even announce to anyone after all these years the game core itself, the very heart of it, will be a cheap experience that will continue to make you feel empty and ask ""what if"" or ""what could have been""			"

								Kenshi is a very good and fun game, Kenshi is the kind of game I love because it has some features that big games don't. First thing I'll say is: ""don't buy this game if you have no patiance"" This game is a little bit hard in the beggining because you're not special... in the begging almost everyone is stronger than you so be careful, to BE special you have to work for it, you gotta pursue it, and that's what I love about kenshi. I can't describe with words, what I can say is: download the demo in their website and you'll feel/know what I mean, I haven't played much but I loved what I played of it. It's buggy, it crashes a lot, sometimes you'll rage in front of your computer and stop playing it for a week but Kenshi is amazing and you know you'll play it again. the developers always keep updating with bugs fixes and add some minor content, and from time to time there's a ""big content update"" wich adds a lot of new stuff.

								It was a loooong time ago that I bough kenshi, when all characters we hairless, and the world was one big desert. There have been times when the game has been completely unplayable, bugs, glitches, crashes and low frame rates. Happily the game moves ever forward and gets better and better. That's not to to say there aren't still bugs and gliches, there are (I'm writing this review right after the game crashed to desktop), but honestly those problems don't stop this from being one of my favorite games of all time. The main hook for me is how you can create so many different stories with your character, a soldier, trader, thief, lord of your own settlement all starting from a nobody who gets beaten up and left for dead by everybody. I have a real emotional attachment to my characters, we have been through a lot in the 135 hours together. Honestly, I recomend this game to anyone who likes creating their own stories, RPG sandbox world and really some of the most entertaining fights ever.			"

								I have been following Kenshi for around three years now. It has grown from very basic mechanics and framework, to this very ambitious and well deserving piece of RPG interpretation. The sky is limited on what you can do now. However, the creator has been able to utilize a team to help him create the game he wants. Key features include free roaming, base building, character development and many more mechanics that make Kenshi great but also set it apart from the rest of the crowd. It has the environment and finesse that allows you to craft your own story in a very unique and different setting than a traditional RPG. It's easily the embodiment of everything a die-hard RPG fan would want to play. It's probably the Sienfeld of RPG's.			"

								(MAY BE A SPOILER) I love this game, especially because of the very large battles that can take place in one area. Excluding the lag that can occur in those battles, a income that can be obtained is the loot after the battle: off of the NPCs killed. The best thing about this game is the vastness of the map! I love how there can be, say Bandits, Holy Men, and then Cannibals all fighting outside of a village. Big problem, or maybe a little confusing/disappointing feature in this game is the money shown on NPCs that you kill around the map (what I mean is how it'll say that they have,for example, 6000 cats or money on them when you loot that character - but those 6000 cats are only pointed among their whole team put together; main problem is that the only money that you can obtain is the bounty on the leader which can be about 1000 cats). All in all, this game is HIGHLY recommended to those who like to play strategy games in an open world, build anywhere game. ~15/10			"

								One of the hidden gems of steam, this rare greenlight success story stands as proof that amongs the sea of greenlit garbage, there still exist some quality titles.I would urge anyone who has been scarred by the early-access system not to be afraid. I've owned this game since 2013 back when there were only ~three types of armor with similar graphics and few features of note. It somehow managed to be surprisingly fun then, and it has only gotten better since. The dev('s) put out updates often and the game has undergone fundamental changes since 2013. The squad system, the new worldmap, the new factions, the overhaul of equiptment (eg. the armour I mentioned earlier) - all these things have changed since then and every one of these changes, though I often initially missed the old ways, were for the better.Some will say a sandbox game which has been in early access alpha for two years is neccesarily a lost hope. This game proves otherwise.The game is still a little laggy and may run slow on older rigs, it also occasionally crashes, though the rate of these has fallen drastically since '13.I strongly reccomend this game to anyone interested in a vast, open-world survival RPG where it is the player who creates his/her own story.

You start off as a regular Joe and can either join a major Faction to help you hone your combat skills or trek off into the wastes and ATTEMPT to make your own life in this harsh world with no mercy.I highly recommend this game. If your not too sure about purchasing it straight out, go to Desura and download the Demo. Its the same as the main game except with a 2 member squad limit I believe.			"

Early Access Review
								Adventure, survival, RPG, we’ve all seen it before; no matter how many times a game promises that you will forge your own adventure, there seems to be only one effective way to play and one ultimate end where you have max-stats and all the rarest weapons. What if there was a game where you actually had options and could have your own adventure, where there are so many ways of getting through every challenge you face and so many ways to recover from such that in simply travelling from one town to another can end up with you making lasting fun memories and maybe some lasting great enemies?Like that time I was heading though a desert valley, got spotted by wild dogs who started to chase me, I ran as fast as I could and ducked into a shack at the nearby farm. The Dogs were distracted by the cattle which they attacked and brought down. The farmer and his family came out to try and fend off the dogs, I ran out to help but we were overrun as more dogs came. We were all knocked out from our wounds in the battle, I awoke later and did what I could to bandage myself and the dying farmer’s family but it was no use, the dogs came back almost immediately so I retreated to the shack and closed the door. When all was said and done I was the only survivor, I collected what supplies I could and snuck away as cautiously as possible. To this day the farm is a ghost town with an eerie lack of life, shrouded in the memory of that fateful day…Yes this game has bugs, the AI pathing is ludicrous and optimization is questionable, there are many features that are missing and seem to create holes in gameplay but never-the-less in its current state it is still bar none the best roleplay and best adventure game I have ever seen. There’s potential around every bend and every time you close out the game it’s a cliff hanger you just can’t wait to see resolved, if you are looking for an adventure game where the decisions you make don’t just put you closer to an ultimate end but rather shape your character and the world around you alike, then this game is well worth the $20… "

								Saw this game featured in recommendations for several of my favorite games and some i have been following the development of for a while. I decided to give it a shot after reading comments on the atmosphere and music. Once installed i was quickly transported to a world of desperation and brutality. The learning curve is a bit intense, but the freedom granted by getting the gist of the smallest game functions grants enough reward that i think it could appeal to a fairly large portion of the gaming community.  As mentioned in other reviews, there is no story, there is no goal, and there is no point to survival other than those goals that you set for yourself. There is a potentially high true roleplay factor generated by the simple fact that each sect has its own set of rules and laws, You can either conform or reject, you can fight or flee, you can walk a fine line or separate yourself from ""society"" completely. Any play style can reap its own set of rewards and the replayability factor is very high.The negatives seem to all be the typical early access flaws, mainly in fine tuning a few lag issues, some buggy behavior in the town generation every so often (two builds of mine so far produced nothing but destroyed/abandoned towns and farms). There have been a few strange bugs involving theft and whatnot but nothing unmanageable or repeating on reload. If you are a fan of open world games, and NWN style squad based games, Use based skill leveling, base building etc... give this a shot. I don't have any regrets with the current price and am looking forward to being done with this review so i can play some more.			"

								I found this game about 2 years ago, which at the time seemed very promising; glad to say it has more than fullfilled that expectation.Without describing anything much about the game's universe, it basically does what it says on the proverbial tin. As it is now, you've got several scenario's to start with. Each has it's pros and cons, but in the end, no one is gonna take care off you. Starving? Deal with it. Bleeding out? Shouldn't have messed with those 'lowly' hungry bandits, dogs, ... Being eaten by cannibals? Oh yes, the game has those as well. Without divulging too much, this game simply will not hold your hand. It'll provide some tutorials which explain the basics behind some game mechanics, but that is it. How you go about your business, whether it be surviving, building your own outpost, making a name for yourself (Really??!! In this game??!!), ... It's all up to you.Now I know this game won't be for just anyone, but if you do get this game? Stick with it. In the beginning you'll get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked perhaps more than you'd like, your dudes and dudettes can actually die ... Anyways, after a while, the game will grow on you. Once you start figuring things out, sky's the limit, as long as the game allows it, that is.			"

								I have been following Kenshi for around three years now. It has grown from very basic mechanics and framework, to this very ambitious and well deserving piece of RPG interpretation. The sky is limited on what you can do now. However, the creator has been able to utilize a team to help him create the game he wants. Key features include free roaming, base building, character development and many more mechanics that make Kenshi great but also set it apart from the rest of the crowd. It has the environment and finesse that allows you to craft your own story in a very unique and different setting than a traditional RPG. It's easily the embodiment of everything a die-hard RPG fan would want to play. It's probably the Sienfeld of RPG's.			"

								One of the hidden gems of steam, this rare greenlight success story stands as proof that amongs the sea of greenlit garbage, there still exist some quality titles.I would urge anyone who has been scarred by the early-access system not to be afraid. I've owned this game since 2013 back when there were only ~three types of armor with similar graphics and few features of note. It somehow managed to be surprisingly fun then, and it has only gotten better since. The dev('s) put out updates often and the game has undergone fundamental changes since 2013. The squad system, the new worldmap, the new factions, the overhaul of equiptment (eg. the armour I mentioned earlier) - all these things have changed since then and every one of these changes, though I often initially missed the old ways, were for the better.Some will say a sandbox game which has been in early access alpha for two years is neccesarily a lost hope. This game proves otherwise.The game is still a little laggy and may run slow on older rigs, it also occasionally crashes, though the rate of these has fallen drastically since '13.I strongly reccomend this game to anyone interested in a vast, open-world survival RPG where it is the player who creates his/her own story.

								The world of Kenshi is slowly coming to life and what a beautiful, fun and angry world it is. The makers of Kenshi have set their sights higher than I originally expected when I first seen this game a few years ago and I'm just loving every single detail that gets added. Rrecently I've been slaughtering the strange fogmen and getting eaten alive by beak things while looking for a great place to set up my base. Not easy when some of the best spots are filled with things that want you dead.If you like post apocolyptic worlds and samuari style combat wraped around a squad based rpg and crafting system take a closer look. If you also have an imagination some patience to enjoy watching a wonderful game develop download now.It's also a bit like the movie Steel Dawn. Anyone old enough to remember that?			"

								If you liked the challenge of dark souls; the strategy elements of an RTS, and the sandbox open world of minecraft, then this is for you...Though still in  Early Access, This is perhaps one of the best games I have ever played.Cast into a post-apocolyptic  world with no explanation, you quickly find yourself outnumbered and overpowered...by every enemy you encounter.You will quickly realise that you are not privilaged, you don't miraculously have ""1337 5KI11Z"". You earn every bit of what you accomplish; through blood, sweat, and tears.But then, the day that you finally stand up for yourself and beat those bandits, all by yourself, you feel the most overpowering sense of accomplishmentYou will travel mostly aimlessly through the huge desert (And I mean HUGE, it takes ages to get to the other side of the map even on 4x speed), picking up a few followers here and there.Eventually you will build a town, and learn to defend it, as you research more and more technologies, the game completely sucking you in.after several IRL days,(or weeks, depending how often you play),you will eventually find yourself with amazing custom forged weapons and armour, an undefeatable army, and automated mining systems. and your still only halfway through the game....However the game IS still in early gameplay, and as such features a few humerous (and annoying) errors that will leave you grinding your teeth in frustration; but if you are prepared to deal with a little annoyance for a lot of reward, this game is for you.

								DISCLAIMER: I am fairly critical of games and originally had a negative view on this one; I have changed my view after thorough review. The negatives of this game can simply be summed up to technical (early access) issues and the fact that this game type will certainly not appeal to many games.I purchased this game awhile back and, upon starting it up, felt as if I had opened a chunky book on advanced quantum theory and Karl Marx's volumes of his work ""Capital"", and proceeded to read them at the same time. This work of art is an unforgiving delight and I regret none of the hours developing my faction, ""Max's Legion"". In a nutshell, you will accumulate squad members (if you want), level them up, build a base, start fighting bandits, move up to swamp ninjas, maybe venture to cannibal territory, and ultimately cash in the exorbitant bounty on the Bugmaster and his army of Starship Trooperesque spiders. That's just one way to play, as you could easily just by the game's equivalent to a ox and shuffle trade goods back and forth as a merchant, and so on. Of course, the game has limitations like substantive dialogue and ""missions"" being relatively absent, which are constantly being added.So, if the have the time and funds, I would recommend this game; this is especially true as the game is polished into an even shinier diamond over time. Enjoy.			"

Early Access Review
								Where to begin ?I've bought kenshi loving the kind of universe it offers (samurai, desert and post apocalypse, count me in just for the heck of it), and the promises it makes.Even though it still is in beta and is expected not to deliver on all aspects a game this ambitious takes into account, Kenshi does a fantastic job so far.I will go through a somewhat thorough description, so if you want all my pros and cons, just skip ahead to the pros and cons at the end of my review1) It is absolutely gorgeous, all in all, environments and biomes are fantastic to wander in and discover. Also your characters can be created beautiful or ugly, straight or broken, and all the same believable. You can also zoom in or out insanely, pause your game, rotate your camera around at any time, and watching your character paused while delivering a huge knee hit at any view angle, kicking asses and taking names is somewhat exilarating considering how hard the game is whe you begin with the ""rock bottom"" background.2) The game is also very challenging even when you know its mecanics. It doesn't hold your hand, lets you be taken into slavery,  and I discovered to my great demise the hardship of having women squad members in the holy nation territory  . For once (save for the demon souls / dark souls series) a game is truly unforgiving, and at the same time really rewarding. The areas you couldn't get to before because of their inherent hardship hold many secrets and loots, the first one being the discovery of the world itself (yes, it is that beautiful and engaging) , trying to make the history of the world out of the lore, the stories you hear or read, or even a faction name.3) The map (as far as version 0.95.11 goes) is HUMONGOUS, and it is even not half of the final intended map. I can't wait to get my mitts on the next piece of it. Con for a map this size so far is that it feels a bit empty for now, but if you go to the kenshi trello, you can see that there are still many improvements to come, (which I won't cover here, go check it for yourself) and that this game is destined to get fuller and fuller as updates come to be.4) Squad management is rewarding, as well, and you can easily specialize squads in all the different gameplays the game can offer, from brutal combats with consequences to day-to-day hunger, items creation, trading management. The downside is that you also feel sometimes a bit limited in this ""lite strategy game"" mecanic (and as a caesar 3 or AoE 2 fan, I easily want more of it, even though it is not this game's objective) .5) You can create anything, as long as you get your hands on the recipe or blueprint.  So Hell Yeah Edge Type Weapons . Con not all blueprints available, and the artifact system feels sometimes restraining. For now. 'Cuz the map is not yet complete The artifact system : each playthrough you get to have with each new update you decide to play and import a previous play onto lets you have a different experience than the previous one : you get all the same locations, but not all the same items. 6) consequences of your acts are true, and I feel somewhat happy when I break the previous bounty record on one of my characters head  including the Bugmaster's .PROS : - So far so good, it has taken me more than a hundred hours (and many more to come with each upcoming updates)- Total Freedom of action- HUGE map- Many factions- you create your own story- continuous open world- The Squad system and its management- Impressive and complex gameplay mecanics and intense close combat system- A world with consequences (to a certain extent, the world itself is a consequence of a previous catastrophe)- Gorgeous and sexy- You make your own story- many items- there is always a solution to your problem- unforgiving- Early access (it is so complete so far that you still feel you're playing a complete game with free DLCs coming up every now and then)CONS:- Early access (you feel sometimes frustrated with the absence of things yet to come)- The map is so huge it feels sometimes empty (yet to hell with that, it is supposed to be a sarce wasteland and a freaking desert)- You can't truly choose a faction, or become its boss, safe for your own, and opposite faction are not enough of a threat past a certain point.- Still a lack of lore, quests, and multiple Choices story scripts (but I guess in a game this complete, it will come last)- no claustrophobic dungeons with ancient freakin' horrors and freakin' loot inside- No (or not yet) freakin' large army and combat system- there is always a solution to your problem- not enough items considered it is a world with a past rich enough to have robots roaming the wastes- not unforgiving enough past a certain point (at some point every character becomes a bit overkill, can take down complete ennemy squads, and the lack of diplomacy makes the consequences less of a challenge since the factions get so weak)			"

								Excellent game. Even in it's unpolished form, this game has something special that 99% of games lack; a developer who truly cares about their game and the people who play it.Kenshi is very different from any other game I have ever played. I typically think that ""early access"" games are an interesting concept in theory, but close to complete crap in reality. Most just suck; great ideas, but no follow though. Not this one. Constant updates, very clear roadmaps and great mechanics set the bar very, very high.The game focuses heavily on a sandbox feel to it; you are thrown into the world with no advice or clue to whats going on, and have to scrape and fight your way to sucess. It reminds me of a little bit of Xcom's tension level combined with an almost Warhammer RTS feel, as well as survival elements thrown in the mix. It's hard to explain...Watch a Youtube on it! It is pretty difficult to describe.			"

Build a base and get REKT by passing bandits even starving ones, watch those very same bandits get literally torn apart by a sand ninja or pack of dogs.  All the while my people are limping to a safe house to recover.  I enjoy this game just be sure to be saving regularly or you risk being set back either by bugs or getting eaten by cannibals. Also after 4 or 5 bandit attacks your guys stop being a group of pansy ***ches			"

								It's ugly, its buggy, its hard and I doubt it will ever be finished or even completely stable, but boy is it fun!So you start as a guy who can't kill anything. Not even a single dog or cannibal armed with a stick. But that's out of the question anyway since they always roam in packs. The only thing you can do is try to bring the different factions to kill each other off so you can plunder the remains. But even that is difficult since you can't carry much. So you buy your first backpack and coninue to loot. After a whilte you get a 2nd looser to help you carry your stuff and some time later you can afford your first warriors and equip your people with the better stuff you find. At some point you dare to take you first fight and if you win, you have to carry half you party to the next city to heal. But with every fight your people get more hardy since their stats increase while using them. Finally you decide to found an outpost in an fertile valley or on the top of an ore-rich hill and you'll have to defend it against roaming bandits and wild animals. And as your settlement grows and your fighters are shaped into an military elite you get an feeling of acomplishment like no other!A small warning: if you can't stand bugs and broken save-games keep clear of this game.If you like a post-apocalyptic setting with a touch of feudal Japan, an intense survival oriented rpg-stile and complex (but  still very buggy) settlement-building, this game is definately worth a try.

								I tried the demo for this game I got instantly hooked after a few minutes. The game really matches my playstyle and can be fun and annoying at the same time. This would be the first time that I payed for an early access indie game, kudos to the developers, they deserve every penny! Looking forward to future updates and the eventual release build! :)			"

								Went on a solo run with my main character to explore.Found a sweet old armoury with so much loot...heavy♥♥♥♥♥loot.Got greedy and decided to take as much as possible.Crap...encumbrance at 80 percent. Slow♥♥♥♥♥running.This is when the death march back to civilization began.Spiders, spiders everywhere. Took out the first few groups and bandaged up but began to get more and more beat up.Group of 8 spiders got me. Knocked me out and crippled my leg.Didn't die! Woke up but now even walk slower with crippled leg.Crippled leg and crazy amount of loot in inventory. I will not give up any loot. Too greedy. Keep walking at snails pace.Spiders again. Knocked out. Wake up. Spiders again. Knocked out. Wake up. This is my death march.Happens a dozen times and then i realize that i left all my food at the armoury to make room for more loot.So now I'm starting starve to top it off. Still a long way from civilization. Damn spiders. No fabric to make bed to sleep and heal. Starvation issue becoming more dire. So much amazing loot in backpack.No slavers around. No cannibals around. I might be ok. I am a walking living treasure chest for whoever decides to beat me up and steal all my glorious loot.Watch distance to town get smaller, as well as my stomach. Can i make it before i starve or run into slavers?Roll into town about 20 points away from death. Skinny as hell. Eat glorious meatwraps. Sell loot i dont want. Profit from deathmarch? Almost 175 grand. Greed paid off. Would death march all over again. One of my many adventures. Love this game. Support it. Buy it. Damn spiders.			"

Early Access Review
								So, I've only played Kenshi for a few hours so far and I will be honest it's been a strangely lovely experience. I have felt more immersed in this unusual game with graphics that remind me of the original dungeon siege games than Pillars of Eternity or Dragon Age, games designed just for that. I can't tell anyone what the progression will be like but I can tell the little story I've already created in my head from just a few hours has been, which made me laugh out loud and have to retell it to my girlfriend.I begun my adventure in a waypoint, barely able to comprehend the floor system and feeling completely useless and daunted. No one wanted to speak to me, there are very few npc's around who have dialogue except barman, potential companions and traders. I was unsure what to do; there are no quests, only a few tutorials to help guide you. I figured I should buy a water jug and saw another town on the horizon. Why not travel there, explore the lands and see what is offered. Kenshi is huge, you have to use the speed up options to cross these great canyons and deserts. I spent my first day travelling to the closest town I could see, which was actually an abandoned town with no one in it. However there was a copper ore vein, so I mined it. I had a dream of becoming a wandering swordsman, but this felt distant and mining was the first interactable thing I could do, so why not? Maybe I could sell the ore and buy a sword instead of this wooden club? Turns out swords are insanely expensive so maybe not.I tried to run back to the town where I started, but realised I was lost (I have later discovered that if you zoom into the map, more places are visable, duh) and found some bandits instead, waiting on the road. There was at least 20 of them, I was no match I knew it so I gave them 300 gold. Then, I had the option to talk to some of the bandits. Maybe they were friendly bandits now? I spoke to him, he demanded that I gave him 300 gold. Apparently not friendly then, I am a naive surviver of the apocalypse. I declined, as my money was already running short so he attacked me. So I ran. Apparently, that is something I am good at. I quickly out ran them, found another copper vein and mined a little more. I was getting better at mining at least.I explored, ran away from more bandits and mined a little more, selling some ore for food and a sleeping bag. Some hungry bandits chased me but luckily a group of slavers were there to help me out, defeat all the bandits with my assistance. Suddenly I had a t shirt, some terrible bandit gear to sell and things were looking good. The slavers looked preocuppied and I noticed they were picking up the unconscious bandits. I guess they were named slavers for a reason, but they wern't interested in me so I decided to carry on. I bandaged myself up but had a horrible limp but felt victorious and hopeful, I was progressing and had my first set of 'better' items.Eventually, I found the shek capital. In the bar their was a shek girl with broken horns. She asked me what I thought about fighting to the death, and I instantly decided to lie and said that is exactly what I would do and that I would never run when outnumbered. She wanted to join me (for free), and even though I still dreamt of becoming a lone swordsman, at least to begin with I could get the help of this shek women. We trained for a while with some training dummies, I had melee attack skill to 10. I felt ready to take on anyone. We left town and saw a tech trader walking down the road. It's time to test out our new skills, let's attack! At exactly the same time, 10 hungry bandits joined in the fight. The lone trader was armed with a katana and ruined us and all the bandits, leaving us all unconscious. I am not ready to be a lone swordsman yet it seems, but I suddenly wanted to be like him. When we woke, we took everything from the bandits (a cleaver, finally a better weapon), heal up and as it turned out, mine some more.On our way back to the shek capital yet MORE bandits attacked us. Spurred on by the lie I had told my companion, we decided to stand our group, outnumbered 6 to 1. Naturally, we were oblitterated. The same hero slavers who had saved me earlier in the game walked past, spyed us and heroicly destroyed these pesky bandits. Amazing, I love slavers. However, this time, we were the ones picked up. When we recovered enough to walk, we tried to limp away. Nope. The slavers came to us, knocked us both into COMAS and started walking towards the hub. COMAS. They dropped me on the ground, bored of carrying me I guess, just outside the shek city where I lay in a COMA for another 12 hours recovering from a stomach injury. My companion was halfway to the hub now. When I woke up, I picked my shackles, and stumbled into town to heal. In my hurry, I forgot to actually take off the shackles and the guards preceeded to knock me out into ANOTHER coma and put me in a jailcell. My companion was dumped on the road just south of the hub by these lazy, devious slavers who like to steal people and dump them randomly in the desert in comas. When she woke up she ran/limped back to come save me.She was sensible enough to take off her shackles and went to town to resupply when I bravely tried to escape the cell. Which took ages. She then proceeded to sneak to the guardhouse in the dead of night and wait for me to escape. It was 5.50am, almost dawn when I succeded. But how were we to escape? I was wanted by the entire city. But she wasn't. So she picked me up, slung me over her shoulder and ran out of town as an unsuspecting shek citizen. We ran to the nearest hill, shared a sleeping bag taking it in turns to rest up while the other mined (I was getting pretty good at mining). We had escaped, now we just had to avoid large settlements and mine and sell ore. I had a new dream now. No longer did I want to be a lone swordsman. I wanted my own group of companions. I was tired of being attacked by bandits and slavers, left in comas on the floor and then beaten up by alien guards and thrown into jail with my second coma of the day. I decided I would become a bandit myself. Suddenly, I had a plan...Never has a game made me subconsciously narrated such an indepth story in such a short time, especially without barely any dialogue. And thats why, even though I don't know if the game will be good or bad in the long run, it doesnt matter because of those first 4 hours.			"

								Honestly a very good and promising Early Access title. I'll tell you my story so far...It started off with just me and my dog. At the beggining things were tough, I was starving and only had 13 cats (Money) to my name, I've been begging in this little farm community for quite some time now, but the people have stopped just giving me food. I had no other choice, I started mining with the local populace to sell at the nearby market to get some food for myself and my dog. After about 10 days of selling iron ore I bought my first Bison and a bag to go on it's back. Now I started venturing further to the cities around the farm selling minerals to barely scrape by. I saved up some funds and bought some building materials to build my very own shack, nothing amazing and quite small, but it's the first roof i've had for a long time so i'm not complaining. After sleeping the night and eating some dried meat i built a well and a vegetable farm, along with a wheat field. Things were finally looking up.  The only problem now is that it's just me to defend against the local wildlife that pillages my fields of vegetables. Some days I spend the whole day inside just so the animals don't eat me. I can see the farm that I used to live at just across the river, it's quite nice out here when there's nothing trying to kill you. I woke up today and heard someone using my well and the clanging of the rock. Is someone stealing all my things? I walk outside to see my friends from the other farm across the river helping out here, I feel relieved as now I can focus on other things while they do the hard work. TLDR: If you're into a Village Building, Squad Tactis game with some RPG mechanics that's what this game is offering right now, not too much in the way of RPG right now but the games not finished yet. It's mainly just a build your own village right now, but it does a very good job at that. I definitely recommend this game.			"

								This game is great if you have a big imagination.  There is no story, and there never will be.  Quests do not exist, but the developers are working on a job system which will give your characters some short-term direction; these ""non-quests"" will not advance a plot.  The map is large, some complain that it is too large, and there is enough explore.  The game is close to release and they've scrapped about 1/2 of the features that were listed back in 2013-2014 when I added this game to my wishlist.  The current experimental version is 95.14, full release is at 1.0.  I'm not sure what else they will drop before they release the ""final version,"" they have scrapped so much that the developers have stated that they ""may"" release a post final version patch which will add some of the cancelled features; but it seems more like they are eager to put this project behind them.Despite my concerns, I really like this game as it stands.  The premise is this right now: you start out with a character.  The character is weak.  Over time they develop their skills (combat, crafting, labor).  Eventually they're not weak anymore.  You can have up to 30 of these characters.  You can built a base, craft, trade, etc.  Since the game has no goals, the thought behind play ends up being.  It would be cool if I ..., or I want to have the best .... There are several factions scattered throughout the map with their own culture.  On final release you should be allowed to ally, and war with whoever you choose.As with any early access game: only time will tell what makes it into the final version.			"

								I bought this game on a whim when it was still in Beta (I remember when my little baby Kenshi didn't have sound and occasionally the vendors in town could be found a few kilometers away from their shops trying to solo a squad of dust bandits) and after sinking nearly 500 hours into the game I can honestly say Kenshi offers one of the most innovative gaming experiences I have come across. The early stages of the game can be daunting and being that it is still in development it's easy to feel like the game is lacking content. However, the 'open-ended' tag on this game is no joke. As long as you are willing to emerse yourself in the world that Chris and the other developers have worked so hard to create you will find an overwhelming number of possibilities. Personally, I love this game and I hope to see Lo-Fi games receive the attention they deserve.			"

								Started out with one man. Recruited a partner before leaving town. Instantly beaten by bandits and then captured canibals. One man escaped and managed to amke it to the nearest town. I had to watch my original character be carried away. That is until a flock of giant beak things riped apart the entire pack of canibals. My character wakes up from his coma and meets up with his partner only to both be knocked out by the next passing groups of bandits -_-After more time spent i managed to set up a base of operations between two cities and have runners who constantly bring supplies. We have six people and still barely can defend ourselves so we were all forced into slavery by a traders guild. All six of my people -_- I watched as my best warrior bled out while being carried across the desert i managed to escape with all of my characters and hide them until everyone forgot. Now i live cautiously slowly building up my people in preperation to start the biggest slaving industry i can.I love playing this game!!!			"

								Kenshi is An amazing Open-World game! ive been up to date on it sense it began early access, and it has come a long way. I love to start a new game and create my own story, I honestly think ~ with how in-depth this game is ~ that one could write an interesting story from their gameplay. i may not have but 50- hours on this game, but that is due to the fact that my pc can no longer play the game smoothly enough for enjoyment. I hope more graphic options are added in the near future, but it would be more simpler for me to get a new system rather than them redoing their program for users. they have already done so much to make this game as fun and as in-depth as possible. Thumbs up, and Post your own recommendations to let others know of Kenshi!			"

								I love this game so much. Even in it's current pre-release status there is a lot to explore and do.Here are some of the main features of the game:- It's a sandbox game; Apart from the literal sense where most of the map is desert, you are also given a character and let loose into the world to do as you please.- It's challenging; Especially at the start of the game it will difficult as it will feel as if everything is stacked against you. This feeling is actually pretty accurate. Just about everything IS against you. But as you play, you will become more powerful and given enough time, you will eventually be in a position where you will gain the upper hand. Don't expect this to happen overnight though.- You can recruit followers; Most of them are just random nobodies who aren't good at anything. Just like you when you start a fresh game. Certain followers will sometimes have unique dialogue as you travel with them, giving the world a but more colour and the factions some background lore  as they tell you about the areas you visit. This is still a work in progress though.- You can build outposts; Buy a house in one of the cities or build a comletely new outpost from scratch. You can have your followers farm and mine for resources and food, so your outpost can become completely self sufficient.- You will get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked; Yes, you will. But that's okay. Usually after being beaten into a bloody pulp by some angry bandits, one of your unconscious characters will wake up and you can have him heal the others. Consider it a learning experience. You will have time to reflect on what happened as your squad limps back to town. Unless the slavers find you first that is... Or the cannibals... or the giant, blind carnivorous beak things eat you alive...- It's hilarious;The npc in the game will occasionally tell you the most ridiculous stories. The people in kenshi usually have very few sensible things to say. And they lie. And they swear. A lot. There is a lot of very dry humor in this game.** This game is not for everyone!!! **If the above mentioned features sound appealing, I really suggest you try the demo first.Kenshi is a very difficult game, especially at the start. Some people WILL get frustrated and quit and if that's you, then that would be a waste of your money. Defeat is a big part of this game.Also realise that this game is still very much in development. Not all features have been implemented yet and those that have been might be changed or removed. If you want to get an idea of where the game is headed and what features are likely to be added then head over to the official lo-fi forum and have a look at the road map. There are however, frequent updates and stuff gets added, fixed and broken and then fixed again (usually).			"

								-IMPORTANT - > The first thing you should know about this game, is that the Devs care. I first realized this when the updates came not with speed, but with good, quality content. The Devs do not rush updates to make people happy, they are not filled with fluff and pointless things, but instead are filled with bug fixes and content that truly help advance the game state. In fact in a recent news post about an upcoming update the devs said ""•Entirely new world map.  More detailed and polished, new factions, new content, things to explore.  Its' like Kenshi 2.  Crazy.  I should have called it Kenshi 2 and charged for it again, but I didn't.  Damn."" That comment right there just shows you that these devs understand what other Early Access developers do, and that they are not like those other early access developers.Now for how I feel about the actual game. This game takes time to get a lot of enjoyment out of it, but you do get just that. In most starting scenarios you choose from, you are dirt poor, and you are nothing close to a hero. Kenshi is not easy, you'll most likely die quite a few times at the start. As time progressive you gain more members to your squad and your existing members become more experienced. There is a really great feeling that comes when your squad finally becomes strong enough to destroy a group of bandits without any outside help. Eventually you will be able to build an outpost, which if you do not build incorrectly can be quite difficult (and by incorrectly I mean not building a stone mine and building materials producer first thing). Eventually you will be able to build research stations which allow you to learn how to farm and create your own items such as armour and weapons. Even balistas and walls can be build eventually. If you put in the time this game can be vary rewarding, and best of all, a huge update is coming out quite soon, which will greatly improve the game. I 100% recommend giving this game a try, you will not be sorry.			"

It has the cruelty of a souls games yet the potential for total all out war that you would find in a game such as age of empires, or rise of nations. You can develop your faction and co exist with others like you would in civilization or go it alone like a true rpg. Like any other sandbox game you can do what ever you like!

								not a bad game at all.  i didnt even know a game like this was on steam. have some bugs here and there but its very playable. there are some issues with the slave part of the game where its seems like after they knock you down, nobodies moves after making you a slave.....you have to wait sometimes 5- 10 min on max speed for them to move(maybe longer) so im hoping thats a bug they fix. but other then that i got sucked right in to the game. im looking forward to future patch's. i think this game deserves to be more noticed.

								This is my first game review, where to start with kenshi... I have played this game sense early access being force to take breaks due to lack of stability. This game is everything I have always wanted, the roles you can take the openness and freedom you feel durning the game from start till death or Supreme Rule. The depth is perfect, I am always talking and look for more lore on the races and on the old ans new empires, I have played sense .40 or earlier I bought it right around when steam greenlight launched, I am iffy on time frames. I have tried my hardest to sell my friends on this game, few gave it a chance but those that did understand my love for it. I want to thank the developers for their constant patches and updates for this 11/10 game that ill for and always love. Stay alive!			"

								I bought this game a long time ago. Installed it. Played it. Not impressed, buggy as hell, low fps, bah.Tried it again a few weeks ago.Started the game in ""Rock Bottom"" mode, because I liket the idea of starting from scratch. The following happened:Appeared on a barren rocky wasteland wearing rags, with no food, and a stick in my hand. No idea what to do. Found a place called Holy MInes on the map. Went there, hoping for charity from preists or something.No, religious fanatics. Enslaved me after I tried to steal some food. Beaten, worked as a slave, tried to escape, got caugth, brought back to slavery. I repeatedly esacped, and repteadly got beaten and brought back to slavery.Until one time, they just stabbed me in the stomach, and left me to die.I didn't die. I survied, started mining ore and sold them to the Holy Outlaws, hired more people, eanred some money, and now we're travelling the world, and recruiting warriors to rebel agains the HOly Empire. I'm obsessed with vengeance over the Holy Nation. :DThis game is waaaay too much fun, can't stop playing.			"

								Game is very original and addicting. The devs are fantastic and have been routinely updating and hotfixing the game to increase its stability on a very regular basis. If you're into sandbox games with a focus on survival, crafting, squad-based combat, and town/city building, I definitely suggest checking this out.			"

								As it stands, this game too unpolished and has a long way to go until it is running as you would expect. If the developer(s) can deliver what this game sets out to be however, i will probably be spending as much free time as possible playing it as the potential is amazing. Just too many limitations as it stands, for example i spawn in some area and the map shows a town nearby, i go to visit this town and am greeted with a 'beta limitation prevents you from going any further' or something along the way. Head back the way i went to see if can discover another town somewhere and get killed by a boar or something, lol. There seem to be regular updates but at the moment when something gets fixed and several new issues arise. Saying that, if you enjoy Mount & Blade then you should enjoy this as it is a similar sort of game just in a different setting. With all that said this game is a tremendous amount of fun and i for one am willing the developers to get it completed as even with the content thats currently available, once its all working and running as it should then this game would be worth double the asking price.

Early Access Review
								When I first found Kenshi it was but a poorly formed early stage physics game set in the deserted land of God know where, I fought to create my kingdom and would eventually stick around long enough to see my squad grow large, slavers invade the land and cannibals rampage recklessly.Then things got stale, as progress was slow at best, I left for probably a little over a year, checking back here and there to see what's up.Thing's have really changed around here, the landscape is majestic and diverse(v90.X), the engine can still be slow at times but I am also running it on as high quality as the settings allow, which aren't too bad.My story starts in Western hive, I awake with my new found sword, a hefty bounty on my head of 10000 cats and basically nothing to my name, as I spend the early time exploring I quickly come to realize that while I can buy raw meat to cook I can't actually cook it around the hive or they will think I am stealing from them, and let me tell you having the entire hives personal army after you can be a scary sight.Once out of the immersive jungle atmosphere I found a familar sight of mountains followed by long flat sands. I made my way East.  Stumbling upon a large city, which I avoided once I realized the holy knights of whomever didn't like me so much, I turned North, towards a small mining community, there I learned the basics of sneak and thieving before eventually being chased out by the guards.  They didn't have much to offer anyway.Through the crashes as I tried to head into a misty valley I quickly turned back East and made my way to some small farming houses, here I learned the basics of Assassination, spending my time quickly smacking some basic farmers across the head and waiting for them to regain conciousness so I could do it again, it was a good chunk of fun watching my failures turn to *Thunk*s, but the holy paladins would eventually find my shenanigans and chase me out.From here I would venture further North, then East into the mountains, I had stolen just enough food from the farmers to get myself over the mountains.  It wouldn't be long before I would eventually find another mining community, here I truly refined my skills and smacking people over the head, and when I was all done and good I jailed the guards and freed the prisoners, who would for some ungodly reason choose to stand inside their unlocked cells permanently.  Whatever.After my skills in sneaking, thieving, and Assassination where at an all time high (and after battling through some crashes) I found myself back on the road and heading south, I needed food pretty bad, even if I had enough to tide me over for the next day or two.  Heading South in the mountains I ran into a strange man from the Adventurers guild, Paste was his name.  He never saw me, he was unconsious in seconds and before long I was trading my shirt and pants for his ninja garb, leather shirt and hat.  All of course of high grade quality.  I needed not for his weapons and left him to fight his way out wearing the trash I had just discarded.From his dreamland body I made my way up the nearby mountain where I ran into some ninjas, none of which seemed to rule the roost and all seemed quite pleased to simply sleep and smack the training dummies all day.  I joined in on this fun and boosted my otherwise pitiful swordplay to a reputable level.  Before long I tired of their boring game, and made my way back on the road.It was from here that I faced my true challenge, running farther south through the mountains I noticed a tower on the hill, hoping for more fun like the ninjas (but better) I made my way towards it.  As I reached the main gate I realized I had come across the main hideout for the Dust Bandits.  Oh how those buggers had long been a thorn in my side in patches previous.  It was time to see what they were hiding.Inside all but an unobservant sentinel were asleep on their bed mats, even the king of the bandits himself.  From this dangerous ground floor I made my way up and up to the prisoners floor, where I met poor old stupid Cat.  What an idiot, getting himself captured under the false pretense of being a noble.  Annoying to talk to as well.  I knew the king had to  be carying something worthwhile as his bounty nearly tripelled my own, 30k cats.So after talking to the buffoon cat, I waited and ambused one dust boss after another, until all 9 cages and 2 chain spikes had a prisoner attached, and there is poor old cat, unlocked chains and he's lost his mind, unable to leave from the shackles he has spent the past few seasons attached to.Not my problem though, I knock out the king and loot myself a beautiful new shirt, better than the last.  I proceed upstairs so I can unlock a nearby chest, looting all the bandits food supplies + a new small backpack to carry it in.Made off like a bandit in black, just before crashing again.Anyway,TL;DR immersive game, multiple play styles, okay graphics, choppy at times, loading can be annoying, map isn't full sized yet but speaks volumes for what it will be.  Talking to NPC's is sub par, sneaking system very easy to manipulate and break, same with assassination skill.  Thieveing a bit harder to bump up but seemingly good system.Great game if you can work around the current crashes and stability issues, very excited for the vision this game is headed for 7/10 currently, potential for 10/10 in the future.

								The freedom in this game is amazing, you can do everything you want.The combat system is one of the nicest of ever seen, but can be very frustrating at some point.Training of your characters is a long process of grinding teeth and smashing keyboard, as you will be losing nearly every fight you get into, and especially at the start it will force you to alot of screenstaring before you can play again, waiting for your guys to heal up.Every little mistake is punished brutally hard, some early mistakes will haunt you later on in the game, rushing things will get you in trouble, the game is very unforgiving, and at times you even wonder if the game is even any fun at all, as you will get annoyingly frustrated at nearly every aspect of the game.From graphics, to Ai pathfinding, to combat to building, everything has something that will annoy the hell out of you, top this off that the game will put your PC to its limits, since the game is badly optimized.I cannot recommend it in its current state, unless you are able to cope with frustrations well, and have the patience of a dead cat.Still the game is somehow dispite it all, kinda fun and addictive and unique.But it needs stil alot more time to evolve its gameplay, as half of the features are incomplete or even missing, and that what is in, all has issues/bugs to a certain point.The interface is a utter mess, and doesnt handle big number of NPC's, but the game is all about having alot of NPC's working for you, so here it shoots itself in its feet. The Ai is still WIP and will make you cuss and swear hard at times, even make you wonder if they ever will get this right, if that is in a game on this scale even possible.Still yet what they have done in this regard is remarkable, but it does make you wonder if they arent pushing it to far, and that its even possible Ai wise to every get this working perfectly.This is one of those games, that is pushing the bounderies of gaming, giving a unique game that cannot fully be compared to other like-wise games, mostly due its scale and size with absolute freedom.And its logical this comes with a price, and the price is a very... extreme long development time, so i play the game now and then, to a point where you really notice its pretty much WIP and trying to play it further just makes you hate the game too much.And still.... if you can deal with this all.. its one of the most original hardcore brutally hard games out there, with topics most other games dont even dare to touch, slavery, extemetism, narcotics, crime and even cannibalism and opression, its all there.And some factions will put your moral compass to the test, and uther loathing them for what they stand for.I never had such feelings in any other game for virtual factions, but in this game, i really have a deep hatred for some of the factions views and laws...This is a game that you want to see completed, but you prolly have to wait a very long time before its done.Very fitting for this game, as the gameplay is nearly as slow as its development.I recommend this game only to those who can deal with the game, its certainly not a mainstream game.IF you cannot deal with bugs, unpolished gameplay, long development time, and frustratingly hard gameplay, with every odd stacked against you, you will not like the game at all..

Early Access Review
								This game is absolutely great for generating your own personal stories. Better so than most games of its ilk. It starts off at a grindingly slow pace, but once it gets going you'll have developed a deeply personal attachment to your first four or five guys in your party. Let me tell you one that I am very glad I experienced.Roud, A weak, hot headed man half starved and an injured arm has just barely escaped with his life from his sacked hamlet. The lone surviver and least respected of his people, is now thrusted into an unforgiving world with nothing but a pair of torn pants and a lead pipe. On his first week he attacks a small group of starving bandits, quickly learning just how easily outmatched he is by even the most ill equipped of raiders. He only survives thanks to wandering band of merchants who tended to his wounds while he was passed out. Thankful for his saviors, he decides to follow them. The merchants tolerate him, despite his almost complete uselessness. Roud acted as one of their bodyguards, slowly building up his strength and being able to suffer a few hits from a rusty sabre. Always reassured in the knowledge that should be begin to fail, the other bodyguards would be willing to lend a hand. He had his share of the loot since the merchants didn't take any interest on what the bandits where carrying, only focusing on running goods from town to town. This didn't last long for Roud however, for after two weeks they encounterd a large, organized group of bandits.He fought hard as did his allies, even managing to down bandit or two on his own, but merchants steadily began dropping one by one, followed by the guards. The main culprit? The bandit leader, adorned in heavy armor and sword far larger and more thick than any man should be able to wield effectively. eventually Roud met the end of the hulking nightmare of a man and was struck down.Miraculously, he woke up to a pile of eviscerated corpses and nothing but a minor cuts on himself. He had merely passed out from bloodloss, a massive relief to him. Even more miraculously he found the corpses five bandits including their leader, the very one who had slaughtered guards and merchants alike with ease. A band of Samurai can be seen from the distance, no doubt the perpetrators of such an act. Roud ignored the small fry and immediately pilfered the massive man's body, adorning his armor and plucking his sword from his cold hands, only stopping to grab a helmet from the one of the other dead bandits. His face now hidden behind a metal mask, his torso protected by iron platemail, and massive sword so heavy he must drag it along the sand, he heads west towards the nearest town, the one he had left only a few days ago following the merchants. After such a defeat, only one thing rested on his mind: ""I must become the strongest fighter in the sands"". He exhausted, he's injured, he's carrying valuable loot, and more importantly he's alone. When he arrives in town, the first thing he does is rent a bed and collapse.When he awakes, his mouth is dry. He heads to the local pub and trades all but his most valuable loot to the barkeep in exchange for a decent sum of cash and a stiff drink. Out corner of his eye, an absolutely gigantic dark skinned man stands in the corner of the bar with his arms folded. In dire need of an extra sword, he saunters over to the giant and drops a sack of coins in front of the man. ""Five hundred catts straight up if you join me"" The dark skinned man only nods and steps forward, only uttering what can be presumed to be his name ""De-Zerka"" The two left town that evening to wander the desert. They had very few victories, but each fight left them stronger, more experienced, and more dangerous. The two became close friends, and eventually made it to the point they could cleave through half a gang of bandits before going unconscious. This was a blessing, as they proved too risky to risk staying in the same viscinity, unconscious or not; not to mention having to tend to the wounded, if not outright abandoning them.Eventually, the two realized the necesity for a third sword, more importantly one who can sow and bandage wounds. The next town they greeted a friendly, short and nimble woman, ""Tuner"". When asked if she knew her way with a medkit, she nodded and hired her on the spot. She proved skillful with a katana, and very effective at not getting hit.The three travelled for a long while, long enough to be feared by many wandering parties across the desert. Even the Holy Nation, very organized, and heavily armored knights with fanatical beliefs, felt threatened by them, though their patrols only served as fodder for the party's quest for becoming the best fighters in the land. Along the way even allowing a Fourth member, ""Hanbu"", an man of average size, stout legs, and a firm back. He served mainly as the pack mule, carrying a large backpack for most of their loot to be stored. Even he became a formidable foe to fight against.By now, Roud had become a very skilled in his own right. His own hot headedness made him very aggressive, often charging straight into the enemy and going berserk. Not even a broken arm, cracked skull, and a knife in his gullet could stop his rampage. De-Zerka as well, wielding the looted armor from Holy Nation and weapon more reminiscent of a long, metal paddle than a sword, becoming renown for destroying a man's skull in one swing. Tuner kept mostly to the sidelines, choosing to pick off the bandits from the flanks rather than risk charging headfirst into danger. She was easily the fragile of the group, but most effective at dealing with the small fry.But this party would soon meet it's untimely end, their quest cut short.On their usual run between towns they  see a strange sight ahead. A gigantic mob swarming around the settlement. Upon further observation they realized it was cannibals. They would always travel in large groups, but never have they seen one as large as this. Their numbers were so many that their howls and cheers could be heard from miles away. At least 5 or 6 hundred of them. Not willing to travel to another town and feeling heroic, the party decides to attack the mob head on.The Cannibals came pouring from the gates, some of them carrying the unconscious residents with them and easily surrounded the party. Roud, whipped into a fury, charges deep into the mob, cutting down cannibal left and right while De-zerka, Tuner, and Hanbu instead of following him, stayed behind, choosing to cover their backs and fight defensively. Roud fought valiantly, but each hit the cannibals were able to connect with him wore him down. Slowly, but surely. All around him lie corpses, yet the chanting, screaming mass of ugly, tatooed abominations surrounding him were unfased. He had made a significant dent in their numbers, but there were still far too many to be considered done.A cry rings out, Hanbu had been struck dead. Tuner panics and runs through the thinnest part of the crowd, fleeing for her life as ten or fifteen cannibals give chase. Roud, distracted and dishearted, takes a blow to the head. He staggers, his vision blury, and he swings his massive sword into the crowd. Another blow, this to his arm: it dangles by his side, effectively usless in the situation. He continues to swing his sword, furious at his sloppyness, the death of one of his comrades, and the betrayal of another. No matter how many cannibals he slaughters it seems like no use as they wittle him down to the point where he can barely stand. He sees passed the crowd one of the tribal monstrosities carrying De-Zerka over his shoulder.... This was it... this is his last battle and it only took him until now to figure it out. He can barely muster enough strength to swing his sword one last time before a pipe to his head fells himBy the way the last bit was in no way an exaggeration, the game bugged and accidentally spawned a gazillion of cannibals. Good game			"

								This game is early access, like super early access. It's got bugs, and issues, and crashes from time to time. But its got potential, and already has many working features. But I love the game to bits already. Options are numerous is very custimizable, varied starting choices, even got mods!Some people fear that this game will never be finished; that it's just a cash grab, well they're wrong. The developer has monthly updates with what they're working on, what new features, races, etc are being planned.It's a giant endeavor, and the one single developer and a couple of hires are working as hard as possible to make updates live, but its slow work yes.If you're looking for a complete game, get the ♥♥♥♥ out now. But if you're looking for that something that fun that could consume hours upon hours of your time, this is it.You're looking for that 100% open world game, this is it.You're looking for something to hope for, to once more confirm the belief that a game in early access can become great? This is it right here.They even got a demo if you're unsure about buying the game yet!It'll be a slow process, but I am 100% behind this game and the developer(s)!More information at http://lofigames.com/ "

Early Access Review
Imagine if Mad Max was made by Akira Kurosawa.A desert world, bleak, hostile, vast.  Sparsely populated by junk towns and populated by newborn cultures based on old black & white samurai films, with a touch of the spaghetti westerns born thereof thrown in for good measure.  Men and women in coolie hats with katanas fighting against groups of bandits and crazed cannibals, trying to build secure outposts of safety in a violent and chaotic world.This was the game that advertised back when I bought into it.  This was the game that was promised.  Does this sound like a great idea for a game?  Does this sound like a game that you would want to play?  Well tough crap, suckers, because all that is going bye-bye!Welcome to a fantasy world filled with lush jungles, mysterious forrests, dangerous wolf packs, and strange races - bone men, bug men, and robots.  Oh joy, robots!  And giant monster things!  That's just what every samurai adventure needs, right?  That vast wasteland that took hours to cross is now a map ten times larger!  Why?  Because we can.  Not that you'll ever get any use out of that, but so what?  This game is no longer about wandering ronin traversing the desert in search of adventure.  It is now the living avatar of feature creep, fueled by what seems like some kind of unending mescaline binge and slowly morphing into new game entirely... a game that's only common denominator with the original is that there are swords.And all this has been while continuing to fail at fixing bugs that are literally as old as the game itself.  Constant crashes, dysfunctional pathfinding, and broken tools thrown around like a gas explosion in a mechanic's garage.  Rather than fix the game they already had they instead decided to turn it into a RTS version of Morrowind, only weirder, if you can imagine such a thing.Now maybe that is a game that you'd be interested in and I won't begrudge someone for liking that, but personally I don't care for the bait and switch.  I certainly do not appreciate the constant adding of more crap that I don't recall anyone asking for while everything that came before it is still horribly broken.I saw an idea, a great idea, for a game that I would like to play.  I paid for that game.  Today I see a completely different game being made, one that I simply have no interest in, while the one I bought was never finished - and never will be.So if you're looking for a high-fantasy, RTS version of your favorite magical wonderland, go right ahead and get Kenshi.  If you're looking for the post-apocalypse desert wandering ronin adventure originally advertised on the box then you're out of luck - keep looking, maybe someday, someone will make that game for real.Final note: Posting this as a review since I was being banned from forum for saying the same things.

								The game is exactly what you would expect from it, the pictures give out alot about the game. though the game has been in development for over 8 years now, its recent sucess as a green-lit steam game has enabled the team to grow ( 6 now), the game is pushing beta soon as many great features are being implimented. This game is aleady inovative and fun, a no loss investment with a great dev team that still hold onto their dreams for kenshi. Lo-Fi games could be standard barrers for what indie devs should be, but thier future as devs is still something to be seen, hopefully the team continues to grow and we could see even better, larger scope games from them.In short, defo worth the price and a safe investment for an early access.

								A game you can play your way, from wandering the world doing good or evil to making a village and expanding it to a town or a fort. Set up trade with other CPU towns and defend your self from the raiders and bandits that roam the land.This game is not finnished but its more playable than most other EA games and has a somewhat realistic feel, combat will result in damage to body parts, bleeding, broken limbs, coma's and even death, but fear not your villagers can not only heal each other buy carry them to bed to heal faster.well worth the asking price, rarely crashes but the combat can be a lil difficult early game due to poorly trained warriors.

								Kenshi is a RPG-RTS featuring a slow progression and massive learning curve. It's core features, being RTS battles and Dwarf Fortress-like base building, are made more complex with every patch. Though, it does lack somethings, for instance: The beginning starts you out fairly weak, even the beginnings geared towards making you more combat ready only leave you with a powerful weapon against an army of more experienced bandits.The difficulty fluctuated heavily a few hours in though. Even after amassing an army, you still aren't strong enough to take on a single bandit party. However, when you reach a point, and you've leeched a few kills off of guards with your squad of cowards, you're able to leave the game running with no fear of attack -- or agency. I'd automated an entire camp. Random events and the like, a feature of base-building games that it emulates, would and have been a boon. This game could easily be the greatest game I ever play -- the potential is there. I need that 3D dwarf fortress.			"

								A very well done game. Kenshi provides the player next to nothing and tells them to make something out of a harsh enviroment full of dire wolves, maruders, and cannibals. The hurde is very high for getting top quality gear and experienced people to use it, granted they arn't mauled or killed in the process. But after that, you run out of things to do. Point being, the journey to the top is fun and challenging, but the end game is boring.			"

								The Game:Kenshi is a game that can't be catagorized. It's a beautiful, sword-punk blend of RPG, RTS, and to some extent a city builder/Sims-style survival game where you cater to basic needs. The demo does the game little justice, and many people who rate it poorly probably never experienced the transition of this game into what it is now. The developers are committed to creating a living world, and tailors an RPG-style game where you are no hero. Even if you choose a start that makes you top dog when it comes to the scum of Kenshi, you bite the bullet. Pros: -Multiple ways/""genres"" to play.-Multiple settings for adjusting the difficulty, for better or worse.-Beautiful world, at least for an independently developed game. -Creature/racial artwork and variety is unique, and funnily deceiving (cute goats that can massacre a small squad).-Dedicated development team, which has proven itself over the long-term.-Lots of replayability, and even punishing starts can have a silver lining.-Combat can be sometimes frustrating, but always beautiful to watch, with drastic outcomes based on even the smallest decisions.-Character customization can be oddly entertaining, and...-Mechanics can be easily caught onto, and easier to work around with a little time and effort.Cons:-Bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. It was much worse at the initial release of the Beta, but within a week or so the most game breaking were patched. -The Dev team actively makes use of bug reports, even catering to some very specific issues players faced in the past.-World can be laggy, even on a good computer. This is, however, on high graphics and almost exclusive to high density bandit zones or rendering of the map.-Updates may feel slow, but minor ones with huge impacts are frequent.-Game can crash due to random errors introduced with an update (commencing specific research, as an example when the game entered beta), but these are once again usually patched within a day or few.-Can be painfully punishing, and some mechanics are unrefined, but bear in mind many mechanics are fresh to the beta and much of it is an EXPERIMENTAL build.Kenshi isn't everyone's cup of... well, dust and rust. Despite this, its flexibility, originality, and progression through the years has proven it a capable contender and worth the attention.			"

								Probably the most effective genre-busting game in its' time. It's real, -real- post-apocalyptic game that doesn't teach you anything easily and lets you figure the game out as you go, and if you're an idiot, you'll be killed. Be a smart survivor - Realize that people are absolutely insane who live in the wastelands and will likely rob you, or at the very worst, outright eat you limb by limb. - And those in the cities treat you as far as your money can throw you. . Passed that, they will let you die from starvation, don't care if you bleed out in the streets and die, may rob you - or they might  join you in your cause. . as long as you have the money to sway them. You can be anything from a Adept Scavenger quick on their toes and trade goods for great profit between towns, to a bandit crew who massacres a farmers village for their base and all of the goods within  - whom you can trade to a fence inside a town while in a disguise as to not alert Bounty Hunters or the guards of the nation whom you've killed their subjects, to a group of settlers trying to eek out an existence amidst the wasteland and start from a lowly village to a legendary town with an abundance of food and technology new to the post-apocalyptic world. You may learn of hidden locations, if you're lucky, and encounter a plethora of characters. . Though not all are friendly.You may be lucky and find a wandering traveler in which you can sell your goods, as well as purchase blue prints to upgrade your skill set or your very own Factional town - Of course you could just murder them and take all their goods, though you may incur a bounty that will cause you to be hunted by lawgiving police. - You could either turn yourself in and face a smaller stint in jail and/or be forced to slave away in the mines, OR you could become an infamous raider whose tales of dread are recognizable to everyone in the province. Of course,  you could always be successful noble and create your own Faction city in which all nations depend on for their trade and have the most legendary army that no one would dare question your authority. -- Or, if you were to be really ambitious, you could become an abolisher of slavery and take over the province as the rightful sire of the lands - if you're ready for hardship, effort, death, surprises, and ultimate victory.

								I remember stumbling across this game's website years ago, very early when it was a mere concept with a couple of screenshots. I didnt really understand it and there was no release or anything, but I liked the name and it had ninjas and open world rpg elements. I bookmarked the page and forgot about it until I found it on Steam when it first released as early-access. Bought it and it turned out to be what I expected from my first encounter. Different, with a learning curve, but extremely unique and tons of fun. Some of the coolest combat and health systems in any game ive played. Its early in it's stages but it is tons of fun with lots to do. The devs are active and fixing the game, and when there arent any game updates, they update us with progress and their plans for the future. buy this game			"

								I love this game, it combines the best aspects of an RTS base building game and an RPG, it has its fair share of bugs as an EA game. But nevertheless its a very good game. As of Beta this game is finally showing its true colors. They fixed most of the bugs that plagued the game and have implemented a huge new map as well as new races, and tons of new features, all around 80% polished and thank god its now pretty much crash free, after around 10 hours of gameplay only experienced one crash after dismantling a building with people in it. Everything else is pure perfection! Cant wait until they unlock the rest of the map, only about a 6th is playable right now and its still around 3-4 times bigger than the old map, its exciting and even more so since its now playable performance wise. If you where thinking about getting the game, get it now!			"

								(This review was created on March 3rd, 2014. It may become obsolete sooner or later.)This game has potential. It really does. It's a sandbox in a steampunk neo-feudal Japan-esque setting. The dev has not clarified what's going on and probably won't tell us for a very long time. I bought this before it was released on Steam, and I have to say: It has grown. It has trading, city building, realistic warfare, a complex medic system, and a whole lot of other things. There is one major issue that has been plaguing the alpha: a good portion of the game progression right now is attracting bandits and luring them to town guards. Once you have accumalated enough ""Cats"" you can try your hand at founding a faction, building an army, then start a town. Recent updates have added more difficulty to maintaining your humble abode. Raiders will come knocking and try to extort money off of you and cannibals will invade and attempt to take you and your men to their kitchen. You can research new technology with a certain workbench, but I won't bother saying much since I have yet to experiment with it.So. Do I recommend this game? Sure, but not in it's current alpha state. If you want to invest in a gaem that has a bright future, go ahead and buy it. Just remember that it's alpha.			"

								How to describe, hmm... Be a druglord, by making your own drugs, then selling it (duh), make your clan grow with some authentic human trafficking, just put them in a cage and add some brainwash. Or, be a bootlegger, a thief, a bountyhunter and a murderer. Start your own settlement and create an army or looting ninjas. And if you are offended by all of that   then no worries! You can still buy the game because you can be a honest Holyfarmer! Baking bread and selling veggies, help out hobos by giving them a chance of a better life. Love and devotion, brother. Also note that the game is pretty racist, Holynation doesn't like female and tinted charactes, but who does, right? (Disclaimer: calm your horses, its a joke). You thought Madmax and Fallout was a themebased wasteland game? Meet Kenshi.In short, explore, build a town, make money, research, explore, vape and explore some more.			"

								This game is just simply amazing !!! even at this super early stage in alpha it is a great game alone but with all these new updates with new settings weapons, factions, and animals its going to be amazing also i am one to research a game lots before i buy it and the Kenshi developement team has made great strides in developement and i salute them for thatthis game is a realistic rpg squad based free roam where you are not the almighty hero you have to actually train and work at your characters stats for them to fight others well.and if you want a fight you can usually find one by either going to a certain area or creating your own base(which are super in depth awesome and can be customized pretty much however you want)once you create a base bandits will attack you and sometimes try to broker with you and will offer a deal you either pay them or they attack.this game is just awesome every pet peave you have about other games before is fixed in this game pretty much and also one of the greatest things you can do is to leave your people on permanent jobs so you can go to sleep for 24 hours and they couldve made like 100000 loaves of bread and created the entire fort you layed out for them to buildalso there are some bugs but most can be solved by simple reloading or restarting the game.i would give this game 99.99 out of 100 stars just simply for the minimal bugs in the game			"

								Okay where to start, While I am giving this a positive review let us take that at face value. I feel as if the game is good and is going to be great when finished but if judge the game by what it should be then we often give false review's. I see the game as fun to play as new content is added each time I find myself playing more and more. Now what I do see is a huge amount of bugs while they can be overlooked they are an annoyance that can all but bring me to not want to play for at least week, now I will cite an example of my own experiance, I was playing the game when two of my men were caught stealing the guards took them but didn't lock them up instead they just carried them and went to a guard position and just stood there holding my two men even after there time was up the two guards would not put them down I tried everything restarting the game, reseting squad positions, and even attaking the guards but it was to no avail, its little stuff like that what I cited that can make the game feel almost unplayable once glitch caused me to lose two of my best men in one run. I also question why would they put us in the most racist part of the map, almost making it impossible to play as the shek as new person to kenshi? Looking over it, I would rather have a more polished experiance with less content then a buggy large amound of content, overall though I can't talk bad about the gameplay though, its fun and addictive, building your own settlment or industry maybe even a small army, the choices make the game unique. I give the game in a conclusion a 7/10 a standard score which if the game is improved upon could easily be an 8 to 9 out of 10. "

								Do I recommend this game, Yes. But not for everyone.This game has the potential to be Frak'in amazing.  I've been following the game for a year or two, and their have been patches and addition that come relitively frequently.  Personally, I was hoping for the game to develope faster, but their are quite a few things that they are putting together, and the interactions between each Start location/faction/character skill/base construction/tech advance/and so on...  is a very complicated to balance and intagrate.The're quite a few bugs still in the system, like pathing issues, caravan guard ""visits"", building inaccesabilities and such, but they are slowing fixing bits and pieces. In recent patches, you have been allowed to assign tasks to your ""villigers"" and they would run arround and complete that task with no further intervention on you behalf; Which was an awesome upgrade from before.Remember before you continue to read this that the game is still alpha.But, to sum up some of the issues that are negitive. you have about 5 primary stats, and currently have access to 3 of them, of which one was only recently added (Toughness).  their are about 6 or 7 weapon skills, of which you currently have access to only 4 of them, and unarmed is not one of them. their are about 20 or so skills, like armor smithing, weapon smithing offence, defence, medic, labourer, engineer, science, and a couple of others. You have access to all of these skills but their are about half that you don't have access to. Again this game is still in Aplha!The awesome thing is that what is planned is things like, renting a building in a City to use a as a store front. Being able to replace severed limbs with robotic ones. Building cities, creating trade routes, starting you own faction (possably even your own empire) and so on.I'd like to recommend this game to everyone, but some people will not be able to enjoy it becuase its not completed, yet.I would advise to those people to add it to their wish list and follow the updates as they come out.To those of you who don't mind a game that is in the works, and can play though and help identify bugs, strap on a sword and come adventuring/build a city/trade with npc's/scavenge the unconsious bodies of the fallen/ or just plain become the scourge of the wastes, this game's for you.

								Takes about 1-3 hours to get a grip on what's going on in the game and how to do anything. Once you grasp it, though, it's one of the most thoughtful and creative games you can experience. Lots of tiny details make it that much more realitic and thrilling to play. Plus, the aesthetic of the game is mad wicked. It's like steampunk without the autism. Many different ways you can play the game, many different paths to take, many different variations on how you do things. Overall best game I have played in a long while, a very good break from the monotony of today's gaming industry.It's relatively new, so there's a few glitches and bugs. It only really gets annoying if you have a big automated base and your farmers keep getting stuck under the stairs for no reason.However, this game is definitely worth it. It's worth a lot more than $20, I can't wait to see how they improve it. I'd recommend anyone to buy this (I already bought a copy for my friend).			"

								Yes!!!!!its an alpha but for an alpha their is a but load of stuff you can do. Hire people to join your squad and custumize and rename them. Build new towns, trade with people, fight other factions, create your own faction, and run around the big♥♥♥♥♥sandy dunes of kenshi.			"

								It's a pretty good game and worth keeping an eye on. Most glitches can be resolved by saving and loading the save which takes maybe ten seconds. It has a long way to go before it becomes worth more than twenty dollars, but for now that's a fair and economical price for the promises being made and the content we're getting. Keep in mind that this is an alpha. It is not smooth, it is not spitshined and polished, and it is not complete. Do not cast any final judgements until you're looking at a final product. For now, keep an eye on this game. It's shaping up to be uber fun.			"

								Train! Gather! Build! Get beat up! Do it over again! This game is so much fun, it's scary. It's slow paced, but the feeling of reward is fantastic. Never before have I cheered for a character of mine so much. No other game gives you the feeling of watching the process of training from end to end, and you'll get a big smile on your face the first time your character takes down a dust bandit on their own. Fantastic game, 11/10 will play again. Oh, and you can build your own city.			"

								This has to be on of the most promising of all the Alpha games I've played. Though very buggy, (It's kind of expected in the state it's in now) it offers a wide varitey of things to do. It's updates are frequent, the owner is trying very hard, and it's gameplay is really enjoyable. If you ever find this game on sale, you should definatly buy it!			"

								A very fun sandbox Rpg thing. I can't really describe what type of game it is because of how unique it is, but that doesn't make it any less good. It is still in early alpha, but through the time I bought and played it the game has grown at an astounding rate. Would highly recommend this game, but i would still say to wait until the game is finished.			"

								When it is completed, eventually, the realized vision of this game will be truly incredible. However, as early access goes, this will take a while to be completed. Currently, most of the game developement is features implementation, because the groundwork has only been laid recently, but after six years of developement I seriously expect a finished product you can be proud to have supported. Very soon, enough features will have been implemented for the final phases of developement to begin, but make no mistake, this game will be finished one way or another, and as most of the features are being added now, now might be the time to get with the program and take an interest in the project.

								Purchased this game back in April of 2013, played it for around 8-10 hours, then put it on the back burner. Came back a little over a week ago, and have since put 50 hours in. This game has improved so much its crazy, I love it too much.Start with the drawbacks-- Pretty buggy, but there is usually a work around that is a little inconveniant but fixes the issue for a while. - Pathfinding is hilariously bad- pretty hard if you dont know what your doing- no real intro to the game or what to doHere are the reasons i stick around - + Completely open ended, this is a hugeeeeee turn on for me (Could be a negative if you need set goals, as there are none)+ Love the building crafting system+You are free to have a squad of just you, or a squad of loads of people (more than 10 needs some mod help (but you can have 30 in vanilla, just split in 3 squads))+ Learned curve is satisfying, not too steep, but its there. + Loads to explore, and a ever present sense of danger+ Getting a charactor OP in stealth is pretty fun/funnyStuff Im not really into / Dont know much about - | I dont do combat much, i am mostly just a trader with a walled off town, i fight pests, not people| Cant say much about the experiance with other races, as i play soley human, because i like the protection of the holy nationTo be honest, the bugs in this game drive me up the wall, and make me clench my fists in rage sometimes. They can get frustrating, and the lack of fps is annoy af, but i keep coming back, every time i rage quit due to a bug, or a bad battle, i always come back, i have had dreams about this game for chistsakes.

								How to describe, hmm... Be a druglord, by making your own drugs, then selling it (duh), make your clan grow with some authentic human trafficking, just put them in a cage and add some brainwash. Or, be a bootlegger, a thief, a bountyhunter and a murderer. Start your own settlement and create an army or looting ninjas. And if you are offended by all of that   then no worries! You can still buy the game because you can be a honest Holyfarmer! Baking bread and selling veggies, help out hobos by giving them a chance of a better life. Love and devotion, brother. Also note that the game is pretty racist, Holynation doesn't like female and tinted charactes, but who does, right? (Disclaimer: calm your horses, its a joke). You thought Madmax and Fallout was a themebased wasteland game? Meet Kenshi.In short, explore, build a town, make money, research, explore, vape and explore some more.			"

								I have been following this games since months, finally I made that hard decision of taking a risk of buying an Early Access game (I just Hate Early access games).However, I found that this was really worth the investment. Kenshi is a genre in itself. You are thrown with a single player (or a group depending upon your choice of gameplay at startup), to live in a harsh world. Now it is upto you as to how you play and what your objectives are. You can buy backpacks  and bulls and be a trader, or you can create industries and be an industrialist. You may choose to become a fighter and hire and train other fighters, to create a fighting squad and boast your power upon the world, or you might want to be an ordinary man (or women) trying to survive and live in this world. On the downside, the game is an unfinished product and has performance issues (The devs have promised to improve performance significantly in coming days), and bugs. But it is still very playable and appears like a Beta version, though it is listed as alpha.			"

								Do you remember the good old days with D&D and using your imagination and how invested you were in your characters? How you died early in the beginning over and over again in anguish? How you kept coming back to this painful experience because you were hooked?... That's Kenshi minus the magic and in a total new world with new races, new Lore and mystery. And yes very very painful in the beginning. As you can see I have put over 300 hours in this game and only scratched the surface of this game.By the way it is in Beta not Alpha and it is much more stable. The world is huge and only 1/3 of the world is open at the moment. If you have the patience with bugs and can contribute to the development, this game is well worth it!  Don't expect hand holding or that you start off  as the chosen  one... But just like the good old days, you can slowly and painfully be pleasantly surprised how strong you can become.			"

Early Access Review
								A Squad-Based Sandbox RPG, where you can become and do (almost) anything you want.So I became a rotting carcass after my first encounter with a group of Dust Bandits. 10/10!I purchased this game a long time ago in early-alpha state with nothing more than a desert map trying to survive in my own created settlement. I set up a small trading caravan and travelled across the desert to purchase and sell good for the highest profit. I really enjoyed it but stopped playing for some reason I can't recall.Recently rediscovered the game and came back to a brand new world. Some amazing new features have been added, like a completely new map, new species (love the Shek and Hiver Races!), new skills, new researchh tree. Really Enjoyed it once more!For people who don't know if they should buy it, just do it. It takes a bit of time and practice to get used to the game, but once you do you're hooked!			"

								I really like this game, I'm not entirely sure why I do.  It could be the brutal difficulty, or the fact you can play about five different ways, and it feels like radicaly different games in doing so.1) Base building and trading2) Mercenary and Bandit hunting3) An RPG with a small well monitored team4) Grand stratagy with dozens or more soilders (I once had 256 at one time, all outfitted differently).5) All of the above at the same time.The game is a massive time sink, and I often find myself starting it up and playing it whenever I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for, or if it has updated recently.  It is a game where time goes to die, and you will find yourself at a loss of what happened to the last 12 hours of your life.  Overall, I recommend it to anyone who likes micro-management games with lots of little details to go over and make sure are working.Some downsides are, the graphics aren't the best, and there are some clip issues, and the base building could be a lot more natural, but I think even with those falls it works as a game.  But like I said, no idea why I like it as much as I do, just if you aren't sure about it, and you like micro-management stuff, well, give it a try!  If you don't like managing inventories and resource management, and always needing just a little more cash, not for you.			"

								First experience of the game: Cool - I started near a farm and I see other people. I'll go talk to them and see if I can get a quest. Wait why is he shouting at me about being a heretic. Oh I'm unconcious on the floor. Wait. Wait some more. That's better I'm standing up again. Oh look doggies. Wait what? I'm dead! One more restart and then I'm giving up on this...Cool I started near a different farm, in the desert. Oh look there's a massive fight between people and animals in the distance I'll go look. Arrive in time to loot corpses. Yay I have a few animal skins an some better trousers. Now I'll go sell these. Wait why I am being attacked by the villagers? Yay I got a hit in! Oh I'm dead. Just one more restart then I'm giving up on this...Cool I started near some weird insect people... (insert stuff). Wait I'm dead. Just one more restart...Cannibals? Interesting I bet they have some loot... Wait I'm (you guessed it) dead. Just one more restart...I was honestly ready to give up on this game after my first character died before I even really knew what was happening. But then the game really grew on me. When you start as just a normal person (or people if you choose some of the start options) there's a real sense of achievement when you make it! But make no mistake, this game is unforgiving at the start (which btw I think is brilliant) - if you get frustrated by losing your progress because you're outclassed and didn't run away fast enough (or sometimes even if you did) then this might not be a game for you25 hours in and I'm on probably my 7th or 8th restart but this time I managed to survive long enough to mine some stone, build a house, some walls and grow wheat. I'm now a bread baron, hauling 50 loaves a week to the local city and managed to hire a couple of extra pairs of hands. I feel like I've hit big time. Until I look at someone the wrong way and get killed I guess :)Really enjoying this game, despite my early fears that I might not. It feels like a dynamic world where you can build what you want and interactions with NPCs feel pretty believable, especially for an early access game. Yes it's quite hard. But as that's really the point, and by being hard you really do feel you've achieved something. And it's the sort of game where (like real life) from a random sequence of events you just sort of fall into doing something you'd have never planned and it turns out to be fun (I certainly didn't expect my best success so far to be as a baker running the gauntlet between cannibals and wild dogs to get my bread to market every week!)I look forward to expanding my bakery whilst seeing off hordes of hungry bandits for many hours to come (I've just installed some crossbow turrets to help with that). Until I overlook some small detail and die.ProsNo handholding / tutorial. Like real life!Engaging universe and NPC interactionsNo set direction - you canfight, trade, build in whatever combination you enjoyGraphics look niceConsDifficult - don't spend too long customising you character at the start - they probably won't make it!Some graphical issues which I expect will get ironed out before releaseDefinitely recommend this game if you enjoy a challenging start.10/10 would die again (probably several times)			"

								I can easily recommend this game to anyone who likes sandox games ( kinda Mount and Blade style.. more or less). Once you get a hang of it, its pretty addictive. You will most likely invest more play time into just getting your character and a few recruits strong enough to finally feel comfortable enough to build your own base, than the entrie game time you spend on many AAA games. Hell, Im 23hrs in and still hold up at a bought farm house training my character and stealing♥♥♥♥♥♥from cities at night.So yeah, my To-Do List is pretty full right now. Getting enough money and materials to build a base is on the top. After that becoming self sufficent in terms of food/materials, recruiting and training more people, getting into crafting and bigger-scale trading to equip them with good gear, and then finally attacking some bigger targets like outposts or cities. Looking forward to kicking some holy-nation♥♥♥♥♥ after all the crap Ive taken from them haha.But of course, as with all early access titles, one has to keep an open mind when buying one. The game is far from finished and polished. I have to play it on lowest settings to keep it somewhat playable (especially in or near cities...but to be fair, my PC is kinda getting old haha) and many things arent implemented yet etc. If you can live with that as I do, then this game is your wet dream. Otherwise Id wait a couple of months for some more updates.			"

								This game is amazing even though its a early access game its a really fun game to play.I can't wait for the new update to come out im super excited for it.To me this game reminds me alot like runescape on the fact you can be whatever you want and the fact you are not neo makes it that much better because it makes you feel like you are more part of the world and the odds are not in your favor unless you work hard on your skills and tactics but again the best part about this game is the fact you can be whatever you want,right now im between being a bounty hunter and a merchant selling and trading with cities,I'm also building up my base and hoping to have my own shop set up soon i also want to get all my guys stronger so i can take on bigger groups of bandits and the fact i can do all of this whenever i feel like it is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.I wish more rpg style games would do what this game does on play style and depth in character developing.I cant wait for this game to be fully completed cause even at full price this game was well worth paying for and after playing 40hrs i give this game a 8/10 only because the graphics could be better and the fact the game crashes here and there and it also can run slow at times as well but i wasnt expecting a perfect game when i got it.If all these things can get fix and improved plus add more to the game besides what is being added in the upcoming update then this game to me is a 10/10 in my opinion.Even in its current state i still recommend this game to anyone looking for a really in depth game to play.

								Kenshi, this game has never failed to disappoint.  I've been with it since the greenlight, before there was even audio in the game.  I think that is probably the main point.  This game has been in development for awhile now but Lofigames has not done what other developers have done and simply abandoned the game.  Yes the progress has been extremely slow (small updates) but there have been constant updates.  Each time I come back to the game, yes I do stop once I've explored all the features, there is always something new to explore.  But the point is, it has never stalled out, there are always updates.  Lofigames has always continued on with development.  I'm not going to sit here and tell you about the features of the game.  Figure it out for yourself, just know that it will definitely be worth your time.			"

Early Access Review
								There is so much to be said about Kenshi... I will try my best to structure and condense it in a way easy to go through.First and foremost, Kenshi already is everything it promises to be in the descriptions, no exaggeration. A very important thing to state for an early access indie still in development, in my oppinion.Even in its yet unfinished state, the game world feels real. One might be concerned that a game that tries to be too many things at once might feel disconnected, stitched together and some portions of the gameplay might feel out of place. Kenshi however manages to turn city/base building, classical RPG and open-world exploration in one complex experience, with a reasonable amount of atmosphere on top.Going through this experience is strangely captivating, with a dose of small but noticeable wonder. The first time I realized how weak I was on my own, the first time I realized I can use my other party members to distract guards and shopkeepers so that I can thieve safely while wandering around a shop. The point at which after a lot of building and researching my outpost finally started looking like a small village, my first attempt at raiding an ancient lab that ended with half of my 10-people away team slowly carrying the other half to the nearest village, but with everyone alive and with spoils to show for it...On to the less important things, the game's graphics are good enough considering they are not the focus, but do look a little dated. Soundtrack is good but a bit repetitive.It is stable, in my 40 hours of playing it crashed once, and that was after intense and prolonged Alt+Tabbing to and from it so that is fine in my book.Overall, the game is a great pick for any classical RPG and/or Sandbox fan.

								Kenshi.Purchased 16th Dec 2014.Playing as  Hive drone, one of 4 playable and original races (minus the obvious humans who have various subraces) whom I named Peaceful Kubo, I started in a Holy Nation farm, mining iron for Cats (the currency of the realm) I scratch a meager living from the rocks, I purchase greenfruits, grown on the farm I now reside on, I endure the soldiers racism as they march past on daily manouvers. I stare off to the north, alone, as the sun rises. I rush into the bar and sell off the last scraps of iron ore, buy food an animal companion and outfit it with baggage. I fill the bags with food and meds. And set off into the unknown abyss that is the desert sands. A scuffle between holy Nation paladins and some bone dogs breaks out, I swoop in, take some furs and a kit of Paladins armour and his blade - he wont be needing them - I now have a bounty of 2500 Cats on my head. As I travel northward to my freedom.Kenshi Includes -Good stuff-Base building, entire villages can be brough up by yoru hand and hard workSquad building and recruitmentInteresting lore and an original world filled with interesting and unique species.A medical system consisting of injuring different parts of the body and having different detrimental effects.An utterly huge open world - But not too big so to as get dull and boreing.Multiuple factions. A dozen or so skills.Research for better, more upgraded items and building to help with your skills and your,Modding community is already bloomingBad/ not good points -Though the game does suffer slow down and the occassional crash (To cut a long list short my PC is far above the recomended specs)The game does take a few seconds to ""warm up"" and load in textures, models etc - its a big game.The game - if your unprepared for a ruthless world, is utterly brutal, this may be very off puttingThe game is without a doubt poorly optimized - BUT it has improved drastically since I firts purchased it.Yes I have pathetic playtime, owing mainly to my older♥♥♥♥♥♥poor build of a pc when i purchased the game, Now with a more powerful beast and several patches of content and optimisation the game flows - there is some slow down in certain situations (which for a game this size is no bother at all.)

								It's great, get it. It's a slow start, but it's got a lot of depth to it. I would consider it to being similar to Mount and Blade (since that's a close comparison). 2 words of advice:  -DO NOT START OUT AS CANNIBAL HUNTERS -You should probably invest some training in Theivery by picking locks until you can steal items at 100% chance.

								Like many others, I bought this game a few years ago. Back then I could only think of one thing: rough. Really rough. The UI was simple with very basic sliders, the sand on the ground was smoothed over as if detailed in microsoft paint, and the game was completely unforgiving. I revisited this game in 2017 and I can safely say everything that was rough about the game back then has been improved and ironed out including the unforgiving nature of the game.   This is one of my favorite games i've ever played because it fits a neat niche I didn't know I was searching for.  You create a character or a few and set out into a wasteland. To give players guidance, it is reccomended you start mining and selling until you can safely equip your character(s). From then on is up to the player to do what they wish be it mining, fighting, basebuilding, slaving, stealing, etc. This is a strategy game with real time combat. You select your character and right click on a potential threat, and your character fights. This is melee only combat, so battles are fought with swords, greatswords, katanas, etc. Depending on the skill levels of your characters and how geared they are compared to the threat will determine the outcome of total defeat, or victory. Player controlled characters have skills that can be trained to better cooking, fighting, mining, and smithing. To train these stats, the characters must do the action to progress. Training toughness for example is done by getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥whooped. Being downed in a fight and getting back up and surviving increases your toughness exponentially. This means you can stay alive and fight longer. This was such a great mechanic for me; in other strategy games, losing a battle would always have me restart to see if i could change the outcome. With this game however, if i lost a fight, I would try to get the character back up and limp back into town to recover. This mechanic is a small example of how the developer utilizes mistakes and losses and benefits the player with not only lessons learned, but stat boosts as well. The developer of Kenshi has made a game in which stories are unfolding for the player each time they play. With the open nature of this game, I've had plenty of intriguing moments. One in particular was mid game. I had a three characters all who wielded heavy weapons squaring up against seven bandits. My main character Jack swings his enourmous sword and staggers 4. I manevuer the other two around to get a better position but they're caught off gaurd and take damage. My tank named Bard breaks his right arm and has to use his back up weapon. As he swings he gets struck down and knocked out. I send my doctor Soo to heal him while my main character jack fights the remaining bandits. One by one the bandits dropped until the leader strikes down Jack. Soo sees this and enraged, pummels the bandit leader. Jack gets up clutching his broken chest. We need to get back into town before more show up, so Jack picks up bard and throws him over his shoulder. Jack and Soo both crippled and beaten limp three in game hours to find a town to rest their wounds. After resting up, they venture into the wasteland once again. I love this game.  "

								A really great, addictive and refreshing game to play. Your only task is to survive with or without the help from mercenarys you can hire. Kenshi feels like an RTS although a strong RPG presence exists in the storyline shaped by your actions along with complete randomness, this game displays a tastefull lack of overpowered introductions due to you entering the game as a regular person. A unique and consistently suprising experience enjoyable over many hours.			"

								For anyone who likes RPGs and RTS', this is the perfect combo. I absolutly love this game.It gives alot of freedom, and the progress is good, not too fast, not too slow. Everything is learning by doing. No levels. And if you want to, you can equib a newly recruited peasant with the biggest swords and armor. Although it might not be the best choise, it does give you somewhat of an advantage. When you do get to the point of where you have a secure foothold and a few soldiers, you reap the rewards of your labour. You see and guide your small society of people to advance and trade. And once in a while a few roaming bandits will come by, to keep your guards entertained and help with their training. OR you can just go around being the hermit samurai and doing your best to defeat the bandits you meet, although this will mean death, if you dont have an extremly strong soldier first. And such training can be gained by follwing the traders around, as a bodyguard. This game is a game i have been waiting for, for a long time. Its open ended. And its a perfect RPG sandbox. And its not even done yet. I recommend you to get this game, while its cheap! Its worth it already now. However, if you want a game where you can dive directly into high action, this is not the game for you. This game rewards patience and tactical gameplay.			"

(12/27/13 now) I highly recommend the this game to anyone willing to give something new a try. The game starts out a little slow, you have to grind a little and run away from a lot lol.

You start out by yourself and can eventually recruit an army to your cause. Build up your own village, town, or base, and raid other villages, help others, or trade! It's very addicting for an alpha build! I can't wait to see what else is in store for it!			"

								Alright, I've only logged 111 hours into this bad boy but, I have to say totally worth the time spent if you're a gamer. It offers an unique challenge depending on how you want to play. It has some kinks for sure but, its worth the buy. Lets not forget how funny it(and its glitches)can be sometimes. I gotta tell ya, seeing your guys running through the wilds with two broken arms is hillarious whe its sped up to max. Now as far as gameplay the x5 mode is really just for travel when you're impatient. Not to mention it can be taxing on your system. The farming system is as good as it gets for the time being and its simple. The hunger system has changed how survival works since I started the game. The combat system is nice to and you can get into some epic battle scenes after awhile. There is a fairly fresh take on the various races with a little mystery heaped onto them as well. You have nations, slavers, bandits and wildlife. Its really a good game and its only going to get bigger from here. The devs are aways on top of their stuff as far as I can tell and the community is pretty good too. Needless to say if you want a different type of experience and challenge give Kenshi a shot. It takes awhile to get used to but, its totally worth the time spent. You can be a trader, a farmer, a thief or, just go around and merc everything. Not to mention the world has an air of mystery about it the whole time. Just roam around and you'll find all kinds of stuff from ruins to, dare I say it, robots!			"

								If you're a fan of building your own towns that span the ENTIRE GAME WORLD, leading an entire army, hardcore gameplay where if you die you die (but game doesn't end! Carry on with your community and let your previous shell rot in the sands of time!), a free roam game, or hell just swords, katanas, straw hats and ninjas, then this game is for you. It's quite unrivaled in its free roam aspects (base building / attacking towns / trading etc) despite being in an early alpha stage. You can send out different squads of people to different parts of the map, start several towns, just click on a character to move your camera to them. It'll cause quite a micromanagement hassle, as everything keeps going (unless you pause it. It features pause / x2 / x3 / x4 speeds, but lacks a notification / alert system for when people are being attacked - at the moment.) I've been enjoying and will continue to enjoy this game, with future updates sweetening the deal.If you're a fan of ""real life simulators"" (hardcore elements, no artificial levelling, no hero characters, no scaling item & equipment quality, etc.) or titles like Mount and Blade, Sim City, The Sims, or any other simulator where you control the way a community grows, then this game is definitely for you. Oh, and there's bounty hunting. Kenshi also has a tinge of the post apocalypse feel, being set in the seemingly never-ending desert. (No fast travel! Buildings take a while to build! It's a good time killer :D)			"

								This is one of those rare games on steam that is pretty good, for me atleast, i have had a great time playing this game since i got it years ago.Tho its taking a long long long time to get anywhere its still happening and i understand that making games takes time.There have been changes to the game over the years, i liked the desert zone they had better then the new map but i am sure i will come to like it just as well after the map is properly done.The game delivers on its squad based gameplay, the combat is fun, the base building is pretty good, the crafting is nice.There is plenty to do in game right now making it worth buying the game right now.But if bugs and an unkown release time is a bother to you then i recommend you wait until after they are done making this epic game before you buy it, but if that is not a problem for you then i recommend this game 100%.

								Still in early alpha stage but already so awesome. Grow wheat and hemp, make medikits, rum, weapons, armour, roam around the huge map and start wars or trade, almost everything is (or will be) possible.Edit:Over a year later I don't see any improvements. Maybe some features. However performance is worse and the UI is equally (if not more) glitchy.I saw regular updates and pictures of future races and animals and I got the idea that progress was going really fast, but based on what's actually in the game right now little seems to have changed. I'm sure there will be cool stuff in the future, but it's still far from done.Still a lót of fun though, if you know what to look out for.(For instance they sometimes keep walking for no reason.

								Kenshi is one of those games that once you start playing, it is very difficult to put down. I believe the 9.7 hours that I have on record is from one sitting. Unfortunately, the lack of content, performance issues, and bugs make it hard to come back. The one man development team is hard at work though, and continue to fix these issues and add more content. If you enjoy open world RPGs or city-builder RTS games, this may suit you very well. The desert landscape is fairly bland and I can't say I'm a huge fan of the asian theme, but they have mentioned adding new areas to explore. The map is fairly large and once you begin building your own city and army you won't want to stop. $20.00 is a bit steep at the moment, but I highly recommend Kenshi.			"

								I admit I havn't played 100 hours yet, but of the 30 somthing i did so far, all were well spent. Sure its a little buggy, but thats early acccess. Suprisingly, this game runs just fine for me, even on my potato of a laptop when set to low graphics (I would still recommend better though, cause we all know low gaphics are no fun.) I've only found one real bug with the latest update (wont let me build certain things anymore), but with my playstyle where i just run in and go ham with katanas,  it doesn't really bother me much. Ive also tried out some of the mods (YES, THERE IS MOD SUPPORT!) and found most of them to be stable in the experemental version. All in all, I truly enjoy this epic game.What I enjoy: Choose your own playstyle. You dont have to be the goodguy (I know I'm not).A wide variety of swords and armor with different stats.Four different playable species (with sub races too).KATANAS!Mod support.A big map (that is going to get even bigger).What I'm dissapointed about:There are a few bugs (Early access, Bugs are garanteed).No ranged weapons (yet).... Yep, that just about sums it up.Hope you found this review helpful :D			"

								With the state that it is currently in, Kenshi has proven that it is something worth keeping an eye on with alot of potential in the future. There are alot of options for roleplaying, allowing you to become a trader, a fighter, a bounty hunter, or whatever you feel like. There are alot of options for customization and building your own settlement legitimately feels like your carving out a little peace of the landscape for yourself, giving a sense of achievement and identity in the pretty fully realized world. The whole world is full of other characters and factions for you to interact with and understand and each one has its own set of rules, customs, and trades. you could get pretty invested in trying to make sure you stay on good terms with the faction you prefer, while also attacking and stealing from the ones that act like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (♥♥♥♥ The Holy Nation). While the game is deffinitly rewarding, it is pretty brutal at the beginning, so dont expect to be crafting vast cities in under 50 hours. That and a few minor bugs do occasionally make the game frustrating, and it can run rather slow at certain times, but none of this really detracts from the overall quality displayed here. all in all, id say that the expiriance outways the minor bugs within it, and i can honestly say that this is a great title for anyone who is into exploration and crafting an identity in a rough and hardened world			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR pros and cons:+ Awesome game (unique style, interesting design, great gameplay etc.etc.)+ They did it to beta, yay!~ Seemless blend of RTS and a Town-builder on a solid RPG foundation.~ Tru sandbox (no story-quest-line, just sand, your toys and your imagination)~ Game is mod-able so you can add a sexy-armor, i guess... ~ Still being tested, so expect some instability and small bugs   - Some little bugs and glitches are still out thereNTL;WR (Not Too Long; Will Read):Synopsis: First of all, i have to say that the game's description and videos are quite accurate and trustworthy. Pay a close attention to the game's description, by the way. First goes ""free-roaming"" then ""squad-based"" and only then ""RPG"". While it is indeed an RPG, in the same time it's not. Not in the familiar today wiev that is.  You character(s) has a set of stats and set of skills that could be raised in particular ways. You can equip your character(s) with whatever gear is accessible out there, in any combination possible. You can tune out the phisical appearance of your character(s) in any given way. Basically, you can build your character(s) whatever you want in every possible meaning.  But that's where the ""RPG"" some may grew accustomed to ends.  In Kenshi nobody will give you a story and send you on the epic quest. Not even a minor quest. Not even to gather 5 rat skulls or deliver a love letter or wake up 11 guards. Every second NPC won't unwrap their soul to you in a complicated system of carefully thought-out dialogues with dozens of possible outcomes. You can't get married. You can't even woo anybody, if only figuratively.     What you can do, however, is to use your imagination, and with help of afeatures given in a first paragraph write your own story by action. Gameplay: Assisted by a dozen of starting conditions, set a foundation to your game. Start as guy with a dog, or try and lead the group of settlers to prosperity of their to-be-built town.  You do not have a direct control over your character(s), instead, it's a traditional RTS\MMO Point-n-click, so you select your character(s) and send them where needed, either to be or to fight, which is also done automatically, based on stats, skills and equipment of your character(s) and those of an enemy.  You may build your own outpost\town, with all the work-stations and various interior set by yourself. Build a shed and fill its inner space with whatever you want. If only it fits there and is available for construction. It's your choise whether that building will become a bar or a hospital. In most cases it's also up for you to decide what role which character will pick: assign them to a mining task, for instance, and their mining skill will progress, which affects the work efficiency. Various traders are available across the vast map, who'll either buy what you've produced, looted, or stole, or gladly sell something to you.  Stealth, stealing and lockpicking is available, and authorities do recognise crimes and in some circumstances - criminals.  Even in it's current state (ver 0.95-ish) map has a very large size and would require some dozen  hours to explore briefly, while only being roughly a 1/2 of a planned map.Conclusion \ impression: All in all, i'd call Kenshi a seemless blend of RTS and Town-Builder on a thick and strong RPG foundation, means, whatever you do - stats and equipment are always there and never neglected.That's said, gameplay is fantastically flawless and natural: Start a character, get some coin, keep wandering alone or hire more characters, build a base, research new tech, build industry, set  people to auto-work... oh, look, your guys didn't go anywhere, it's still they and their stats underneath that thick heavy layer of management and strategy. Quick, assign this guy to guard this girl, and tell her to do the same about him. Boom, Kenshi marriage just happened!    __________________________________________________First version of the review left here for the historical purpose:I want to ask you a few things. Do you remember Fallout? Nah, not that fancy F3 and F:NV, no, i'm talking about '97th Fallout. The world, completely destroyed by nuclear warheads, and then, intensively dried by merciless impartial Sun for over a century, become a harsh, empty desert... that was the world we lived in for a while. We did things, necessary for our cause, we met people, hardened by this hazardous environment, we saw rising nations, mindless bandits, we saw the life after... We were free to go wherever we wish and do whatever we want... Now, do you remember Mount-&-Blade? Where we could roam absolutely free, with no particular cause. We had a party of trustfull associates, we could've trade, fight alone, or swear an oath to a ruller, and fight by their standart. We had to think about provision for out group, so they won't starve and leave us...Before this point we had everything we could possibly want, except one thing...In Kenshi, besides all other things mentioned above, one of possibilities we have is actually settling our own village. Gather some coin, get some bricks and start to build your little paradise in a middle of nowhere. Build it in a trade route, open a tavern and watch caravans going by and leaving you some coin for your goodies. Build a large house and put some beds in, so roaming patrols could rest their feet and heal their wounds. Grow your own crops to make food. Grow your own hemp to make... err... fabric... Beware though, as not only peacefull force roaming the desert. Cruel bandits and mindless cannibals could show up in any hour. They will crave for your supplies, your money, or even your bodies and your life. Build walls, gates, and take deffence of what rightfully yours! Then gather some strenght, and send a squad of trained warriors back, to their den! Take their lives to bring peace across the land and earn respect of other factions. Travel, trade, fight and settle: ""The world is yours"". I can't forget to mention the party itself. Every buddy you hire is, in fact, a full character with same set of stats as your first created guy. So eventually, if you want to, you can go from a single hero to an army of individuals, and even if ""your"" character dies, it's not a ""Game Over"". Everyone are equall, and everyone counts as your character. Besides i'd like to say few things about a graphics. Maybe the textures are not perfect, maybe collisions are not always right, maybe animation is a bit dull sometimes... But, brick hit me, characters even has their FOOT FINGERS modelled! They don't even have this in Skyrim! Anyway, just buy it and help Lo-Fi Games finish this ambitious project and grind this diamond to the brilliant!			"

								Still in development, the title is already very promising, check out the planned features.The only main thing missing atm are quests or things to keep you busy once you've researched the full technology tree. (maybe kill everyone on the map ? XD) I'm still not there yet and have already 30 hours of gameplay on the clock.Lesser things to note:There are also still a few graphical and 3D clipping bugs but you get over them easily. The user interface is really chaotic but gets the job done once you figure out how it behaves.Since the price is planned to get up the closer they get to the final product it's definitly worth investing now than later.

								It's hard to describe exactly what makes this game so addictive and fun. Make no mistake, it's absolutely a work-in-progress, but it's got insane amounts of potential. There's certainly a learning curve, but the game rewards you for trying and failing. Mostly every action you take can build your skill set, even getting♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked by a group of cannibals will make you tougher. If they lock you in a cage, you'll build your skills by trying and failing to escape a few times before making an incredibly satisfying breakout. Once you get your bearings and some respectable equipment, you can group together with some companions and build an outpost as you train your fighting skills and become self-sufficient. Or you can do none of these things. It's a game about creating your own stories.It's also constantly being worked on. The updates are frequent and full of content. Be aware that some updates break certain features of the game, but it doesn't happen very frequently. It's worth investing your time into if you're a fan of Early Access hidden gems and you've got the patience to see it through til the full release. This gets my reccomendation with the expectation that the game continues on the same track it's on now and doesn't get abandoned before it's complete, though I have a good feeling about the devs. They're active in the forums and are great at working with the commuinity.

								recently i've been sinking dozens of hours into this and i decided i had to write a review. this is a openworld RPG with enormous freedom of choice.. have played since oldland (0.4 or something i think) and this game is what i like to see in RPGs..Story:this is a RPG that plays in a postapocalyptic wasteland thousands (?) of years after an extinction event and now people fight with swords and sticks because technology has mostly been lost..Freedom of Choice:tons of factions each with distinctions that set them apart (cannibals, zealots, ninjas etc..) so you can meaningfully change what kind of playstyle you want to use.. you can be a farmer, raider, trader.. kind of reminds me of x3 and other space-sim gamesHigh Customizability:choose between 4 Races and change your appearance with tons of slidersModding / Workshop:I have no experience with modding but with the tools provided by the devs (FCS - forgotten construction set) you can get at the guts of all the settings ingame that govern how the world and you / the NPCs workActive Development:this game has been here for quite some time and has already changed very much from the first versions and while the experimental branch (testing version) sometimes has bugs its very much enjoyable and improving all the time..

You got to have a good PC to run this! Not because of the graphics but how big the map and the amount of npc/buildings/vegetation/animals inside the game!This game is currently playable! When i bought this game long time ago, I used to think it was abandoned. There was not a lot of things to do and there were a lot of bugs. However most of the old bugs are fixed but there will always be new ones so we must keep reporting!Now enough with the old past and gibberish that no one likes to read them.Let get to the Pros and ConsPros:1.A lot of replayabilities because of the different background stories where you start your game from. (You can add more with mods)2.There is Steam Workshop where you can add mods to the game which adds more fun.3.It is quite fun and you make your own stories.4.You get to build a settlement, make a huge clan and raid big bases.5.You can customize how your character looks.6.Huge map with npcs (You can add more npcs with mods)7.You can adjust your own difficulties.8.The combat is quite in-depth with different body parts which your character can get hit.9.You can imprison people and people can imprison you! (If you add mods, you can become a slaver)10.You can control your settlers at home while you go shopping. Meaning if your character goes to a far away place, you still have full control of both your character and settlers. (Similar to the Sims 3)11.Like most rpgs, there is experiences and stats. So there is grinding!This game has not been abandon yet. Which is already a good sign!Cons:1.Not a lot of content (Mods can counter this problem!)2.Slow update (Who can blame them? Developers are humans too)3.Not really that great graphics (Probably due to how big the map is or my PC need some upgrades!)4.The building mode is quite annoying because of the terrain which bothers me a lot. You will encounter unnecessary slanted buildings similar to Fallout 4 settlement building. (I am the type of person who likes to make pretty bases)5.Crashes a lot after a few hours of gaming so be sure to save a lot! (Probably because i put a lot of mods.)6.Bugs (Just report them!)Meh? Don't know whether it is right or wrong.1.There is no linear story.2.It's a very random game.3.I used collections for my mods.4.No guns. (except turret which is stationary)5.No transport. (Be it horses or vehicles)6.No special skills or perks?This is my review and if the game has updated more content or whether the game is completed or the game is abandoned.I will come back and edit this review.

								To begin with, this is a game for the patient, tedious-loving, and hardcore gamers, that seek a fulfilling experience. If you played the pre-CU SWG, and loved it, then you should feel at home in this. It's slow paced, and requires a bit of thought, and I swear you could write a book based off of the experiences of your character. From being enslaved, escaping, and becoming a bad♥♥♥♥♥ninja, to slaughtering entire cities with your army of samurai. You could, instead, buy a house in one of the towns and live a peaceful life as a trader/farmer. Don't want to buy a house? Build one then, but why stop there? Build a whole damn fortified town, guarded by ninja with freak'n harpoon guns. Great early access game, maybe one of the best. The devs also appear to be fairly active, so I can't recommend it more.			"

								I'll admit that at first the game sucked real bad. I had no direction, no purpose, nothing. I was bored and felt like I made a bad purchase (around 5 hours into the game). I only had some basic armor and 1 follower who I named Grandpa.(The game has no storyline so spoilers ->?) I got brutally KO'd and tied up to a pole by the Dust King after I stumbled into his tower. That was when the game opened unfolded before me. I spent 2 days picklocking my way out and with no items weighing me down, I ran away but Grandpa had an injured leg. He didn't make it out. A few people joined my band. Some freely joined, others I paid to join. Now I have purpose. I'm building a town...my own faction. My goal now is to avenge Grandpa and capture the Dust King. Unfortunately, I've♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off most of the other factions, but oh well.The game isn't easy at first and the optimization isn't great. It takes a while to understand. It's basically a do whatever you want type of game with no clear goals. All I know is that I can't...stop...playing...If you like resource management games such as RimWorld or Prison Architect, this might be fore you. There's just more depth to it than most others.			"

								Let me start out by saying one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of owning and playing. I currently give it a 9/10, it will easily be 10/10 once they fix the crashing and the path finding and a few very minor bugs it will be one of the best games out there! I have logged 87 hours currently and I have played all of the starting options and let me tell you just because you start out as a group of 5 nobodies dosnt mean jack! This game is a true open world sandbox! I have played as a travling merchant who brought life saving medic packs to the local police, Iv been a smuggler who had to slip pass the same police to smuggle drugs. I played as a bounty hunter who got his butt handed to him many times and Iv been a bandit with horrible luck! Iv also been a slave and a slaver! and there is so much more to this game! You should give this game a chance even though it has a problem with crashing just be sure to save very often! My hope for this game is for it to become stable and to be moddable I get goose bumps just thinking about the greatmods that can come out of this! I will write a final review once its finished till then play this game and immerse your self in Kenshi!			"

								I decided to go wih the freedom seekers for the idea of making a nation and conquering Kenshi. Day one My group and i travel about a 2 minute run from a town to begin building our haven (incase we get overran and have to book it). If you attempt this the first tech you should learn is makeshift walls. By the second day a little post at the top of the screen had said. Aldonia (name of my town) has been noticed by starving bandits. I only had one gate because i thought my walls would hold. Nope i was wrong. 20 bandits came like the Fire nation. They breached my gate. The Old solider and I ran to battle to defend our workers so they could get to safety. They saughtered us all and looted everything. This game is challenging yet appealing at the same time. If you like the sims, with apocalyptic feel and sword fighting. This is your game to try.			"

								While the concept and mechanics are good, the execution is terrible. Little thought (or capability) was given by the developers for things like the pathing of the characters or the resources in memory.Characters are frequently unable to find their way to complete a task unless manually guided. The rendering of textures along the world is slow and buggy. NPCs and beasts are erratic at best.This game screams of Unity plugins and copy'n'pasted code. All-in-all, it's an amateur execution at best.			"

Honestly if development stopped now I would have gotten my money's worth ethier way as some bad reviews have mentioned.10+ different factions being worked on at the top of my head with one being slavers that capture you and imprison you as you hope your other squad members can rescue you by defeating the harpoon turrets guarding the prison along with different types of bandits ranging from highly trained sand ninjas to hungry bandits dressed in rags and weilding wooden sticks but in massive numbers.If your to worried to make a base that can be raided Abundantly by bandits then settle with a house in a fortified city as you make some basic armor.The possibilities are endless.

								Do you enjoy free roaming and getting owned at the beginning all the time? Then this is the game for you!On a more serious note:This game is slow paced, you will start out with almost nothing (Depending on which start you choose) and you WILL get rekt all the time at the beginning. But once your squad has grown in number and power the fun starts kicking in. Slaughtering silly bandits that used to slaughter you!Sadly I haven't been attracted to the building alot, it's still a little buggy in my opinion to enjoy the building part of this game. Also the View Distance is attached to your Camera, not to your characters so it's a hard time to spot enemies sometimes.All in all, this is still Early Access and I can see this game having a big potential. Hoping for some new updates!			"

								Avoid, only in the past few years has this game even started to gather any form of pace , let alone any kind of play. Despite the hundreds of hrs put into this and 5 years of waiting this game is still unplayable. Countless times have i unstalled this game because of it bugg ridden and constantly crashes. Verifying cache, rebuilding the nav mesh, broken pathfinding- still,and endless bug reports filed .Yes the game has an approach and style that come as very appealing to the sandbox/ sim / stratergy. But the implementation of these ideas are ham fisted and generally break the game. Resulting in a gameplay although i paid for 5 years ago, i have never been able to play this game to any sort of conclusion , even if it was a narrative or a play style that i wanted. It will list on the store that its a game for all sorts, And in theory it is- but only if ALL of these options work, which for most part they dont.  Want to be a trader- path finding is iffy- so is trading most of the time. Want to be a fighter- the a.i for your squad and group control is basic at best , no formations , its a drag box -gather all affair point and attack. Its rather warband mount and blade sorta thing only with slight dumber a.i /npcs.Which is a reall shame considering once you have a base set up and start crafting your going to win- full stop. The a.i in the game wont counter u in anyway. This is daft considering this game has factions, but for what ever reason other than some npc running after u to kill / or steal theres no real war going to happen. Its u gathering your troops and attacking what ever u see fit- the game wont counter or gather other factions to help. It wont come kick your♥♥♥♥♥if your getting to big. In all honesty buy warband  if your after a large warfare siege building  faction game. This is quirky and it has it moments , but waiting 5 years for this to come half way playable at best was a step to far for me. Early access has a bad name for good reason, companys came along , promised much and then sat on our money while we got broken codes, false promises, delay after delays in ""well fix that patches"" this imo was one of those companys.Now the fan boi's on steam will tell u the company lay golden eggs and there ideas for the game out way any gripes u have . Which is total b.s, if u sell something , even if its early access theremust be some form of timeline, steam must address this, because the dev of this game is like""o0 i have another idea"" so u have to wait while he codes his idea and then breaks the game again. All along while waited for his first 10 ideas to be fixed. This has been my first 5 years with the makers of this game.  You've been warned.This is the 3rd review- 5 years on			"

								I've been playing for a long while now and only recently transferred my account from desura to steam, reason for my almost non-existent gameplay time...it's all about preference. All I can say is that this game is unique in its own way and a lot of reviews had gone into details which I would rather not repeat. The developer and maker of kenshi had before worked as a security guard before to make a living while designing this game until recently he got enough money from sales to form a small team. We had waited years for long intervals between updates but he had never disappointed us before. It is his persistence to complete this game, come what may attitude, is the selling point to me. I see it having a lot of potential and modable qualities, his preseverance and persistence at work is the deciding factor. Believe me, it will take some time to get a complete game but it will arrive and you will not be disappointed. It's just quality work by a single master-craftsman with a few helping hands to produce this gem, so you can't expect work to go fast to your liking....he wants it to be the best so for me, take all the time you need, just don't take too long....I hope. ^_^			"

								Dang...  I helped to greenlight this game. It was actually the first one I ever voted yes for.  And I've followed it since then, waiting for it to become complete enough for me to want to give it a try. And so I tried it today. And I'm a bit saddened by my disappointment. It reminds me of the old Neverwinter Nights mods that were just vast tracts of open space with occasional randomly spawned monsters. Those weren't games. Those were templates for games. I could open up the NWN toolset and hammer out something like that in 45 minutes. People often did do that.So Kenshii looks like it's just a template for a game. And, given that it's in the .9x version series now, It appears to me that the vision for it may not shift very much. Oh well. :(			"

Early Access Review
								As of January 2017, the play experience Kenshi has offered has declined for several years in ways not attributable to the normal churn of development, to evolving code and ideas, or to the good and bad experiments we hope to see during development. So, I think it is fair to consider it one the very, very few early-access titles that can and should be ""reviewed"". But, it is an early access title and a normal ""review"" would be pointless and unfair. Instead I'll summarize why I recommend to hold off deciding to buy or not to buy for now.In a nutshell, what began as a great little gem with a focused and tight presentation and play experience, lacking only in polish and game-mechanic features, has become a bloated, unfocused fever-dream of bad user interaction, inscrutable play, poor reliability, and abysmal rendering performance. The only area that has improved is the length of the checklist of features implemented. But even those feel scattered, random, and not truly essential to furthering the core of play. Kenshi used to seem it was destined to be a master of one thing, now it is an amateur of many.Given that long and steady trajectory, so opposite in direction to its early course, I would recommend holding off on a purchase decision until LoFi releases this and it exits Early Access. Put it in your follow list, keep an eye on it, see how the critics and lets-players you respect get on in their games and hope, as I do, LoFi will prove me utterly wrong with their 1.0, because the early promise and execution were wonderful once and so there is still reason to hope.

								EARLY ACCESS IMPRESSIONSIf and when this game reaches completion, I will update this review as necessary.That being said, for an Early Access game, I would still recommend this to anyone looking for a fun free-roaming open-world RPG. There are various starting scenarios, though ultimately you play a character (or characters) stranded in the middle of nowhere; the overall objective - to be or not to be completed at your leisure - is to recruit other survivors and literally build a community from the ground up that you can all survive the many dangers of the harsh wasteland within. One of the main draws is being able to control upwards of 20+ characters (believe this number will eventually be much, much larger) who are capable of doing various jobs: farmers, scientists, labourers, bounty hunters, warriors, bodyguards, thieves, assassins, engineers, merchants, traders and more; the neat thing here is that all you need to do to train a skill up is to use it, which allows any given character to potentially do anything and everything you'd like them to.Graphics aren't much at the moment, but this game will likely never have a huge emphasis on visuals since you will spend most of the time zoomed out far enough out to not care. The sound is coming along nicely, so far, though it definitely needs more work. AI isn't fully implemented yet and is a bit single-minded, but the 'to-do' list in this area is sounding really promising at this point. Still. The game has a certain addictive quality to it.			"

								Awesome game. It is currently in alpha, but I could (and have) play for hours on end. The mechanics are stellar and, while buggy and incomplete, really make the experience a unique one. You can do just about anything you'd want to do in this game, save for maybe taking on a group of bandits solo. The combat is difficult, so taking on enemies should be done strategically so as to not get yourself killed. Luckily, you can hire as many companions as you'd like to help you take on the baddies. Want to build a base for manufacturing goods, weapons and armor? More power to you! Want to build an army to ravage a nearby town? Better start training! The possibilities are near endless. All in all, I cannot wait for this game to hit 1.0 version. If it keeps going at this rate, I've no doubt it will be extremely successful. GET IT NOW!			"

Early Access Review
								This game has a ton of potential.  And I don't just say that based on the projected features, I base that on how it feels.  As I play it, I get the feeling that as development continues the game world will become a complex and interestng place, and the different facets of the gameplay will compliment it.  It is ambitious, with base building, diplomacy, squad-based tactics, and rpg elements.  If all those come together, it will be an extremely unique game.The development is continuing steadily, it is not a project that is abandoned.  When I read about all the planned features I almost worry that the developer has bitten off more than he can chew, but the progress that has already been made proves otherwise.As it is early access, there is not a large amount of things to do within the game world yet.  However, a significant map expansion and diplomacy/faction system are a couple of the updates coming down the pipe, and if they are as advertised this game would be justified in shedding the ""alpha"" tag once they are released.A couple of the game mechanics are clunky, it can take 5+ minutes to sell all the items in my squad's inventory due to having to run around to different merchants in the towns.  However, the game attempts to be realistic in many respects and this is one that reflects real life, a merchant likely wouldn't be able to take a dozen sets of armor off someone's hands in real life.  Although I complain about the selling system, I can see that it was purposefully done to make the game seem realistic; it is not just something that was poorly implemented or was not though through well enough.As it is alpha, my characters do get stuck in walls occasionally, it is NOT a common occurrance however.  It is easily fixable too, just save the game and reload with a ""reset squat position"" option.  This is another example of the thought put into it by the developer; he recognizes that its deveopment status could cause bugs, but implemented a system to allow people to enjoy their experience despite it.  And the bugs really are few and far between for me.I really think this game is going to be something special.  Aside from the planned features, it just has the feel of something that will be a great experience.			"

One of the main draws is being able to control upwards of 20+ characters (believe this number will eventually be much, much larger) who are capable of doing various jobs: farmers, scientists, labourers, bounty hunters, warriors, bodyguards, thieves, assassins, engineers, merchants, traders and more; the neat thing here is that all you need to do to train a skill up is to use it, which allows any given character to potentially do anything and everything you'd like them to.Graphics aren't much at the moment, but this game will likely never have a huge emphasis on visuals since you will spend most of the time zoomed out far enough out to not care. The sound is coming along nicely, so far, though it definitely needs more work. AI isn't fully implemented yet and is a bit single-minded, but the 'to-do' list in this area is sounding really promising at this point. Still. The game has a certain addictive quality to it.			"

								One of the best rpg/rts games ive ever played, and its only in early access. I bought this game ages ago after seeing the first part of a lets play thinking it looked amazing, Altho it looked really complicated and it seemed that it would take a long time to figure out how things worked and played so i put it off for almost a year. Finally a week ago i decided to pick it up. One week later and i have 57 hours clocked in this game. Do yourself a favor and get this game. It may seem a bit daunting at first but its worth the first 30 minutes to an hour floundering about, because once you figure out how everything works it becomes an amazing experience. I only wish the entire game was out so i could enjoy the full vision of the devs, patience was never my strong suite tho, and right now it shouldnt be yours either, so stop being patient and buy the game!

								 I've followed the game for a few years now and it may be coming around slower in terms of development. It's clear to me that these developers care about their game and name considering how far it's come and the fact that they still work on it, having not taken our money and ran like a Nigerian Prince. At this point in time, it obviously has it's bugs but Kenshi is still a fun game; definitely unique in a good way and I cannot wait to see it completed. This is one of a few games that I truly cannot wait to see it realize it's full potential.			"

								This game has so much potential. One day, it will probably be one of the coolest rpg-like strategy/builder games out there. Love the idea of building up from nothing in a wasteland.There is always a but though. This game crashes. A lot. Which is to be expected from just about anything that's not produced by an established gaming company, Hell, even a lot of those crash. I for one will patiently await the day that this game allows me to play for more than twenty or thirty minutes at a time, as like I say, it has a lot of potential.			"

								I've been playing Kenshi for the past three years slowly watching the crazy amount of improvement it has underwent. At the beginning I was on the fences with everything due to some bugs and less opportunity for exploration with the old old map.. I recently got back into it and I just CANT stop playing it. The experience that I’ve had with the new map and the whole new system makes adventure 10x more ‘awesome-er’. This RTS/3rd-Person Hybrid, Sandbox, Squad-Based, Adventure-RPG is now a forerunner to a new genre in the RPG world and I’m extremely happy with the progress that Lofi Games has made. IF you want endless adventure, BUY this game so more improvements are made for the Beta!!			"

Kenshi - A RPG mixed with some tactics and base-buildingDid you ever want to play a RPG where your character was not the chosen one until you achieved the skill to be him? Did you ever want to play a game where you can play with a single or multiple characters with pros and cons for each style? And most of all: Did you want a game with an open world where you can build your own outpost which can produce materials, weapons a.s.o.? If you don't mind some bugs and pathfinding problems (only sometimes) then even the alpha is good for you.You begin with a character for whom you first choose the background. There are a few backgrounds you can choose from and each changes the difficulty (i.e. you get a better weapon or none at all, have a squad or are a loner...). So you begin on a big map (which shall get bigger as the development continues) and don't have a real goal. Except to survive. Bandits may find you very fast and the first thing you REALLY want to do is run away. You need experience. The levelling system is like in Oblivion: You get better as you do it. So now you should get to the next city or a patrol. Bandits are Bandits and you don't have the experience to fight them. Like I said: You are NOT a hero. As you venture to the towns you may find better equipment and buy it from money you got for selling looted stuff from dead bandits or ninjas. Maybe you even find better thins on them, but that does not happen very often. To get the best equipment you need to produce them on your own. As soon as you have got money and found a safe place (not too far from a city would be best) you can begin to build a research bench and begin building an outpost. It takes a lot of time. Many hours (real time, not the ingame time) until you researched everything. You also need to buy some blueprints for better weapons and armors. Now that you have even better equipment you can do more in a fight and if you already have more experience, you can take on at least 1 or 2 enemies at once. Since I only played to this point, I cannot go further with the gameplay. Oh, did I mention you can lose limbs? And need to bandage your wounds? There are no health potions and it takes a lot of time to recover. Conclusion:Pro:- Huge map- Learning by doing- Build your own outpost/city- Research- Limbs can be severed- Different weapons with different playstyle- Research better weapons- Not as easy as most of the games nowadaysCons (at the moment):- Still alpha (includes bugs and similar problems)- No animals- Mines can be build anywhere- World seems very empty- Cities are small- Even if more guys around sometimes 1on1Neutral:- No AAA-gaphics, but still not so bad- Animations			"

								I am not recommending this game in it's current state, but I am giving it a thumbs up because of its amazing potential. I mean, seriously, if it gets through EA without the devs abandoning it as so many do, gets the updates it needs and is released in a finished, polished state, then this could be an absolutely amazing open world RPG. It has all the elements of the,perfect game; base building, farming, recruiting town/party member then upgrading them, crafting, research, factions, a huge open world, there are many more elements but I didn't intend for this review to be a long one until I put more time into the game .The reasons that I am not recommending this game in its current state are simple.The terrible, seriously flawed control system.The ridiculously bad camera,The awful performance. I have, literally, a top of the range PC, and the FPS still drops to a level where I want to throw my base unit across the room this is ridiculous for a game in late 2016.I appreciate that it is in EA, and the regular updates make me hopeful that the game will get finished. In the meantime, buy it on sale (unless you want to support the devs, which can only be good for the game), or wait until it is rather more polished.			"

								I have backed Kenshi form the alpha stage and the developers have put an insane amount of work and love into the game and a lot of progress has come out of it. that being said only a quarter of the map is playable leaving not a whole lot to discover and the holy empire are easily the worst faction so far (if you arent with them then your an enemy) but I really like the Hive and hope that i will be able to join/work with them in the future. Otherwise their is a good amount to do to keep yourself busy until more updates come out. The biggest drawback is poor optimization but the team have made this their main concern along with finishing the whole map. Thumbs up for insane potential.			"

								Let me start off by saying I've been following this game from it's early days. I never thought that this game would turn out as awesome as it has. I thought that it would've remained in it's previously quite barren alpha state. I was wrong.Kenshi is now one of my most favourite games of all time! It's become quite an amazing sandbox experience and I would definitely recommend this game to everyone and anyone. Although the world and lore still has a little building to do at this time, the game and it's features are well worth the £12.99 I paid for it (If its on sale, then even better!) The world is bustling with activity and things to do. You can do literally whatever you want (within reason) and all the hours I've spent playing this game have felt definitely worth it. (Bear in mind that i've played Kenshi off of steam for a long time)This game is truly a hidden gem and I can't wait to see what comes next. HOWEVER, currently this game is based around what YOU MAKE OF IT. If you're looking for storyline or cheap staright up violence then this game isn't for you. It's better played with a mindset of creating your own story (although the factions and lore help direct this I feel). Also the developers are bringing frequent and progressive updates to the game, and the mod community is very active and talented. A plus on the side!10/10			"

								It may be early access but it is such a good game.The developers have really big intentions for this game, some them look amazing ( big beasts and multiple map areas)It plays well even being early access. It really gives the feel of you being weak at the start ( like one bandit could kill you ) but with practice that soon changes.Pretty nice graphics and some cool base building and thats pretty much it. Lots of dieing building and then making yourself stronger for next. All in all ive been playing kenshi for a year now and i have to say the developers are always working on it with big updates normally every few months.			"

								(Keep in mind this was written about half way through alpha testing, this game may be far ahead of what you read, by the time you see this reccomendation)I bought this yesterday, and unlike every other Greenlight game I've seen, this one is truly amazing! I really can't express enough how great it feels to see that useless husk of a human/tribal you have, finally be able to win battles!I at first was having great difficulty, as the games Research and a few other mechanics arent very well explained in the tutorial or help menu, but once I realized that I need blueprints, how to learn them, and how to actually stand a chance in combat the game really grew on me immensly :)Watching your little one man army, grow to 20 men strong is really an amazing thing, and the pretty intense battles you have, really make the game amazing :)I would definitly recommend a purchase before the price goes up as development goes on. If you're on the fence about this, I really would purchase if I were you.			"

								Kenshi is still in alpha and full of bugs that crash the game, causes some mechanics not to work, has a single repetetive desert landscape to play on and has only just had basic audio added to the game. Yet i look at the in-depth RPG and realistic combat systems in place and the potentiol of the game even in its current state makes me, for the first time, accept calmly that my game crashes and things don't work, because what does work shows just enough of the great things that are in the future of this title. This may not be a must own just yet, but the odds are stacked in its favour that it will be one day.			"

								One of the greater mix of the sandbox and RPG games. Its a top down RPG game focused on gamepaly rather than a 'campaign' If you have a great imagination, then by the time you push that new game button, its the start of your own campaign. However, this game doesnt take kindly to new players, in the beginning of the game, its harsh. But once you get a good character that could defend themself, you'll have a great time just like I did playing this game. (By the way I dont know if this is a local problem but to install updates to this game I have to reinstall it..Probably a local problem.)			"

Early Access Review
								Clearly an early access game, so a lot of content is still missing. However, it's a very FUN game even now, and since I bought it about a year ago, it's a very DIFFERENT game than what I bought, in a good way. The team has grown and is steadily updating with new and improved content, and they're quite dilligent about squashing bugs.The ambitious idea behind this game is pure sandbox gold, and thus far, I see no indication the game will fall very short of its goals. Even in its current state, it's a game I sink 4-6 hours at a time into. I tend to take long breaks, usually coming back after a big content update overhaul patch, but when I do pick it up, ""I think I'll play Kenshi for a bit"" always turns into ""Wow, I played Kenshi for that long?"" It's an addictive game with an extremely promising future.If you enjoy sandbox games, survival games or games that let you make a personal mark on the world, you'll love picking up a guy here and there from the taverns in the local towns, banding together for protection, and watching your recruits grow into hardened warriors and master builders as you carve out your own little piece of the world to call your own. I definitely recommend Kenshi for anyone who like a game that gives you freedom and rewards you for surviving in whatever way you see fit. I also recommend it for those who like to start out with nothing and eventually (a long time into the future) have to means to obtain anything they wish.If I were to compare it to other games... It's a little bit Mount and Blade, a little bit Age of Empires, and just a tiny bit Minecraft. (Tiny bit; you get to build, but you don't get to design your buildings. You can, however, place useful constructions like beds to heal in and containers to store materials and items into these buildings however you choose.)Do bear in mind that Kenshi is still in alpha, so it's a little barren and it does have its bugs. Also keep in mind that Kenshi isn't a game that holds your hand too much. You're plopped down in a world populated with various hostile and neutral factions, and your purpose is to survive however you can. Trade between the cities, start your own society where you mine and farm for resources to sell, or prey on starving bandits until you become bandits yourselves capable of waylaying wealthy merchants and their caravan guards.However, what you do and how you do it is left entirely to you, so do bear in mind that at first, you might feel a bit lost and without direction. Also keep in mind that the world is a dangerous place, and you might lose quite a bit before you start to see gains. Don't be afraid to fall; just speed up the time, and there's a good chance you'll wake up. If you do, you'll be tougher than the last time. Every scar in Kenshi brings you a small step closer to being the big dog in the game.Long story short: If you're thinking about buying Kenshi based purely on what the store page has to say about it, you'll probably be glad you bought it. It's an amibitious game that is slowly doing all it set out to do, and gives you the sense of accomplishment you'd expect. It's paced to be played for the long haul, so if you enjoy open-ended sandboxes where you reap your rewards after many long hours of effort and character growth, this is definitely a game you'll want to consider.

You can create your own faction, and live the way you want to within the game.  You can start a brand new settlement and fight for survival.   You can raid, and mug and terrorise all over the play area.  Make enemies and forge alliances.  This game is well worth the investment and more.

								A whole lot of fun, though a bit challenging at first. This game is overflowing with potential, and I can't wait to see where it goes. Right now the gameplay is pretty versatile, with a number of different ways to earn money, experience, and respect. Most of these paths, e.g. farming, smithing, trading, etc. take quite a while (1-3 hours) to really get functioning, so from the getgo you've got atleast 4 or 5 hours before the game gets anywhere near the risk of being boring. Throw in random attacks from the different desert and city factions, recruiting new members from the taverns of the world, and the amazing fun of mass combat and you're looking at a game well worth the price.

								An absolutely original game, a unique and delightful gem amongst the dross. I bought this a long while ago, not really anticipating too much from an early access. I played, and found it enjoyable, but there was so much missing that I grew disheartened and left it. Now that I have returned, I am consistently astonished by the sheer amount of work and committment that has gone into this game. Too many early-access games are left barren for months on end, as if the creators are only interested in making a few extra bucks from eager games, but with Kenshi the developers have truly pulled through, making something unique and consistently making it better.

The gameplay and features planning to be added definately set this game apart from the crowd, in that it's hasn't been done over and over again.If your a fan of RPG and RTS games and would like to see a melding of the two come together then you should definately give this one a look. Understandably as it is still Early access it lacks what most would hope for from a finished game. I however think that the developers have worked hard enough on it that it warrants my money being invested.Keep in mind that it is still very rough around the edges and make sure you do a bit of research. I sincerely hope more people see this game for the absolute Gem it can and will be.			"

								      In this review we will go over a few of the key features along with the pros and cons of this game. I personally am at a stand point between loving the game and distaining it while keeping in mind the game is in alpha stage. I will explain if and why this game is worth the price.     This game has been in development since 2012, the development cycle has been slow, and an update roughly every two months at the time of this review (3/14/2014) the last known update was February 10th 2014. The game has a few of the features spoken of, the vast land scape that is truly every meaning of the word large. It would take you quite some time to get across the map, I clocked it at 24 minutes on standard speed (the game comes with three speed rates) There are a few things you can do at the beginning of each game, mostly attempt to trade with other factions or cities. As most factions are less than vanilla, the rewards are arguable. You could make a living hunting bandits, or you could simply create a single structure and have the bandits come to you (After maybe 3-4 hours of excessive training). Unless of course you would like to know how it feels to be a three legged cat chased by a pack of wolves. The fighting animations are fairly nice a few clashing of swords, however does get a bit repetitive which is fine considering the game is in alpha. Now there are other things you can work to accomplish if you actually want to feel some progression in the game, consider there is no story or dialogue to guide you in the game at this time  (3/14/2014). There is however a simple tutorial in the options menu. The base building of the game is fairly nice; you can make a nifty manufacturing system mine, research and build. Then find something else to do, which of course is all there is at this current state (which is fine) as the amount of time it takes to get to that point is quite hefty. The amount of available research is quite vast, which will take you at least six to nine hours, depending on which game speed you prefer. Once you have your super industrial enterprise and have the best warriors equipped with the best weaponry and training that the game allows the next step is to find something else to do. That can be a daunting task; you could put little outposts all over the map and make your own little empire with a few squad-mates. 	On another note, there are mods available for the game. The construction kit is easy to get. (http://kenshi.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Modding) Although, the amount of mods aren’t a huge attraction, but they do exist! Now then to pros of the game are. -Awesome concept.-Based on Sword fighting with nice animations. -Build a small empire.-Very large map.-Mod-ableNow for the cons.-Slow development.-Many game breaking bugs.(which is forgivable for an alpha of  course)-The game-play will come to a point where there isn’t much to do and wait for updates like many on the official forum.-The super crash (I clocked it at every 50 minutes) Quite a few of the fellow Kenshi players know what I am talking about.    The question you need to ask yourself before purchasing is the game worth the price tag (I picked the game up for 20 dollars). The developers do need the support I will not argue that, I merely want the buyer to understand what they are getting for their hard earned cash.  As of right now (3/14/2014) the reviews for the game are quite positive, especially from the players themselves and for good reason! The amount of potential for this game is beyond words. I am personally excited about the development, and so are many others. As a personal statement, please understand the game is in alpha stage with slow progression as most alpha stage games are just keep that in mind. If you are in doubt, watch some youtube videos on this game.

Early Access Review
 Overview – Kenshi version 0.93.28 StableKenshi is an interesting game that's very hard to describe. It's a blend of RPG and RTS that functions quite well. You can dwell in the broken world just by yourself, with a squad of faithful friends, or with an entire army (using a simple mod, you can control up to 256 characters). So, what all does this game offer? Plenty of options you can find in most other RPGs. Be a thief, pawning off stolen goods to make profit, or you can travel the cities to make a living off honest trading with a bull to carry your load. Scavenge the ruins for artifacts with a faithful bonedog companion by your side. Establish outposts/villages/cities, serve a holy purpose, hunt down cannibals, become a leader of an army to sweep over the lands, battle giant creatures, or just chill in a tavern and listen to some of the stories others have to tell. Sounds good, doesn't it, but does it actually work?  The Good   True sandbox experience – almost all that the enemy can do, you can do too (and if not, there are mods for that) Official mod support (with Steam Workshop) – modability can carry the game when the game can no longer carry itself Giant map – even though only about ¼ of the map is implemented so far, it is still quite large, and will become only larger and more diverse as time goes on Updates – disputable (read more in The Bad), but the game is basically being made by a single guy (except for sound, music, and art), so with that taken into account, the game is being updated quite frequently Soundtrack – the music is great, and I applaud the composer for pronouncing the atmosphere of the game with fitting music. Look up the sound engineer and music composer of this game, Kole Hicks. You'll find that the music system of Kenshi is a lot more complex than you might think. Gameplay – All I described in the overview, you can truly do.  Replayability – Even when I explored the map, seen what there is to be seen, I still have the urge to play again and again, just to try a different style, a different race, or just to hang out in the amazing scenery once again   The Bad  Bugs – the game, to be honest, is a buggy mess. Some features that are implemented are not working correctly. For example, mercenaries that you should be able to hire to protect your outpost or to bodyguard you on your adventures don’t work (they just eat your money and act as if they had done the job), clipping textures (your characters can get stuck in inescapable places), shops can get bugged and be opened when they shouldn’t, which leads to guards attacking you, and more Pathfinding – While it’s amazing that you can just click anywhere in the map and your characters automatically go there, it’s not quite so useful when your characters get stuck, run around unnecessarily, etc. Your outpost workers will get stuck in buildings, behind staircases, and in other places. Learning curve – it will take you quite some time to get the hang of the game. This means you won’t be able to experience the game in enough time to be able to claim a refund if you don’t like the game anyway. So, buy at your own risk, knowing you won’t be able to get a refund Long development – the earliest Kenshi development video on the developer’s channel is 9 years ago, where in the description he also states that it’s a pre-alpha footage of something he had been working on for a few years by then. It just might be another decade before we see this game enter at least a beta stage. Still, at least we have an actually playable, feature-rich something, unlike another game that comes to mind – Overgrowth. What’s notable, though, is that even through such a long development the game is still being updated on regular basis, so the developer is definitely determined to see this game through. Dubious PR – I can’t attest to this myself, just thought I should mention it anyway. There has been, allegedly, some controversy. I don’t participate in the forums/steam discussion, so make your own picture of this. For further inquiry, read Extrasmooth's review of the game. If what he says is true, I fear that the developer might dig himself too deep into unfixable bugs. We shall see. Optimization – the game runs like garbage. You will have to contend yourself to playing the game at low/very low if you have older hardware like me. Still, the game will run like♥♥♥♥♥♥in some areas. Be wary. I don’t really care about the graphics as long as the gameplay is fine, but I know some people do care.Phew, that's quite long so far. I don't think I'll be able to write the story of my first serious journey in the end due to character limit, but I might do some ""greentext"" version later on once I get it written down. Just so you know so far, yes it does indeed ""work"" and you can experience all I have said you can. With that, I do recommend this game even in its kinda broken state, as I most definitely got my money's worth out of it, and will continue to do so in the future.  But, I still urge you to read through other reviews and to take ""The Bad"" things into account.			"

								WICKED GAME!!!! when i first got this i played none stop now i know theres problems and parts seem emty and that its been an eirly access game for years but, playing it you can still really enjoy it.its mad and wierd a tottal one off. the graphics are good though fbs runs up down every ten minutes even on a 970 ftw, but still fun and im not gonna get hung up on frame rate with this style of game.now the sound track,,,, i liked it, honest, it fitted this game well but if your planning on a night of kenshi then please, go to settings, turn offfff the music and play your own, it very nearly put me off, its pretty constant.the fighting and even getting knoked out is so cool like i litrally get so into it its just awesome though i do F5 before fights aspectaly with canibles... and some long knecks.. ive not gone crazy far in base building but so far so good, i saw people have lost stuff through updates so you know, dont wonna go all out and wait my time.leveling is pretty sweet in this, its soming i feel needs to be pland from the begining, like alright i think its 8 charictures so i make sure my first is indurenes based cuz theres a carry limit before you cant move, then a meddic second and on and on with dffrent builds, but nut just stats theres also armers and wepons.anyway big ups for reading, i hope ive helped out on some choices, tobe sure though, read bad reviews to to be unbiouse when spending cash.cheers			"

								I like this game. Its open world, play as you want, not easy at all and keeps you busy and eyes open at every waking moment. It has some bugs but thats to be expected with EA and Devs are active in working them out. So if you like the idea of making your way in the wild and starting from nothing, building as you go from the bottom to the top, then this game is for you. Its a challenge, and thats what I like about it.			"

								A whole lot of fun, though a bit challenging at first. This game is overflowing with potential, and I can't wait to see where it goes. Right now the gameplay is pretty versatile, with a number of different ways to earn money, experience, and respect. Most of these paths, e.g. farming, smithing, trading, etc. take quite a while (1-3 hours) to really get functioning, so from the getgo you've got atleast 4 or 5 hours before the game gets anywhere near the risk of being boring. Throw in random attacks from the different desert and city factions, recruiting new members from the taverns of the world, and the amazing fun of mass combat and you're looking at a game well worth the price.

								An absolutely original game, a unique and delightful gem amongst the dross. I bought this a long while ago, not really anticipating too much from an early access. I played, and found it enjoyable, but there was so much missing that I grew disheartened and left it. Now that I have returned, I am consistently astonished by the sheer amount of work and committment that has gone into this game. Too many early-access games are left barren for months on end, as if the creators are only interested in making a few extra bucks from eager games, but with Kenshi the developers have truly pulled through, making something unique and consistently making it better.

								I am not recommending this game in it's current state, but I am giving it a thumbs up because of its amazing potential. I mean, seriously, if it gets through EA without the devs abandoning it as so many do, gets the updates it needs and is released in a finished, polished state, then this could be an absolutely amazing open world RPG. It has all the elements of the,perfect game; base building, farming, recruiting town/party member then upgrading them, crafting, research, factions, a huge open world, there are many more elements but I didn't intend for this review to be a long one until I put more time into the game .The reasons that I am not recommending this game in its current state are simple.The terrible, seriously flawed control system.The ridiculously bad camera,The awful performance. I have, literally, a top of the range PC, and the FPS still drops to a level where I want to throw my base unit across the room this is ridiculous for a game in late 2016.I appreciate that it is in EA, and the regular updates make me hopeful that the game will get finished. In the meantime, buy it on sale (unless you want to support the devs, which can only be good for the game), or wait until it is rather more polished.			"

								I love this game. I feel like this whole game was made with me in mind specifically. Wasteland, samurai, giant sword fights, building your own town, it's not even finished and yeah it's buggy at times, nothing you can't work around with a little patience though. It reminds me of certain games in a way, but I find this to be pretty unique. I've played a lot of games in my life and nothing was ever really like Kenshi. I HIGHLY recomend it. I have never once reviewed anything ever before. That should show you how much I love Kenshi.			"

								I've been playing Kenshi for the past three years slowly watching the crazy amount of improvement it has underwent. At the beginning I was on the fences with everything due to some bugs and less opportunity for exploration with the old old map.. I recently got back into it and I just CANT stop playing it. The experience that I’ve had with the new map and the whole new system makes adventure 10x more ‘awesome-er’. This RTS/3rd-Person Hybrid, Sandbox, Squad-Based, Adventure-RPG is now a forerunner to a new genre in the RPG world and I’m extremely happy with the progress that Lofi Games has made. IF you want endless adventure, BUY this game so more improvements are made for the Beta!!			"

								Kenshi is still in alpha and full of bugs that crash the game, causes some mechanics not to work, has a single repetetive desert landscape to play on and has only just had basic audio added to the game. Yet i look at the in-depth RPG and realistic combat systems in place and the potentiol of the game even in its current state makes me, for the first time, accept calmly that my game crashes and things don't work, because what does work shows just enough of the great things that are in the future of this title. This may not be a must own just yet, but the odds are stacked in its favour that it will be one day.			"

Which is to be expected from just about anything that's not produced by an established gaming company, Hell, even a lot of those crash. I for one will patiently await the day that this game allows me to play for more than twenty or thirty minutes at a time, as like I say, it has a lot of potential.			"

								Kenshi is an amazing game. You don't start out as some chosen one who can instantly take on an army of guys who have the best weapons in the game with their bare hands, you don't start out as someone who can build a city and have hundreds of people traveling through, you don't start as someone who has lots of money and can buy everything, in Kenshi. You start as a nobody. To even think about beating the weakest enemy you will face in a fight you will have to hire another person to join you, and then train on some dummies for a couple of days, and you'll still probably lose and have to limp back to a hospital bed. 10/10 would get captured by cannibals again.P.SWhile this game is absolutely amazing, please keep in mind this game has been in development for years and it will not be finished any time soon. The developer of this game is basically creating this on his own. although i do believe he has hired outside help. Plus, he's called Captain Deathbeard. give him your money already. check his steam page  HERE.			"

								Although Kenshi is a bit buggy (pathing & structures) I have found it to be a very satisfing combination of simulation/rpg/tower defense games.  I do enjoy aquiring new followers and ""training"" them to fit my overall strategy.  The open-world aspect fits really well giving you the freedom to play any way you desire.  So far I havent dealt with many aspects of the game, like faction reputation, but I do look forward to exploring them and new updates as they are released.  So far it has surpassed my expectations making it a fine investment for $20.			"

Focused on squad or team members, you create your own town/village and try to excel in the wild lands. Bandits will attack occasionally and you'll have to move your goods to market to make profit. Overall, a fun game and will be even better if final version in the future brings the full integrity of the game to light.			"

By the time I wrote this reviewed I already spent 30 hours, yet I only discovered a very small part of the game. Do you know that the game has not been fully mapped  despite being there for more than a years?? People has only been seeing the west side of the map, and only the northern part.

Went to internet for bandit locations all to found out the whole area was yet to be mapped, and so the whole east side. You might be that one hero who brave enough for unknown frontier.			"

								It's half finished, buggy and incredibly fun if you're into the RPG/simulator/strategy genre. It reminds me quite a bit of The Guild 2 (also sold here on Steam). It's a bit unstable. I crash about every 2-3 hoursI made character, picked the origin where you start with a broken arm and a stick in the middle of nowhere. I was the gimpies gimp that have ever gimped. Knowing what to expect from reading other reviews I looked at my map and headed for the nearest town. As expected my crippled self attracted the attention of some bandits on the way. Knowing that fighting them would be brief and pointless I just kept running (bravely) away. Made it to a town and hid. The town guards dispatched the bandits. When it was safe I sauntered back out and started looting, making several trips to the local shops. After I had confiscated all the bandit possesions and profited I headed to the nearest tavern and recruited some backup. I could now confiscate things twice as fast! And that's pretty much how things went for a while. Traveling from town to town, luring bandits along into town guard ambushes, recruiting more and more people. Invested in some backpacks. I even started getting a little bolder and would help the townguards with dispatching these outlaws. My people would get hurt and sometimes even knocked out but I always made sure everyone had first aid kits on them, ready to patch a fallen friend up.  Before I knew it I was leading a group of 20 people, 18 females and 2 males (amazons!),  and we could actually kill single groups of bandits alone without the help of town guards.  It was time to build an outpost!Outpost life is hard. Not a day goes by without getting hassled by bandits, ninjas or cannibals. It didn't take long before I decided to pay the Dust Bandit faction off to leave me alone. One payment and they havent bothered me since. That cut the constand hassling down to about half and made it manageble. I can usually handle any town ambushes but I do sometimes get overrun and have to make a run for it to the closest town (Brink). But I finally finished the wall surrounding my outpost and my little group gets stronger every day!			"

								I'm writing this during the Alpha 0.62 phase of development. Positives:Self-set goalsInteresting worldEpic mass battlesA wide range of gameplay optionsDetailed battle system and character creationNegatives:Self-set goalsMany bugs (for now)A lot of patience requiredvisually bland environment (endless desert)I got this game as soon as it was released on steam and I can say that it is absolutely fun to play. It has plenty of bugs (for now) and there are many unfinished aspects of the game but that is alright. Whatever this game is lacking right now it makes up for in excess with its gameplay. You do not start strong and there is nothing designed to be ""easy."" In fact, you will get demolished by anybody at the start of the game. The real fun for me came from building up my squad (I started with two characters, i now have 20) creating a town of my own, and then using my expanding reserves of money, skilled fighters, and tradesmen to utterly dominate anyone who crossed my path. Be warned though, because of the nature of this game it takes a LOT of patience. If you are able to strive through that though then it will be both extremely rewarding and enjoyable for you.

								Early Access so far and it is quite interesting. Though character development becomes ruled out after you get to the gist of the game, it is still a unique game. Focused on squad or team members, you create your own town/village and try to excel in the wild lands. Bandits will attack occasionally and you'll have to move your goods to market to make profit. Overall, a fun game and will be even better if final version in the future brings the full integrity of the game to light.			"

								It's half finished, buggy and incredibly fun if you're into the RPG/simulator/strategy genre. It reminds me quite a bit of The Guild 2 (also sold here on Steam). It's a bit unstable. I crash about every 2-3 hoursI made character, picked the origin where you start with a broken arm and a stick in the middle of nowhere. I was the gimpies gimp that have ever gimped. Knowing what to expect from reading other reviews I looked at my map and headed for the nearest town. As expected my crippled self attracted the attention of some bandits on the way. Knowing that fighting them would be brief and pointless I just kept running (bravely) away. Made it to a town and hid. The town guards dispatched the bandits. When it was safe I sauntered back out and started looting, making several trips to the local shops. After I had confiscated all the bandit possesions and profited I headed to the nearest tavern and recruited some backup. I could now confiscate things twice as fast! And that's pretty much how things went for a while. Traveling from town to town, luring bandits along into town guard ambushes, recruiting more and more people. Invested in some backpacks. I even started getting a little bolder and would help the townguards with dispatching these outlaws. My people would get hurt and sometimes even knocked out but I always made sure everyone had first aid kits on them, ready to patch a fallen friend up.  Before I knew it I was leading a group of 20 people, 18 females and 2 males (amazons!),  and we could actually kill single groups of bandits alone without the help of town guards.  It was time to build an outpost!Outpost life is hard. Not a day goes by without getting hassled by bandits, ninjas or cannibals. It didn't take long before I decided to pay the Dust Bandit faction off to leave me alone. One payment and they havent bothered me since. That cut the constand hassling down to about half and made it manageble. I can usually handle any town ambushes but I do sometimes get overrun and have to make a run for it to the closest town (Brink). But I finally finished the wall surrounding my outpost and my little group gets stronger every day!			"

Watch as your helpless comrades are beaten and robbed by men with loincloths and iron bars. Watch as evil wolf things sniff out your bleeding body and chomp on you as you try and crawl back to your base. Watch as a larger pack arrives and starts attacking the original pack. Wait for an oppening to send some guys in to help your unconious, bleeding squad. Watch as they too are turned into human chew toys. Watch as even larger animal things show up to the fight. Watch as your guys grab the fallen and get out of the fray. Then watch as the same guys with loincloths come back and beat you up again. 11/10			"

								I'm changing my review from a negative one to a positive one. There's just too much potential and fun in this game to hate on it. It has camera control issues, lag, and sometimes incredibly frustrating pathing issues, but I found that cranking down the graphics settings helped with some of those problems. With a great mod that increased the population limit and squad size, I've been having a lot of fun establishing bases and sending out parties to explore. If this game ever reaches completion (the full map accessible, some of the mechanics fixed - i.e. kidnapping/stealth kill which doesn't seem to work) this game will be incredible. In my opinion it's a better Fallout than Fallout - if you don't mind some beta flaws.Holy ♥♥♥♥ the pathing issues tho - those seriously need to be fixed.			"

								The team working on this game have managed to create a wild, chaotic, dark, scary, fascinating world which has so many possibilities. This is my first review ever and I've played many games over decades but never felt compelled to write one. I am so excited to see how the full game ends up but I'm in no hurry at all, it's already amazing and unlike anything I have ever played before. It has a replayability factor I havn't felt for a long time, probably since diablo 2. It's scope is pretty groundbreaking. The fact that you don't die outright every time you are attacked is very refreshing and makes for some vey interesting/scary scenario's where members of your squad play dead until you are ready to heal the group. There are many layers to reveal in this game and there are more to come. I want to see it realised to it's full potential, whats the rush ? It's an rpg where you can build bases to eventually become towns, buy houses in towns, trade, craft weapons armor plus pretty much everything, stealing, many many many factions and a sexy roadmap. If you like rpg's, this is a champion, give it a go.			"

								Early 2013 review: Get it, you wont regret it. Takes around 2-3 hours to really get a feel for the game. After that, it is all gravy. At the moment, there is no audio, but don't let that hold you back. Just thow on some good jams and start forging your name in this great title.Early 2017 review: It's been nearly 4 years to the date since I first review this. Kenshi has came a long way since the early days, mainly the audio. I do miss the desolation of the old map (all desert) compared to the new biome system, though I agree it's ""needed."" Kenshi has easily stolen a spot on my list of top 5 games since I've been gaming on the Sega Gen. It has a long way to go, but what's currently here is more than enough for me to be satisfied.			"

								I love this game. I will in detial describe the good and the bad. But in my opinion the good FAR outweighs the bad here!First off the bad:Sometimes the ai gets stuck. Yes sometimes the ai will get stuck running between projects or delivery, towns, buildings or just plain start to stand there. But they know this and are constantly working hard trying to fix and update this.Sometimes buildings get a little buggy with placement of walls or and other ""Shell building.""Wall placement is a little... off... to be nice, sometimes bandits will walk right through/under a wall and attack you leaving you shaking your head after you kill them and figure out where in the world they came from!? They had no shovels on them so... there's that.Graphics are a slight eh. They are updating these as they have just switched to a x64 bit engine. (Yes they are still keeping x86 and DX9 so no worries about specs there)there are a few more oddities in this game, but those are the biggest.Next are my favorite things about this game:It lets you create your OWN tale! Whether you and your band of nomads roam place to place conquering and killing everything, which I might add, is harder than you think! Or perhaps a peaceful trader just trying to make an honest living out of your hard work, or otherwise ill gotten gains. But maybe, just maybe you are the daring settlers off to make your own mark on the world, or what's left of it, by building yourself a nice and cozy town amongst the barren wastes.Maybe become the dreaded sand ninjas/samurai/drifters/assassins of lore!!!You can create or destroy in life as in this game, the options are limitless... well as limited to your imagination and what the game has so far.In the future they will be adding slavery, ranged combat, robotics, new lands, and it all makes me excited just thinking of the new tales and stories to be had!In the end, I rate this 8.3/10 so far, and I am expecting a 87/100 finished. I set my expectations low as not to be dissapointed. Hope this helps!!!!			"

After much looting I thought it would be a nice time to leave my safety net... I built a small shack, and was loving it, then a evil gang of sand ninjas circled around my shack. The leader emerged yelling ""Oi! Come out 'ere pansy"". So I complied with the bandits. I walked out there and they offered to be best friends for the ""small"" price of 2,000 cats. Being the poorfag that bark was, had to decline. They enclosed me, and beat me into a small coma. They lingred there until I woke up and finished the job, and left me out in the desert to die.

								I'm writing this during the Alpha 0.62 phase of development. Positives:Self-set goalsInteresting worldEpic mass battlesA wide range of gameplay optionsDetailed battle system and character creationNegatives:Self-set goalsMany bugs (for now)A lot of patience requiredvisually bland environment (endless desert)I got this game as soon as it was released on steam and I can say that it is absolutely fun to play. It has plenty of bugs (for now) and there are many unfinished aspects of the game but that is alright. Whatever this game is lacking right now it makes up for in excess with its gameplay. You do not start strong and there is nothing designed to be ""easy."" In fact, you will get demolished by anybody at the start of the game. The real fun for me came from building up my squad (I started with two characters, i now have 20) creating a town of my own, and then using my expanding reserves of money, skilled fighters, and tradesmen to utterly dominate anyone who crossed my path. Be warned though, because of the nature of this game it takes a LOT of patience. If you are able to strive through that though then it will be both extremely rewarding and enjoyable for you. I expect many great things as time goes on and can't wait to see the new game dynamics which will make this even better in the future.			"

								Epic, fun, impressive, and ready to play now.If you like free-roaming sandbox games with no level scaling and tons of base building options and exploration then this game is a must buy. There are no other games remotely like it that i'm aware of.I won't go into all the features but this game is rich and ready to play.  There are some large updates coming up so you can either resume playing or import everything into the new version depending if the update requires a new game.  Very impressed with being able to do the latter.Some other random good stuff:- The world seems plausible instead of a theme park like other games.- The dialogue is pretty good and funny.- You can fully automate your workers in your base(s) while you devote full-time to your exploration squad.- It's very challenging at first, it's fun getting past that hump and becoming strong.- Location damage is really cool, for instance if someone takes a hard blow to the stomach then they will be pressing on it with one of their hands until it's healed.- Combat is fun to watch as it's physics based animations.  If a blow is landed then you'll actually see the animation connect.- If you see something in a store inventory, then it's also stored somewhere in the shop physically that you can steal.Things I'd like to see:- Multi-threading and performance (coming very soon I believe)- Further help screens explaining some more of the game mechanics (how armor stacking works, damage reduction, etc.)- Audio improvements, especially combat- More of the map available- Notifications, for instance when one of your crafters's queue is empty and is idle.- Able to add notes to the world map- Underground structures to explore.  Like dungeons.- Traveling trader caravans.			"

								oh my goosy moos this game is an endless sweet cake with the cherry on its head missing.this game is for everyone who loves endless sandbox gaming, a kinda post-apocalyptic world, rpgs, tycoonish management, craft and building things.+ not many bugs i encountered, I had one freeze and a certain group of paladins stuck in one area.+ even if the fights are mostly automatic, its always fun to watch getting your♥♥♥♥♥beaten+ style and art feels slick+ no crude hp bar, everyone has different bars how high the damage on your body parts are and combined with bloodloss gives you different ways how(long) are you knocked out and die.+ crafting is super fun, you can build your own base(s) and you can spend a lot of time+ gave me a lot of chuckles+ every success (mostly in battles) feels great in the hard environment+ I personally like the graphic, even if the shadows in some parts are kinda ♥♥♥♥ed up+ different choices how to start your game (be a starving injured poor guy, king , start with an legendary weapon and so on)+ sweet feature to queue tasks order to automate processes (like crafting, farming, etc)+ different races with differencies+ permadeath, which is not that easy to happen, since you a lot of factors need to happen~ optimisation, many slowdowns when shadows are activated in some parts, annihilating a lot of ram. but its already playable aside that~ AI behaving is mostly good, but some groups stuck in a certain area- the map is not comeplety accessable- its annoying when you cant click on certain areas, even if your group can walk through it (like up/downhills)- body parts are not able to chop off- would like to see some blood or gore- no gay marriage- would like to see more content and richness in overall ( but it its early access, so no drama)my conclusion: already a playable game, were you have enough content to waste a lot of time and having fun lying half dead on the ground			"

								Beta 0.92~ UPDATE for 0.94- With the new engine upgrade performace is increased and the map is now very large. A great addition to content too.I've been following Kenshi for quite a while and put a fair amount of time into the different aspects of the game. But by far the best parts are the style and music. I cannot find anything quite like kenshi on steam and it makes it a pleasure to enjoy.This is not a fast game. This is not an easy game. It is deep, beautiful, challenging and full of promise.It has been in development for a long time and there was a period when the engine was being overhauled that it seemed to have died. However it is back on track and the updates are coming fast.If you have been considering this game at all, with the inclusion of workshop support, then now is the time to give it a try. It's only getting better!			"

								Kenshi takes the base building features of an RTS, straps RPG stats to your ""units"", and sets you in a world where everything is trying to kill you. Watch as your helpless comrades are beaten and robbed by men with loincloths and iron bars. Watch as evil wolf things sniff out your bleeding body and chomp on you as you try and crawl back to your base. Watch as a larger pack arrives and starts attacking the original pack. Wait for an oppening to send some guys in to help your unconious, bleeding squad. Watch as they too are turned into human chew toys. Watch as even larger animal things show up to the fight. Watch as your guys grab the fallen and get out of the fray. Then watch as the same guys with loincloths come back and beat you up again. 11/10			"

								Well worth the money. It's a great game for the price it's at, there are games that currently are out and ""AAA"" that arn't nearly as fun as this (i'm looking at you skyrim!) Yes, this is still early access, but it's decently stable with the odd crash here or there unless you opt into the experimental version. And if it doesn't look like it's that intresting now, check back in later down the line and see what else has been added, you might be surprised.Edit for 0.95.5: The game is coming along very well and recently has added unarmed combat and the dodge skill into the game. Now you too can live out your fantasy of being a hyper aggresive Saitama and devestate entire cities.			"

								This is a very in depth, fun game. You travel the world, recruiting other people to help you in your adventure. It's difficult to survive. I've been killed countless times because I enter a wrong building. Once you get set up and establish a decent sized village, the game gets a little easier. It's still being developed. I enjoy it so far. The difficulty makes it an enjoyable experience once you start to build a community. You have to research everything, practice skills for tremendous amounts of time and then hope you don't get mauled by some ridiculous creature while exploring and trying to expand your knowledge/resources/skill set.I would buy this game again without hesitation. I reccomend it for anyone who enjoys challenging RPG style gameplay in an enormous open world.			"

 Kenshi: a promising gameI'm totally in to sandbox games so this game caught my eye. Interesting design and even is its in development stage very nice to play. It has a big map to play on even if only a part of the world are released in this early access.The game is promising in early and late game stages. Early on its hard to get money and you relay feel ousted by the societies. Late game has endless possibilities if you want to go to war on parts of the world you hate or be more friendly to allies in other part of the Kenshi world. There is lots of factions and some of them can even be a bit wild and eat you if you don't be careful....insert more ....			"

It was like my dream RPG and strategy combo. But as years went by and I randomly decided to check in on it, I was extremely impressed. My computer could run it smooth and I started playing the hell out of it. And then, not too long later, 0.90 came out and it was like playing a whole new game altogether.

								While early access and open world sandbox are two words which usually bring forth any reaction from \""this has potential\"" to \""i would rather cut off my arm with a rusty spoon than play this game for another minute\"" but personally i think it\'s on the good end of the spectrum.Firstly, the game is as previously stated, an open world sandbox, but with a nice twist, as opposed to the usual solitary experience were you craft, build and improve all by yourself, this game encourages you to recruit other npcs to be controlled by you. And by \""encourage\"" i mean it in the same way disease encourages you to go see a doctor, while not always necessary, it\'s still the best course of action, mostly because your new \""hero\"" is as much of a hero as the crack addict that lives next door to meThe gameplay is quite nice, they call the fighting is squad based, meaning you will be fighting with a group, against a group, a big part of combat is also the standard gear and their bonuses, but they also have a skill system, were the skills become better the more your people use them, and some gear gives negative stat bonuses, which means that heavier armor is quite balanced.You can build too! You can start your own town (though i don\'t think you can get any \""normal\"" citizens) were you can craft several houses and a ton of machines that do stuff for example, you can make a blacksmith, weaver, chainmaking station etc. you can also farm within your town, which is done by building the respective farm building, for example a wheat farm, then employing one of your guys to work there, but before you can build any of those you need to research them, which you slowly do by making the highest level research bench you can and staffing a person there.A lot of people tell me to judge early access games by their current state, and not their potential, and while i somewhat agree, i don\'t even need to judge it by it\'s potential to tell you this game is great, even in it\'s current state.The main problem with the game is simple, a lot of bugs, but however it doesn\'t crash too frequently, except when you mess about in the settings too much, and sometimes buildings lose their textures and get a placeholder one, and sometimes the npcs get stuck not doing anything.But despite all that, i would recommend this game to anybody who likes open world sandboxes and a challenge, and don\'t care much for high-rez games and don\'t mind some bugs and crashes			"

								Is suprisingly adictive and highly modable.This game is quite complex and fun and due to it's very nature there is no real end to it.It also comes with a pre-built moding program, that make's it very easy to start modding. Hell, I learnt how to mod from this game. The starts will always be tough but after you have a base built and some decent combat stats, the rest is enjoyment. And agony when it crashes :D			"

								I haven't seen a game with more raw potential  this early since... well, ever. It's already an addicting timesink, and I can only imagine it'll get even better as time goes on. I love the RTS/Open-World RPG hybrid idea. Base building, squad management, character progression, and a huge world full of warring factions. This seems like one of those dream-games that people were trying to build decades ago before the technology existed and the industry got caught up in multimillion dollar AAA ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The aesthetic is wonderful. ""Steampunk Samurai Western."" That is now officially my favorite combination of words.			"

								The game can be described as Skyrim meets town building.I think the beauty of it is probably the early game struggle whether you're playing a single warrior or a weak bunch of settlers... in both experiences you'll only just be barely surviving and it's that edge of your seat moment to moment that makes the game so addicting. Yes in time you will become a master but it does the early game better than other survival rpgs in the genre. You will come to care about your characters if only due to all the extreme close calls you've been through with them.If you can imagine your most ideal open sandbox game lacking only a well written story or deep characters, well that's Kenshi.It does go from being one of the best games I've played to being a painful bug-ridden headache. But the Dev is very active adding a lot of new content quickly and likewise trying to fix bugs just as fast. I have a lot of faith in the Dev and the beautiful game he's creating and know it will be a labor of love that only continues to get better over the years.The highs for me overcome the lows. I'd recommend playing, it will be a game you remember fondly for a long time to come - provided you're lucky enough to have your first playthrough be a stable experience :)			"

								I Love the idea of this game and have put about 90 hours into it.  I believe in being honest so here is the good and the bad.First the bad, the game lags quite a bit if you don't lower view distances even with an I7-6900K, 64GB ram, 1080 video card, 3 SSD raid 0.  In other words a pretty decent gaming rig.  In order to get it to a playable state I had to drastically reduce viewing distances, turn off shadows, reflections etc....  I am able to play in the correct resolution for my monitor 3440x1440 but I had to turn most options fairly low before it was in a playable state.  Game is still in Alpha apparently, so may be this will be worked on and get corrected in the future through some sort of optimization.  Now for some of the good things about this game!  Character customization is superb, you can drastically change the way your toon looks when getting setup.  The devs have made massive updates to the game content wise since I first started playing it.  The game world looks substantially better than it used too in almost every single way imaginable.  I am not saying the graphics are F'ing amazing or something but they have improved and the world is not nearly as boring as it once was visually.Long story short it is a good indie title and definitely enjoyable if you have some patience.  Just remember your character sucks badly when you start and your best bet is running from danger to begin with.  You characters improve steadily through harvesting, fighting, running, carrying heavy objects, manufacturing etc... etc... if you like the idea of a squad based sandbox game with no real end game goal this could help you kill many an hour of boredom.

								If you are looking for a game you can casually play for a few hours and be done with it, you should not buy Kenshi. This game takes a lot of time to get almost anything done. The huge world alone (and not even all of it is playable at this point) takes hours to explore, especially if you dont want your characters to starve on the way. The different zones make the world feel interesting enough, even though there are a lot of huge open spaces (perfectly suited to start a base).There are a lot of different ways you can play this game:Build a base with everything you need protected by a huge wall strong enough to withstand groups of raiders... orGather a few capable fighters to pillage camps, raider groups and whole cities if you are up to it... orMove swiftly in the shadows while you steal the most expensive goods to sell in another city where nobody knows (or cares) that the goods were stolen in the first place.But no matter what you do, be prepared to lose fights and almost get killed or enslaved over and over again, until you are an experienced survivor, because the start is very rough and the first few hours you will probably barely hang on to your life. But keep going, because once your stats allow you to withstand a proper fight, it will be so rewarding to pay back the beating.All in all this game has already very deep and intriguing mechanics and no matter what play style you choose, there is enough content to keep you busy for days. The development seems slow at first, but whenever there is a content update, it is usually pretty profound. The game is still a little glitchy, but there have been big improvements over the last year, so apart from occasional reloading, the bugs are not really much of a problem anymore.			"

								I just want to say that this game is pretty incredible for what it's worth. Even though it's early access and still bug riddled, the devs are still putting out updates so it's not like a Stomping Lands kind of deal.The soundtrack is probably my favorite part of it. Beign a video game design student that is focusing on audio and visuals, the soundtrack sets the tone and just gives me chills. I would very much like to meet the head of the sound department for this. Gameplay reminds me of Baldur's Gate in a sense, with the stop starting squad movements.Overall, quite an amazing game well worth its price. I would very much like to see what the devs come out with next. 5/7			"

								I remember seeing this game a couple years ago and being genuinely interested. I had a He-Man Lunchbox for a rig back then, so I figured it wouldn't run and held off on the purchase. Fast forward to my current rig, and now I still can't run it at max. But even with choppy frames it held my interest.The open world of Kenshi gives you an interesting post-post-apocalyptic backdrop where death is a constant threat, but survival is rewarded. Next to nothing remains of the old world, and there's been too many generations since for anyone to remember it or even know about it. The desert sands have left only unrecognisable hulking metal structures for scavengers to gather scrap iron, and the technologies of the past are only hinted about in tattered books that are sold at high prices. A fanatical religion dabbling in feudalism controls most cities and outposts, but searching beyond their military's grasp will find you in stranger places and their people, where you might find reward or a desolate death.In Kenshi, the player's role in the world is never specified. Your actions are completely free to you, but the world does react to them. What sets it apart from other sandbox is that NPC's can perform the same actions as you. Bandits will loot you after knocking you out, and factions may send trader's if your shop interests them. When you're researching walls and farming techniques, NPC outposts are studying the same, if not better, technologies. The Kenshi world is truly large, and set to be even bigger with future updates. There's nothing else really like Kenshi in similar genre's, and it's a truly ambitious idea. Only regret is not buying it earlier.			"

								My take on Kenshi is a mixed bag.  Bottom line is I love the game but it's horrendously buggy and development is extremely slow.They bill it as an RPG with RTS elements, but it doesn't play that way for me.  I see it more as an RTS with RPG elements.  You scavenge materials, build a base, train recruits and laborers and defend or go on the aggressive.  It reminds me a bit of Earth 2150 in how each unit can earn experience and lvl up (the RPG aspects) while maintaining an RTS-like squad-focused feel.It's a lot of fun training your troops and building your town up.  But the bugs, oh my.  If you play the ""stable"" release, expect to crash randomly every hour or so like clockwork.  I honestly had better stability with the ""experimental"" opt-in steam beta branch, however some friends with similar rigs say they can't play the experimental version at all due to single digit frame-rates (it plays fine for me).  But either way you go, the sad state of pathing AI in this game really kills the joy.  Regular reloads when your own guys get stuck in the landscape and terrain and a constant spectacle of enemy units stuck on hills and corners.   This is by far the worst of the bugs, but there are lots of others.I really like the game and think it has awesome potential, but the state of development and the persistence of bugs through so many releases really has me discouraged.If you managed to pick it up on sale like I did and don't mind risking a small investment on a game with great potential, then go for it.  If you aren't willing to throw money at a project that may never be completed and has too many bugs to enjoy for any length of time in it's current state, then I suggest you wait and see what happens.  For me, I'd do it again.  I knew what I was getting into and the sale price of $10 makes it an acceptable risk.			"

Kenshi is really shaping up to be a really good game, and I'm very impressed by the tenacity displayed by Lo-Fi Games (the devs). Whereas the game used to be ""a mile wide and an inch deep,"" now there's actual substance to the game as well. I look forward to being able to write a more complete review once a full release comes out (Kenshi is in 0.95 as I write this). Keep up the good work, guys!			"

								A realy great game and worth a buy even in its early access state..An rts/rp/sim/ninja/running/headf**k of a city building style game with alot more..Im not gonna get into all you can do go look at youtube for that..Great building system.Fresh Training/leveling system (The more you do something the better you get).Large map (All sand but new bios comming soon).Not easy mode, if you want a squad of elite ninjas you will have to train them. rest/house them. keep them alive with medics and craft them gear and weapons.The game will crash .... alot so get used to saving and its not so bad.The ai tends to get stuck, stand around and do strange things but ...ya know early access.You need to put time into this game to get the good so if your looking for an arcade style fighting ..keep looking.But all that said i love this game and if you can look past the early access bugs buy it as its gonna be something unique.

								I've put 300+ hours into this game; and really enjoied it. I've built towns, and found a bunch of bugs, but it is in alpha. I didn't buy it because I thought I would enjoy it, I bought it because I thought it was briliant, and diffrent from other games I've played, and that when finished, it would be a truely great game. The only other games I've put more time into are Fallout 3 & nv, oblivion and skyrim. Kenshi is tough, and unforgiving, and very unkind; but a great challenge if you can manage to survive. the ammount of times my squad has run into multiple battles on the way to another town, and had to run to the gates to just barely escape. Having friends is good, espicially in kenshi.			"

								I absolutely love this game.  I've been following the development of Kenshi for a few years now.  This is truly a hidden gem.  It all started out with one man with a dream and ambition and it turned into a small team with even greater potenial.  This proves that you can do anything if you work hard and strive for it!  Incase people are curious:  There is a demo for this game on Chris's / LofiGames website http://lofigames.com/~Quick Edit~It's indie developer's like this who turn a dream into a reality that make me love gaming and the gaming development community as a whole.

Early Access Review
								While early access and open world sandbox are two words which usually bring forth any reaction from \""this has potential\"" to \""i would rather cut off my arm with a rusty spoon than play this game for another minute\"" but personally i think it\'s on the good end of the spectrum.Firstly, the game is as previously stated, an open world sandbox, but with a nice twist, as opposed to the usual solitary experience were you craft, build and improve all by yourself, this game encourages you to recruit other npcs to be controlled by you. And by \""encourage\"" i mean it in the same way disease encourages you to go see a doctor, while not always necessary, it\'s still the best course of action, mostly because your new \""hero\"" is as much of a hero as the crack addict that lives next door to meThe gameplay is quite nice, they call the fighting is squad based, meaning you will be fighting with a group, against a group, a big part of combat is also the standard gear and their bonuses, but they also have a skill system, were the skills become better the more your people use them, and some gear gives negative stat bonuses, which means that heavier armor is quite balanced.You can build too! You can start your own town (though i don\'t think you can get any \""normal\"" citizens) were you can craft several houses and a ton of machines that do stuff for example, you can make a blacksmith, weaver, chainmaking station etc. you can also farm within your town, which is done by building the respective farm building, for example a wheat farm, then employing one of your guys to work there, but before you can build any of those you need to research them, which you slowly do by making the highest level research bench you can and staffing a person there.A lot of people tell me to judge early access games by their current state, and not their potential, and while i somewhat agree, i don\'t even need to judge it by it\'s potential to tell you this game is great, even in it\'s current state.The main problem with the game is simple, a lot of bugs, but however it doesn\'t crash too frequently, except when you mess about in the settings too much, and sometimes buildings lose their textures and get a placeholder one, and sometimes the npcs get stuck not doing anything.But despite all that, i would recommend this game to anybody who likes open world sandboxes and a challenge, and don\'t care much for high-rez games and don\'t mind some bugs and crashes			"

								So, I've been playing for 20+ hours now and I can Say I love to hate this game.Its a good RPG or Town management game that you have to manage squads, hunger and resources.Only downside, is that there is a tonne of stuff that needs to be fixed.All good games do take that time of course but when you are trying to farm and get raided and crash as it auto saves will drive you mad.Pros: you will lose your squad mates, you will want to build more, you have the freedom to mod the game for your self. BUGS THAT CAN KILL YOU, and holy arsehats they hate anything non-humanCons: the game is still being made, it doesn't run smoothy at first but does after a while. FPS drops alot in new areas. BUGS THAT WILL KILL YOUR COMPUTER, and lack of playable races(without you adjusting some stuff in the game editor)It has a lot of content, Its a solid game, needs alot of work but I think it will be worth it in the end. Limit your self in this game to see if you can do well. And have fun waiting for your guys to heal in cages. "

								First of all, my playtime is not accurate as I bought Kenshi well before it was available on Steam. Just want to add my thoughts about the dev cycle of this game. I rarely buy games before their full release given the risks of doing so. In the past years I have seen the dev team for this game go from basically one person's passion project to something more likely to be able to provide the grand vision the dev has. I have to say I have been impressed with this dev's committment to this title, even after making a good deal of pre-order/beta sales over the years. Integrity is important, and in my view this dev has done a good job working consistently to live up to his promises during this time. If watching a passion project game slowly grow is something you can be patient and handle, Kenshi is worth the ask price.tl;dr I do not regret buying this title years ago pre-steam. Would buy again.

I wasn't disappointed. Even with the alpha glitches this game is great fun, and with upcoming features and more polish I can see myself being sucked in for many more hours.The way the skill system works is great, it's a style you don't see very often anymore. You want to get faster, run. You want to get stronger, carry heavy things. You want to get tougher, get hit in the face with a brick.I will continue to play this in it's alpha state and look forward to each upcoming patch.			"

								If you liked M&B you will love this. Bear in mind that being in alpha state the game has some issues like glitching, AI pathing conundrum, and squad members randomly forgeting what jobs you have assigned them. Apart from that the absolute freedom of gameplay is there. The grind to level up your skills is substantial as well but then again you feel a certain satisfaction when you hit that coveted threshold. I am looking forward to seeing this game bloom into its final release version.			"

								Update 2/20/2016:This has been a LONG time in the making, but the game has progressed nicely. Content is always coming and the game is looking amazing. The struggle to survive is real. Now with food and water being an issue, it's not quite so simple as scavenge what you can to sell and get better weapons and armor. Nope, now it's actually more surviving. Great game if you are looking something more realistic in terms of survival as in most things can kill you, and if it doesn't, it give you a broken arm/leg making the next thing so much more likely to. Highly recomended. This is a very cool and HARD realistic type game... which makes it AWESOME!!! Definately recommended!			"

								A one of it's kind genre of a game. Open World RTS RPG ect ect. The work on the game is quite fast (considering the features added all the time) and was slowed down by a huge amount of work on Pathfinding, which is finally done. In the meantime, they've been adding animals, random insult generator, and all sorts of fun stuff to their dev build in preparation for the finished pathfinding. I found the game fun back in the earliest stages of alpha, without sound, great graphics, or any polish at all. It was buggy but fun then, now the bugs are fewer and the fun is far greater.The limitations for the game are slowly getting reversed, and the game is becoming more grand by the day, with lots of dev updates and supports. The community is still small, meaning it's a lot easier to get a message across to the devs if you are feeling concerned. Overall, this is my all time favorite strategy game, start the game with a stick and become a martial arts master who runs a fortress with well armed squad of companions who tear up all sorts of bandit life in the wastelands.The game is great, but it's only gonna get better from here!

								This game. Its worth the investment people, even if the develpoment process is a bit slow. The game filled the part of my soul that yearned for freedom within a game. Ive put in a decent amount of time and tried a few different playstyles. This game is definitely meant to be played as a team based rts, but my favorite style is to go for the one man army. Picking fights, losing misertably, watching your bruised and battered swordsman crawl back from the brink of death...nothing tops it. 11/10 would brutalize my character again. thank you lo-fi games			"

								 Kenshi deserves your money. Not only does the store page entice buyers, but it seems that the devs are actively listening to their buyers and are updating the game on a semi-regular basis. I owned this game when all I had to work with was a barely functional ""promise"" that, for the most part, held up and made an enjoyable ""God game"". Now the 'one-man' dev team has escalated into an actual team, there is actual music and sound, base defense, talk of a stealth/interogation mechanic, and wild animals! This is more than I asked for and I thank the devs personally for making this game and continuing to improve upon it.			"

								Kenshi is a game that i have always loved because of how harsh it is, in other games like this you can destroy bandits and other enemys easily. But in this if you go out and try to fight bandits you will die, and fast too.its a game where it doesnt have to be about combat either, yuo could be a farmer, shopkeeper, bandit, trader and many more occupations. i dont have many hours on kenshi but i do plan on playing more and i think it was worth investing my money in.

								my my where to begin... this game is over 9000% early access (strange bugs, horrible pathfinding, very little variety in anything, very few updates, so many unexplained crashes) and yet... it appeals to me like very few other games have. i mean when you first jump in the game is hard as diamond and as rough as sharks skin and more brutal than dark souls but i think it really sets the mood.the game takes place on some sort of desert planet full of bandit groups, thugs for higher and shabby towns. its survival of the fittest and you better hope you and your crew are fit to survive.Pros:-completely open ended gameplay (you want to murder and cage every npc in a particular town? if your characters are strong enough then by all means!)-super in depth damage system (some bandit breaks both your legs? prepare to crawl on home boy, and pray that you don't lose em!)-build your own town/outpost (for training, crafting, and trading)-lots of crafting to be done-super in depth character creation (can also be used on newly recruited characters)-indication on the hud on who is being aggroed allows the easy snapping to any battle situation no matter what you are doing with verry little load time (like if you have 3 units running weapons to a nearby town for trading when suddenly a group of bandits shows up to your town)cons:-some structures can not be deleted-its not entirely clear whether or not your machines are not working because you don't have any power or they are full of junk at first glance-some of the UI is cut off-fast forward not fast enough (i don't want to watch my guy with broken legs carrying tons of stuff and an unconscious ally inch along the barren desert for hours looking for a town with a bed)-beds are easily exploitable     -if you have no cash or the bed is not public you can just pick someone up and lay them on the bed and it just works        -you can place NPCs with bounties who are ""dying"" in beds to prevent them from kicking the bucket and as an added bonus they also won't take any♥♥♥♥♥♥from guards who will be aggroed on them until they are removed from the bed(s)-very peculiar bugs (one that comes to mind is my armor smith somehow getting a stack of 40000 iron plates and another stack of the same size in the container i was keeping them in when he only had time to make 40 or so of them and his AI constantly taking way more that the armor making station can hold and stopping work on armor production as a result)-SUPER ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PATHFINDING!- one of the towns has 2 gates however one of them is blocked by a poorly made hill or something and the pathfinding dictates that they exit the other gate and go all the way around the outer town wall just to get to where they are going.-super steep learning curve-amazingly slow pace-HaVOK physics engine makes ragdolls look silly (even the dev made fun of it on twitter)-strange bugs with carrying people some distance and later dropping them-job allocation not clear enough (and for the longest time i didn't even know it was a thing making for a lot of tedious micro management)if you don't mind bugs and don't have interest in any finished games at the moment: get itif you do mind bugs or are looking at other games that are complete: go get those other games! its early access (at the time of writing this its actually in alpha) its not done and many of the cons i listed may be fixed by the time it actually comes out. so for you guys i would just wait until then.

								I have played over 40 hours and so far I had a nice ride. Here´s my review:good graphics and setup. the character design and customization is neat, although I played zoomed out most of the time anyways. nice ideas and gameplay when it comes to base building and crafting. pretty good production chains. very nice concepts in this game. I love the post-apocalyptic-style of world design. atmoshpere-wise this really stand out.BUT... and there´s always a but it seems:( i know it´s early access , I get it. I never expected a finished game. it´s not that I bught it without having experience with other EA titles.)1. core mechanics not working or not working consistently enoughthis one is my main concern. workers forget their jobs, which means you end up a lot of micromanaging individual group members. also pathfinding and collision is a mess sometimes. even the workaround (which are offered, that´s a plus) don´t work consistently2. slow development cycles. the game is in development, which is nice. but so far I have experienced only one real update. the devs are in contact with the playersm which is nice. but I wonder how this game will ever pick up some momentum and gain some ground. basically from my standpoint, i couldn´t care less about great char graphics and player customization... thats all icing on the cake once its baked and finished to eat. but pathing, collision and AI behaviour is so essential for this kind of game that it needs to get taken care of asap. and when  Í read on the forums that some core game bugs are dependent on the actual game engine chosen for the game, I am prone to believe that maybe the have chosen the wrong engine....its been a good expense/reward scenario for me. I don´t mind spending the money as the time I played was great. but there´s no poin fo rme in keeping playing right now, because of the points mentioned before. keep in mind: it´s early access. so if you want to support the game and idea behind it (like I wanted to):buy it. its a good investment as the game itself will be sweet once it´s far more advanced. whenever that might be though...

Early Access Review
								Update 10/07/15Kenshi has gone through a massive bug bash and is now far more playable than ever before. It is still missing the complete world map and still needs more content, but the majority of the bugs i mentioned in my review are now squashed! Kenshi has all the potential to be a great game, possibly even Warband great.At the moment it is fun but with no real longevity and a lot of bugs. This is to be expected in any Early Access game and as more content is added and the bugs are slowly squashed the game will only get better.Pros* A different play style - the world is cruel and you are but a grape waiting to be stamped on. (being beaten to a pulp by a group of starving homeless people with sticks, wearing pajamas is a cruel start to any game.)* Excellent damage system - limb damage and animations.* Base building (leads to CTD's at the moment but you can still experiment.)* The beginnings of an economy, with many items to purchase, craft and sell. (selling is a little bugged and not fully implemented yet.)* Open sandbox world - with the promise of many more biomes to come (currently there is only one flavor, desert!)Cons* Bugs glorious bugs! - CTD's every hour or so in the stable version, less to none with experimental, but a boat load of others such as NPC's getting stuck everywhere.* Without quests, faction relations and other planned features the game can get a little repetitive after 4-6hrs. (you will need to create your own adventure.)* Thrown in at the deep end - steep learning curve (can also be seen as a pro!)* Slow developmentMy main issue with Kenshi, and i believe the only reason you should not buy it if you like this type of game is the slow development speed. I cope with this because i really do believe in the devs and understand that this was a 1 man show for a long time and that this is their 1st project together. Everyone has to start somewhere! But because of this big bugs, such as the memory leaks and pathfinding are taking a long time to squash!So, should you buy Kenshi? If you like open world RPG squad management games... then it all depends how patient you are..... if you are not, then i would wait, there is an option on the Kenshi website to receive an email when the game is fully released.

								I'll write a short tale on how I became Hitler of Kenshi, the human experimenter.My journey began in wanting to be the world's greatest swordsman. So naturally I studied how to increase my combat skills. It says in the description of leveling up your combat skills, such as katana, dexterity, offense, and defence to fight stronger opponents than you in order to gain a bonus in leveling them. But, the obvious problem to that is when fighting stronger opponents you run a very high risk of dying. So I took on a passive approach. In the beginning I aggroed stronger mobs into friendly cities in order to maybe get a hit in between the crossfire. After the fighting was over I looted and bandaged the mob. Then I realised something, if the mob were not armed (because I looted them) they cannot fight back. Thus I learned a faster method to grinding my skills. Every once in a while I would get hurt so I ran to the local inn and rested my injuries. There I wondered, if I can rest my body faster this way, can I rest the bad guy's bodies? Of course I can. So I started making a human farm of looted enemies where I would beat them to unconsciousness, put them on a bed, then beat them to unconsciousness when they got better. But, the story doesn't end here. Later when I was building my village I noticed I can construct prison cages. What originally started out as a simple outpost for researching weapon crafting, turned into a human livestock factory of caged samurais and holy paladins where they would be beaten to unconsciousness every momment they are awake.tldr: I made a post-apocalyptic japanese concentration camp.9/10 (1- for the damn glitches, go finish the game)			"

KenshiI will start by giving a brief history of my experience with Kenshi....When I first seen this game I was ecstatic, I felt like finally an rpg like sandbox/simulation game was being developed that had a theme which I found fitting and unique. It came across as something being built upon and in a very ambitious manner. When I first jumped in kenshi I did not have much to work with other than running from town to town across this expansive desert or farming hemp. NPCs were pretty rare at this point and it did not matter much to me. I still found myself running around aimlessly, having fun just imaging what this game can eventually turn out to be. I truly believe this game has nigh endless possibility for the fans out there of this style of game play.I have to say all in all this game is pretty self explanatory from the trailer. You can choose several starts for your character, all of which give you a different style of game play starting from a solo rp play style to a squad based one. (you can start with 1 pc or 5, you can start as a trader or retired soldier) When you get in after creating your PC you are given a rough ui with all the controls laid out in a help screen. Forewarning this is not a walk in the park, expect your survivability to be low especially when picking a tougher starting.However, regardless of what start you end up picking you will most likly be forced to do a few monotonous things to survive. Such as having hostile npcs chase you into town, staying alive while the guards kill said hostile npcs and then looting/selling the gear you recover from them. Admittedly this is an issue, one I see being resolved as the skill and stat system is fleshed out more. Albeit I feel as of right now, in the stage this game is currently in (alpha) it would not appeal to someone lacking the needed patience or interest in Kenshi's development. IMO - I am willing to wait as long as it takes to see this game reach it's full potential. A project of this magnitude takes time, and I hope the devs keep updating it with the slow and steady approach. This means working updates that actually change major aspects of the games mechanics, graphics, ai, landscapes...I think I have seen these guys rework or update about almost everything this game has to offer since initial release.  UpdatesIf you have any doubts about this game seeing updates, I would ask you to consider the following. I have been following Kenshi closely for some time and the developers are making a fantastic effort with updates. I have about 60 hrs so far putting in a few every other week since initial release. I can say the changes this game has undergone is tremendous. Here you can find any info regarding updates and the roadmap[www.lofigames.com]Be patient and take solace in knowing you will be supporting something that does take great effort to create. The team for Kenshi is not all that lucrative afaik and the amount of work I personally have seen put in at this stage is well worth the current price tag. Pros vs Cons(All subject to personal preference)  Pros Cons   Price Tag Very Long Devel Stages   Endless Possibility/Modding Support A lot of monotony in this stage/Very Long Devel Stages   Major bugs are hot fixed fast You Can Find A lot of bugs   Time Consuming Time Consuming Short of the developers studio being swallowed whole by the earth itself or losing all funding...I don't see this one not living up to it's potential. With the extent of this games mechanics and the capability of a modding community, the sky is the limit for this one. Another game that will surely, one day become a classic among the host of others.Recommended "

Early Access Review
								So what is kenshi? Well, it is a sandbox RPG with a twist. It acts as an RPG in the sense that you can customize your character to almost as much detail as most other RPGs out there. You also have the crafting element you find in most RPGs and sandbox games. You may craft weapons/Armor/Clothes/medical supplies/rum (which at this stage can only be sold/food (same as rum) and other things. You gain materials to make them through mining, farming or buying it.That is fine, so what makes kenshi different then? Well, kenshi has a couple of other elements to it, two of which add some serious sandbox/RTS attributes to it. First we have base building aspects, you may build buildings and put your production equipment and storage boxes inside. You may build walls around your town and you may put man-able crossbow and harpoon turrets on them to defend your town. Base building to a degree some RTSs don’t have, comparing it to a sandbox instead. Now you may ask, I have a big base with lots of production equipment and I can build pretty much anything, but who is gonna run the economy??? Well, the other aspect that gives it an RTS feel is the fact that you can recruit a total number of 255 equally customized characters to your cause. So now we have a large base and an army that may take over the world if we want? Well you will end up like that yes, but not now. Now you are one guy, and probably the weakest most insignificant one within the kenshi universe too, unable to 1v1 anything at all. That seems unfair! So at least we get a lot of gold to buy some epic swordsman to protect us right? Nope, you don’t even get that. You have crappy worthless gear and barely enough money to recruit another useless person as weak as you are, with equally worthless gear. Okay but if 1 of my guys cant 1v1 something, maybe we can 2v1 something right? Well yes actually you may 2v1 a hungry bandit, the second weakest thing in the kenshi universe, only they don’t travel alone…there will be 10-15 of them. The only things that travel alone are the very strongest ones on the map. But that’s okay since they wont be found in the safe zone right? Wrong, the only safe zone you will find is the one you make from hard fighting and training and good gear and lots of strong fighters….In kenshi, the weak and the strong walk together, and most of the weak die before they even get a chance to grow strong. That is if you don’t wanna be stuck in a friendly town for the rest of your miserable life. So how do we get stronger? You train your skills by using them of course. No level system, just skills that are independent of one another. For damage you increase your weapon skills, whether you wield a katana, hacker, sabre or heavy weapons class weapon is up to you. That goes along with your attack skill, which influences the frequency your attacks get passed the opponents guard. For defence you have toughness, which allows you to get hit more before fainting or dying, and is trained by…getting beat up a lot…Along with this goes your defense skill, which allows you to block or dodge more often. Then you get your heavy supporting skills in both defense and offence, namely strength, allowing you to carry more stuff without losing speed, dexterity, increasing your attack and block speed, and athletics, increasing your movement speed. Then you get your other skills like medic, armorer, weapons smith, thieving, stealth, laboring, engineering, science and more. Increasing your ability in each. So how about the world, whats the world like and does everything want to kill us? Well, there are groups of bandits running around who would attack you and strip your gear once you faint(you can turn the gear stripping off if you want an easier game) ; there are ninjas running around who will attack you to train their skills, there are nests of animals who roam the area who will attack you and drag you back to their nest for feasting, there are cannibal towns who will attack you and eat you, there may be factions who hate your guts and will attack you, different towns and the groups who own them. So who do you have that will not kill you? There are traders and their guards walking from town to town, there are towns that will be neutral towards you, who luckily hate your enemies to the point where they will defend you, and there are adventurers (powerful warriors who travel solo) who will come to your aid if they are around (a rarity) So kenshi is about learning about the world and your place in it, and slowly moving up in the world until you are the superpower. It is about skillfully avoiding unnecessary trouble until you can face it. It is about starting at the bottom, and ending at the top somehow. It is about what you have it in yourself to be. It is not multiplayer, so you wont see the horridness of humanity you find in an online community. No noob bashing and no kids acting all grown up. Right now though the game is in alpha state, and the map is just one big desert with mountains and minimum foliage (it acts as a fake map right now since they are building the real one, which will be 339 square miles as opposed to Elder scrolls: skyrums 25) Right now it is buggy, but the devs are fixing bugs and releasing updates 2-3 times a week. The devs are very active, and have so many ideas of what they wanna add its not even funny. Right now there are 2 races, but they are planning at least 5. But for now the focus are bug fixes until they announce beta with the new world map, which will have all the kinds of biomes you can think of and more that you haven’t thought of yet, along with many biome specific creatures. There will be a fast travel system that would not work like a loading screen (or so they say) we are thinking that ships or some sort of caravan road system will be what they opt for. Right now though, it is on steam for $19.99, where at full release $59.99 will be a bargain. This is basically an RPG/sandbox/RTS/survival game. The most complex idea I have yet seen on steam. I would recommend it because the devs see it as a dream. They are very active and include the community in pretty much everything. Lo-Fi games, despite being a 6 man crew (half of which are not programmers) are doing an admirable job with this game. I recommend it because if the devs pull it off this will be a game easily worth more than $59.99. It may be worth close to $100, but I know that the devs wont go that far, however it is easy to see that if you buy it now, you will save lots of money. I recommend it because if the devs pull it off kenshi will be the greatest single player game in history. So now we are at the 0.9 beta, and wow, all i can say is wow. its still buggy, but within the last 3 days a total of 9 hotfixes were released, so the team is working on it around the clock. Weve been waiting in the deserts for what was promised to be the best single player experience ever! and we are getting closer, with the first part of the actual map being released. It looks beautiful guys, it really does. No more bare deserts, you can tell alot of effort was put into the map. There is atmosphere now, nightime seems ominous, and everyone wants you dead, or just doesnt care. Very few people would help you from being slaughtered. In the kenshi world death is just another part of life. things are harsh, and hunger is a thing now. If you dont starve, get eaten,  or killed in battle, you may just end up being that impossibly powerful swordsman you see in the movies, but even then you can die, as you are not the only one out there. The character avatars are so well designed. The stronger you get the more visible your muscles. The more starved you are the scrawnier you look. Its just great.			"

								Lots of neat ideas, but the game needs to get a bit further along before I can recommend it. Frequent crashes and a lack of depth in many game systems make it a bit too early to invest your cash into, I think.			"

Early Access Review
								This is one of the few early access titles I've not regretted picking up early. It delievers a decent level of content already with a lot more promised on the horizon, and it actually abides by the spirit of what early access is rather than just being a sort of super early preorder; the developer actually uses community feedback to determine what features to focus on.The game itself is also very engaging, but that's more a matter of personal preference. At its core it's primarily a sandbox game (and as far as I'm aware the first sandbox game to feature primarily desert, which strikes me as odd; think of the symbolism!), though at the moment it isn't as flexible as you'd expect a sandbox game to be. Even in early access, however, there is a decent level of easily accessible moddibility to be found. You can tweak and create weapons, NPCs, characters and even build NPC towns and modify the base mechanics of the game with a simple and relatively straightforward GUI.There is unfortunately not much more to say about the game at this stage because it is still early access and seemingly a long way off from release, which may be enough to put a lot of people off. Let me repeat because it can't be overstated: this game is made by an incredibly small team (it was a team of one for a long time) and it isn't likely to be finished in 2014, maybe not even in 2015. But it's already a fun game at its core if you like squad based RPGs or town building simulators or a mix of both, and it is steadily progressing. I also expect that over the coming year it'll start seeing some decent modding.			"

								To preface this review I would like to say,  ""I really did not want to rate this game negativly. I also understand the early access stance of the game"" It has a bold and unique style. And presents great ""Potential"" for gameplay. Many systems are implimented and more will be added. The game handles adventure and  the life of a wonder very well. These aspects will get even better with the new map. This is were my issue with the developers priorities come in. Far more resources need to go to bug fixing at the moment before adding new content. The second you start trying to build any mildly complicated base you will be in micro managing hell. Characters commonly get stuck  when depositing items into storage, get stuck under the stairs of buildings, randomly get their position confused and think they are outside a gate (this one is a little wierd), characters fill their inventories with♥♥♥♥♥♥when the container they are trying to hall to is full (I could probably fix this one if given access to the code. Check if their is space to stire the item in before allowing a character to pick up items from the original container. Items currently being hauled there by any any other character assigned to the task of auto hauling are counted into this total as well. They would still have issues if the player fills the container they are going to manually, but it is a start.), river raptors congregating at the base door and glitching through. Most of the issues involving characters being stuck can be fixed by reloading saving and loading the game. Until the game crashes as a result of this.			"

								A very fun and addictive game a cross between stratergy and survival game genre. You can choose diffrent sceneries to start your story all of which add diffrent difficulties and fun to the game for example one spawns you in the middle of a camp of cannibils in which your be knocked out and have to escape, Another starts you off with a bunch of freedom seekers wanting to start their own town with a few supplies to get you started. This game adds a lot of replayability and freedom it has a few bugs here and there but it has a lot of promise and in this stage i find the game very fun and addictive.  One of my favirote features is the body health feature which if a body part gets damaged too much it will effect how you move and behave like holding your stomach from being damaged in the torso or being damaged on the leg causes you to limp which adds a dramatic feel to the game trying to limp to safety to a town or your outpost from bandits. this game still gets updated and improved on and i'm excited about seeing the future content they are lining up for this gem of a game.

								Kenshi is the best squad based game I have played since I started playing games. I've played it for quite some time and could recommend this game to anyone.In it's current state Kenshi has some bugs but they will be worked out by the developers, it is most definitely worth buying and proves to be a great game to play for hours on end. In it's current state you are able to create a base, run a trade empire or even bring law to the lands by slaughtering bandits and turning their bosses in for bounties.Kenshi is a great game and deserves more patience from its crowd, there is no other like it and so you cannot judge it as you judge the others.

								This concept is the best i've ever seen, hands down. Love it.INSTA FANBOY, of the concept!!!I'm not even going to list to many of the bugs and flaws...because it's still in an alpha/beta  stage,and has been so for a long time.7 years + mostly with one guy working on it.Biggest Cons imo are,Lack of Heavy armor types/skinsNo AXESNo Maces,hammersNo bows/ranged combat..is planed tho on the roadmap.lack of buildingsBuilding walls is so broken its sad after countless fixes over the years including the new beta build.Men building the walls bug getting stuck in place or just will not build them etc.Can run through walls.(will be fixed )Even with chase disabled your men will chase enemy and start to spread out across the landscape.Game needs a stand ground or hold postion option for squads.The lag is real,game needs to be optomized.The stuff that makes this game just Great.(really to much to list)You can set up bases anywhere you want and as many as you want.Have up to 30 men in your faction,you must arm them and train them(this number will go up during beta maybe,if not easy to mod or DL a mod off the workshop)Buy and sell  goods.NPC SHOPS WORKCan have pack animals so far Bulls are in gameCan have dogs.Craft yourself and your men swords and armor.Huge open would. check the roadmap on their website.(Google LO-FI games.)The combat  is good,lacks good sounds tho.You can hardly hear any combat sounds in general.Hard at first, after maybe 10 hours or less becomes a cakewalk till more things are added.(that is if your starting guy or men are built up enough and have not been KILLED!!!)Each of your men have about 40 or so skills,its pretty crazy that you can lv up.Lots of research trees to upgrade everything.PERMA DEATHImport to a new world(map) with your squad you had from other saves...Steam workshop-modsCreate mods with the FCS,comes with game.Overall tho this game is cool and worth the time.Play this games experimental build that way you can play with all the new stuff before it gets added into the ""stable build"" the games gonna crash no matter what build,so imo its better to see all that the game has in it.After playing on the new map a bit,94hrs+ so far...got to say its looking good lacks flat areas worth building a nice looking base.I give the games concept a 10/10  the build 7/10 so far. Worth the 20 bucks as there is nothing like this one.			"

								Worth the money I found. Ive got most of the game figured out other then the exploring part. I stuck to mostly town building. After that I made an army of people and made my way north to get a better feel for the fighting part. I found it usefull if you build resting outposts were ever you wanna send troops. All in all though I have to explore the combat and the world map more. For now though im taking a break so I can come back to the game later with a bunch more updates. Even if it wasant updated anymore I would be fine with whats is working and done so far. Really easy squad management. A little buggy for plotting movments on world map but eventually you figure out that there is certain points that work. If  you try to really far spot on the map you squads might not make it. As for graphics I actually really like it. I always enjoy all the detail off how diffrent some of the areas look. Its nice that its not some generated map for once. Worth the price! Its a game that I know I will always play.			"

								This game has a big potential and is already lots of fun. The main music theme is beautiful.One point I like in particular about games is character customization and this game has alread plenty of it already. Besides facial features, you can even adjust the height, boob size and shape and many other things for every group member, let alone all the clothing and equipment you can buy. Fighting is fun and somewhat realistic. You are not a super hero fighting off a group of enemies on your own. Building a base already works really well and is interesting. Although this game is far from being finished, it will be amazing once it is done.			"

								FIrst off, I have had this game for a good many years now; It has progressed so greatly that I feel proud when I play it now. Proud for the developers and proud of how I have learned the ins and outs of this game. This game started out pretty basic, just lots of sand dunes and hungry bandits everywhere. Slowly, a game started to appear out of the haze. Building towns, getting invaded, shop counters (still kind of broken, oh well) and then cannibals. Gotta love cannibals! Now the map expands and there are new places to uncover. I recently uprooted from one area into Holy nation land (Although they hate me) once I had a devoted military group. I have a base in on an island sorrounded by rivers and the holy nation must cross the water to get to me... Which is no easy feat while getting hit by mounted crossbows =)This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥hard though. I started out in a setting that gives you a veteran soldier who is hated by the biggest faction in the game currently. It gave me a springbox to move forward though. I worked up his stealth and was able to kidnap a holy nation soldier in camp and use his armor as a disguise to get into their cities. Oh there are also raptors and giant turtles to kill and eat11/10			"

								This, at the moment an early access indie game, is an RPG game with elements of RTS. You can play this game as one character, or play it as a group (at the moment maximally 20 peoples).None of your characters will be ""unbeatable"". Even your main character is just a man - and in the beginnings practically everyone will be better.Usually I start the game in hardest mode. Totally naked, with bad arm and a STICK. Yes - I can survive somehow... The best way how to show that any character can die is to give a preview of my game:I got around six peoples group and went from city to city. I walked too close to Cannibal outpost, and all my group except one girl had been prisoned. I walk then with that girl, and found a band of samurai's. And I made her to walk with them... Then I ordered all the rest of the band, to try pick-lock their cage to get out. one by one I managed to get out... One of the cannibals started to attack to my first character - to the AssassinLV, they beated him up... And were eating my character... After time He managed to get out... But My band was beated up - again but still alive... Later I was close to the city - when bandits attacked on my band... After many attacks AssassinLV were dying...

Early Access Review
								Do you like The SIms, or squad based RPGs in general (games where you can control multiple characters or individual ones each with their own skills, and statistics)Do you like Ninjas? Have you ever wanted to play a sims type game in a ninja / samurai filled apocalyptic world?this is the game for you, its a bit rough around the edges still, and sometimes the glitches can be quite frustrating But with the bad out of the way this game is a master class game that you should try. Favorite parts: The game plays without you and your characters are not ""heroes"" they are probably weaker than almost anyone you can encounter.. however they have the ability to grow depending on what you do. The game will not need you to start events, or to stop them. You are more of a drop of water in a big puddle. You can influence and affect what happens.. if a big band of bandits shows up at a city your base is near, they can take out the guards and shops, effectively neutralizing the town. Later a travelling group of lawmen might take it back.. either way, even if you could have changed the outcome, the game keeps playing. Your characters have stats in almost everything. if you want yout character to be stronger, give him or her a lot of heavy equipment and have them run around. Eventually their strength will increase. Speed is the opposite, have someone run around without anything in their bags and they will become more athletic and therefore faster. Laboring from mining, or smelting. Crafting from weapon or armor smithing. Medicine from healing. The characters become increasingly valuable as time goes on..The fact that you  can plop a town wherever you want, build walls, turrets, arm your soldiers with swords and armor and have your builders be guarded and automated with designated tasks is beautiful. Kenshi is absorbing, Rough, Frustrating, Comically suprising and has the potential to be an amazing game. Id say get it.. try it, support the devs and enjoy the process of their creation  "

								Started with a few people, made a bunch of wheat farms, and established a bread factory. After fending off tons of overly hostile beaked giraffes and endless patrols of king kong, finally got some walls and made a pretty respectable town. Every once and a while, characters would get stuck and glitch on many items (terrain, buildings, enemies)... all solved by picking up the char with another char and putting them back down (some kind of reset)All glitches aside, things were going great. Never mind the random spawning of ♥♥♥♥♥ons of cannibals and hostile wildlife that made my characters constantly stop and battle (inside town walls). I ended up making 500k running my bread factory and selling excess armor/weapons from the smithy. SO I decided I would set out with my fairly rugged, well laboured, farmers and see what hell I could raise. I walked not even 200ft to see a char get stuck. WELL I try my normal technique of using another char to pick up char... etc. Hrm WHAT IS THIS!?Somehow, I managed to get no one unstuck and my entire squad stuck instead. Then my autosave kicks in...As I'm trying to problem solve...My previous hard save was from over 4 hours ago. I feel like I just lost time in my life I will never get back. Overall, very fun addicting concept, but with multiple years in, you'd think they would have character pathing and tracking down. "

								Kenshi is well thought out and being actively worked on with quick responses to bugs. There is a lot to look forward to and I can't wait to see how this game matures.  It is already quite enjoyable putting together a squad and leveling up. The character development, combat, crafting, and building have interesting mechanics which refect nuances of reality. The game can be paused and saved at any moment which makes it great for short stints or a weekend binge, but I often find it hard to quit.			"

								This game has come a long way from its humble beginning. Even at the early stage it was very playable. Since then more features and improvements have been made. I like the fact that the dev does not rush things and in doing so I can see this game having a very large fan base when its finally completed. Its difficult to describe this game accurately as it contains many well thought out ideas. Its a great combination of things and because death comes swiftly to the unwary you actually start to care about each individual member of your group. They are vulnerable like any human and require training and experience. As this takes time you can get quite upset should one day your group get attacked by a large group of bandits and many members die or become seriously injured. Its this level of detail that makes the game so rewarding because you have to actually think rather than just throw a bunch of disposable, easily respawned soldiers into battle as you would in other RTS games. In Kenshi a human life is a valuable commodity.			"

								This looks really solid so far, some more shortcuts for common actions would be grand, but at this pace, I see that happening soon. The visual syle and presentation are rather grand, I can really appreciate the efforts at consistency in certain areas. I'd like to see more random stuff - civilians doing things, maybe cities slowly changing, more npc interactions. But the engine is all there for these improvements, it's just a matter of adding the content itself. I really hope this game does *not* getting a debug/cheating/modding system as there is quite a lot of enjoyment in comparing progress and seeing what the game is capable of - the scale so far is EPIC. Single, squad, and city elements are all coming together so well!			"

								It took me a long time to decide to buy Kenshi a year ago or so. I was really intriged by this game I've never heard of before and that poping up in my steam suggestions. After reading some reviews and watching some gameplay videos I decided to risk a 20$ on this wierd looking game. Had this game for a while now. And I can say I really really like the skill system. It's a lot of fun to start with your weak♥♥♥♥♥squad and struggle to build a settlement that will survive a starving bandits raid. I had my main character becoming a martial art expert by kicking my bandit prisoners' asses on a daily basis. Said prisoners in return improved their defence skills, making it more chalenging for my character. Profit. I gave them little names.Of course the game is still in developpement and new features are still appearing and bugs are getting fixed as time passes, so I don't really mind if it's not as polished as you would expect from regular game. The gameplay is lot of fun, once you understand what the hell is going on, and the universe/lore of the game is truly unique and fascinating. I did not regret buying it.			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi hates you and will punish you for every terrible thing you’ve done in your life.It will sometimes bring its wrath down upon your unsuspecting character right out of the gate and other times it will bide its time, waiting and watching you as you build up your perfect village, before it crushes you into the sand of its hauntingly beautiful world.And that’s just one of the reasons it’s so great.At its core, Kenshi is an open world group survival simulator. You begin the game with up to five characters and your goal is to keep them alive, heck maybe even try to get them to prosper in the Japanese themed post-apocalyptic world. This is by no means easily done – your characters start out pitifully weak and even a starving bandit can (and will) beat you half to death on his way to the shop before leaving your broken mewling body lying in the sand hoping you don’t bleed to death. Which brings us nicely onto death. Losing in a fight doesn’t mean death in Kenshi, it means you’re left lying in a pool of blood. Often you’ll recover on your own and limp painfully away but even if you don’t, all you need is a single member of your group to get back to his feet and he can then run around giving medical aid to everyone. Assuming you have a medical kit. You really should have a medical kit.With your character created (from a selection of origins, ranging from easy to hard – though easy isn’t all that easy) you can choose what you want to do. Do you want to hunt down bandits, loot them and sell their gear? You can do that. Rid the world of cannibals? That too. Become a trader, ferrying goods from town to town or even start your own village to try and make your way in the world.Whichever option you choose there will be a host of enemies that want to stop you achieving your goal and they will descend upon you time and time again. Interestingly, the initial point of the game is the hardest – being poorly equipped and rubbish at everything means that anyone passing can mug you. As the game progresses you hire additional mercenaries and gain skills, perhaps a fortified town with nitro-powered crossbows all around the walls; which means that the difficulty curve is strangely reversed – the game starts hard but becomes much easier later on.Despite its roleplaying open world sandbox style, the game which Kenshi struck me as most similar to was X3 (Not X4. That was a travesty) in that you are provided with a world where you may live however you want to, and expand to become whatever you want.The graphics of the world are nice if a little sparse. The world is a barren desert and there’s little to see when travelling from one town to another. At first this sets the mood quite nicely in that it’s a barren world that’s harsh and unforgiving, but this feeling drains away after a while since there’s little change and not a lot happening. There are bandits, traders, cannibals, and all sorts of factions, but no other signs of life – I’d have liked to have seen something like mutated scorpions, giant radioactive yaks, or even an occasional cow to give the world more life. Additionally the user interface is extremely basic in looks if not function – I’d very much like to see a more graphical interface rather than the generic default grey boxes.This is Alpha though, and there is a brand new world on its way with new biomes and, hopefully, wildlife that will serve to bring the world to life.Progression is through doing. There are a host of skills related to survival and combat and each skill is improved by doing work in that skill – the Engineer skill, for instance, is improved by building things. There are also three stats; strength, toughness, and agility, and these too are improved by doing things related to the stat – Toughness is increased by getting your face kicked in.Sound is still somewhat lacking; there is a pleasant music track throughout but ambient sounds – the hum of generators or creaking of windmills – is noticeably missing.I definitely recomend this game but, if you do get it, prepare to spend some time looking at your character whimpering and  gushing vital fluids.

								To begin, this game is a mess. However, it's in Alpha, and the producers are working very hard. Describing it is difficult - You start off with nothing but a sword and a pair of pants. Literally anyone can kill you at the beginning of the game - most of your first hours will be spent scavenging off of corpses or running for the safety of towns. Eventually, you can build your own town, and the nature of the game completely changes. It becomes a sort of Age of Empires mixed with the Sims. You'll need to keep recruiting people and assigning them jobs - you'll need miners, blacksmiths, warriors, medics, scientists. Eventually (and I mean VERY eventually) you can wage wars agains the other factions, destroy bandit camps, and become the ruler of the desert. If you've ever seen six-string samurai, you'll have an idea of the setting. The soundtrack is pretty amazing, especially given the homemade feel of this game overall. Despite all of the problems, this game is addictive, and so original that it's hard to stop thinking about it in your off-time. If you're one of those people who doesn't mind unfinished games, dying all the time, and frequent crashes, I'd recommend picking this up. Even considering the somewhat high price tag, you'll likely put enough time into it to make it worth it.			"

								It's a very good game and i love it very much. Have some bug but it's not problem, you can handle it. The dev make this game success with the concept: make a character, be a slave or leader on your community (RPG Mode, one of the choice mode in game), make a building, grow your community, give them some job or controlling them all, be a mad so you have a bounty and make sure you have to survive from the crazy world, be hunter or hunted. And one thing, make sure to save the game often because nobody know's who is coming for you to kill and robbed you.			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi has become my go-to game for sandbox aventure. The development of the game is going at the pace to be expected for such a small team. It is an ambtious project and I am confident they can pull it off. I started as a loner in the game, forced to run for my life from town to town. Now my tribes have settled the deserts across the map. Communities of individuals capable of labor and battle. With the introduction of a slaver faction, I have taken to roaming the lands for would-be captors. Narratives will be developed from each gamer's playthrough. My point being that a story-weaving gamer will likely take great enjoyment from this game in its current state.The game is about to undergo a major overhaul, with new biomes, an expansion of fauna varieties, and improved faction AI. At the time of this posting, there still remain pathing issues with gates and a host of bugs which are being addressed. Please keep in mind the subsequent pro/con list below is subject to adjustments as development continues.+ Great building system and tech tree that continues to expand+ Unit organization permits efficient distribution of tasks over many isolated towns and forts+ High interactivity with those around you+ Gameplay that encourages treating your community as your greatest resource+ Open styled gameplay, I have some characters that run shops in cities while others hunt slavers. Militarism is not essential to succeed.- Still in development, lacking much landscape and biological diversity-""                              "", pathing system can be annoying, along with numerous bugs-""                               "", as much as there are many achievements to seek in a new game, content becomes limited after 15-20 hoursThis is not a game for people who are looking for a finished product soon. Nor is it suitable for folk who want fast results and progress. This is a game of protracted events and would only keep the attention of gamers with such sensibilities. When I want a high-paced action experience I don't pick this up.This is a game for individuals who want to see the progress of a well-made game through its evolution, unlike some other early access titles. It's suitable for gamers who like to dabble with genres of RPG, town builders, and RTS. If you are on the fence about its development I would wait, but holy scat if you're looking for a great game to enjoy in its growth this is the best early access title I've supported!! "

It has evolved a lot since I bought it last year and looking at the future updates it excites me even more to see this game finished. It is a good mix of sandbox, open world, strategy with rpg elements. The world is vast and it will even be more vast, with different kinds of creatures and biomes, in the coming updates. 11/10			"

								Kenshi, well well ok it took me about an hour to get into the game but when i did i have to say i love it, i like that you start out how you want to wether as a trader, a lone warrior or as a group of settlers looking for a new home. The trading system is very good and is part of the game that could really make it do great things. One word of advice for the creators though maybe you could include in the game that when currently looting dead or unconcious npc's you can take there clothing and swords and whatever items they are carrying but you can't touch there money, well how about in the next update we can loot there money aswell this would make the game more realistic which isn't a bad thing.

								Worth the money I found. Ive got most of the game figured out other then the exploring part. I stuck to mostly town building. After that I made an army of people and made my way north to get a better feel for the fighting part. I found it usefull if you build resting outposts were ever you wanna send troops. All in all though I have to explore the combat and the world map more. For now though im taking a break so I can come back to the game later with a bunch more updates. Even if it wasant updated anymore I would be fine with whats is working and done so far. Really easy squad management. A little buggy for plotting movments on world map but eventually you figure out that there is certain points that work. If  you try to really far spot on the map you squads might not make it. As for graphics I actually really like it. I always enjoy all the detail off how diffrent some of the areas look. Its nice that its not some generated map for once. Worth the price! Its a game that I know I will always play.			"

At that time (march 2013) it was already several years in development, and already had been selling on Desura for a couple years.At this time (january 2017) Kenshi has been in development for well over 10 years (the actual start date is lost in the mist of time)This alone wouldnt be so bad if the game made progress, but in its present state the game is much worse than it was on its Steam release in 2013.I spent over 90 hrs on this game in 2013 and it was great fun.The game was rough around the edges and unpolished and unfinished but i didnt care, it offered me 90 hrs of a unique experience that i cant compare to anything i played before or after, it was THAT unique.Fast forward to 2016-2017....Kenshi is a pile of unplayable trash that feels more alpha than the original alpha release on Steam in 2013.The game changed a lot in the last 4 years and not for the better.The positive reviews posted 2-4 years ago are honest, but people writing positive reviews for this game recently, they are either insane, or have a substance abuse issue, or have a hidden agenda.Pretty much everything that was special and good about this game was demolished.I dont know what went wrong and why, i didnt follow the development of this game the last four years, but i recently tried it again after four years of absence and oh boy, what a pile of junk...make sure you keep your refund window open, and only buy on Steam, because thats the only platform that offers unconditional refund.Disregard reviews more than one year old, its not the same game at all, and development has stopped. You dont believe me? Just check the changelogs, the developer pretends to be updating the game, but all he does is switch to and fro between minor changes in stats progression and how items work...Big part of the map is still unaccessible...under development apparently...while the dev keeps switching on and off obscure stat features for the last year or so.....need i say more?Its sad really, some games are weak because of lack of ambition of the devs, this one was destroyed by the excessive ambitions of the developer....regardless, what i see here is the ruin of what once was a fantastic game.

								Worth the money I found. Ive got most of the game figured out other then the exploring part. I stuck to mostly town building. After that I made an army of people and made my way north to get a better feel for the fighting part. I found it usefull if you build resting outposts were ever you wanna send troops. All in all though I have to explore the combat and the world map more. For now though im taking a break so I can come back to the game later with a bunch more updates. Even if it wasant updated anymore I would be fine with whats is working and done so far. Really easy squad management. A little buggy for plotting movments on world map but eventually you figure out that there is certain points that work. If  you try to really far spot on the map you squads might not make it. As for graphics I actually really like it. I always enjoy all the detail off how diffrent some of the areas look. Its nice that its not some generated map for once. Worth the price! Its a game that I know I will always play.			"

								FIrst off, I have had this game for a good many years now; It has progressed so greatly that I feel proud when I play it now. Proud for the developers and proud of how I have learned the ins and outs of this game. This game started out pretty basic, just lots of sand dunes and hungry bandits everywhere. Slowly, a game started to appear out of the haze. Building towns, getting invaded, shop counters (still kind of broken, oh well) and then cannibals. Gotta love cannibals! Now the map expands and there are new places to uncover. I recently uprooted from one area into Holy nation land (Although they hate me) once I had a devoted military group. I have a base in on an island sorrounded by rivers and the holy nation must cross the water to get to me... Which is no easy feat while getting hit by mounted crossbows =)This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥hard though. I started out in a setting that gives you a veteran soldier who is hated by the biggest faction in the game currently. It gave me a springbox to move forward though. I worked up his stealth and was able to kidnap a holy nation soldier in camp and use his armor as a disguise to get into their cities. Oh there are also raptors and giant turtles to kill and eat11/10			"

								This, at the moment an early access indie game, is an RPG game with elements of RTS. You can play this game as one character, or play it as a group (at the moment maximally 20 peoples).None of your characters will be ""unbeatable"". Even your main character is just a man - and in the beginnings practically everyone will be better.Usually I start the game in hardest mode. Totally naked, with bad arm and a STICK. Yes - I can survive somehow... The best way how to show that any character can die is to give a preview of my game:I got around six peoples group and went from city to city. I walked too close to Cannibal outpost, and all my group except one girl had been prisoned. I walk then with that girl, and found a band of samurai's. And I made her to walk with them... Then I ordered all the rest of the band, to try pick-lock their cage to get out. one by one I managed to get out... One of the cannibals started to attack to my first character - to the AssassinLV, they beated him up... And were eating my character... After time He managed to get out... But My band was beated up - again but still alive... Later I was close to the city - when bandits attacked on my band... After many attacks AssassinLV were dying... Then that girl - who was not kidnapped, I ordered her to save my character, cause he had the bag full of trade... She managed to prevent AssassinLV from dying, but also she was noticed by other group of bandits... Then she was dying... And no one could been able to save her... She died - cause she was saving the other......			"

								Do you like The SIms, or squad based RPGs in general (games where you can control multiple characters or individual ones each with their own skills, and statistics)Do you like Ninjas? Have you ever wanted to play a sims type game in a ninja / samurai filled apocalyptic world?this is the game for you, its a bit rough around the edges still, and sometimes the glitches can be quite frustrating But with the bad out of the way this game is a master class game that you should try. Favorite parts: The game plays without you and your characters are not ""heroes"" they are probably weaker than almost anyone you can encounter.. however they have the ability to grow depending on what you do. The game will not need you to start events, or to stop them. You are more of a drop of water in a big puddle. You can influence and affect what happens.. if a big band of bandits shows up at a city your base is near, they can take out the guards and shops, effectively neutralizing the town. Later a travelling group of lawmen might take it back.. either way, even if you could have changed the outcome, the game keeps playing. Your characters have stats in almost everything. if you want yout character to be stronger, give him or her a lot of heavy equipment and have them run around. Eventually their strength will increase. Speed is the opposite, have someone run around without anything in their bags and they will become more athletic and therefore faster. Laboring from mining, or smelting. Crafting from weapon or armor smithing. Medicine from healing. The characters become increasingly valuable as time goes on..The fact that you  can plop a town wherever you want, build walls, turrets, arm your soldiers with swords and armor and have your builders be guarded and automated with designated tasks is beautiful. Kenshi is absorbing, Rough, Frustrating, Comically suprising and has the potential to be an amazing game. Id say get it.. try it, support the devs and enjoy the process of their creation  "

								Started with a few people, made a bunch of wheat farms, and established a bread factory. After fending off tons of overly hostile beaked giraffes and endless patrols of king kong, finally got some walls and made a pretty respectable town. Every once and a while, characters would get stuck and glitch on many items (terrain, buildings, enemies)... all solved by picking up the char with another char and putting them back down (some kind of reset)All glitches aside, things were going great. Never mind the random spawning of ♥♥♥♥♥ons of cannibals and hostile wildlife that made my characters constantly stop and battle (inside town walls). I ended up making 500k running my bread factory and selling excess armor/weapons from the smithy. SO I decided I would set out with my fairly rugged, well laboured, farmers and see what hell I could raise. I walked not even 200ft to see a char get stuck. WELL I try my normal technique of using another char to pick up char... etc. Hrm WHAT IS THIS!?Somehow, I managed to get no one unstuck and my entire squad stuck instead. Then my autosave kicks in...As I'm trying to problem solve...My previous hard save was from over 4 hours ago. I feel like I just lost time in my life I will never get back. Overall, very fun addicting concept, but with multiple years in, you'd think they would have character pathing and tracking down. "

								Kenshi might be the next immortal Skyrim or even better, because you are never overpowered, no matter how far you are into the game. You can play from an RPG, RTS or an economical management perspective. Moreover, there is a great soundtrack, a world to get lost in, and many races and character patthways to choose from, which allows for replayability alongside mods. Looking forward to the official release.			"

								This game has a big potential and is already lots of fun. The main music theme is beautiful.One point I like in particular about games is character customization and this game has alread plenty of it already. Besides facial features, you can even adjust the height, boob size and shape and many other things for every group member, let alone all the clothing and equipment you can buy. Fighting is fun and somewhat realistic. You are not a super hero fighting off a group of enemies on your own. Building a base already works really well and is interesting. Although this game is far from being finished, it will be amazing once it is done.			"

								I was enjoying this game after 4 days of gameplay. I've owned the game for a very long time and quit due to excessive glitches. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SAVING YOUR MONEY AND BUYING A GAME THAT ACTUALLY WORKS. Everything was working just fine for the MOST part and I could deal with the minor bugs no problem. Then... people walk through my gates. It's set to private locked and closed while the door condition is max. But yet they just stroll up in my city and start wrecking all of my workers. IF YOU PLAY THIS GAME, YOUR CITY/WALLS/GATES WILL GLITCH AND JUST LET PEOPLE IN. Because of this I have absolutely no defence from the river raptors nor do I have anything to stall the holy nation from running up in my base. I can almost assure you that by the time you make it to day 100 everything you have spent hours working on will be completely useless. Then you might think oh well I'll rebuild EVERYTHING THAT DOESN'T WORK! Nope wont fix the issue whatsoever even after 5 rebuilds. Almost I can't go inside my storm house filled with countless cages, beds, research bench, battery banks etc. All I can use now in my massive base is the stone mine and my small shack. I gave this game another chance and yet again they made me feel like I wasted hours trying to train a group of people to be combat worthy. GG RIP KENSHI			"

								This is gonna be an painfully honest review. This is just my opinion of the game. Honestly I personally like the game, it's entertaining. So that may make me bias but let's just put the genera things about this game out there.1. It's a sandbox game.  Meaning there is no purpose, no goal, no direction what so ever. As that may be it's a pain in the *** to start. The game will rip you the hell apart in a second and you will have to tough it out. There's been times where i just started up and got killed for no reason. You'll have ""what the f--k"" moments by galore and it may just♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Talking of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off this leads to the next thing perfectly.2. The bugs. Not just one or two bugs either. Just to name some you have people walking through your walls, bandits spawning as giant group in your base, your guys walking off, randoms guards attacking, yadda yadda yadda. Theres a good amount of bugs but thats just a warning. I would go on but i think you get the picture. If you have a calm head you may be able to stand this. If not then don't get it. Go play something else. The game is overall fun, but also makes a good rage bait. I like it personally but i would not recommend getting it just yet.			"

								All things considered I like the permise for this game, I like what I see might be possible, but after spending most of my first 20 hours of this game with multiple tabs on my browser open trying to find work arounds and trying everything i can find in every forum, I have to see, this game is no where near playable at present.  Not even playable enough to test out base-building which is what I really wanted to see.I'm not an impatient person by nature, but after getting loading error after loading error, getting save games corrupted time after time, and having it be impossible to even load into my base, I just can't spend more time on this in late June 2015.  I will come back later when the guys who just grabbed my $20 have enough time to make simple loading and saving possible in the game, fix the major memory leaks, and figure out how to make the game modestly stable.I would encourge anyone to hold off presently, it's currently a VERY unstable build.

								If you want a game that is so differnt from what you're used and combines your favourite elements from RPG's and RTS's, as well as some aspects of tell your own story Sims-like gameplay. Then this is certainly the game for you. However, as the devs say this game is unfinished and is still in a buggy state, your games will crash, and the frequency differs for what you are doing.The game is fun, challenging and rewarding. I myself have got a large pack of freedom seekers that have stuck by each other through thick and thin, I've lost some along the way, but more importantly my two characters that have been together from the start are mated for life. I only wish this game had a relationship and memory system whereby the friends you make will enjoy your company and hang out, protect you and will remember the times you saved their♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that you could show that friendship or love through interactions. Would give this game so much more life in terms of the human interaction.This game has so much potential and I can't wait to see the finished product when it comes out of ALPHA and into BETA and then finally into full release!

								Decided to come back and update my review for this one.The basic concept of a squad combat is solid and meshes well with the RPG style caracter progression.Combat itself is both simple and complex at the same time, and there is no real right or wrong way to equip your caracters. Though some builds do require alot of certain stats to really shine.That being said some balancing may be nessisary (and is probably allready planned) in the future. Going alongside the caracter managment is as of so far fairly basic faction system. What is there mostly works and there is alot of room for improvement. What is there though is enough to know for certain that if you steal and murder everything in one town you wont be totally screwed out of profiting off your illicit deeds.Speaking of illicit deeds there is also a system for stealth, and thivery. Again its not fully implemented but what is planned is enough to make both Garret and Etzio foam at the mouth. From simple B&E burglary to disguises, and even assasinations planned further in the pipe. Speaking as a player with over 500 hours in the game, the ability to one hit kill anyone and anything in the game with assasination is a very powerfull gamechanger.The game also features an economy with growing diversity. Better yet, unlike most other games that feature combat and trading a full blown trader focus is a viable option to transition from rags to ritches. Especially if you take the time to venture out and build your own Outpost/Town/Fort and produce your own trade goods/weapons.Not everything is sunshine and rainbows obviously. It is currently an alpha (soon to be beta) and there are optimization issues with DX11. DX9 runs alot smoother and dosent look all that different in my opinion though. The game does crash from time to time (especially again if your running with DX11) Alot of newer players seem to have problems with the difficulty mof the game but personally I cant fathom why.All in all though its a very fun game as it is now with a lot of new features and content planned in the future, so as long as you can tolerate the flaws that are pretty common with anything youl find in Early access developement.

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis game has been in my library now for awhile and I'm cleaning up my reviews, here's how I feel after owning this game for over a year:The concept, the depth and the artwork are golden but why negative? They overhauled this game to what it seems to come back to the same conclusion, it's unplayable. The bugs, performance issues will slowly if not instantly ruin your game (mind you that this game is a grind, bugs and show stoppers will wash away hours of work). They have been adding to this game which is great but they still have yet to deliver something that's playable. Most of the previous positive reviews were more than likely from the previous build which was more playable to an extent***The game itself will be a masterpiece if its ever finished but thats where I give it a negative review, it felt almost complete before the overhaul now it feels like its taken a few steps back but with even more depth and with the scale I'm wondering if it will every be completed. I'd grab it on sale or hold off, its one of those games that wow you, you play, the bugs and un-optmized feel have you back shelf the game to only revisit. Devs are active but are quick to ban... recommend not bringing up bugs or scorn against this game or commenting on the active state of the game.Below is a response from a Dev/Moderator that I wasn't too fond of, if you have a questions and it can be generically answered by a moderator like below, you may see this again. Originally posted by Captain Deathbeard:This is what game development is like: -You've got a list of 100 features and 100 bugs.-Every time you add a feature, it adds another 50 bugs.-Every time you fix 10 bugs, you discover 3 more bugs.-Occasionally to fix one of the bugs you might need to totally restructure something. This will probably add 10 more bugs.-When you fix bugs people say ""These updates don't do anything, where are the features?""-When you add features people say ""Why aren't you fixing the bugs?""

								I've had this game for a few years now and I do see improvements being slowly made but the basic game mechanics are still crap. Movement mechanics needs to go back to the drawing board because it is just frustrating as it is. Doing anything in this game is frustrating and no fun, IMO.			"

								Hi allI have to say i took a risk when i got this game since i burned myself in the past with early Access Games such as ""RUST"".This one however is being worked on regularly and new content & bug fixes are introduced every couple of weeks. There are still a lot of issues and you agree to play the game as it is when you make the purchase. Overall i am happy with my experience and if you are a fan of open world sandbox RPG's than i would recommend the game for you guys.P.SJust keep in mind there are still a lot of bugs but it is possible to play it.Enjoy			"

								Kenshi is a great idea and its mechanics are sound, HOWEVER it is extremely glitchy and immensely frustrating as of now, with random crashes at random moments, an amazing amount of bugs and multiple game breaking glitches that can happen. This game has a great idea and should definetely be on your watch list, but I would highly recommend watching this game from afar an NOT buying it until it has become a much more sound game.			"

								New update. Time to change the review right?! It looks better, the camera follows your team. The world looks less like sand in your eyes and more like a setting. Sweet right. Nope. Still the same stupid thing happens everytime I start a game. I have a bunch of useless units who can't fight. I bump into a mob of trained killers, 30 units strong. How hard is it to set mob spawns to a game timer. Time < 40 minutes, Mob = 5. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT DOESN'T WORK. IT JUST KILLS YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN. It's not like dark souls. It's not fun, or rewarding. Your units don't get stronger. They get robbed, the get kidnapped, they get killed. There is no way to progress your units. Again. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Level 0 villager ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is still real. There is still no way to prevent this. You can now pick from a bunch of races, even one with a warrior caste. Guess what. They get cut down like trash bags in the wind by 30 bandits with sticks just like your humans. While your breast size has a slider, there is still no slider for fighting skills. Long time player same stupid flustrations.I like the concept of this game. I can take a group of people into a hostile desert and make a civilization. What I don't like is watching dogs eat it. I don't like random groups of 30 guys with sticks knocking everyone out and walking off with them. I'm not sure what the developers play for games, maybe the sims? The group of starting colonists the game gives you all start out as level 0 village meat shields with one slightly less useless guard. Mobs are huge. The game suggests that you train all your little people in a town first, by attacking the dummies. This is a 15 minute process. Why not let me mod stats? Why not set those stats higher and skip wasting my life? Time invested versus reward is terrible. Whatever my graphic setting are at I can never see the enemy mobs coming. So suddenly 30 guys are beating my villagers to death. If they go down they need a med kit to get back up. Which you get very few of, and cost more than an arm and a leg. I wouldn't reccomend this. The play testers must all be used to doing all these stupid chores just to play or have some cheat codes. That or starting a colony got lost in the developer shuffle.			"

Early Access Review
								Early access experimentalPros- the game has tons of potential.  Where it's heading looks to be a fully sandbox solo play any way you want mode.       - lots of progress has been made and continues to be made at a slow pace but with huge updates.       - be a wanderer, be a trader, be a builder, you decide or be all of them at once when you have 30 characters in your faction.        - it looks decent, and gets better with most updates.  Cons- Failure is the norm.  You can get wiped out in under 2 minutes of starting and have to restart.  You can also get wiped out after dozens of hours.  It can get frustrating for most players.        - Learning curve is extremely steep with nothing in-game to point you in the right direction or even give you goals.        - Character progression in skills is hellishly slow.  You can play upwards of 20 hours and not see much stat increases higher than level 15, which is incredibly low.        - Gets boring when all you do is dig ore, make weapons to sell to npcs, repeat repeat repeat repeat.....nothing much else to do at this stage.        - You can't seem to progress combat characters skills enough to survive enemy encounters.  Most bandits will outnumber and easily wipe out all your characters so you need to have one or two hiding far enough away that they can revive the rest of your party when it is beaten.  Even so, combat skills only go up with use and using them is decidely not in your favor.  Perhaps this is going to be addressed at some point, but for now, be a coward and run away.        - Looting used to be the way to make money early in the game....now it gets you killed even if you loot bandits, because you're a lousy stinking thief! and the guards will come kill you when you try to sell that stolen junk from a dust bandit that would have gotten you 7 coins before....        - Been in alpha for several years already and looks to be at least another couple more before beta.  It's a small team, and therein lies the problem.  They sell the game, but don't invest the money back into it to get a larger team to work on the game.  The result, a very long development time.WHEN the game gets further developed, storylines and reasons to play will be added in.  As it is right now, it's something to keep an eye on and pick it up on a sale.  There's just not enough content to bother with and what is in game isn't balanced out.  Perhaps in a couple more years it will be at the point where it might be enjoyable enough.			"

								Well, its nearly everything I could have wanted in a game. The RPG elements, the gradual skill increases as you perform various actions, the ""exploration,"" hell, even being a character that has a backstory that suits your playstyle. The game is great with a bit of a rocky start, but after you recruit a good amount of people (at least 6-7), you can finally get things rolling with the crafting and settling of your own town- that is, if you don't choose to live in a pre-made town. The possibilities are truly endless, and no playthrough will be the same- unless you play narrow-mindedly and safe. While I am mildly unsure as to what changes have been made to the world, the playability even through its alpha stage is marginally better than when I first bought the game. I, in fact, created my own world and recently finished it in liue of Dark Souls. The modability is there and given to you on a silver platter. All it takes is a bit of understanding, some programs, and the already there construction set and you're good to go.Overall, I'd give Kenshi an 8/10.Die well.			"

								I bought this game ages ago and keep hoping to find noticeable improvements when I come back.I WANT to like this game. It has an amazing concept. Id love to build up my own little trade town and go from there.The REALITY of the gameplay so far is that I start the town up and then for the next hour continually get beaten down by bandits and waiting to no longer have my squad be unconcious before making some more minor progress.Even that would be ok if at the end of the hour the game wouldnt concistently crash and thus you lose all of your slow, dragging progress.The game needs boat loads of more work before it deserves any kind of recommendation.  Like others have said. The potential is there, but the progress on the game is so slow that I doubt it will ever even reach beta.			"

								Honestly, I would not buy this game for full price as it stands. It's highly unfinished, and many things are broken. If you want to have fun while the game gets updated, by all means buy this. But if you're looking for a game that's probably going to get finished soon, you should look away. This game will probably not get done for 2 years, and it's a huge ripoff to get it at this state. Maybe I'll be able to change the review in the future, but otherwise, not a good buy at all at full price.			"

								Kenshi is an open world squad based RPG -- it feels like those ""choose your story"" books.  I play many different genres in games, but I've really struggled to find some sort of city builder that gives you freeroam over your city, free choice on how to build, lots of customization, and a city defense aspect.  I've also struggled to find a good squad based game.  The good squad based games I do find, like Company of Heroes 2, are not open world.  I feel like this is the game I've been searching for, as cheesy as it sounds.This game has been in development for 4 years now, ouch! - but just because it is considered an early access game doesn't mean it isn't polished.  What you'll find while playing this is fantastic gameplay (better than a lot of AAA games), fantastic soundtracks, fantastic building, fantastic customization, fantastic environment, great AI, confusing UI, and a medium amount of bugs.  It's really cool that the devs also created a modding kit for the game. This game is a gem that not many people know about.  To give you and idea on what it is, watch these:

 -- The Power of Moddinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1eIujt8lBw -- Combat and AtmosphereI do want to address some negative reviews to enlighten people on the negative parts of the game, and some flat out lies.  The fact that this game has been in development for 4 years is not a good thing.  Although the studio has less than 10 people working on the game.  I remember about 3 or so years ago they wanted people to email them atmospheric music for the game with royalties.  It does feel like a good game in the end, but it isn't quite there yet to be considered the game they promised.This game has trivial updates.  This is true in some aspects, but not completely.  The amount of updates put out is a large number and each update adds something that they have promised.  Compared to some other small studios, the amount of updates isn't impressive.This game is not immersive.  Pffffft.  I bet you would say that The Walking Dead (game) isn't immersive too.  Some reviews are blatant lies.Crashes and bugs out 70% of the time.  In the 20 hours I have played, I havent crashed at all or witnessed any game breaking bugs.  If you do decide to use some experimental tools, like the freebuilding (different than the standard building) mode, you're going to get bugs.  I tried out the freebuilding mode, which lets you place buildings without any cost, and my squad decided to turn on each other.  There is no reason not to play on a faster timescale, it's like watching simulator 2015.  What would you expect in a city builder?  Have you played Banished, Cities Skylines, or Dawn of Discovery?  Actually, have you ever played a city builder?  The game is about progression, not having everything handed to you in the first hour.  Whoever said this also doesn't understand there are other aspects to the game than just building.  I hope this helped anyone wanting to buy the game.Thanks for reading!			"

								Hello people, this will be a straight up review no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or anything like that, so here goes.I personally like the game, it has everything that I personally want. It's time conusming, if you want a challenge here it is, it will take you time to play and become good so you have to be willing to put it in. Great features and there are more features put into the game nearly every update. The difficulty, believe it or not, is fair but they implimented new features to make it harder or easier if you want more/less of a challenge. Your crew members will eventually die one way or another so you really do need to strategise and make sure you, yourself are 110 % convinced they will live, but that's not always the case. It used to be no sound, 1 squad max of 9 or 10, and only a certain amount you could achieve. Now, however, it is bustling with more squads, more research, tech, buildings, even mounted crossbows on walls to great giant walls. Now like I said it will take you time to achieve the perfect citadel or city but it really is worth the effort. Back bout 2 years ago I wouldn't recommend this game because it just didn't have enough in it to call it, in my opinion, alpha version. But now I really think that this version, the alpha at the moment is worth gettiing. There is a very long play time and at the moment near endless possibilities in the game, whether just making a base, or setting impossible goals, you can achieve it. However there are downfalls, (1st) the dev team is still relatively small making big updates slower to come out (however they are covering everything when an update does coe out), (2nd) there are very much so, alot of glitches and the AI path system is alittle stupid and annoying sometimes and the game itself can sometimes crash unexpectedly (3rd) some of the features aren't out yet which really really bugs me because they sound really cool, so there has to be a wait.Other than that, it really is a brilliant version at the moment and I can't wait for the final release!Happy Gaming and I hope this review was helpful and pointed you to a good purchase!

								For every frustrating buggy moment I have (understandably as it's alpha) I have 100 great ones. Hyperbole maybe but my purpose is to illustrate the difference between the amazing immersion of those great unscripted moments this game supplies you with so often VS. the insignificance of the frustrating ones that occur quite rarely.  It is currently an imperfect game that is full of perfect moments. The music is right, the vibe is absolutely right, the stripped down no guidance on how to accomplish anything, while perhaps not intended for future builds, feels totally right.  You are dropped in a desolate landscape with bands of wandering thugs and brigands and tasked with figuring out how to survive. Crazy loner in a hut? Start a town with tons of followers? Just wander the waste and scavenge corpses then sell junk to NPCs? Build an armor and weapon crafting factory? Produce and sell weed and rum? All possible and you'll probably do a bit or tons of each.The skill system is great as far as im concerned. The more you do something the better you get at said skill. Makes sense. Want to be tougher? Get beat to hell often (and recover hopefully). Want to be quicker? Run around with low encumberance. Stronger? Swing a heavy sword and wear heavy armor. Same system goes for crafting obviously.There is zero pre generated story to be had here. If you need Bioware levels of explanation for why you're playing your game then stay away. It's 110% no direction sandbox. If you have a creative mind and sense of adventure and find creating your own backstory and narrative enjoyable then buy it. It's that simple.Death will happen but it always feels like my fault when it does. Overconfidince or negligence is usually to blame. That being said, SAVE OFTEN. No ""respawns"" here. You reload the last save.Perfect blend of Samurai disciplines and the chaos of Mad Max (sans vehicles). Slow development and occasionally glitchy but I could not care less. I really hope the tiny dev team (couple people I think?) sticks with it. One of my favorite games in recent years.			"

								This game is the defintion of a perfect idea in route to a perfect game.  I have always wanted an in depth strategy game where you can forge a connection to the people in your squad and watch them grow into the certain player you need them to be.  Kenshi is a game that words cannot describe, even in its early stages it is so immense that I cannot begin to fathom trying to cram all of it into one review.  In short, kenshi is definitly a work in progress, but its also one of the most captivating, aggrivationg, emotionally taxing, in depth, fun, and addicting games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.

								Overall I was suprised I enjoyed this game. Even though it is early access and a lot to be done, even though I still got addicted. I love games that allow you choose your own path and essentially start from the bottom and rise to the top. This game will become amazing once they add more features and implement a few things here and there. So if you are willing to look past bugs and limited features at the moment then this game is a lot of fun and will get you pumped to see how they make the game grow.If you like challenging/unforgiving games (similar to Blade & Mount) then this is the game for you. Here I was lone wanderer who got attacked by a very large pack of dogs. Luckily next to a city so once I was unconcious in like 2.5 secs the guards dispatched them like chump change. I layed there (after the guards healed me) for 2 days in a recovery coma. While I figured I could reload the game I was like ""eh what the heck"" and waited it out. This game will be challenging in the beginning. You definitely don't start out like a power house.Graphic wise its okay. Nothing great nor terrible.Character leveling, skills, building, and the like are fun but limited at this point in time. I can only imagine as the game gets better and adds more how it will be. You can even customize your companions once they are recruited. Fighting is a lot like MMO's minus all the special abilities. Its point and they fight kind of thing.As of now there are no quests but I am sure through time some will be added. As of now its just roam, get money, build, and get companions.			"

								The best way to describe the Kenshi game world would be to think tattoine crossed with asian culture. Kenshi is a totally unique genre of game, it's a mix of RTS, RPG and Simulation but has the ability to make you feel invested in your own characters due to the random nature of the world. It's still got a while to go before the finish line but with additional content, alot of bug fixes + optimisations and more of the same passion and attention to detail that the Dev has shown so far, i have no doubt that Kenshi could wind up being one of the greatest games ever made. It's a labour of love and it truly shows. In it's current state Kenshi already has enough content to make the purchase worth the money so i whole heartedly recommend picking this game up if you want to support a Dev who's creative direction is a breath of fresh air.Some suggestions for the Dev in the event he reads this :- Add the ability for the camera to aim upwards not just eye level (It would be nice to be able to see up hills and see more of the stars).- Add Bo Staffs to the Blunt weapon list when you add it in.- The Martial arts skills in the future should be about disarming and disabling your opponents.- Animals that act as pack mules for the travelling merchant playstyle would be great.- Shields would be a nice addition. Much lower damage output but much higher survivability against groups swarming you.-  Bows not just crossbows. Ranged weapons should do low damage but be more likely to cripple limbs and cause bloodloss.- Even more weapons, armor for crafting/purchasing ect.Anyway keep up all the great work and best of luck for the future of Kenshi!

								I got this game 3 or so years ago and i keep on coming back to it after to do a lot of updates and i have not been disappointed yet on the game.Though it has been having slow development over said years, they have had added a lot in the past year, and i cant wait for the new races, animals and then taming them. I tend to focus on being the settler, making my own city and getting rich as ♥♥♥♥, its going to be interesting once they add in hunger and thurst system into the game.So far the game devs are heading in the right direction with this game and i recommend this game to anyone that loves world building games.

								6/10Pros:- It's definately creative, and at least in scope it goes beyond any other competing game I can think of.- If you like a challenge then this is definately for you. At least in the beginning anyway. Once you've got your character toughened up and some production going it gets a little monotonous and you end up trying a different set of start settings.- There's plenty of room for the players imagination. Whilst all of the features aren't there yet, give yourself a bit of a backstory and there's plenty to do.Cons:- As with any alpha, it's full of bugs, including numerous CTDs. I would not recommend playing it on a 32 bit system as it has loads of caching and memory issues.- Here's the big one, appalling development team. Their site states that they've fixed things that are still broken, they refuse to give a timeline on any development, and the development progress is so slow it's unbelievable. I don't know if they can't really be bothered with it, if it's a hobby project or something else but they definately do not seem to be taking it seriously. It's a shame really, since what they have planned could really prove to be something truely fantastic.			"

								This game just keeps getting better and better.  The only thing I'm not a fan of really is the fact that I'm an impatient person.  I also would like to see more weapon options such a two-handers like axes, spears, and maces and maybe shields.  Hopefully there's mods or something for this for us people who aren't fans of the Asian theme.  Definitely overall buy this game.  This is going to be one of those games you'll never stop playing.

								Being an early-access game, I'm not surprised that it isn't finished and riddled with little bugs. That said, it is in a much better state than most games these days and definitely worth buying or getting the demo if you're into squad-based strategy/RPGs. Can be frustrating at times, such as when bandits or wildlife trap you in your own home with no escape, but overall its a fun game!Can't wait to see more updates and more interesting features!			"

								This Game has a fascinating concept, its playable actually and you can probably extract a lot of ""Fun"" out of this, The only issue I have with this game has to do with 2 things, one would be the constant delays and excuses to release an upcoming patch, now I get it, coming out with updates can be pretty hard, lots of coding involved and the fact that the game is in Ogre3D makes it even worse, the other issue is the time that this game has been in development, now i'm extremely patient with this kind of thing but I would expect more content, instead over the years, the only thing I got was constant bug fixes, Sound for this game, and a prettier UI, as for the contents over the years the only thing I can pinpoint would be the harpoon which you can't even bring it around with you, you have to build the thing on a certain spot/area, a few wearable items and a new weapon type which to my knowledge you can easily copy and paste existing assets from things that already exist in this game and sort of change the values up a bit, Honestly a modder can do this in his free time, An overhaul for the character as well as a new race which I almost forgot it even existed because everything as it is right now seems to be a bit out of context and forgetable, and of course prison stuff and a few more dialogues, I mean what else did I forget? does it really matter at this point? thats not much for a game thats been in developement for years.Now of course, the review (I wouldn't call it a review) has to do with me recommending the game for you, that does not mean I hate the game, in fact, I actually enjoy it, but the developers need to step it up, be a little faster with progression, add more content to the game instead of just bugfixes, Give your modelers a job to do, get them to rig more heavy armor which is also something that lacks in the game, just keep adding misc stuff so people won't feel frusterated over the constant waiting, Anyways I truly hope I can change this review in the future, but as it stands right now, I don't think I can trust the idea of this game ever finishing, I could be wrong though and hopefully I am, And for the developers that reads this, Please make your mod community more accessible, some folks i've seen on the forums aren't even capable of rigging a custom armor properly without messing up the bones, that needs more clarification.

								Kenshi is what it says on the tin - a sandbox RPG. For those familiar with the Mount & Blade games, Runescape or perhaps Minecraft, there are similarities to be had here.The game dumps you into its world with very little, and from there it is up to you. You can travel alone or start recruiting hirelings to accompany you. You can start building up your own little town, producing goods and trading, or you could go bounty hunting.Considering it is unfinished, at time of writing Kenshi probably lacks a bit of depth to its features - there arent that many viable ""endgame"" options for what to actually do, but its got definite potential and if you are a fan of the genre, its worth a try.

If you love post apocalyptic open world games with a twist but are sick of them Involving zombies then you will love this, I can't wait for this to be developed all the more. Sure, some people are complaining this game is taking forever to develop but they need to understand that the team consists of 6 people, just bare that In mind.

								This is a hard one. The game is amazing, it's alot of fun and has heaps of content already. The biggest problem this game has however is it's bugs. The bugs are literally everywhere, one example: i enter the game i get into character creation and i crash because my graphics settings were too high, which brings me to another problem, this game has no optimization for any graphics card, my gtx 780 ti runs overlcoked at 1150mhz in this game for some reason it only reaches 650mhz, as if the game is trying to limit my gpus potential, neverthless i still get decent framerates, which leades me to another problem, the random lag spikes which drop frame rates to 5, which leads me to tell you that you will be playing for an hour, then bug solving for the next. At least this is my current situation. I just spent 3 hours trying to get my characters to another town, because all the merchants in the town i was in bugged out and the trade screen would not show up. That's 3 hours of constant re-loads etc due to bandit attaacks killing everyone in my squad, due to lag spikes, and no matter how many reloads the merchants did not sell me anything. I now have to restart the entire game. Do not buy this bugfest until i can go from City A to City B without restarting my game at least 3 or 4 times. But those few hours of gaming that you manage to sneak in as the bugs gather reinforcements are truly magnificent, and because i want more money going to these devs, meaning more bug fixes i am reccommending this game. There are people complaining that the devs are focusing too much on bug fixes, they need to spend the next year fixing bugs in my opinion, the content here is good enough as it is, i merely want to enjoy the content not look at new bug-filled content if you know what i mean.Take this review as u will, a 10/10 game, but has more bugs than the amazon.

								This is my first review for a game so I'll try to keep it brief, lol I've put many hours into this game, and do enjoy it, though currently there is no story line, none of your actions in any way influence the world around you except when maybe the reputation system is working, which is definitely hit and miss. The pathing system still has bugs, and often times you will find people with assigned jobs stuck against something, or trying to interact with an object inside a building from the outside. I have had the game for well over a year and while updates do come out more often now (usually once every month or every two months), they still have yet to resolve really important game play issues.I do however encourage you to purchase the game, as a fun way to pass the time inbetween games with actual story content and substance (this game currently lacks any), as the base building is fun and watching your people mow down starving bandits with turrets, who just want to attack and not steal your food, which totally refutes their name of ""starving bandits"".To sum it all up, they have some really lofty goals for the game, and if they come through with them, it will be an amazing purchase. If not you will at least have a base building game where you randomly get zerged by bandit/creature patrol, so if you are into being punished with no reward, it is definitely for you.			"

								While the game, as far as I know, is not finished yet, it shows promises.It is long and slow for your character to get better (and I avoid saying good in purpose).At the moment, the game does not look great, but I'm assuming all the eye candy things will make their way in eventually.The game is unforgiving if you make mistakes (like trying to take on opponents too strong or too many of them). You might end up dying, very very very slowly, with no options to get better :).			"

								There is something endearing about this game. I purchased this game far before it was on Steam and have loved watching its continued growth. It is truly one of the handful of games I am interested in and has a charm that I find hard to describe. I suppose I am attracted to the game because the developer made it so you are not a special snowflake in this game, you are a normal person or group of people with no special powers or abilities with the only difference from your characters and the games NPCs being your drive for success in whatever path you chose.Any skills have to be earned and only through trial and error. You will be beaten down, your goods and clothing stolen, you will limp back with broken bones to whatever you consider safety, and then try again only to fail. With each failure you gain experiance though and eventually you will be able to eke out a living on scraps and eventually maybe even make an outpost that could blossum into a metropolis you run, another city on the ever growing map with a whole new diplomatic game to consider. Or just be a lone wanderer trying to survive, making your own story among the sand dunes.Possibly a true sandbox game when it eventually finishes... + Developer is not only active but also has an interesting personality/beard.+ Constant updates+ Fresh kind of gameplay+ Future plans look bright and, more importantly, actually going to happen.- Very Glitchy, many crashes, texture issues, shadow problems, characters getting stuck, etc (Alpha problems)- Slow to add new content but understandable as they are focusing on getting the game more stable. - General ""Alpha""ness that will go away with timeI highly recommend this game even on its current merits. The future for this game looks to be an amazing one and I can not wait to see how well it comes together.			"

Captain Deathbeard) has been constantly improving this game over the past couple of years.  Do you like Post-apocolyptic, Ninja, crafting, RTS, RPG, sandbox games or never tried any of those?  You will like this game.  It's wierd, but wierd can be pretty fun.  A few bugs, but the team is cleansing the game of them with each update.  Generally speaking, this game is just plain fun.

								This is a hard one. The game is amazing, it's alot of fun and has heaps of content already. The biggest problem this game has however is it's bugs. The bugs are literally everywhere, one example: i enter the game i get into character creation and i crash because my graphics settings were too high, which brings me to another problem, this game has no optimization for any graphics card, my gtx 780 ti runs overlcoked at 1150mhz in this game for some reason it only reaches 650mhz, as if the game is trying to limit my gpus potential, neverthless i still get decent framerates, which leades me to another problem, the random lag spikes which drop frame rates to 5, which leads me to tell you that you will be playing for an hour, then bug solving for the next. At least this is my current situation. I just spent 3 hours trying to get my characters to another town, because all the merchants in the town i was in bugged out and the trade screen would not show up. That's 3 hours of constant re-loads etc due to bandit attaacks killing everyone in my squad, due to lag spikes, and no matter how many reloads the merchants did not sell me anything. I now have to restart the entire game. Do not buy this bugfest until i can go from City A to City B without restarting my game at least 3 or 4 times. But those few hours of gaming that you manage to sneak in as the bugs gather reinforcements are truly magnificent, and because i want more money going to these devs, meaning more bug fixes i am reccommending this game. There are people complaining that the devs are focusing too much on bug fixes, they need to spend the next year fixing bugs in my opinion, the content here is good enough as it is, i merely want to enjoy the content not look at new bug-filled content if you know what i mean.Take this review as u will, a 10/10 game, but has more bugs than the amazon.

								There is something endearing about this game. I purchased this game far before it was on Steam and have loved watching its continued growth. It is truly one of the handful of games I am interested in and has a charm that I find hard to describe. I suppose I am attracted to the game because the developer made it so you are not a special snowflake in this game, you are a normal person or group of people with no special powers or abilities with the only difference from your characters and the games NPCs being your drive for success in whatever path you chose.Any skills have to be earned and only through trial and error. You will be beaten down, your goods and clothing stolen, you will limp back with broken bones to whatever you consider safety, and then try again only to fail. With each failure you gain experiance though and eventually you will be able to eke out a living on scraps and eventually maybe even make an outpost that could blossum into a metropolis you run, another city on the ever growing map with a whole new diplomatic game to consider. Or just be a lone wanderer trying to survive, making your own story among the sand dunes.Possibly a true sandbox game when it eventually finishes... + Developer is not only active but also has an interesting personality/beard.+ Constant updates+ Fresh kind of gameplay+ Future plans look bright and, more importantly, actually going to happen.- Very Glitchy, many crashes, texture issues, shadow problems, characters getting stuck, etc (Alpha problems)- Slow to add new content but understandable as they are focusing on getting the game more stable. - General ""Alpha""ness that will go away with timeI highly recommend this game even on its current merits. The future for this game looks to be an amazing one and I can not wait to see how well it comes together.			"

								If you like the vastness of a large map, a world which is harsh and where your character has to struggle to survive, absolute randomness in the encounters and the freedom to do almost everything and to settle almost everywhere, then this is the game for you.But beware: Development cycles can be long, but this game has an editor, where one can make a lot of changes to the vanilla game. My absolute favorite: the cannibals in this game DO eat other people (and your characters too!) "

								This is my first review for a game so I'll try to keep it brief, lol I've put many hours into this game, and do enjoy it, though currently there is no story line, none of your actions in any way influence the world around you except when maybe the reputation system is working, which is definitely hit and miss. The pathing system still has bugs, and often times you will find people with assigned jobs stuck against something, or trying to interact with an object inside a building from the outside. I have had the game for well over a year and while updates do come out more often now (usually once every month or every two months), they still have yet to resolve really important game play issues.I do however encourage you to purchase the game, as a fun way to pass the time inbetween games with actual story content and substance (this game currently lacks any), as the base building is fun and watching your people mow down starving bandits with turrets, who just want to attack and not steal your food, which totally refutes their name of ""starving bandits"".To sum it all up, they have some really lofty goals for the game, and if they come through with them, it will be an amazing purchase. If not you will at least have a base building game where you randomly get zerged by bandit/creature patrol, so if you are into being punished with no reward, it is definitely for you.			"

								After 50+ hours, I can say without a doubt, that this is one of the GREATEST games I have ever played, even in early alpha, the game mechanics and style of the game have me hooked! As its in early alpha, there are bound to be some bugs and glitches...and crashes! ( and trust me, it CRASHES at the worst moments lol) But for all its flaws it has the makings of a magnificent rpg, and to my knowledge is a new type of rpg! All in all, I give Kenshi a 8/10, its good, but still needs work! work that im sure will get done by the time its fully released! Definitlly recommended!			"

								Kenshi is a game with potental that only needs to fix that one bug they say is trying to e fixed by the engine users.However, due to this game having the option of multible races with their own cultures I realised what this game needs the most: Fur... I MEAN, anthropomorphic beings with animal-like characteristics. Mostly because if your going to ad a race of stone/hammerhead/rock people you might as well have anthropomorphic beings with animal-like characteristics.Also it would be awsome to add crazy hassan to the game. You never know when you need slightly used camels at crazy low prices.			"

								A Pro review-no cons I bought this game a good couple months back, i held my breath as time went on and these guys have been really consistant with thier updates ! they are pretty responsive in terms of development and theres a particular moderater hanging around here in steam and on thier website forum who's been dedicating thier time to Q & A. I run a 32 bit system and was worried people who runs like me have been forgotten but recently they released an update for the 32 ! huzar now i can eat my piece of the cake :D, first time i jumped in i play as a retired captain went out immediately to fight some bandits there are some major noticeable changes since i last played last year and its now become more Hard, funny and enjoyable. now after encountering bandits i bit off more than i could chew i battled with a boss bandit and defeated him but his lackeys popped round to save him, i ran back to town (micro managing the chase, quite the engaging affair if i do say so myself) but i made one wrong move and got knocked out...which then the bandits proceeded to steal my clothes the odd but funny part is that aside from the fact he took my medkit he also took my pants XD ! End conclusion these guys are consistant with most things and the game at times can be engaging almost getting the balance between rpg/rts ! i have high hopes and looking forward to the changes being made including the new races !

								A game that offers almost complete freedom and micro management. You may feel like theres little to do right now after 60+ hours, but I'm hopeful they will bring the game out of EA sooner or later. One of the few EA games that isn't a massive rip off. Though, only get it if you feel like this game is something you would want to support and see grow. Otherwise, just wait for it to come out.			"

								Kenshi is what it says on the tin - a sandbox RPG. For those familiar with the Mount & Blade games, Runescape or perhaps Minecraft, there are similarities to be had here.The game dumps you into its world with very little, and from there it is up to you. You can travel alone or start recruiting hirelings to accompany you. You can start building up your own little town, producing goods and trading, or you could go bounty hunting.Considering it is unfinished, at time of writing Kenshi probably lacks a bit of depth to its features - there arent that many viable ""endgame"" options for what to actually do, but its got definite potential and if you are a fan of the genre, its worth a try.

								My original review was a positive recommended due to the content being added and the idea of the game. I have re-reviewed the progress of the game and looked at multiple standpoints as well. I used to play this a lot on Desura, and there were multiple, multiple bugs. It is still pretty unoptomized and some older bugs still occur for me (the least harmful being my characters falling through the world in ragdoll mode). Seeing how long ago I played this game, and seeing it now... at the progress it's at... years are going to pass by before this game is ""ready"". By the time it is finally ready, its relevance will have worn off, and people will have long since went to other games and indie projects with set goals, dedicated teams who want to get the game out and fully released -- not as an alpha, not as a beta, a stable release -- and real drive to fix bugs instead of putting them off.Honestly I wish Steam's system of review didn't only have two options: Yes or no. I'd put a ""maybe"", because really, it depends. Do you want to have a pretty neat indie game within the next year or two, or do you want to have a very ambitious, open world indie game in the next decade or two? Pester, or Investor? Unfortunately since there isn't a neutral option, I have to pick one, and I have to change my review to not recommend it. Most people on Steam interested in indie games and supporting them are hoping to be able to play the game in this decade. I cannot honestly say that this will happen with this game as it is going, and to be honest, what does my review matter to those who disagree and still like it? Regardless of what I say, people who decided they were going to buy it before even seeing my review, are probably still going to buy it, and they will either like their purchase or regret it. If you want to invest in an indie game that just might be the perfect game we were all looking for, no matter how long it will take to finish, go for it. Realistically.... I've seen what happened to games like Duke Nukem Forever, that take a long time to develop. Ultima 9 was another one. In the end, they lose their relevance, direction, or both. I fear for this game with the bugs it has and how long it's already taken, but I already made the investment, and I will see where it goes. I hope those who are more casual indie gamers or those who want indie games within a certain time will read this and consider at least waiting until it either releases, or gets out of Alpha and in to Beta.

								The game is very different from anything else I have played, it's a mix of a Squad RPG and a city builder.  The concepts of the game are really new and orginal, however the implementation leaves something to be desired.  The game is riddled with bugs (even though it is early access) to the point where it's pretty much impossbile to play for more than 30 minutes without experiencing a crash.  Building placement needs a fair amount of work, and character collision, pathing, stuck areas all caused me to have to reload the game to a previously saved state ever 10-20 minutes.  Overall, it's an incredible game, it's just not even close to being finished.			"

								If this is just the framework, I can not wait to see the full game. It feels a little like Dwarf Fortress Adventure mode meets The Settlers meets The Fall (The 2004 RPG not the 2014 Platformer). A mix which could bear many pitfalls but holds promise to endless hours of entertainment.When this game is done, it could very well become the gem of gameplay I've been looking for in this age of unimanignative games.Chris (the guy who started it) hired more people to help developing the game, hopefully a sign it does get finished. Updates are not as regular anymore but still happening.			"

								I'll preface this review by saying a lot of the negative reviews do have merit. The dev is not super fast to push out updates, and the game is by no means near finished, but you have to keep in mind just how ambitious this game is. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of mechanics they're tyring to add and iron out before this game moves forward.I would also like to mention that I have somewhere closer to 300 hours on this game, rather than the 60 steam shows.This game is super ambitious and I don't think I've played anything quite like it. When I look for a sandbox RPG, this is what I want. There's a good progression and a ton of content to explore, even though the game is still in alpha. Building up your base and setting trading up, the combat, RPG elements, everything is just super well paced and fun, not to mention each playthrough is different. There are a lot of bugs, depending on the version you're playing, but most of them aren't game breaking, and the few that have been, there's enough content to just gloss over that piece of the game and do something else.More recently (closer to version .75) the dev has been working a lot on updating some of the mechanics and fixing a lot of the bugs. These last few versions have been the most polished and balanced between new features and bug fixes that have been released. All in all, it's definitely worth the $20 for the game. I've gotten tons of fun out of it and it's a blast to come back to every update. I've found myself playing more and more each time.			"

								bought this game on the daily deal sale and i have to say i like it! it looks like it has alot of potential as im playing it in the alpha state there are a few bugs sure and the map is huge with not much way to travel and lots of sand. but watching your squad of people slug it out is sort of fun! the base building is pretty good as well i cant wait to see more option and things there and maybe some siege or attacks on the players. so for this review i would say 3/5 giving it room for improvement :)some pro's:the squad based fighting is cool!the base building feature is nice fun to place a mark in the worldthe fact the your units take damage to certain body parts and can bleed to death is interesting.the cons:the map is huge! even with the speed feature your running alot! <maybe add horses or camels to ride around?>there is alot of sand and not much changes to it! <maybe add some weather features? it rains in the desert sometimes>the slug fest does get bland but the game is early <i heard you may be adding some limb loss features that would be neat!>all in all the concept behind this game is great and i cant wait to see it progress :) GL!

That's the funny thing though, the only way I can see a major improvement to this game is to be able to play it with friends! It seems such a thing will never happen in Kenshi, but word is possibly in a sequal it could happen. I hope that's true, but till then I'll be enjoying my time wandering through the deserts of Kenshi being a total badass!			"

								Great game. I can easily lose time in this game. When I think about what is next to come, I get rather excited. Definitely a game I'd reccomend to anyone. The game has few songs in it, but those few it does have, I like quite a bit. If you like Desert Punk, this is basically Desert Punk as it is right now, without guns. The art style of the game just reminds me of it abundantly. This game went silent on updates for some time, but I understand that re-writing the entire pathing code from scratch, can take quite a bit of time.  Especially when you have such a large map, and can build anywhere on it. For those that have read other comments, and may be worried about this, I've been keeping close tabs on this game, and the developers have been rather transparent with what they are doing. They are upfront, and there is plenty of work they have shared, still going on behind the scenes. The game has recently started updating again as well.Considering how little I paid for this game, and the amount of time I've put in already, I definitely got my money out of it.I've been taking a bit of a break, and trying to keep myself from playing this game until it is done, so it feels completely new when it finally releases.  The new map that they've been revealing details about, has me quite excited, and the concept art looks amazing, as well as the modeling of the creatures that will be added in.			"

								I got this game very close to its coming out on Steam Greenlight.  It has changed a lot since then, and it is awesome to see the developer's vision grow into a playable reality.   This is what a badass game looks like... without the AAA stiffs saying ""No make this game, no make that game, no make another CoD since that is what makes money.""This game is brutal, in the most rewarding way possible.  I have to admit that early on I let development get a bit further before investing a lot of time in it; dying on the character creation screen due to a pack of roving bandits was a bit of a shock.   Kenshi brought me that first--the first time I'd ever died (in game) while making a character for any game, ever.  That issue is long gone, but few games bring that visceral sense of loss of your personal pixellated avatar(s) home as well as Kenshi.Which brings me to my next point, permadeath is so awesome when you know that you can build your base up, research, trade, pirate, murder, craft, or somehow launch yourself from a measly peasant unskilled in battle, to a slightly stronger peasant that is marginally better in battle.  Never do you feel like you're king of the world, untouchable by the masses, and the NPC bandits are far too willing to remind you that your ♥♥♥♥e in fact does stink, as they disembowel you and walk away as if nothing happened.This game is the type that grows on you, and gets inside your head.  It's a very slow paced game, but offers (even in its unfinished state) an amazing strategic role-playing game that lets you build a shack, build a town, build a city, make rum, and grow hemp.  All that with squad-based combat.  Hurry up and finish already!For those of you on the fence, if an old-school game catches your fancy, don't miss out on this game.  Pure Sandbox/Strategy/City-building/Crafting/Murdering/RPG goodness!			"

It is what you make of it.Their are PENALTIES with your actions though, attack a friendly you can ignite a war. Anyway a few tips.. if your like me and like automation make a ""auto"" town.

								Alright time to update finaly got sound, cannibals, and females in game. Isn't even to .7 yet is playable to a large degree. There are still some bugs running around but it is not a finished game if you don't expect bugs well you haven't played games in the last 10 years. I still remember plain xbox games that had bugs and you were stuck with them, the first time my xbox 360 patched a game I was in awe of the tech, then a year latter I wass annoyed at having to wait 2 mins for bug fixes, that use to be stuck with for life.You can't go solo some bandits for exp instead your running like coward dragging bandits into gaurds, and looting other peoples kills. Or my fave trying to gather enough to kill a trade caravan or at least just the weaker traders, so you can loot their backpacks full of goodies, and once their guards clean up, you look for a bandit leader, strip him naked, heal him pick up and collect his bounty at the nearest town lol.You can now start a outpost early and work on your own little prodution empire, but beware doing so means a lot of running since the start that lets you do so doesn't have any real armor, weapons, or skilled fighters so you will get chased out of your outpost on accasion. Much better to assemble your own team and train in the desert while buying goods low, and selling high between towns. That way you are attached to your men/women there not just worker 1-6 you know them by name. Of course you do end up hireing worker 1-6 still but they are just production fodder, the crew you trained from scratch are their gaurdians and masters, who can work along side them in time of peace. To me it isn't just about making my own outpost and sitting in it waiting for traders to come and buy my goods, its about the adventure, going out of the outpost taking on the cannibals, and bandits. Using the base to research a means to craft high quality gear, and train old worker bees into soliders to assit my core team in picking fights with people who use to mop the floor with me.And next up on the roadmap diplomacy, making it so factions interact with you. Especialy nice for the people who turtle up in the outpost and never leave, they will have to deal with demmands, raids and the nicer things that goes with faction interaction			"

								Humm, what to say about Kenshi. Well it is unlike anything I have ever played, it is a wonderfully unique game that I have grown to love, the world is massive, you can do anything you want, it has eliments of an RTS and RPG which mesh perfectly togeather. Even though it is only still in Alpha and has many eliments to be put in place and bugs to be fixed, it is one of the best and most addicting games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.			"

								Great game. I can easily lose time in this game. When I think about what is next to come, I get rather excited. Definitely a game I'd reccomend to anyone. The game has few songs in it, but those few it does have, I like quite a bit. If you like Desert Punk, this is basically Desert Punk as it is right now, without guns. The art style of the game just reminds me of it abundantly. This game went silent on updates for some time, but I understand that re-writing the entire pathing code from scratch, can take quite a bit of time.  Especially when you have such a large map, and can build anywhere on it. For those that have read other comments, and may be worried about this, I've been keeping close tabs on this game, and the developers have been rather transparent with what they are doing. They are upfront, and there is plenty of work they have shared, still going on behind the scenes. The game has recently started updating again as well.Considering how little I paid for this game, and the amount of time I've put in already, I definitely got my money out of it.I've been taking a bit of a break, and trying to keep myself from playing this game until it is done, so it feels completely new when it finally releases.  The new map that they've been revealing details about, has me quite excited, and the concept art looks amazing, as well as the modeling of the creatures that will be added in.			"

								I usually stay as far away from ""early acess games"" as I possibly can, but since I have a weakness for sandboxgames(+ on sale) I figured ""♥♥♥♥ it"". This game have an infinite potential. I think that the ""stat/skill system"" takes the concept of ""character adaptation and development"" to a whole new level. I'm not a huge fan of the camerawork, but all in all this game is well worth the money.			"

Early Access Review
								I got this game very close to its coming out on Steam Greenlight.  It has changed a lot since then, and it is awesome to see the developer's vision grow into a playable reality.   This is what a badass game looks like... without the AAA stiffs saying ""No make this game, no make that game, no make another CoD since that is what makes money.""This game is brutal, in the most rewarding way possible.  I have to admit that early on I let development get a bit further before investing a lot of time in it; dying on the character creation screen due to a pack of roving bandits was a bit of a shock.   Kenshi brought me that first--the first time I'd ever died (in game) while making a character for any game, ever.  That issue is long gone, but few games bring that visceral sense of loss of your personal pixellated avatar(s) home as well as Kenshi.Which brings me to my next point, permadeath is so awesome when you know that you can build your base up, research, trade, pirate, murder, craft, or somehow launch yourself from a measly peasant unskilled in battle, to a slightly stronger peasant that is marginally better in battle.  Never do you feel like you're king of the world, untouchable by the masses, and the NPC bandits are far too willing to remind you that your ♥♥♥♥e in fact does stink, as they disembowel you and walk away as if nothing happened.This game is the type that grows on you, and gets inside your head.  It's a very slow paced game, but offers (even in its unfinished state) an amazing strategic role-playing game that lets you build a shack, build a town, build a city, make rum, and grow hemp.  All that with squad-based combat.  Hurry up and finish already!For those of you on the fence, if an old-school game catches your fancy, don't miss out on this game.  Pure Sandbox/Strategy/City-building/Crafting/Murdering/RPG goodness!			"

								This is a very fun game to mimic a steam punk sword-play world with a feeling of being on the baren planet of Tatooine. Add in the Hutts, vibroblades, dewbacks and maybe a geriatric Jedi, and you have yourself Star Wars. The creators should add some similar music when entering cantinas as a joke. The game has a fatalistic feel where civilization is tattered. You will struggle to get a foot hold but attention to detail will help you a great deal. I love this game and it is only in alpha stage. Taking this into consideration, when finished, i feel this game could be one of the greats in terms of unique setting and customization options. It may have a lot to accomplish still, but if you think you may like it, you should get on board with supporting its creation. The more people that get involved, the better the game will be in the long run. Enjoy!			"

Pros-~lots of room to run!~easy to understand controls.~lots of cool stuff to build.~lots of ways to play-example: i can be a trader or just go kill bandits.( not so great at ether yet lol.)Cons-~quite a lot of lag when i move from town to town.~i cant zoom to first person, its always third person view. (Or at least a setting that allows me to lock on my camra, would be nice.)~not alot of wildlife or plants preatty plain landscape.Hope this helps! I will update it as i play more.			"

								bought this game on the daily deal sale and i have to say i like it! it looks like it has alot of potential as im playing it in the alpha state there are a few bugs sure and the map is huge with not much way to travel and lots of sand. but watching your squad of people slug it out is sort of fun! the base building is pretty good as well i cant wait to see more option and things there and maybe some siege or attacks on the players. so for this review i would say 3/5 giving it room for improvement :)some pro's:the squad based fighting is cool!the base building feature is nice fun to place a mark in the worldthe fact the your units take damage to certain body parts and can bleed to death is interesting.the cons:the map is huge! even with the speed feature your running alot! <maybe add horses or camels to ride around?>there is alot of sand and not much changes to it! <maybe add some weather features? it rains in the desert sometimes>the slug fest does get bland but the game is early <i heard you may be adding some limb loss features that would be neat!>all in all the concept behind this game is great and i cant wait to see it progress :) GL!

								This game has a ton of potential. It's very fun and addictive. I've always been a fan of the free roaming RPG games that don't need or have a story, but instead give you this playground to make your own story and adventure. Set your own goals then achieve them. This is that game easily, even in it's current alpha state (Alpha 0.64). It has a small learning curve and just a few youtube videos will show you around the game quickly, but this game is tough which I think adds to the ""started from the bottom, rags to riches"" type of thing that games such as GTA, Sims series, and Saints Row, etc have all done, and once you can take on bandits or better it gives you a very satisfying feeling of accomplishment. Even more so when you build your base and eventually make a ton of money trading, then have your group strapped and armed to the teeth! I definitly support this game and feel I got my moneys worth when I bought it. I look forward to see where this game goes in the future.			"

In conclusion great game, lots of freedom, but I would wait and follow the updates and see if they fix the concerns mentioned above before you purchase unless you don't mind the low frame rate during congested areas and also save often.I give it a 7/10.

								Kenshi is a very interesting game.  Its very fun.  It has great RPG elements.  Survival-like mechanics.  You can build up an army.  Become a trader.  The game is a blast.  The game is not very face paced just to make that known.  Its about taking your time and making a real faction/nation.  When i first got the game i loved it.  But it was a very long time ago and it was in very early access, so it lacked in content and got boring.  But now with all of its updates and with the workshop, this game really feels like a game.  I rate it a 8/10.  It drops the two points because its still early access of course and its controls can be difficult at times.  But overall this is a great and fun game!			"

								I picked this game up a year ago and while there were a few annoying bugs(now fixed) it was an enjoyable game that was exactly as stated a free world squad based rpg... where you're not somehow special without working at it, and when trying to take on a bandit... they have friends.   I started playing again this year and the bugs had all been fixed.  The game had made actual progress unlike so many early access and it plays and feels like a complete game already.  This is the first early access game i've played where full price or more seems justified, rather than waiting for a sale.  The obvious interest and tangible updates by the developers is encouraging and I can't even imagine what else they will add to make it a finished product.  There is even the option for different difficulty levels by altering the world dynamics, and different optional starting squad compositions, anything from a small team with the materials to start a base, to the lone scavenger trying to survive the wasteland and find a few friends. (one note is that i'd recommend taking a look at some of the mods after the first few hours of experience to potentially reduce grind)			"

								(Due to bad internet, I've got much less hours on record than I've actually played)I'm updating my review, which was made in 2014.I still recommend this game. Since my purchase of it, it has been updated, patched onto and received many additions. That, however, does not make it complete, or stable.What are you getting right now?The game is a survival sandbox-rpg where you command a squad of people with different skills and attributes, you can build in a vast, albeit a bit empty (a new map is coming, so... not an issue), desert land; mine; trade; hunt for bandits, for trade caravans; research and manufacture an assortment of products, from food, to booze, to katanas, to chain mail.There are several cities and settlements, a couple of factions, ranging from bandits to the holy nation, to cannibals, and slavers.As it is, the game is filled with half implemented features, grayed-out options, bugs and optimization issues and, basically, room for improvement.It also comes with a lot of things to do, from building a fort, to making a ton of money from trade, to beating the ever living crap out a bandit boss who wanted to threaten you and sticking him in a cage, only to then hand him in to some samurai police dude.tldrThe game is not ready, but has been being updated, and, overall, has improved since my acquisition of it. In addition, it is great fun to have such a degree of freedom in a game, and I have full confidence in the developers and their commitment to their product, which is key to an early access game.If anything, the year and a half I've had with this game taught me that regardless of the goals the devs set themselves, they seem quite capable of achieving it, should you give them time.

								This is a game I've been following and playing for a VERY long time.  One of my first GL games, I loved the idea, the setting, and the core mechanics.  And while development seems to have been taking FOREVER (seriously, it's been in my library for over 2 years or so) it's actually been progressing very quickly, I'm just impatient.TL;DRVery realistic approach to an RPG game.  Nice open sandbox elements (done well so far), good combat elements that are in need of some slight refining but are otherwise well thoughtout and implemented, and the possibility to build your own bases/towns to form your own ""faction"" is great.Pros:+Everything?  Seriously, there are so many elements to this game it would be impossible to list them in the limit that Steam puts on reviews.+Music is good, not great, but immersive enough that it doesn't distract+Graphics are good, nothing AAA here, but the rest is so well done who the hell cares?+Gameplay: so without being able to go into too much detail because there's not enough room, they've done a great job with the entire concept of ""play how you want"" within the confines of the game and it's world.  Theivery, trading, combat, research and technology (which goes along with), base building, and the FIGHTING!!!!+Combat is good, since it's still in beta, I'm hoping they refine a few things that are buggy/problematic (Yes, stagger, I mean you, you annoying ♥♥♥♥♥!).Cons:-Still buggy, lots of crashing issues (still a beta so this is hardly a complaint, just a problem that in it's current state may detract from some people's enjoyment-UI is a little odd, in that it doesn't fit the game's aesthetics, but it's far from awful-Load times! But they're still working on optimising the game, so another item that will hopefully fall off the list (but needs to be stated for anyone currently looking at the title)-Some combat elements (staggering is a HUGE problem IMO), though this is purely an OPINION on the current balance they have for the game that I feel doesn't fit to wellIn-Depth:So I can't fit it all in here, there's so many good things to say about this game, but it's a great title.  They really took the whole sandbox combat RPG thing and just created something so spectacular.  You can almost literally do whatever you want.  Seriously.  The way things are done is super realistic (as much as you can in a game like this, anyways), from combat, to research and base building, to farming and trading, right down to the injuries people sustain and how it affects their movements!  You'll limp with a busted up leg, or cradle that beaten up arm, or hold your head so your brains don't fall out from that gaping hole you just got!  Ok, not THAT detailed, but you hold your head when it's injured!  That level of detail is downright impressive from even a AAA title!This team has done some really amazing work, and they deserve some major props, praise and a whole lot of cats... er, I mean cash!  I can't wait to see this game finished, polished, and then what they come up with next!			"

Early Access Review
								In an earlier state of the game when I first bought it, I wanted to build a base really bad. I chose to build it somewhat close to a dogs den on a hill, next to the mountain because it looked like a defensible location. I thought it was far enough from the dog's aggro range.I was wrong. Day after day, dogs practically rushed up the hill and murdered my squad in their sleep. Sometimes, it rained dogs on top of my squad member's heads. One @#$%ing dog could completely destroy my whole squad, even with some  members clad in heavy plate armor. Just to build a well, they even had to go on stealth mode for fear of alerting the dogs.After constant fighting and brushes with death, my squad members survived and grew stronger. There were times when I had them running up the hill with huge backpacks packed with heavy ores, concrete bricks and water buckets just to train their strength.Eventually, I had at least 3 warriors on par with a samurai lord, and could solo sweep the entire murderous dog's den on their own. I was unrivalled across much of the land of Kenshi, and even won a battle with an entire city's worth of ""policemen"". Good times.Based on past experiences, I recommend building your base next to a monster spawn.			"

								Absoutly love the Idea, Love the Path it's Taken, owned it now for 2 years, still cannot play long term!The game is fantastic with the survival aspect of gaining followers and base building that I love, It's a slow paced building, which is nice and relaxing.  The updates over the past 2 years have been a definate upgrade and well done.Now the game still has bugs, And the bugs are what stop me from playing long term.  I get about 5 hours into a game and system gets buggier and buggier, which I am Absoutly confidiant that they will get that fixed.  Their responces on their forums are Fast and Fantastic.Buy this game if you enjoy watching a game evolve and develop.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOUR WANTING A PERFECT GAME OUT THE GATE! still got my money worth out of the game, 28.8 hours as of this review and i paid 20$, so under 1$/hr still well worth it and enjoyed almost all of it till the buggyness starts.

								-->>I would suggest turing down mouse sensitivity and scroll speeds to aid in performance.<<--TL:DR Buy Kenshi if you're into this sort of epic Post Apocalypitic Survial RTS RPG. I say epic because to truly become a master or rule the world of Kenshi, you will have invested likely a thousand hours; provided you don't cheat, or use the variuous mods which change the typical way you train your fighting skills.I played Kenshi years ago when the extremly early alpha was free on the now bought out Desura. I can tell you the game has really pulled through on that initial vision, and I can't be happier for the developer. Kenshi has come to life.You can literally go from a broke, naked, and incredibly weak; to a mighty warrior wrecking groups of foes and ruler of all the lands. You can build an empire / trade / steal / fight cannibals and other exotic creatures. You can participate in the slave trade or be captured as a slave yourself.The post apocalyptic world is vast (F'ing HUGE) and beautiful. It makes you wonder about the past fallen civilizations and what took place to cause the fall. I think the less you know about Kenshi when you start, the more awe struck you will be upon discovering the world of Kenshi. Don't watch let's plays, just go in blind and you'll be happy that you did. Easily hundreds of hours of gameplay await you. Surviving is difficult and managing a large settlement is also difficult, as it should be.			"

								This Is a really amazing game that I love playing! From being able to start out completelty hopeless in a extremely dangerous desert where you can die within contact of any hostile NPC's. To the awesome level up system for your people. However the game needs work. I haven't played more than 10 hours of this game yet and already notice many things wrong with the game. I will help out by making a list of problems.1) After closing hours of shops your person can get trapped in stores over night2) Game crashes constantly  3) Random spawning of NPC's (litterally had a beaked giraffe or whatever it is spawn right in front of me)4) The pathfinding is slightly broken and causes your people to loop around building before they acctually go into the one you want)5) Textures could use a lot more work! (And I mean A LOT)6) When youn reload the game the squad hotkey at the bottom screen does not display your characters and makes you restart the game to see it again.7) There is no home menu option when you pause the game, WTF!8) Characters and NPC's can walk strait through furniture9) When your on the ground bleeding out in the middle of a town, none of the NPC's help you (This isn't really a bug or anything but come on you know it needs to be part of the game) 10) Help menu seems to be very outdatedI will update this if I run into anymore problems. But I highly recomend this game it has crazy potential to it!			"

								Had i wrote this review about 1 year ago when i played it for the first time on my friends computer i would of put the worst review ever. It seemed so unorganized at the time and i just felt like the game was just a mess. But i always thought about this game alot when i would scroll past it because i noticed later on that i really just.. didn't understand kenshi. I finally decided to buy it after i burned out on RUST and find out if i could grasp it. Let me tell you. When i grasped it. I didn't put it down. Kenshi is a Sandbox game that literally takes you into a world that no one cares if you live or die. There are many entities that will kill you and barely anyone to help you. Food is such a pain but i love the struggle to survive. Mining ore for a whole day (In game"" to make ends meet to put food in my stomach. My skills go up from mining. I get faster... better at it.. i mine more and keep working until i'm making enough money to pay for 2 days worth... then i get building supplies... i make a shack... grind more and more and more. I finally hire a helper after and it changes the game dramaticly. Kenshi is not a game that you will just dive straight in and kill groups of enemies in your first fight. As a matter of fact your are supposed to lose. I won my first battle in kenshi on around day 70. I took my squad of barely trained lowlives and turned them into hardened masters of the sword. Its an amazing game. One that if you pick it up and actually try it and don't give up because you can't take the time to learn it will give you a lot of satisfaction when you finally make that small little farm town you always wanted.

								this thoroughly challenging wasteland wandering RPG, though unfinished, is immensely fun! I've never played a game where I had my character minding his own business, brewing rum, when all of a sudden... BAM! cannibals raid my town and knock me out. When I wake up I was in their camp and I was on the menu. This was obviously unacceptable, so I had to pick the lock, break out of the cannibal camp, and make it home safely! It's like the game makes it's own story as you play it! The more you throw youself into, the more the game gives back!although between moments like these, such as power leveling and scraping up some extra cash the ""safe"" way, may not be as intense, They are also fun in their own right. the game can switch back and fourth from city simulation, to an adventure/combat game, then back to a shop simulator in a few in-game days. It really keeps you on your toes and blends together seamlessly.I highly recommend to anyone who has some free time and likes some hard-won battles with whatever comes their way!			"

Early Access Review
								This is the only pre-release game I've ever bought, and it was totally worth the purchase. I've already recruited a group and built an outpost. We make weapons and armor, which I sell in my outpost or take to other towns to trade. I've slowly built up my group to be adept in combat, so now we can fight off the bandits that attempt to raid our settlement rather than running to the nearest city guard for help. I usually can't get into pure sandbox games...without a story telling me what to do I tend to feel overwhelmed and lost. Kenshi offers more gameplay options than anything else I've ever played, but there's plenty that you can do to progress the game, even though there isn't a story driving you to do X for Y. I've built my own outpost and fortified it. I mine my own resources, make my own food, and craft my own clothing, weapons, and armor. I struggled to survive at first, but now my faction is thriving. It's a tough game at first. You aren't special. You're not a hero. Any lowly bandit could easily murder you when you start the game. But you learn to survive until you become skilled enough to defend yourself. The initial difficulty may be a turn-off for some, but it makes everything about the game so much more rewarding.			"

								As of right now I do not feel the game is playable but if you are the kind of person that loves financing great concepts this is definitely the game to get. Kenshi is a open world action-strategy hybrid where you control one unit at the start, a character that you can gain stats with by doing natural things like running, attacking and carrying lots of weight. Sadly, it seems the game is rather barren on the 'quest' and 'story' aspects, there being pretty much nothing to do with friendly NPC's in cities besides buying supplies, getting new companions or straight up killing everybody. I am not one of those RPG 'purists' that absolutely need a story but the issue here is that as of February 14th, 2014 there is essentially no content for the player besides looking around for bandits to kill and building a base.All of this would be fine if the games combat system worked, which it does but its painfully simply. You click on your guy and you click on your enemy and whoever has the best stats win ( Most likely your opponent at the start considering that they are pretty much always better then your character stat wise. ) There are a few unique quirks to combat like picking up wounded enemies and healing them back to health after a battle which most games dont do and I personally had the most fun doing.Overall, as of right now I dont feel like the game is worth playing but I feel like it is a good investment for the future.

								This game can also be referred to as ""Running away from bandits simulator: the game""It pulls no punches and for a long time you will be outclassed by everyone you meet. You will run away a lot. But it has a very addictive quality because of it and when you eventually come out on top you will feel all the better for it.It is however very buggy and prone to things going wrong on long playthroughs.

Early Access Review
								Kenshi is early access. Kenshi is early access. Kenshi is early access.And if you didn't understand that, it means that the game is not finished. It has bugs. It's not complete. It's, well, early access. I don't think the majority of negative reviewers understand this. I just don't get what's so hard about it. You simply cannot buy an incomplete game as a work in progress, and expect it to be complete.. Why does that not register?Now that we've got that out of the way, we can continue to the review...But first off, I'd like to make a quick suggestion to everyone who's too lazy to check out the forum.:INSTALL THE EXPERIMENTAL VERSION!!Most of the updates go to the experimental version because of the amount of experimental content being added. It doesn't get published to the stable branch unless it's complete - which, being as the state of the game is incomplete; most of the content is on the experimental version. Seriously, it's like a completely different game when you step up to the experimental branch...That being said, my review will be on the experimental branch of the game based on what it currently contains.Sound: 9/10Man, the backing music in this is really great. It gives the perfect feeling of being in a post-apocalyptic world along with the wind effects. It just FEELS like you're trying to survive in a wasteland.I feel that the rest of the sounds are appropriate with the genre. (Combat voices, swords clashing, etc.) I'm not really picky about the sound as long as the game is good, so I give it a 9!Improvement: More backing tracks that create the same sense of being in a desolate wasteland!Visuals: 7/10The game looks good. It's no FarCry, but it holds it's own with games of the same genre. I can't really complain about anything. The game currently runs solely in a desert as it stands, but a larger, more populated map with biomes is in the works. From the snippets I've seen, it's going to be just as excellent. I give it a 7/10 based off of what they've got. It's reminiscent of Mad Max!The drawback is that the night cycle makes the terrain a bit hard to discern. Maybe add a moonlight effect that causes dunes and topographical features to stand out at night from a top down view.Improvement: Better night views. Ruins and wreckage with loot to scavenge maybe? Other than that, the setting fills the wasteland role really well.Gameplay 7/10I first started the game, and wandered around for a while. I quickly learned that I needed to stay within a safe distance of the city or I would get steamrolled quickly. (You rarely actually die in the game as long as you provide first aid to your characters. Characters get knocked unconscious for a while, and usually must recieve first aid from themselves or another character; or they will eventually bleed out.)I started an outpost once I had recruited enough characters to fend off small groups of cannibals. That was where the fun started! The city was constantly attacked by bandit groups, causing me to abandon several times. Eventually, I grew strong enough to waste anybody that came knocking.Then... The monsters started showing up and really added the heat! A really excellent addition, and add another facet to the game. If you don't incinerate dead bodies, they come looking to scavenge and will smoke a few of your characters as well! I give this a 7/10 because last played, the monsters began to run rampant as the game had played out for a while; and became overwhelming to towns.I feel the only major drawback is that there is a really steep learning curve. Most players are weak of heart, and would just as soon put the game down and cry about it, rather than taking the time to figure it out on their own. An in-game guide was added that really helps to get the lay of the land, but I think areas with differing difficulties would help a lot.Improvement: Respawnable town guards, town incineration NPCs to help keep monsters away, and starting zones to help new players get on their feet.Overall: 8/10Kenshi is already a hell of a game, and has endless potential. It's one of those games that you start playing, and several hours have passed in the blink of an eye. There's a lot you can do, and the openness allows for many different play styles.It's got some rough edges, but nothing that is game breaking. I don't regret making the purchase one bit!The content comes in nice large chunks, and thorough updates on progress are given every few weeks to let you know where they stand.			"

								Shows great promise, still in very early alpha.Kenishi is the story of the boy who wanted to go out into the world to become a great....Swordsman/Mayor/Trader/Inventor. But unlike most RPGs  today where the hero has all of the advantages; and magically can plow through hordes of enemies, in Kenshi, you start with the no knowledge and no skill. Almost every encounter you find at the beginning is one sided (NOT in your favor.)Bandits roam in groups generally and your best course of action is to run. If your are caught by a group of bandits chances are you will be knocked out/killed. It is more likely your will be knocked out, in this game. This is good because this is how you learn to fight, and become tougher. But it is a pretty miserable experience trying to walk back to a city with your leg broken. With time I think Kenishi will become one of the more interesting indie RPGs available.			"

								It really has a great potential. But, i couldn't figure out the patches yet. There are lots of serious bugs, crashes and unfinished zillions of stuff screaming out there, still patching cosmetics. If you have a great imagination about what this game will be after, at least get a beta stage, and also if you have patience about crashes occuring in every 15-20 minutes; yes it's fun. But it looks and smells like a side project of some accountants and hobbiests whom patches the game nearly two months row. If you survive crashes and bugs with lots of saves, the point of ""everything is done and what to do next"" comes really quickly BECAUSE it's not finished fundementaly yet. And, they announce a new race while characters couldnt run/climb/fight/enter a building/exit a building/talk to NPCs etc. Maybe gets beta in 5 years.			"

Best thing about all of this is that the game is only 40% complete in features.

								This is definatly one of the most satisfying games that I have ever played. Some people might see this as a negative, but the game plops you in a random location and lets you do whatever you want. No quest line, no objectives, your only job is to survive. It's also nice that you don't start the game as some kind of ""chosen one"" the fact that you have to build yourself up from the bottom is what makes this game so satisfying. Though the game has been in development for some years, I have seen that the devs have been dedicated in thier work and have made a lot of progress. I eagery wait for the game's full release. If you want a game that doesn't hold your hand, that gives you total freedom to do whatever you want, I totally recomend this game.			"

								Lots of pottential for this game, there are some crashes and some minor or game breaking bugs but this is still a early access game, the game mechanics are easily adaptable to and easy to figure out.RTS/RPG/Survival/OpenWorld/CityBuid is basicly all the tags for this game if you wanted to see what its like.Graphics are decent for a game like this, The amount of characters you can have(30 Max.) is very useful if you want to have a Trading Caravan. Bandit/ninja party, Small Town, Doctors, or anything you wish, there is different roles and scenarios you are able to play like, a lone wanderer who has nothing, a hungover ninja who got into a bad situation, or a lucky scavenger who found a OP sword but has people out to get him. Survival is constant as there are animals everywhere trying to devour you, slavers trying to capture you or canibals trying to eat you and bandits of all sorts trying to rob you and kill you or the ninjas that have no real reason to kill you but theyll just try to do it anyways. There are many Factions throughout the lad of Kenshi including your own faction, you can improve or worsen relations with different factions, make freinds, enemies, have new members join, hire medics, engineers, nobodies or experienced fighters to join your faction. there are many jobs within kenshi like bounty hunting, farming, mining, crafting, water gathering,hauling,and just so much more to come....i do really recommend this game but you should probably wait until a few more patches and updates to come beacsue the crashes are really crazy and it usually crashes after a autosave or when you load the game the squad system is broken...but i do reccomend this game because it hasnt given me that much trouble other than lag and crashes.

								This game is fun! Why not recommend it then, right? Well its because its not quite ready for general playing. After building a town you realize none of it really has a purpose yet. Thats fine, but it gets super boring. Economy isnt fully functional yet either, 10 minutes is enough time to abuse trade for a fortune, THEN build a city. Im too sad after playing it to explain anymore, dont forget this game, just dont buy it yet.EDIT- The time has come to re-review this game and it has made huge leaps into being what it claims- an open world sandbox squad based RPG. So many new options for building. Still have a rough a tumble problem, were just starting out you get rocked for a good while. Then suddenly youre the butt kicker. The base building is so much bigger now, after not playing for like 8 months. The game seems so much better. Its time to finally check it out!			"

								荒廃した世界でサバイバルしていくゲーム。現在30人までキャラクター操作可能。キャラは酒場で3,000capから雇える。時々無料で仲間になってくれる人もいるのでお金がなくても安心。初期は街の人が倒してくれた犬の皮を剥いで売ったり、鉄を採掘して売ったりしてコツコツお金を貯める。仲間が増えてくるといよいよ拠点づくりを始めよう！拠点には城壁、門、家、井戸、石切り場、畑、鍛冶場等、色々な施設を作ることができる。また、キャラクターに仕事を割り振る事が出来、自動で働かせることも出来るので便利。採掘した鉄を精錬して武器を作ったり、皮をなめして防具を作ったりもできる。鍛冶スキルが低いうちは弱い武器しか作れないが、たくさん作ってスキルが上がれば状態の良い（強い）武器が作れるようになる。農場で牛と牛専用バックパック（大容量で便利！）を買えば交易もはかどる！技術ツリーを開放するのに必要なアイテムには「本」と「古代の本」等があり、より高度な技術開発に必要な「古代の本」はレアなので、遠くまで旅したり、古代遺跡をあさって手に入れる必要があるらしく、拠点作りが安定してからもやることがあっていい感じ。初期キャラ作りでの注意としては、種族「スケルトン」を選ぶと、一部の勢力からは見つけ次第攻撃されてしまう（その場合も人間を仲間にして人間だけで近付けば攻撃されないので、ロールプレイのためにスケルトンを選びたい人でも大丈夫。スケルトンは治療コストが高いので初期につらいという欠点もあるが……）。マップは十分広く、バリエーションに富んでいる（砂漠、平原、山岳地帯、古代遺跡群等）。しかも現在行くことのできる地域の数倍の広さの未開放地域があるので、将来的にはかなり広いものになるだろう。現状でもかなり面白いので、おすすめです！			"

								I've put many hours into this game.  Though it's still in it's early alpha stage, the game is coming along nicely for what it is currently.The concept is fresh, and is executed very well.  The detail puts many AAA games to shame, even in it's current state.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone that loves RPG's, strategy games, and squad based combat in a real-time setting with pause mechanic.There are flaws with the game, that are unfortunately due to the engine used but it's being updated and as of writing this review, 0.72.1 is really buggy and crashes.  I have set it to experimental which means it's the unstable variant of the game and as I stated it is buggy.  There currently is a limitation in the engine that causes a specific crash that tends to happen often, unfortunatly though they haven't pinpointed it yet but I have faith they will soon.  Other flaws, which are very minor, are glitches with pathing and AI mainly.  It's not optimized so it's very slow at times even on high end machines.  Aside from these flaws the game is very much playable and extremely fun despite missing many of the mechanics the developers have in store for the game.They have many additions in store for the game, new races, new biomes, a HUGE map, lots of buildings to build, and many more we have yet to hear about.Again I recommend this to anyone that loves chaotic fast paced battles.  I'm looking very much forward to the finished product.			"

								Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is amazing, and has sooo much potential. Get your bases raided by bandit, slavers and all the above. or play with a single character (or group, or even get 2 characters and pretend one of them is you and your stupid brother) and go roam around only to get your asses handed to you and spend hours bleeding out unconcious until someone happens to walk by and give you a hand. ( or until you wake up lol) You can even set up shop and live a boring life selling the same godamn sword lmao. (Even that♥♥♥♥♥♥is fun in this game)Even though its still in Early Access (and has been for QUITE some time) i think it only leaves room for much much more improvement. Even as early as the first day it came out i enjoyed the few hours spent building up my bases, getting my people stronger, acquiring more people to add to my little clan, and also working hard (literally slaving away manufacturing items to sell) just to make a decent living for my group and get them the best gear i could.Though i've only played for a bit, every moment was enjoyable.If you guys like atmospheric, open world, RTS/RPG? (plays like a age of empires sorta thing) As well as a full on management on every single unit/character you got. THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!!!			"

								This is by far one of the best games I've ever played and I've made the circut a couple of times. Well worth the $20 and hard to believe it's still in development. This game has depth and scope that I've been hard pressed to find in even high budget games I've played. The only down side that I've found thus far, which I'm sure will be addressed, is the lack of animals. I personaly would love to see this game advance to adopt additional climates and/or some sort of additional vegatation to be used in building, landscaping, w/e... I played the 'experimental mode' or whatever it's called and only encountered crashes in open desert. I honestly forgot I opted for the testing! This is some great work and a must for anyone looking to take their rpg/rts gaming to a whole new level of freedom of play.			"

Early Access Review
								I built a small settlement near the Rebel Base with my main character and his five friends, where there is little water and poor dirt. After a few fights with bandits trying to steal my food, I finally built a wall around my territory and set up some farms and mining stations, recruiting a hostile bandit and three enslaved servants. I had to go out with my best-equipped character (me) and sell some hand-crafted katanas to the Holy Nation, Outlaws, and a Skek city to raise enough funds to buy proper armor and growable food.Next, I decided to scout out the remaining accessible regions, so I decided to first visit the tropical region to my west with the purple trees (with my main character once again). The Hive was very friendly, but the surrounding wildlife was deadlier than anything else in the game. When I saw the Beak Things, I thought they were giraffe-like herbivores. Boy, was I wrong. Not only are they the fastest NPCs in the game, they have the best range out of all melee-type enemies, meaning it is impossible to outrun them unless you’ve trained to be Usain Bolt. Granted, I was wearing heavy armor, but still.After barely surviving a Gorillo (gorilla-type monster that can kill you in less than five hits) and Beak Thing attack, I decided to go north to scout out a hazy region, which I thought was snow. Once again, how wrong I was, because I immediately got defeated and kidnapped by a cannibal. After being carried into the Fog Lands for a solid fifteen minutes (real-time), I was able to recover from my injuries, but I was unable to escape. I was finally given the opportunity to escape from my captor's clutches when the Fog Men attacked us, incapacitating my captor and dragging him off while I had enough time to flee for my life.Trekking back to my settlement, wearing my heaviest combat gear, I stumbled across a group of Dust Bandits. Fighting against the group with my nodachi and katana, I was defeated after defeating five of their members. Fortunately, I had someone manning the mounted crossbow near my fort, and they were able to drive off the remaining bandits alongside a group of wandering servants that decided to attack the bandits.After I had recovered from my wounds, I made my main character fight every bandit that wandered near my settlement, resulting in either victories or losses, but I was able to retain my items due to my manned crossbows on my perimeter walls. While my main character is in charge of combat, my other fellow survivors are responsible for forging weapons to trade for food and research supplies, growing food and cotton to stay alive, and fortifying our settlement and expanding its borders.That is what you can expect from this game.A lesson to those who wish to explore the world of Kenshi. Stay on the roads, stay away from fog, and NEVER enter a tropical forest. EVER.			"

								Kenshi is shaping up to be one of the best games on Steam and maybe one of the best games out. Period.A very ambitious design, Kenshi is real time and looks like these game makers are trying to succeed at giving players squad based combat, base building, base defense, factions warfare and relations, character development and excellent customization, rescource management, serious exploration, rich atmosphere, and in depth game play mechanics like stealth and lockpicking. Thats just to name a few game play elements Kenshi is aiming to offer players. Ambitious or what.Kenshi's story is weak at the moment and there are a few bugs but the updates are rapid, like once or twice a week. Alot is unfinished and buggy, but its in alpha. This is a game that I expect the price to rise when it is launched.Check it out for sure. Theres a free demo even. This could potentially be a 10/10 game some day. Really. As it is now, in alpha, with so much unfinished its easily a 7/10. I expect pro reviews will be just as flattering.			"

								Alright time to update finaly got sound, cannibals, and females in game. Isn't even to .7 yet is playable to a large degree. There are still some bugs running around but it is not a finished game if you don't expect bugs well you haven't played games in the last 10 years. I still remember plain xbox games that had bugs and you were stuck with them, the first time my xbox 360 patched a game I was in awe of the tech, then a year latter I wass annoyed at having to wait 2 mins for bug fixes, that use to be stuck with for life.You can't go solo some bandits for exp instead your running like coward dragging bandits into gaurds, and looting other peoples kills. Or my fave trying to gather enough to kill a trade caravan or at least just the weaker traders, so you can loot their backpacks full of goodies, and once their guards clean up, you look for a bandit leader, strip him naked, heal him pick up and collect his bounty at the nearest town lol.You can now start a outpost early and work on your own little prodution empire, but beware doing so means a lot of running since the start that lets you do so doesn't have any real armor, weapons, or skilled fighters so you will get chased out of your outpost on accasion. Much better to assemble your own team and train in the desert while buying goods low, and selling high between towns. That way you are attached to your men/women there not just worker 1-6 you know them by name. Of course you do end up hireing worker 1-6 still but they are just production fodder, the crew you trained from scratch are their gaurdians and masters, who can work along side them in time of peace. To me it isn't just about making my own outpost and sitting in it waiting for traders to come and buy my goods, its about the adventure, going out of the outpost taking on the cannibals, and bandits. Using the base to research a means to craft high quality gear, and train old worker bees into soliders to assit my core team in picking fights with people who use to mop the floor with me.And next up on the roadmap diplomacy, making it so factions interact with you. Especialy nice for the people who turtle up in the outpost and never leave, they will have to deal with demmands, raids and the nicer things that goes with faction interaction			"

								First things first, this game is a gem. It's a squad based sandbox building game with a cool world and lots of rewarding levelling and progression. Even with minimal dialogue you will feel attached toe ach and every one of your squad members more and more as you go along. Now for the downside, this game is a long time coming, and is being developed LITERALLY by one guy. Progress is slow but it's always making progress. This game is well done, and while there are some bugs it's potential is limitless. If you like independent game development, and this sounds even mildly entertaining to you, buy this game. It's cheap and it supports original, independent game development.			"

								This is one of those games I go back to every couple of months.  Every time it's a different experience, but that core aspect is still there: ""Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""  I laugh sometimes at the strategies I come up with.  ""perhaps getting my butt kicked daily as a slave will be a good endurance grind...""  I keep a special post-disaster savegame named Whatthehelljusthappened for when I get suprised and I use it often.The developers are very ambitious.  They had a great base game going, then they threw out the map with the experimental version, and replaced it with a huge continent.  Only about 1/8th of the new map is available for play right now and I'm simply amazed at the detail that was put into it.  They added animals and creatures out of nightmare.  Different humaniods, religious motivations, pets, crime and punishment.  There are still lots of bugs to get ironed out.  CTD is common, but with a decent autosave, it hasn't ruined the game for me.			"

								I bought this game almost 3 years ago and little to no progress has been made. Its notorious for crashing and whenever they do update the game the previous saved files never work. I like the idea behind it and like the theme. Steam needs to crack down more on developers that hook people with a ""early access game that will never be completed in this decade."" If you do not want to shoot yourself in the head, do yourself a favor and don't buy this game.			"

								This game has a lot of potential, however I am not sure they will take it on. Early game: Early game last a very long time, partially because it is difficult to get skilled out of early game.This part of the game is boring, repitition and grants no sense of doing anything.  You go find a group of baddies, lead them to town, help the guards fight (if you call it help), loot and sell, buy guys and gear, repeat for hours.Mid game: After you have enough guys, lets say 20 to be safe, you can buy up a bunch of building material, find a spot and start your own town.  Hopefully you can win about 20-30% of the fights by now.  This is where the game starts to get interesting finally.  Unfortunately I started this too soon, unable to actually win most fights makes my 12 guys unable to hold up my base.Short of it:  The game is as grindy as an MMO, but makes winning more difficult at first.  Based on the description, I believe it will become too easy late in game, if I could get to that point.  Thus I believe the mid-game is about the only part with any play value, considering how long it takes to get to that point I would not suggest starting again with a new goal unless you like watching guards grind.  With the description by the Developer the world will not change, hense long game you'll be so tough it will be boring from the lack of challenge.  This is why I don't believe the game will ever reach it's potential, and why I cannot recommend it.			"

Skyrim costs less than this right now. You'd be crazy to not get that instead.			"

								Kenshi is a sandbox, open-world game where you can theoretically ""do anything"" however there really isn't much to do at this point.  There seems to be a lot of potential with this game but I found myself lost and bored rather quickly.  I haven't played it for very long so I will update review if anything should change.PROS+ Many skills to improve+ Lots of craftable buildings and items+ Faction system seems promising+ Building your own base is funCONS- Huge world is virtually empty- Interface needs improvement (can't read half of it)- Towns are bland and uninteresting (most NPCs say the same thing)- Inventory management sucks (one piece of armor made of rags takes up HALF of my inventory?!)- Huge learning curve with very little tutorial info (and no tooltips)- Moving characters while manipulating camera is a pain- Game clearly plays like an Early Access title (obviously unfinished)			"

								I like early access, getting involved, helping the dev... and true, I've made some purchases that I regret but this game is up there on my list of disapointment. I was taken by the concept's idea and potential this game has but... it's so early in alpha that it's barely stands on it's legs. It's so buggy and unattractive, even the UI is horrible. Looking at the main menu, it's just as bad as something I did awhile back, and I'm an amateur with no formal training. Development is taking forever with few major improvements to show for it, which is expected from a small team but regretable. The dev should perhaps focus on fixing (and perhaps overhaul) the UI to be more user-friendly, making sure everything is simple and smooth before making additions and balancing. I can't reccomend this at this time given how slow development is aswell which is a shame because the concept is quiet good.			"

								If the worst an early access game can be is hot unplayable mess (0-1/10), and the best it can be is retail worthy gem (9-10/10) - this game currently sits just above interesting shell of a game (3-4/10).  I think the potential is definitely there and if you buy games on potential, than it is definitely something you should consider spending your money on, especially if you think the idea of open world games without forced narratives is something large companies should be looking into at least once.  If you like things that you can play, and are optimized, and work well - I would completely pass on this as it stands today.  "

It wouldn't be worth a Downvote because of it's Early Access status, but considering how minimal the development progress is and how many years of development this game still needs, i cannot recommend to pick it up. It's a prototype on it's way to Alpha.When you buy it now and see no real improvement when coming back after one year you see that the game was clearly not ready for any kind of release.The Developers should have started with a smaller project with better chances of finishing it in a decent time in order to get their funding for a bigger project.

They're hard to kill but don't worry about that because when there are 2 dozen attacking you that doesn't matter anyway. Thats about the most threatening thing in the game right now because the only other enemy to engage are bandits, most of them are stuck on the cliffs around the terrain...not moving.To sum up;Potential= Lots (the reason we all decided to support this Alpha in the first place)Bugs= LotsLag= LotsUnbalanced gameplay= LotsContent= VERY lowProgress= VERY SLOWThis development team really needs to put in some work before this game is even close to enjoyable, at the moment this is the only early access game (Of many) which i've bought on steam were i feel ripped off. :-(			"

								Do not get this game until they come out with an overhauling update, it is not worth it at this time. The content is very limited and quite hard to get a good start. Pretty much at the moment the only way to begin is to get people to kill the bandits and then loot what is left. There is much do to other than wander around, trade, and build a town. It is pretty fun to build a town but very hard to get to that point unless you pick the trader group start. The game has a lot of potential but glitches, diffiulcty, and not having much to do really doesn't make it worth the buy at this point in time.

								To begin, i know there has been some critical negative reviews, and i would like to explain them.The game has been in development for a long time, but when it was on indiegogo in 2012, it raised $2,315 dollars, when they wanted $40,000. So development is not going to be quick until their revenue.Since then, ive seen a vast improvement in the game, the development has really sped up in the last 12 months, as there is now a larger dev team and they can afford to focus on different aspects of the game.Now onto the game itself:Pros:-Game is definitely playable now, with alot to do, and a variety of things to aim for.-Can be modded easily (if so inclined), to increase the content and improve the game, although it doesnt need to be if you dont want to.-Immensely enjoyable, you can start in nearly any situation, as a single guy with a broken arm and a iron club,as a dedicated group of people ready to build a dream city, and plenty of other options.-The dev team regularly react to forum suggestions, and you can often see a direct impact of uploading crash reports.-Only £13-Alot of options of how to play, and there is something to do at the early, middle and late stages of the game. Starting an outpost, building up a core group of fighters, and then maybe even starting a war of sorts with some of the cities.-Everyone can level up in the game, the NPCS will get stronger if they fight, you can get stronger by winning (and sometimes losing) fights. -Nothing is guaranteed. There is a chance, albeit a slim one, that you can beat someone much stronger than you, as long as you get a lucky shot in. But that works in reverse, you could be KO'd by a hobo bandit when you can usually take on 10 of them, if they get a lucky shot.-However, my favourite feature is this: You are not special. You are not unique. If you fight someone stronger like you, you are not going to win very often. When you start, everyone, even the hobo bandits with rags and iron clubs, will easily beat you in a fight. But because of how some character stats work, this isnt neccesarily a bad thing, as by being beaten up, you improve, you build up a defence, and become harder to beat up next time. Fast forward abit, and you can easily kill a hobo bandit.In the view of being unbias:Cons:-Alpha game, so expect bugs, expect the game to lag and glitch out occasionally, and sometimes to crash completely. But by making use of the Autosave function, i've managed to make it so i rarely lose much progress. (I also sometimes use the crashes as a cue to stop playing, since you can get sucked into played for along time.)-Potentially long waits if you are beaten up in a fight, on max speed, i sometimes have to wait a minute or two for my guys to wake up after a knock out, which can get a little annoying, but i guess its a motivator to become stronger and not get beaten up.-Sometimes slow development. As i explained earlier, the development was slow for the first few years, but now due to a big dev team, it has sped up significantly. However, when new features are added, new bugs arise, sometimes making the game unplayable. This is usually resolved within a few days, and is sped up by uploading your crash reports to the forum.I cant think of any more cons. It seems bias, but thats because there are more pros than cons.I hope this has helped you make a decision, and just think: If you're worried about slow development, buy the game, and your money will help to fund it, causing development to speed up.Thanks for your time.

								Broken beyond belief.What most say is that it's hard to get into, but what I say is that it's easy and welcomming to start out but the further you go, the more issues you'll see.It's in its core a cool game: Open world, do what you wish to do, no boundries set ... kinda . BUT it isn't. You're bound to the limitations of the engine itself, not the world, and besides several crashes while exploring (This one has big issues with memory leaks) it turns out to be a sure chore to play because of lacking gameplay options and bad AI.Let's do a quick Pros and Cons list, shall wePros:-Sim's like gameplay, where you chose what each of your crewmates do in a specific order-RTS type gameplay where you order you band of survivors by a drag and command interface-Promotes a Macro gameplayCons:-The AI often get stuck in a loop even if you've given them clear priority orders-You'll be doing a lot of pausing to control everything, or waiting for loads-Shallow and uninspiring world -A LOT and I mean a LOT of micromangement-Squad based RPG they said .. so how come my sqaud can't move in formation? Fast characters run ahead, get in trouble while the resque team is minutes away.- Start out as a weakling, and I mean WEAKLING.

								I think this game deserves all the support it can get.  In it's current form, there's not too much to do.  It's glitchy.  Sometimes you start off the game and NPCs are sky high and weapons slowly bury themselves into the desert just to make the game even harder.  And dead ally NPCs never disappear from your HUD.  Sometimes you put down an injured ally and suddenly they fly 10,000 meters northwest.  Yet this review isn't supposed to dissuade you from purchasing Kenshi.  These bugs are being thoroughly adressed, ableit slowly, and the creator really seems to have a passion and committment to his game.My opinion is that Greenlight is the worst thing to ever happen to Steam, it's flooded my beloved platform with CRAP.  I'm thankful that Kenshi made it through Greenlight and is one of the few redeeming releases in the sea of turds released from Greenshit.  It looks to be a great RPG, though I have my doubts whether the all the auspiciously planned features will be available, I have full confidence that Kenshi will be a fully fledged, fully fleshed out, vast and enjoyable game.Please buy it, try it, and support the dev team with crash logs.  They seem to really care and try.			"

								Gave this game a fair shot aannndddd....A vast open and overall EMPTY world, just played a little after giving the dev team over a year to put in the long awaited content which is being labeled as 'potential'seem to recall that the team was working on the communication system over a year ago but for now 99% of NPC's are mute ghost who add nothing of value to the game.Oh there are 'dogs' and they're new since the last time i played. They're hard to kill but don't worry about that because when there are 2 dozen attacking you that doesn't matter anyway. Thats about the most threatening thing in the game right now because the only other enemy to engage are bandits, most of them are stuck on the cliffs around the terrain...not moving.To sum up;Potential= Lots (the reason we all decided to support this Alpha in the first place)Bugs= LotsLag= LotsUnbalanced gameplay= LotsContent= VERY lowProgress= VERY SLOWThis development team really needs to put in some work before this game is even close to enjoyable, at the moment this is the only early access game (Of many) which i've bought on steam were i feel ripped off. :-(			"

								Do not get this game until they come out with an overhauling update, it is not worth it at this time. The content is very limited and quite hard to get a good start. Pretty much at the moment the only way to begin is to get people to kill the bandits and then loot what is left. There is much do to other than wander around, trade, and build a town. It is pretty fun to build a town but very hard to get to that point unless you pick the trader group start. The game has a lot of potential but glitches, diffiulcty, and not having much to do really doesn't make it worth the buy at this point in time. I will change this review once a decent update comes out.			"

								It's quite a fun game, and worth the price. Sure its still being made...and sure enemies will sometimes walk over your walls...and your characters have a phobia of keeping the gate closed and will open it when your not looking...but...Despite the bugs its still an awesome game to play. and its team is definitely deserving of more support they've been working on the game 4,or more  years before it hit Steams EA program. and 2 or more years since then . They're dedicated to making the game their 'dream' game so the team is somewhat small. so progress doesn't happen as fast as we'd like but its a quality game.You take on the role of a down an out swordsmen...or sword post really cause..you'll spend the first 60mins getting beaten to death . an if you manage to survive >.> you'll be eaten by a pack of dogs who didn't like you building a house in the middle of nowhere.11/23/2016 : After 300+ hours , i still think its worth getting. It has improved a lot since i originally made this review.it also has had a workshop for a little while now so there are a lot of mods to keep it interesting and make it harder....or easier if you desire. You still get beaten down , an potentially eaten by a giant ostriche but..........thats life!			"

Early Access Review
								I purchased this game over a year ago, and it's been fun to see how the game has progressed. Kenshi has a special place in my heart as it was my first Early Access game, and it gave way to a horrible EA addiction; My personal views on the game: -Being Early Access there are a number of bugs, but the majority of them are so minor as to not be noticed and tend to be fixed quickly. Overall I've only come across one bug that caused me to quit playing, but it caused me to quit for a number of months. Recently however I decided to give it another try, and I'm very happy I did, the work that the Devs have done have been amazing, and the bug had been fixed. -The Gameplay is quite fun, albeit can be slow to get into at the start of a game, and the premise is unique, which I appriciate. -Once the initial slow start was over I found the game to be fairly immersive, creating seperate squads, each with its own purpose, town building, guards, labor, craftsmen, bounty hunters etc.-The Graphic are pretty good, and have improved significantly in the year I've had the game.-Updates can come slowly, but so far have always been worth the wait.Overall, aside from the Early Access bugs, and the occasional crash Kenshi is one of my favorite games, and I highly recommend it, however, as with all Early Access games, if you're looking for a finished game, this isn't it.

								As much as I'd like to write a positive review, I can't. Kenshi has a great concept, but it's just a bad game. Menus are hard to read and complicated, camera controls are infuriating, and there is no tutorial that I have found. I wouldn't pay 20$ for this, and I regret paying 11$. It is early access, but there is a lot of polish to be added before it will be worth any amount of money. Also, there isn't even a desktop icon. It seems like that would be one of the easiest things to add but the developers just don't care.			"

The limb/damage system is absolutely atrocious. I found myself just frustrated over the UI.Help menu was vague and a little helpful.Lack of explaining anything, anywhere.Building was fun, for 5 minutes then it was, meh.In the hours i put in the game i did not find myself at anypoint having fun, or doing anything squad based.This game can ♥♥♥♥ right off please.

								This game is absolutely obsurd. It promises sandbox game play? yea freaking right.  You are relegated to what amounts to be a 1 hit point character that get mobbed by 8-10 bandits if even think of leaving the city, you have no way to reliably defend yourself, training weapons takes forever! Seriously put your guy on auto attack ona dummy and go to sleep NOT FUN all skills are like that. The camera angles are wonky to say the least numerous buggs are still in effect for example I was returning a bandit leader to the police for a nice reward but they wouldnt take him so I put the bandit leader out and he immediately jumped up spawned some bad♥♥♥♥♥sword and took out the ENTIRE EFFING MILITIA apparently he was unkillable he then spawn camped me and any time i would wake up he would drive his sword through my skull. YAYA SO MUCH FUN! I managed to scrape together some materials and find a nice spot to set up camp but as soon as i did the bandits cam eout and demanded ransom which i couldnt pay and slaughtered my  one tiny shack. I bought this game on sale and its not worth it AT ALL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE even the origianl X-com wasnt this brutal. all your stats start at level 1 and any recruit you get also starts at level 1 so it will take you roughly a week to get any momentum up if you can survive the first 2-3 hours that is if your going to make yoru characters one shot kills to everything you need to have them advnace a lot faster than they currently are or SOMEWAY to buy a mercenary that can take on 12 bandits at a time since all you do at the beggining is run out find bandits run back in train the town guard ont hem then loot thier corpses then walk at a snails pace back with the little gear you CAN CARRY and hope the gear doesnt despawn when you go back or hope the bandits dont wake up and run away.Weapons are worhtless seriously you made a ninja/samurai game WITHOUT ♥♥♥♥ING BOWS??? READ A BOOK YOU IMBICILE!!!! THe game world is to large for how fast you can travel on foot. Desperatley need horses since you know samurai tended to be MOUNTED ARCHERS YOU JACK♥♥♥♥♥ Finding your way around town is difficult some towns dont have every shop and when you cant buy a backpack your well and truly screwed. theres no minimap no directional heading so you cant find your way around easily, shops are incongruously marked, I've yet to survive more than 3 hours without the game bugging out and forcing a restart, so i can't even comment on the whole ""Sand box building mode"" Weapon damage and armor are the most INANE system i've ever seen WTF do these damn numbers EVEN MEAN???!!! THAC0 was ten times easier to figure out than this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥combat ystem.  Guys if you want a city builder go get banished its way better than this. I wanted to liek this game so much....I REALLY WANT TOLIKE YOU KENSHI BUT JESUS EFFING CHRIST ALL MIGHTY YOUR A BIGGER TURD THAN JABBA THE HUT!!!!so reasons NOT to bu this game via bullet point1. Character advancement monotonous, slow, underpowered, and to complex to easily understand2. Slow travel times bog a slow game down even more have fun crawling to town with your loot only to get jumped by bandits and killed.3. A single starting character VS 12 bandits right  off the bat run or die. YOu need to have a party of 8-10 chars starting to even try and survive.4. Unstable gameplay can screw over all your hard work and set you back several HOURS.5. awful camera controls.6. Tooltips?? LMAO WTF ARE THOSE7.NO ranged combat all melee seriously give me a godamn bow go read some japanese/chinese hostory8. ugly ugly ugly graphics characters hover about 2 feet off the ground such lazy programming. Character models are very unrefined and buggy. Often times when using a bed my character sleeps upside pwn with his feet sticking up under the pillow and his head poking into the ground.9. Sand box! you'll never make it there and even if you do you get overrun by bandits so unless you ahve hired 50 recruits dont even think about it. I'm sure it would be just as bad a grind fest as getting your character up to that point. Hmm let me research for 5 hours real time how to craft a SPOON!!!10. Absurd combat system crafted by some demented lovecraftian spawn of cthulu locked in a extra dimensional pocket of agony.11. absolute BARREN landscape you will spend most your time zoomed out to max range watching a monotone brown desert, looking for tiny pixes that resemble bandits so you can run your name close to them and then run away to town having the town guard do your dirty work loot as many things as you can and hope beyond hope you can make it to town again without getting jumped by another 20 fuggin bandits. this game isnt worth 5$ if this was a 2.17$ i'd still be more entertained by wiping my♥♥♥♥♥with the code this game dares to present. If you are looking for a sandbox game go elsewhere. if however you are looking for an INSANE CHALLENGE to both your wits, and patience as a human being then get this game as each bug and each death and each set back will make you tear your hair out asking why the EFF DO I PLAY THIS!!!! The only potential this game has is how far the well of dissapointment goes down. YOu have a choice...YOu can take the red pill or the blue pill......take the blue pill			"

								Number 1, I happen to really like this game.  I purchased this game in Oct. 2014 and have spent over 318 hours trying to play it.  The constant crashes are the biggest complaint I have.  This game used to be semi playable and would stay operational for a couple of hours.  Sure it has been buggy with people sticking in walls and getting stuck inside buildings, etc., but it was playable.I do not know why the crashing problem has not been addressed but has been constantly ignored and instead other content of the game keeps getting added.    I stopped playing for a couple of months and waited patiently hoping that this problem would be taken care of in one of the patches.I have deleted all content and have reinstalled this game at least 2 dozen times.  Two days ago I decided to try and play again.  I reinstalled the game AGAIN so that all content would be new.  It allowed me to play a couple of hours then the crashes started once again.  On one crash it deleted all saved games and even the autosave game.I don't even mind my characters running backwards, I actually find it amusing and it doesn't stop them from operating machines or doing other duties assigned to them.   I check the integrity of the files and I seem to be losing 1-4 files every time after each crash.  Today my average game play time is 22 seconds before the game crashes.I really want to play this game, but 22 seconds between crashes is very infuriating even for someone with as much patience as I have shown towards this game.

								This was one of the very first games I ever bought in Early Access.  This game is part of the reason I avoid early access games like the corporatist plague they are. Raise Money! Fund Raising! Pump the Hype! Delivery at Minimal Cost! PROFITS!!!!!I am really sorry to see that this is becoming the norm for retail video games as it has become the norm in so many other aspects of our lives. Kenshi (and countless early access games now), is result of this system... The owners have no technical or legal mechanism to force them to complete the game in a quality or timely manner, and they have already had their money grab thanks to to Early Access and Steam. This game looks almost identical to what it looked like years ago when I bought it. Very little has changed in development. The question of whether or not is has ""potential"" is an excercise in futility when something has been around as long as Kenshi has.  The world is empty, there are no quests or missions, every NPC is identical with the exception that a few of them start the game hostile to each other. There really just isn't anything here, and until the game is released and the reviews start to change, iI would avoid this like a waste of money it is.You will probably get 10-15 hours of playability out of it in its current state. This is about how much time it takes to run through the research tree, level some characters, and get some production going.  Over the years as it has been updated modestly i have done a few play throughs (I refuse to not get my money out of it).			"

I've had alot of fun with it, while the content is not much, and the gameplay requires getting used to, you get a feel of apocalyptic bad assery.Update : 3/31/2016 - Beta ReleasedIts pretty good still, the new map is huge and has great variety between the biomes.

								this game looks super cool and to tell the truth it is but its not finished hardly even playable needs alot of work and it crashes more then you can even save. alot of ai and skills are broken. takes way tolong to even be able to kill anything should atleast make it so you can level fighting up faster or anything.right now if you get this game you will probaly be doing nothing but watching the screen while trying to build skills hopeing it dont crash or hopeing the random ai doesnt attack you for doing nothing like the police thats so boring. i understand its in early delv but its been out for years wtf. i feel they started out with a really good idea but when the cashflow came rolling in this game has been on pause and noone has cracked down on it in a while.if you notice ive played 27 hours of this game.and i havenot even done more then try to keep it on with out it crashing and my people are not even strong enough to take on a random unarmed person in town. wait and buy this when they finish well if they finish the game unless you like to waste your time. be ready to not be able to kill anything and get knocked out for real life hours waiting for things toimprove but i have not seen any improvementsince ive been playing good luck			"

								I bought this game shortly after it was released. Please for the love of your sanity do not buy this game, at least not yet. Ignore these positive reviews. Anyone that posts a positive review starting with some lame story is doing nothing but building the hype at thats all it is. You'll spend weeks just trying to get leveled up to be able to fight something and even then you'll still get pummeled. Right out of the gate you can't do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥to anything. All you can do is run through the desert and build your strength or running speed so you can lure enemys to the gates of a town so you can steal their armor and weapons. You can sell it or wear it but it still won't make a difference. You'll have to do this a hundred times before you can afford to even start building anything. Even after all of this you'll still not be able to kill anything, even with a group of hired hands. Moving around is ridiculous. I haven't seen such an awkward movement system since the alpha for ultima online and even they had something better than this. You'll right click to move and nothing will happen and you'll do this several times and still not go where you want your character to go. No W A S D controls whatsoever. The GUI is horrible, the character models and textures are disgusting. I've been back and forth with this game over the years hoping for some improvements but they've done very little. I cannot fathom how such little progress can be made in 3 years. If I look back at what it was then and what it is now I cannot see a bit of difference.			"

								I got the demo for this a few months back and it was buggy to say the least. Also felt like a game from 1998.... however I liked the idea for the game and thought id give it a go... Well the full game looked worse than the demo for me.. still the same bugs ( shadows all over the place, glitchy character etc) the controls and camera movement are awful, point and click would seem straight forward but after playing this.....half the time the character doesnt move when you click...some of the textures looked rubbish...(and yes settings are maxed out) all the buildings in main town look the same ..graphics is as i said from a 1998 game...i know graphics aint everything but they could be improved..I also felt the game was boring...no incentive to do anything...wondered about wastelands for ages only encountering the odd sand ninja (and i died lol) ... I know i didnt give the game much time on here.. but i did play the demo for a few hours ...It maybe an early access game but its been worked on for over 2 years and should be much better in my opinion (smooth moveme...especially when theyre charging £12.99 for it! Anyways thats my opinion. Dont buy it, plenty better deals out there that are way more fun			"

								Cool concept, execution is a little weak so far. The sense of scale is terribly off. Perspective, camera control, and controls in general are off. RTS controls are fine if you are handling multiple characters, but if you are handling just one character (as in some game modes) the controls are not intuitive.			"

								Not recommended unless you like copious heaps of trial and error and save scumming. You start out unable to kill a puppy. Haven't tried the other modes yet, but the experience marketed as the default experience should not have you be so helpless.

								I bought this game in the Steam Summersale 2013. I played it for a while and discovered that it was an unplayable mess, even for an alpha. 18 months later I tried again, thinking that maybe some of the bugs have been fixed and that the game would have some interesting content instead of just an empty desert. I don't know what the developer(s?) did between those months time, but actually trying to make a game was not one of them. Virtually no progress had been made and I am convinced that this junkheap of a game will never ever actually be anywhere near finished.			"

Build a city using blocks or run around and get killed by groups of enemies. I know this game is in alpha, but games like this make me never want to buy early access again. The updates are so slow that it feels like the dev said thank you for your money now♥♥♥♥♥♥off.

Made a hap-hazard character and BAM! Into a town in the desert I go. Then, it was the war of the camera angles and rotation and direction and ... this game has the balls to have a DLC out when it's not even working properly to begin with. Skip it, go buy something else. I'd get a refund if I could.			"

								This game reminds me of a skit I once saw from a television show on IFC. I believe the show is called Portlandia, and the sketch was Bicycle Movers. A lady calls movers to get her moved into her new house, so that she can sell the old one, and two people show up on a tandem bicycle pulling a toy red wagon. The lady grows increasingly frustrated as she continues to pay both mortgages, her items get broken, and they even move her things to the wrong house. All the while,they keep giving the excuse that they are bicycle movers and trying to sell her on the concept that they are somehow  the best choice. The are hip, independant, and cutting edge alternative.This game does precisely the same thing. It sells you on the idea that it is ""Hip, Indie, and Cutting edge"" It says its a squad based RPG, and in early access. When it arrives, you realize it isn't even playable, and things continue to get worse. All the while, nothing ever changes and when you ask why it is still in alpha after two years, people keep telling you how this is a, ""One man dev crew..."" and ""it will be everything you ever dreamed once its finished"". The problem is that both the experimental and main versions are essentially unplayable most of the time, and even when they are, there is nothing to do but wander around aimlessly getting in fights. Fights which by the way, you have little to no control over. The excuse of this being a one man Dev team is absurd. If that is the reason for this being in perpetual alpha, why isn't there a warning about that in big bold letters above the game page? No such warning existed when I purchased it! I don't care how great a craftsman someone is, I don't want one person building me a house by himself. Life is too short for such nonsense. Besides, from what I have seen, this game doesn't come anywhere near delivering what it promised it would. I hate to break it to the developer, but he is not a great craftsman, and this game is begining to border on being a scam. If this were something that no one but a great visionary could achieve, I could at least understand going it alone, but it doesn't look like the vision is much more than an occoasional passing interest on the part of the developer. I for one think refunds need to be issued to all who purchased the game. At this rate, the developer, and the rest of us, will be dead from old age before the game is completed.  Or better yet, try to sell the idea to a company who can get it finished. Either way, it is clear this game is taking to long to develop. By the time it gets anywhere, technology will have changed so much that it will look siilly and cartoonish. Of course it already looks silly and cartoonish.			"

Early Access Review
								Admittedly I only played about an hour of the game, but hear me out.Kenshi's early game is extremely painful. I understand the game is supposed to be bleak and hopeless, and it's post apocalyptic, but the early game is boring and long. Every guide I've found to this game revolves around one theme: ""DON'T GO FIGHT THINGS. LITERALLY ANY ENEMY IN THE GAME CAN KILL YOU 1v1."" I gave it a shot though, and died horribly. Then I played the way the game told me to: Wait for a patrol, tag along, find lewt, sell lewt, buy better gear. It was half an hour for the patrol to finish on the fastest speed, and I had a slightly (.1 better damage) better sword, and half of the requisite money needed to hire a new guard. Enemies are hard to find, the map is difficult to navigate, and the early game is uneventful. Eventually I'll give this game more time, but honestly it doesn't catch me as early as a game should. I'm not super motivated to find more content. I hear the game is ""Deep"", and that the crafting is rich, and you can build your own town. Just how much of the boring roaming through featureless monotonous landscape hoping to find corpses do I have to endure before I get to the fun stuff? If you want a squad based game, I hear good things about Banner Saga. If you want strategy, look at Starcraft II, or Novus Aeterno on the horizon. So near as I can tell, this game isn't worth the twenty dollars.			"

								It is a charming idea, and a very ambitious project, but kenshi is not ready to play.  The camera is the most annoying part, since it neither follows nor travels particularly well, and the mouse implementation can be very confusing.  The set up is not bad, but I would vary the textures a bit more and add considerably more content before I put it out, even as Early access.Congrats on a lovely idea, and getting this far, but as far as buying it is concerned I would wait for another six to twelve months.OH, and please deal with the UI it is really small and hard to read due to colour.Good luck			"

								Well, people, don't buy the game.I like the game and if you think that paying about 20 something euros or dollars or whatever currency you have for playing about 50-100 hours or maybe some more is worth it then go ahead and buy it.BUT. The game crashes all the time, the pathfinding is terrible  especially with those walls. You really can't just enclose a place with walls and expect to be safe inside. Most things will find a way to get in somehow.And finally, I bought this game some years ago with the expectation and the promise that it would be finished a year or max 2 years later.Well, that didn't work out so well for the devs now did it.So, seeing as it will never be finished and that it can get annoying as ....

								Still waiting for a game in this somewhere. It's not a bad program, as it stands - looks kinda cool, the dudes can do interesting things in a potentially interesting setting. Just, beneath the desert garb there's a skinny undernourished engine.The sum of all there is to do, aside from (alpha level, and expected) crash, glitch, bug and loading, is run around a bland, have my group perform a ninja dance and run on to the next dance performance with limps and loot, hopefully with the shoddy path-finding not dropping someone from the running.Trade? Minimal, and tiny profits, with a static supply/demand - this town will always be a place to stock up on armour plates cheaply, and offload steel bars at a profit .City building? Dull slog, with little to do aside from wait for more resources to be mined. Exploration? Empty desert, becomes empty swamp, becomes empty grasslands.IMO, combat the area that Kenshi is pretty good at making visually appealing (even if combat is largely moving towards the enemy, and letting a hands off free-for-all happen) is a means to an end - to produce opportunities and increase what I can do in the game. Being able to take on tougher groups of bandits just makes the ninja dance more difficult, not more interesting. A tough group can take on a town, and receive little opportunity or satisfaction.There's a lot of promise in the game, there's a lot of interesting things that need some work to become engaging. But there's not a game worth playing. Yet. So, I see why people are burnt/have been burnt out by Early Access, because even when the game is finished in however long, I've played the demo and rarely enjoyed it.Refund? No way. Well worth the price of it on sale, or for someone absolutely okay with a gamble on it clicking with them, despite the flaws mentioned. But with the reason of  'supporting the developer' or expecting to play an enjoyable, engaging game? Best find something else.			"

								Save your money. There is absolutely no gameplay in this game. Combat is right clicking, sitting back and watching, there is no challenge or skill, just grind.It's advertised like a samurai mount&blade with base building. What it really is, is a barrel landscape with nothing to do.99% of the map is a barren mountainous desert with no features besides towns you can visit. You start out with a weak guy, and then you decide what to do from there. Maybe appropriate for people that play D&D or minecraft, happy to pay money for a blank slate for you to paint your own picture. But if you've paid to be entertained, you would get more value out of a chocolate bar.I promised myself never to buy into alpha games, after getting ripped off buying towns, now I remember why. This game is the next abandonware project I've mistakenly paid into thanks to an impulse frontpage 40% off sale.			"

								Ugly as sin. Buggy with many crashes. The control system is not intuitive. It seems like you spend 97% of the game clicking the right mouse button. You need to search the internet for help with figuring out the most basic things. It feels like the game's developers had never actually played a computer game made since the year 2000 or seen a modern user interface.I suspect that if you are willing to fight your way through it is probably an interesting building / squad game. Frankly I just don't have the time to go back to the old days of gaming where figuring out how to play the game was half the battle. If you want to play this game be prepared to put in 100 hours.

								Had this before it came to Steam - was buggy then, and buggy now.  There is a lot to like about this title, especially some of the ideas being implemented, but after several years of dev time, seeing how difficult it is just to do basic things, it simply isn't reassuring:Just entering buildings can be hit or miss - the interiors won't load sometimes and once that happens, you'll have to reload the save/game just to get it to function right again.Mining - well, this may not be a simulation, but in real life a person can swing a pickaxe about three times in the amount of time it takes for one swing in this game.Crafting - why have crafting when you can't gather basic resources - I can mine iron right from the get-go, but can't gather any other resources...?!?The map - why advertise a huge map only to find that most of it isn't accessible - not sure if it is unlocked in the experimental branch, but the game is already experimental to begin with (EA).Optimization - not just loading lag, but pretty much every other type of lag there is too.I'll put it on the back burner once again, pull it out in another year or so, and see what the progress is.  I'd like to see some real progress on it and hope people support it, but I can't actually recommend it right now.			"

								This is proof that early access needs regulation. In the several years since I paid for this game, updates have change very little beyond textures, crafting mechanics, or bugfixing . I won't claim to know what the devs intentions are, or what the hell has them too busy, but the point is that Steam shouldn't allow projects like this to be sold on their market. It's a dying and wheezing animal, and theyre never going to finish it. The two things you see most people bring up are that it's in alpha ( as if that were an excuse), or that it has some great potential. Both of these statements mask what people are really feeling. Buyer's RemorseIf I ever meet Gabe Newell, I will motorboat him until he shuts this project down.			"

								I do not recommend anyone buy this game as it is now. I will say the concept of the game is great but I see little action going in manifesting these concepts into a great game. UPDATESIts been half a year now since there was an actual update. April 14th was the last true update there was one or two more that are in the experimental version only, but the game has so many bugs in the ""stable version"" that I would be hard pressed to attempt to play it any other way. I dont believe another update will ever come, but when they do they are normally small and feel much more like a fix patch than an actual update. My belief is that this game is going to go down the road of many starter games and the developer will stop altogether and move on. You may feel you got your money worth, but personally I expect more from a developer. I will say just recently the developer talked of some plans, but being that I have seen nothing since April come from these plans makes it nothing more than talk. In summary, if you like the concept and think it will eventually pan out then pull the trigger. However before you do, ensure your ready to wait a very long time before its completed.			"

								I bought the game not that long ago and I'm getting fatal crashes every 10 minutes or so and I've tried all of the tips that everyone has said in all of the forums. It is a huge pain, but it's the only thing stopping me from telling everyone I know about how awesome Kenshi is. On that note, the game is still in alpha and I understand that I should expect some glitches or bugs, but for the money I spent on the game, I would expect at least some more support on solving this issue as the content of the game is quite sound and there's more than enough to keep up tied over until the developers fix the fatal crashes.At it's current stage (APLHA) this is my review;Audio: 7/10 - Ambient sounds are good, with the wind speed increasing when you increase game speed.Visual: 6/10 - For what the game is and how well it ran on my machine, the graphic content was sound. There are a few bugs and randomly whilst running your path may take you through a rock throwing you up into the sky.Content 8/10 - The content is great, there is enough in the game to have me spend hundreds of hours playing it. The dev's are focusing a lot of their time on new conent however this is a problem as per my gameplay review.Gameplay 3/10 - The problem exists with the majority of players that the game crashes between 2 minutes of game play through to 1 hour before it's inevitable fatal crash. This is the only problem that I have found with the game, as there are new concepts of AI and strategy bringing a very fresh new idea into the market.Replayability: 8/10 - Even with the game crashing every 10 minutes and without saving your progress you may have just wasted a lot of time, I have found myself putting more and more time into the game only to be pleased with the accomplishments (and a little let down by the crashes).So we have this amazing game right here, with fantastic content and new ideas but the major fatal crashes every few minutes is a huge problem. The game is in alpha, and if you are to purchase the game, keep that in mind. The dev's need to focus more on fixing the issues that are stopping the people from playing their game before moving onto making new content, at this stage, it's like the worlds best coffee being poured into a broken mug. You're unable to enjoy the coffee because the mug needs to be repaired.Final verdict: Kenshi is an amazing game with some brilliant ideas. I can see this game being played by all different types of gamers and possibly bringing in people don't generally play games. The only problem with buying it now, is that it crashes constantly and reducing your quality of game time. At this stage, I'm not going to recommend buying it for the simple fact that it is marginally unplayable. Once this is corrected or the final version is released, you'd be stupid not to buy it, just hold off for now :)			"

								English/Italian review:(First of all, look to other reviewers time played, thinks about it, kenshi is a game you can play max from 5 to 40 hours before you close it and wait for an update)After months and months of waiting, even if the game idea was great, the programmers aren't so great, they aren't able to program the game and this can be confirmed from last update where the game was downgraded with more bugs and crash than the old version even the experimental one. The problem about this game ""for me"" are the laziness of the devs, they work on the game not so much and at losing time and even they haven't the competence to concretize this project who will fail for sure after all this time. I suggest to not buy the game now if you don't like to trash your cash, the only things work good in the game are the bugs and the crashes, even the complaints on the forum community as this one(review) aren't well accepted and can be resolved in a permanent life ban from kenshi community as the one i recived.Dopo mesi e mesi di attesa, nonostante l'idea di gioco è ottima, i programmatori non lo sono altrettanto, non sono capaci a programmare e questo si può constatare che l'unico update rilasciato dopo più di mezzo anno, ha solo peggiorato il gioco rendendolo ancora più instabile di quanto gia lo fosse. Il problema di questo gioco è che i devs a mio avviso personale sono pigri, ci lavorano poco e a tempo perso e in più non hanno le capacità per concretizzare un progetto che ormai dopo tutto questo tempo sta ovviamente fallendo. Sconsiglio vivamente di comprarlo per ora, sarebbero soldi buttati via in quanto l'unica cosa a funzionare bene nel gioco sono i bug con i crash e le lamentele in forum non sono ben accette e può accadere che, dicendo o esprimendo pensieri come questo che ho appena espresso ci si può guadagnare solamente un ban a vita dalla community di steam.Edit: After 2 years.... the game is more buggy, lost 32bit support, continue crash, more bugs are added with new (1/8) map.I start play again 2 days ago(experimental) and now, new bugs was released with a patch who make my game wasted, all builded things disapered on load game. As for 2 years ago, the game seems to be convulted and not evolved. Sigh! Ah, and im yet banned from steam kenshi discussion for the 2 years ago ""ironic example of no sense answer"" given to one fanboy who provoke me. So i think the moderator here ban all those who make complain about kenshi to make the board open only to the fans and not to the ""customers"".----*UPDATE*Game became updated more often, pheraps i start changing my mind if the things continue to evolve this way.

								I've really enjoyed playing this game, I like the concept and style it has. I've had a lot of fun building up a squad, taking on some bandits, carrying half my unconsious squad back to safety and building a small town. The problem is that the game has very little polish, you will run into bugs (including crashes) and incomplete features often. Its clear that the development process is more like rolling a snowball than working through a feature list.I'm sure the final version of this game would be great, and have a lot of replay value. I doubt that I'll ever play it, because I don't think this game will ever be finished. I love supporting start-up games, but in my opinion this game is abusing the trust of it's supporters.I would not recommend this game because of the very infrequent updates, long development time and no timeline for a final release even after years of development. Its a great idea for a game, but how could I recommend it when it's been in this state for so long with no indication it will ever be finished?			"

								I tried. But.. Unresponsive followers, lifeless boring towns, unintelligable stat systems, and shattered hope is all that you'll find here. 1. I would say diversify your map, but at this point it'd be better to just slice it in half and add the extra land mass later on. 2. Overhaul every aspect of combat, save animations. Combat is fun to watch, but 9 times out of 10 you will lose. Also, if your last person conks over, just give us that new game option immediately.3. Remove the gunky character creation system; it is a novel idea, but you are rarely zoomed in enough to care what your zerglings look like. 4. Make the x2 building and resource gathering settings the default. Waiting simulators are fun and all, but no.You either wait for a long time, and hope you can get something started, or you travel around like an ambulance chaser, shamefully following overpowered protectors as they aimlessly search the empty desert. I'll keep trying, but this game looks exactly the same as the day I bought it. Did they post anything about giving up on this game, or something?			"

								It's like a walking simulator...The game mechanics are tough to understand for someone new to such games and the game is extremely glitchy and some stuff that was supposed to work still does not function properly, overall the game is not very attractive or fun, The character models are all weird and stuff and the game is not ready to be played yet, it might get better, but as of now, i won't recommend that you spend your hard earned money on it. :/			"

								I have had this game for 3 years and I keep hoping they will un♥♥♥♥ it. but as of yet they still have not.  Let me give you a rundown of how the gameplay goes for the freedom seekers for example.  you start out with a group of settlers with the supplys to start your own settlement.  you venture out into a mars like desert and are quickly attacked by bandits. they kill everyone in your group. if you are lucky enough to have someone regain consousness they are unable to help the others without beds to put them in. being as you were slaughtered moments after leaving town you have no beds or a settelment for your people to heal in. game over. Ive started 15+ games  in the last 3 years and the same thing happens EVERY time!!!! you cant even take a lone bandit with your entire crew. this game is so unbalenced it is unplayable. unless you enjoy starting over and over again to watch how worthless the gameplay is.

								It's the second time I got seriously addicted to a single-player video game. The first time was with the first Kenshi demo, back in 2013-ish.I need to consult a doctor. Heeelp meeeeDespite it's flaws this is a great game. And I love the dev for working on it constantly, improving it for so long.			"

								The game is currently unplayable in its current state. Streamers with high end computers have stopped doing videos on the game because they are getting 1 to 5 count frame rates, Excuses are made for the game telling players to use previous patches instead of the current one but the bottum line is this is still not a beta game but an Alpha game that is unplayable due to lack of optimization. If your thinking about buying this game, wait another 3 to 6 months and see if the developers can get their act together then.			"

								I'll just start off by stating my personal truth: I LIKE THIS GAME! I REALLY DO! But as for why I'm putting this as a Negative Post, read below.This game is something else! I mean that in a good way. I'm sure finally reaching my post anything I say you'll have already read, but the truth is the truth no matter how many times you hear it.My experience has shown me that this game is really not that bad, in fact I'll admit that its down right addicting (check the play time on some of the posts and alot of them are well into the triple digits ((mine's no different)) ). But I gotta be honest the number of minor glitches (which I gotta admit are relatively small in terms of quantity in my opinion) that are biting at this game are the biggest pain of all. I realise that the game is early release and all but I honestly think if the development team focused their COLLECTIVE attention on ironing out ONE OR TWO BUG(S) AT A TIME and improved the stability of the game rather then trying to broaden the gameplay by adding new 'creatures' or 'bigger, better walls' then Kenshi would become one of those games you'll start playing after breakfast (or during in my case) and then when you get up to go to the bathroom (because you've literally reached you're limit) you realise you've been playing for almost 18 hours straight. I can admit that my statement above may not actually be productive, but when you've reached the point that you've spent more time trying to actually BUILD the perimeter of your outpost rather than enjoying the other characteristics of Kenshi, you find you're self thinking about not playing the game for a few weeks in the hopes that these particular kinks get taken care of when you come back.I won't tell you not to buy the game, but I will warn you, if you buy this game you're in for a few headaches and more than a few bouts of frustration. I, like many of the other posts, will advise you to WAIT on purchasing Kenshi for the time being.At least until there are a few less posts (both positive and negative ones) that are warning you about the bugs and stability issues. If you still decide to buy Kenshi, I can only hope the developer's have ironed out a few more kinks then there are now while i'm writing this post.			"

								The game has quite a learning curve to get used to, and is currently single player only (for those curious). Basically when you first start out you can't kill anything, anything at all because your character is so weak. You can also recruit an infinite number of people into your facton or party which is basically how you start your own town and build your own army.The reason why I do not recommend this game, is that the controls feel quite clunky to me, and that this game is extremely time consuming. You need to devote A LOT of time and, most importantly, patience when playing this. I have devoted a lot of time to many other games, but Kenshi does not feel quite as enjoyable to me, and I dont get that feeling of satisfaction from accomplishing something because quite frankly, I neither have the patience nor the willingness to put in hours of work into this game.Notice how I haven't really put that much time into playing Kenshi. But by reading guides, looking at other reviews, and looking at the game mechanics myself, it was pretty easy to conclude that yes, this game is extremely time consuming.The game also seems to be a bit buggy, a lot of the time doors will not open or close, your character and/or party members clip through walls, and bandits (or people who just want to kill you) will literally follow you FOREVER until they are killed. And good luck killing ANYTHING at all. The only way to kill even a couple of wandering banidts is to find a friendly faction or run to a town and let the guards kill the bandits for you. But be careful, because if the town's faction is friendly to the group trying to kill you, the town guards will simply ignore them and watch as they slaughter you and your party.From reading other reviews from players that have put in much more time than i have (30+ hours), the game hasn't changed all that much. When Steam early access first started, I remember Kenshi as being one of the first games to join Early Access. Since then, very little updates have been made. Check out their changelog, it's a jumbled mess of adding insignificant content (more cities, more armor, etc) when there are other bugs/balance changes that should be addressed.This is simply my take on this game that i honestly haven't invested that much time into nor plan to. You certainly have the right to agree or disagree with my statements, or justify any crude remarks with ""Oh, you just haven't played the game enough"", or ""You're basing your reviews off of other's gameplay expirience rather than your own"". I just can't recommend this game to anyone.			"

Early Access Review
								I downloaded Kenshi because it boasts an open world, a free roaming ""squad based"" game. Well, it is, BUT..What his game COULD be is amazing, sadly, the controls and camera ruined it. I spent my whole time moving around by right clicking too far off in the distance, losing my character, panning over a field to find him, only to find that I lost my dog.Well, you could double click their icons, but that separates you and if you double click your main hero, you're now separated from the group and it just feels clunky to find your way back.I didn't like how the camera was stuck, how you you are fixed at a certain crappy angle, and as you pan through the scale to find your team, you just fly through buildings and hills, and overall, it feels crowded and in my opinion, the camera/controls made it unbearable.I requested a refund, I felt it was THAT bad, and I'm typically a pretty forgiving person.I want to recommend this game, as everything else about it seems absolutely wonderful, but until they change the camera/control combination, I can't.

								So I start the game up, the character creation is cool and adds a lot of customization I spend some time making my character and finally have her they way I like. I spawn next to a house with two fields and two farmers and no tutorial or anything. I think to myself it's nice that they'll let me learn on my own and go in the house to look around, all I find is stuff I have the option to steal. I figure the farmers aren't really my friends because I have to steal to take stuff from the house. I went outside of the house and tried to cut down some trees, can't, go walking away a bit and find a bush which I want to interact with, can't, walk away a little farther away and find different trees to try and cut down, can't. I think to myself maybe I have to craft an axe but the crafting menu is empty... ok so I have to build something first maybe? I try to build a small shack but it requires 3 ""Building Material"". I go to look for something I can interact with to get building material, after wandering for like 5 minutes I find a rock I can mine, the magical pickaxe I can pull out of my♥♥♥♥♥appears and I mine the rock wondering the whole time why I can't cut a tree. I have some iron at this point and I figure ""This must be a building material."" I then try to build a shack again, can't. I realized that there is a tech research at this point for ""Building material"" but it requires I have a research bench which requires ""Building Material"" and must be placed in a small shack! I give up and look up a guide, you have to trade for ""Building Material"" this is the only way early game and I tried a few times to earn the money by mining rocks but they made me too heavy and bandits or animals would kill me everytime. The only way to really start the game is to aggro a bandit group and drag them into a town so gaurds fight them.This game lacks any direction, has no real goals, is beyond confusing to start, and extremely slow. I would highly advise NOT to buy this game.			"

								Kenshi would be a fun game if there were actually guides or something to help you find a direction to get started. Unfortunately the only way people suggest you start out is by luring bandits to towns, and looting whatever the guards kill, even the devs themselves suggest doing this. The problem with this is that it is not creative and not immersive. When guards kill something and you loot it and that's literally the ONLY way to make money from the start, it really is unrewarding and limiting. That alone should tell you that there are very few aveneus to take when it comes to starting out and making money. There are no jobs, no other skills you can use to make money like crafting, or anything like that. No, you can only do one thing at the start, that's it, and it's not even realistic or rewarding. I have had this game for years and have come back to it a handful of times to see if it has gotten any better, unfortunately it has not gotten better.			"

I'd go for not really, waging more towards the no, due to me not really having faith in the game ever reaching a state that does homage to the idea.Kudo's to the solo developer whom develops everything in this game apart from the audio, but I'm thinking it's another 3 years before this game is finished, and it is clear to me that the developer took on more than what he can deliver within a realistic timespan.

								The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 18, 1812 to February 18, 1815, fought by the United States of America against Great Britain, its North American colonies, and its North American Indian allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but Europeans sometimes see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). By the war's end in early 1815 the key issues had been resolved and peace came with no boundary changes.The United States declared war for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of as many as 10,000 American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy,[5] British support for Native American tribes fighting American settlers on the frontier, outrage over insults to national honor during the Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, and possible American interest in annexing British territory.[6] The primary British war goal was to defend their North American colonies, although they also hoped to set up a neutral Indian buffer state in the Midwest.The war was fought in three theatres. First, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Second, land and naval battles were fought on the U.S.–Canadian frontier. Third, large-scale battles were fought in the Southern United States and Gulf Coast. At the end of the war, both sides signed and ratified the Treaty of Ghent and, in accordance with the treaty, returned occupied land, prisoners of war and captured ships (though neither side returned the other's warships due to frequent re-commissioning upon capture) to its pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations without restriction.With the majority of its land and naval forces tied down in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a predominantly defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. Early victories over poorly-led U.S. armies, such as in the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than anticipated. Despite this, the U.S. was able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's Native American allies, ending the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Native American state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. U.S. forces were also able to make several gains and score victories on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813, seizing western parts of Upper Canada. However, a large-scale U.S. attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813. Despite the major U.S. victory at Chippawa on July 5, 1814, serious U.S. attempts to fully conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The U.S. then fell back roughly 30 km (19 mi) from Lundy's Lane to Fort Erie, where they withstood a siege for several months. The British eventually withdrew, but as winter set in, the Americans demolished the fort and fell back across the Niagara.In April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In the Deep South, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. In September 1814, the British won the Battle of Hampden, allowing them to occupy eastern Maine, and the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C. They were repulsed, however, in an attempt to take Baltimore and Fort Bowyer, and during their assault at Fayal. An American victory in September 1814 at the Battle of Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which, along with pressure from merchants on the British government, prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that London previously sought. Given that it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic, news of the peace treaty did not arrive before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815.[7]In the United States, late victories over invading British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring the United States national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"") and New Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a ""second war of independence"" against Britain.[8][9] The war ended on a high note for Americans, winning the final engagements of the war and bringing an ""Era of Good Feelings"" in which partisan animosity nearly vanished in the face of strengthened American nationalism. The war was also a major turning point in the development of the U.S. military. The poor performance of several U.S. militia units, particularly during the 1812–13 invasions of Canada and the 1814 defence of Washington, convinced the U.S. government of the need to move away from its Revolutionary-era reliance on militia and focus on creating a more professional regular force. Spain was involved in fighting in Florida but was not an official belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The U.S. took permanent ownership of Spain's Mobile District.In Upper and Lower Canada, British and local Canadian militia victories over invading U.S. armies became iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border.[10] The conflict has not been commemorated on nearly the same level in the modern-day United States, though it is still taught as an important part of early American history,[11] and Dolley Madison's and Andrew Jackson's respective roles in the war are especially emphasized.[12][13] The war is scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe.

								Update: 08/04/2017Wait until the release!The game gets pached on regular basis. The patches may not campatible with save game. There is option to import your save, but it is bugged (at least for me), where I lost my progress (e.g research even tho I ticked transfer research box)).Old review:-------------------------Kenshi is a brilliant idea with poor execution.The main reason I am leaving negative review is the game performance and bugs. I will get back to this later.Kenshi is an open world, RPG, city builder, squad manager, craft and survival with great mod support. I wish there were more games of this genre (RPG city builder, minus the survival). It would bring some higher standards and higher quality of the games of that genre.The first things first. Loading time is veeeery loooong (bad).The game has a number of different scenario starts (good). Character customisation is acceptable, there are a few classes available (ok).The first few moments in game were tedious, I was grinding my time just to eat and survive, even tho I used the lowest hunger settings. Then I discovered mods. So, I used no hunger mod, which would eventually introduce a bug when you find a hungry NPC that you want to recruit into your squad. After the hunger was sorted, I started grinding stuff for money and research accompanied by poor performance. I recruited a few squad members and started grinding stuff for more research and I eventually started building my outpost (city). Unfortunately, my attempt to grow or produce anything would be ruined by either hungry beasts or bandits. OK, I managed beasts and bandits well, but then a faction that was non hostile to me attacked me. All this was accompanied by a poor performance.If your outpost or squad members get attacked, there is no pause / notification and if you are in fast forward time mode, you are screwed. But hey, you can always reload your last save... that would take forever to load.Uh...Aesthetically, the game is not that appealing. The game world reminds me of Morrowind (that was the Year of 2002).Please do not get me wrong, there are so many things to do in the game that are fun (exploring, looting, fighting), but they are accompanied by poor performance and bugs.I really feel bad for discrediting the developers, because they put a lot of effort into this game. Maybe if they fix performance, I will be back.Did I mention poor performance and bugs?Maybe the fact that the game has been developed since 2009?Specsi7-4710HQ16 GB RAMGTX-980M			"

								Epic disappointment. I wandered the wasteland for an hour before I found anybody. And when I finally did encounter some bandits, there were 15 of them. THIS is the reason the Steam community has so many hours invested into this game. Not because it's fun, but because it takes forever to do anything.			"

								I'm sure if you have the time to put many many hours into this game then its great. From what i experinced in the short time i played, was bad camera movement and just a lack of any clue of what to do. Perhaps my copy was just bugged but the lack of tutorial that i got made the game almost unplayable and thus ended up spending a good days worth of just trying to find good guides and video tutorials and dont even get me started on the clunky and crowded UI. I fully suggest waiting till this game is fully released before trying it. However if you enjoy the exprimenting aspect of trying to find out what the hell to do then you will enjoy it! The idea of the game is great, It's just not pulled off in such a great way. "

								GUYS! DONT BUY THIS GAME !Hello guys, let me introduce yourself. I am one of donators who bought this game in early alpha. Now i am banned on oficial forum and developers try to cenzored my opinion and story on steam too. I was banned since I started criticizing the slow and illogical development. I was banned for evaluating the game I'm talking about here (it was banned many other critics)DONT TRUST TO DEVELOPERS:dont believe for progression update:All updates which they are adding to the game are only cosmetic changes. Important bugs which make the game unplayable (path finding, stuck NPC, disordered structures (stuck npc During production) and still doesnt removed and doesnt fixed, these bugs were in alpha which started few years ago and still exist in the game. = ZERO PROGRESSION, JUST COSMETIC CHANGES AND STRONG WORDS BY DEVELOPER ABOUT FUTURE PROGRESS... Do not believe what the graphic looks on pictures and arts:I have GTX 970 and the graphic is really bad and ugly!! Nothing change. But go on oficial website you will se perfect graphic, but its lie!Dont believe to promises:They many times said: game crash fixed(UNTRUTH), memory leaks fixed(UNTRUTH), performance improvments(UNTRUTH), UPDATES COMING(UNTRUTH = NEW BUGS COMING).THE GAME IS AT THE SAME STAGE AS FOUR YEARS AGO << TOTALY EPIC TRUTH! NOTHING CHANGES just adding useless updates which never fixed bugs > THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE. QUOTATIONS FROM OTHERS OBJECTIVE REVIEWS: "" I have only had it for the last year or so, and must say little work has been done in that time. Sure, a patch comes up every month or two, but only to add a new useless model, or a non working one. Something trivial that really adds too little to this beautiful broken sandbox. ""                                                                                                                  ""booyoov""""He patches it, breaks it, makes it unplayable, u wait for 6 months to a year for him to add content. Some thats not needed, he adds more buggs, and experimental versions. Been like this for the past 3 years.

""Panic""""But the fun doesn't end there. The forums are rather heavily censored and anything that isn't praise toward the developers is deleted and followed by a ban. As of now, I don't think people who don't own kenshi can even post there. This is clearly just an attempt to censor the forum more heavily.""                                                                                                                 ""Flappy""""This is an alpha game that CAN be fun if you ignore all of it's flaws and are dedicated. But my impression after testing it off and on for about two years it has changed very little since I first played it. More towns have been added. The character textures/models have changed as well as the clothing, stuff like that. But in terms of pure content addition, this is a game that has made absurdly slow unnaceptable progress. It's directionless. This is a game on steam. Why? It obviously makes money. So where is the money going? It sure isn't making true progress.""                                                                                                              ""Saphirum""and more, more others....			"

								Bort this game 2 years ago and I enjoyed it more then. It had bugs but it was enjoyable to play. I was able to survice long enough to start and maintain a health community that could survive a bandit attack. So after not playing for 2 years, I thought that would be enough time for the game to be finished. However in all that time the new features added are so broken that the game is unplayable (if fun is the goal). Lately gameplay is start new game, first town guard that sees me attacks me. Why? See a fight go to it to see if you can loot some dead body. What now it is stealing to loot a corpse it you didn't attack. In the early game looting corpses is the may occupation, however just standing near a fight will cause the guards to attack you. Why? my weapon is not drawn. This is all in the first town in the first 10 mins. Talk to someone town guard attacks you. Be a multi racial group town guards attack you. If you manage to get past the town guard and find a bandit, hopefully you don't starve to death first. Now bandit are rare thing to find. 2 years ago there was a bandit attack every 10 mins. Kill the bandit loot his corpse. Finally I have something to cover my naked chest. Go to town to sell loot. Town guard see me and kills me. I guess because I was wearing the bandits clothing I was a bandit. Makes no sense in any RPG game out there.There seem to be a complicated system for factions that is broken. As I said 2 years ago I thought that if they fixed the bugs and finished the crafting trees. All the game needed was some direction. There are no quest marker or any aid as where to go. There is not even a quest system. So if you get a quest go to the temple, that is it. No more info as to where this temple is. Needless to say I never found the temple. Even after running into every building in the town. A simple marker on the map and a icon above the build. How difficult would that be compared to trying to fix broken systems like slavery, factions etc. At this point that would be to much to ask for. I would be happy if I could play the game without getting attacked by the town guard for no apparent reason and at least know why in the starting town am I attacked on sight.This game had massive potential but I don't think the devs have the skills needed to manifest that potential. In 2 years the game is more broken than what it was. That is why I give this a thumbs down.			"

								The next is from my first around 5-10 minutes of attempting to play this game. Spoiler alert - after such initial reactions I doubt I'll play this before it stops being Earyl Access and since it was in development for like 2+ years and still... well... these. I doubt it'll ever will. I'm sorry developers, but if you make game about Japan or something with honor - you kinda has to have something similar yourself.1. My name (Alexander) doesn't fit into damn name box under character portrait2. His head doesn't fit into hairs and goes through them3. It just... crashed when I first go to character creation4. Hint for hold middle mouse to rotate camera doesn't work5. When it first starts - that area in launcer which looks like big text box... I thought it's text box. Apparently it's options. U click on a line and can change option. Very intuitive.6. By default it's not full screen and u can't scroll to full screen options in settings7. In windowed default mode main menu buttons just... drops somewhere to the right...8. There are no < or > texts on buttons on character selection...9. Apparently this was in development for around 2+ years (as of 2/3/2014)I just... what the hell did I pay for... as of February 3rd this game doesn't worth a single dollar.			"

								This is a good game, however the moderators and the devs need a reality check. In other words they want your money and not a comment on how to make the game better.After submitting even more bugs and getting told that this is the way the game is going to be, and they are not going to fix that as it is what the way they want it. I am again inclined to state that the devs only want your money and to shut the hell up!Bugs found, include but are not limited to:Characters litereally being chased across the map.. exploit. Needs fixed.Not knowing what buildings to and not to walk into as only half have signs up that indicate a vendor or non-faction usuable area. Exploitable...Terrain issues, including but not limited to : Misplaced rocks/ores Pathing breakage due to above.Roaming horeds above 20 characters in a group (LAZY PROGRAMMING HERE) to fix simply do (set initial group size 5 + (random (1-25) ) ) but they are too lazy to do this they just want your money.There are several more however the moderators and devs just dont care that there are issues with thier game that would make the game exceptional instead of just fair. Dont buy save your money.8-2-16Again I have attempted to play this game and again i notice these VERY same glitches and not impimented or broken mechanics. They are pandering to the public modding communty way too much and this is not only making the game Fecal matter, but is bogging the game down. have to stick w the same Dont buy ...			"

								I really wanted to like this game, the setting seems great, the depth seems great, the graphics are a little dated but I'm comfortable with that.But the controls are SO godawful that I simply can't play it. Camera doesn't move with you, camera controls are clunky, mouse for camera is inverted, movement is clunky.I can't recommend it based on the terrible interface, even if I think the game world and the mechanics show serious promise.

								Please remember this is early access.Right now the game is poor at best. The optimization is really bad. I have a high end machine and the frame rate is just terrible even with the settings turned down.Gameplay is in my opinion the worst part of the game. Starting out, your weak, poor, and frankly, you cant do anything about it. If you read disscussions on starting tips, youll find everyone says to hang around cities and let guards kill bad guys and then loot the dead. This is great advice as you are completely unable to do any fighting yourself and survive. So the game from the begenning is based on you playing a weakling coward who scavenges the leavings of other fighters. This just doesnt sit good with me. I would rather grind or do fetch quests to raise skill enough to do my own fighting. I find it insulting that a developer would make the game this way. No reccomendation untill they actually make a game instead of a buzzard simulator.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is probably the single worst entertainment purchase I have ever made and I saw Crossroads - the Britney Spears movie in theaters. I bought it during the early access craze based on it's potential 2 years ago. I bought Kerbal Space Program around the same time. KSP had its issues, but clearly had changes being made and steadily got better and has reached full release. Every so often I popped in this game and tried to play thinking it would be better in any way and it simply wasn't. I saw reviews stating essentially that you have to get 3-5 hours in before my complaints with the game are no longer valid (boring world, looks like garbage, clunky interface, shattered hopes and dreams) and while that may be true, it seems like Stockholm Syndrome to me. The fact that this game has been in ""Alpha"" since 2009 is just more proof that it shouldn't even be for sale.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game until it gets a full release. Don't be fooled by people who put in a ton of time and tell you it is great as long as you get over X, Y, and Z- it is just justification for wasting their own time and money. This is an incomplete, likely never to be complete, dumpster fire of a game. Value yourself and your time more - don't buy this game. I expect that this ""game"" will be a fully playable and complete game for its value around the time of the heat death of the universe.			"

								A lot of promise, but so little in execution.  Find a group and give the command to attack and hope for the best.   Finding a target is hard enough with the zoom being so restrictive. Its overly repeatative for the large expanse it covers.  Days can be had just exploring it all if your willing to deal with the constant loading and resetting of the game speed.  I'll give it a try a year from now, as it stands now I would not reccomend it due to the fact the amount of disapointment this game has generated will not fit in my inventory.			"

								game looked cool on the steam page but...........things do look cool ie graphics however they feel like really outdated almost like the first lara croft game almost if the graphics where like for example half life 2 the game would look amazing af my other issue was the settings and putting the game into big screen mode when i did this all i kept getting was a part of my screen that had no game on it and then i could see the bottom of my screen with all my stuff like app store internet and so on so i had to play the game in the non fullscreen mode but in a box mode .... some times the game would say ... game not responding ? not sure why but it happend a few times and crashed the game and  shut the game down .................. i think the game has chances at being grate but my other issue is the fact that the last negative review was 2013 or 2014 and the last comment in the comment bit on the help page was about the same 2013 2014 so the people making this game should really be on steam telling people what they are doing on steam not somewhere els ........... my other issue is that apparently this game was being made since 2009 .............. i mean as i say i think theres a chance it can be grate but theres a lot of things that need to change just to make this game full on grate			"

								Well...here's my 38 minute review:Had fun creating my character, jumped into the world (literally: my dude was floating in the beyond realm for 20 seconds before I hit the ground) surroundings looked lackluster (i know, it's in alpha status, graphics dont matter) but it was also extremely empty and interactions with my surrounding were limited. I went to pan the camera and the game dropped to single-digit FPS. Since movement is point n click, I went to click my way up a hill/up some steps into a house and my character kept running around until it got stuck on the steps.Then I took a deep breath, and got a refund.TL;DR: Left a bad first impression, hella buggy, rather buy a pepperoni pizza.

								Potentially interesting at release, but virtually unplayable as a game (even one in alpha) at this time. Its more a collection of cool features/tools than a coherent game.  The customization options avalible in game are nice, as well as construction is quite realistic (you have to carry heavy stone to build a building, potentially for miles). Combat is frustrating, even with the ability to pause at any point and change camera angles. But, the nail in the coffin is lack of instuctions on how to use some of the things that are implemented. Need to give it a few more months, unless your really into the development part of Early Access Games.			"

								I regret buying this game. This really burned me. I thought the concept was really amazing, I thought the graphics were decent for what we were looking at in terms of supposed game play. Let me tell you now why I would never recommend this game or ever suggest buying it.1. It is unplayable. Truly it is. It is so bad, incredibly glitchy, and it is insanely hard. There is no objective so you are left to wander about with nothing to do, you literally just try to survive. Which is damn near impossible. EVERY faction will hate you, and you cannot join a faction to gain allies.2. The build system is a joke. Like honestly I have nothing good to say about it. You will not survive long enough to dig far enough into. Once you reach a certain point a wandering group of 30ish bandits will just wander around your camp and kill everything. 3. There is no gameplay. There is no point like I said before, but needs to be said again. Like its just survive, which is cool in all, and it WOULD be fulfilling if it were not for the fact there is ZERO NPC or story interaction.In a nutshell I would desribe this game in the following way: basically it is a kid playing in a sand box, byhimself, with zero imagnination. You are alone, by yourself with nothing to do, you got two plastic army men and thats it. Oh and it is raining and squirlles are terrorizing you.  "

								The description of the game excited me. I found the execution of the game (at time of writing) did not meet with the excitement and expectation. The controls are very awkward. There is little indication in the game world of what you are supposed to do.When mining an iron resource, my character was actually severl in-game feet away from the rock. His pickaxe was actually digging into turf. After several minutes of mining the turf, there was nothing in my inventory.My character had a hunger attribute. None of my activities seemed reduce it (this may be an unfinished feature). My starting point was near some domestic beasts, but my character was not able to do anything with them.After running around the game world for about 20 minutes, trying different things, and getting lost, I refunded the game. That was a disappointment to me. Maybe as the game progresses in development I'll pick it up again.			"

								so, I bought this game on the recommendation of a friend a few years ago. I tested it and it showed great promise, like all of the sandbox indie games do.Then I closed it again. I had given the developers some money and I hoped for quick updates.But quick updates did not happen. This game is the slowest developing game I have seen. I'd rather wait for no mans sky to turn into a decent game than to wait for this one to get out of early access. "

								This game doesn't sell itself too well. The features are not there, the level of polish is abhorrent, bugs and glitches are abundant. It doesn't even look that good, with all the bland sand and rocks and ridiculous slopes and buildings that hang in the air. According to the author's blog, there's a lot in store for this game, but with the current frequency of updates, I'm not sure if it gets anywhere anytime soon.It actually makes me feel sad. The intentions are undoubtedly good, but after playing this game for some time - and waiting for it to improve for QUITE some time - I can't recommend it to anyone.			"

								Really bad. It has really big ambitions but upon doing some research, its like 1 guy trying to do all of this. He might be able to, but Im not subscribing to a 10yr EA (well, I already have). But that was 2014, a year which showed (and burned) a lot of consumers that EA is full of mainly garbage and here's why:Most of these EA games have H U G E ambitious goals. You read them and totally want to get on board. Dont. Research first, everything. Most of the EAs have to do so because they lackfunds (or manpower) to get the project done in any real / acceptable timeframe, so no real publisher is going to pick them, cause they are not ready for primetime, so to speak.REMEMBER this before you sign up for any EA - this one being the 1st I ever bought, I actually believed all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in the game description. Following up on the dev blog, I dont have a lot of hope in this game's future. Probably just gonna skate on the sales of this game while updating it for the next 5 years			"

I wanted it to be more fun for me. To me, this game is just so boring it hurts. I am sure plenty of people find this game fun. It seems pretty well made. The concept even sounds interesting... Maybe its the seeming total lack of any story that kills it for me. I feel no grand purpose for being. Maybe that comes later on... but the game has so many directions... literally any direction so it seems to have NO real direction... if that makes any sense.

Don't buy you will waste funds. Trust me I went throught this. Damn should have bught cossacks3 instead now I have to wait until next pay day. UGH! AGH! F@CK!Also loading it takes hours. I have the most advanced NVIDIA Graphics card i990 series and it lags a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton. If they would have hollowed out the mountians it would help however it lags any which way. To many pixels inside pixels and so on.			"

								   This is a dope game, probably what I like the most is how You make the story. Theres not some plot you have to wrap your head around or, scripted events that everyone sees. Its you and whoever you decide to bring, out there in the desert making it happen, however you decide that is. Theres crazy potential for this game and the direction its heading feels kindve familar...? but I know its new, idk.. Maybe because it incorporates systems from some of my favorite games, (FO2, TES4, DA1) but in a good way because nothing feels copied and its deff its own thing. When I set out to do something in this game and I accomplish it, I feel good about myself in real life and about my team in the game.    On the con side, I hear updates are slow, theres not a clear explanation of some systems, sometimes your just running around looking for action (i play a team of 3 bounty hunters, which kindve sucks because theres not like wanted posters or anything to tell u to go look for this person u kindve just have to run into someone with one.,) generally needs more to do, can only make white or arabic characters, bugs. All of which given time will probably be fixed.    For my summary, Dope now, Amazing later. if ur looking at this now nd dont end up getting it, u should keep an eye on it.			"

								Honestly one of the most unique games I've ever seen out there. Its not just a game you pick up and play, you learn so much and its extremely hard to be successful. You have to be tough to face the challenges the world presents and have a good team assembled. The Combat is incredible because units dont have 1 lifebar, but 6 or 7, for every part of their body. Your characters can die if they lose too much blood, the work their doing on the new biomes is amazing. Theyve created their own creatures, designed a new style of wolf-like creatures, their own races. Its like post apocalyptic samurais and ninjas. Seriously suggest this game, you will thoroughly enjoy its bitter lifestyle. Budkai has a good series which shows the most recent patches! Check it out!

								This game has a lot of potential. I find it fun even now in early acccess. Obviously there are bugs so if your buying early be prepared for that. There is so much choice in this game and there is a lot you can do, many skills to improve, items to make, buildings to build and places to explore...			"

								Excellent concept; Having bought this game around a day ago, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of sophistication in gameplay and AI, expecting it to be remeniscent of other Alpha titles. Has an atmosphere that reminds me of Fallout: New Vegas - probably from all the sand and ramshackle-esque structures. Will watch eagerly for updates, and wait on tenterhooks for the release proper. 7.5/10 (Alpha State - Review subject to change with game quality.

								This is a remarkable, i have spent hours playing the game. it's a lot like xcom enemy unknown because of the personal story you develop around your allies and yourself. even at this state, even if it is nothing but bare bones it is still an outstanding game. the price is a bit harsh for it's current state, it should start low and increase when the full game is released. though i am going to recommend it i suggest that you wait for it to update and patch because it has a lot of bugs and frequently crashes. but if you do get the game make sure to save very often, still a very fun game and huge potential			"

								I love it, it was one of my first early access games bought on steam and no other early access has ever come close to being as enjoyable as Kenshi for me.The concept is inspired and the setting has real gravitas. Mad MAX meets Samurai epic.Considering this is an alpha still, there is alot to do, I have only ever played 1 character and his followers but between base building, getting rich, training stats and skills and eventually assaulting NPC towns (Holy Nation was my target a while back) there is alot to do.I can see this being a game that appeals to a certain type of player, but those players will love it with a passion.

								Where to start off with Kenshi, I bought this near the start of it's development and I was wary and almost even regretting my purchase before I played it. As soon as I booted up the game I was confronted with a primitive menu so I decided to take the plunge and start a new game. The character creator was very limited and you could barely customise the base model at all and so I just decided to leave my character as default and get into the game. Oh boy, desert as far as the eye can see. I really was not enjoying my first half hour on Kenshi but I stuck to it and eventually when I got used to the gameplay and mechanics I was oddly enjoying myself. I didn't mind that there was no sound at the time, I didnt mind that it was nothing but desert, I didn't mind the skeleton menu and character creator. I was building my own village, smithing weapons and mining resources. Bandits would come once in a while only to be beaten by my assorted cohort of slave labourers all armed with massive two handed weapons. The combat in this game is satisfying, limbs can be disabled and you will need to have medkits handy when your peons are♥♥♥♥♥♥at fighting. There's a lot to be completed before Kenshi should be released, new biomes is what I want to see first. Music has been added and sounds great. Graphics have been improving over time and even the character creator is more fleshed out now. Overall, I'd reccomend Kenshi if you're willing to support an early access game, if not wait till it's released. It's flawed, but it's fun.			"

								Just started playing, takes a little to find your bearings. I am not fond of the crash that tells me to use an option that is unavailable. Anyway they work on these things I am shure it will get smother. I like the research I like the fighting. Not crazy about the 20 person mob attacking me at times. But I am getting stronger from it. I am excited about the multiplayer play. Cant wait to see how that goes. Over all, Worth the money. I am shure I will get hours of play out of it.			"

								I bought this game about two years ago, played for an hour, and put it down. It simply wasn't at thelevel of development that i considered playable. I pick it back up about a week ago and have been hooked. Seriously. Battlefield 4 and even titanfall have taken a back seat in the last week. I can't stop playing. Can't wait for the final product.

								Love this game, it is no where close to being complete but evn so it has a lot of depth and really challanges you, not in an unfair way but instead the only way to gain an advantage is to train your guy(s) meaning you actually have to earn the advantage. Again, amazing game even though it is only in alpha. If you have to buy 1 game this would probably be the best 1.			"
