												horrible game. it bugs out when travelling back through completed quest areas. it has an extremely basic skills tree/char development and plot. items are also very bland/generic with only 3 lines of modifiers and is no where near as detailed/varied as the diablo series. the graphics/animation and controls are also poor. its easy to get lost during each quest because theres no minimap (or any kind of map). stay away, they're better free games on the internet. I'd rate this a 3/10.. closer to a FREE flash game than a $20 game.			"

												I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this game, especially since there are so few games that actually deal with Persia and its mythologies (Prince of Persia notwithstanding), but I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone. There's no actual randomized items, no deep character development, and the story looks interesting but sounds like it was badly translated. All together, the game comes across as bare-bones, it functions like its still in its development stages (hell, it probably is considering), and you really don't get bang for your buck. Thankfully I got this during the steam sale, so my wallet wasn't hit too bad, but still, unless the developers release a HUGE update that actually makes like it like an actually finished game, I don't think I have the strength to finish it. Plus, going by the achievements, its not very lengthy anyhow. Sorry folks, but look elsewhere for your hack'n'slash'n'cast'and gunnin fix.			"

												To be honest; They are WAY overcharging for this crap game. Persia is not really anyone's idea of ""the coolest setting ever"", to begin with, but the gameplay is just brutal. I couldn't get into the story due to its horrid gameplay.Instead of buying this game, get yourself either the FREE Path of Exile, which is awesome. Or if you're looking for more of a story, I strongly recommend Van Helsing. I haven't beaten 2 yet to give you a good enough critique, but the first was(in my honest opinion) better than any of the diablos I've played. Honorable mentions: The artists for this game obviously worked their tushies off, and I love the story telling aspect. But the programming and animating team should probably be REPLACED, or trained a lot better. Might I suggest Disney's Principals of animation? You'll be doing yourself an immense favor by learning from it. A programmer I am not, but from the dabbling I've done in UDK and Unity I have created more convincing and better programmed pieces of crap. Honestly though, the animation is probably worse than the programming. All I could say for programming is it felt like they were not compelled to do a better job, which I could understand to some degree, but they should have at least tried their best :/Review END.			"

SummaryLegends of Persia is an action-RPG played from an isometric point-of-view, similar to Diablo or Torchlight . It is one of the most disappointing games I've played in years, with very few redeeming qualities.Unless you obtain it as part of a bundle, it is not worth the price of entry.Story elementsOriginal but underused settingOriginal story, set in a part of the world that isn't often explored in videogames. However, the story is conveyed entirely via cutscenes and only the first one has voiceovers; the remaining dozens do not. The cutscenes are mostly exposition, and the gameplay barely feels connected to the story. Cliffhanger endingGame ends on a cliffhanger promising a sequel or an expansion. Remains unclear if it'll happen.Brief longevity/replayabilityGame it very, very short. A playthrough while watching the cutscenes is about 4-5 hours long. Replayability is almost non-existent.Gameplay elementsUnderwhelming lootThe weapons and equipment variety is extremely low for an action-RPG. I changed gear a total of 5 times from start to finish.Very few skillsSkills variety is low. Descriptions don't update past the first level, making it impossible to know what leveling a skill to the second and third level does before investing points. Unbalanced difficultyGame difficulty is poorly balanced. Instead of fixing it, the developers added cheat codes to be invincible and skip levels...Linear level designLevels are very linear and exploration is not rewarded. There is no minimap.English translationIt is rather obvious that the game wasn't developed by native English speakers, or translated by someone who had the skills to do so. In addition to numerous typos and grammar mistakes, sentences structure is often incorrect, making the story harder to follow. My favorite error is the game title: on Steam, it is called ""Legends of Persia""; in-game, it is ""Legend of Persia"".Technical detailsDated visualsGraphics are dated and the aesthetics are bland and generic. Animations are sub-par.Additional informationFalse promiseEditor promised in the Key Features section is unavailable.			"

												If you purchase this game expecting Diablo III or Torchlight II set in a Middle-Eastern world, you will be horribly disappointed. I backed the game on kickstarter thinking it would be exactly that - a mid-east Diablo II clone. Initially I was put off by what seemed to be an overly simplistic game, as everything seemed to be rather generic. However, if you play on, the game gains more complexity - equipment gains stat modifiers for example. Legends of Persia is actually a fairly decent ARPG.The graphics are not great by modern standards, but they are not as terrible other reviewers say. I guess people tend to forget that many of the games people loved that influenced this game (Diablo I & II, Divine Divinity, Siege of Avalon) look horrible by modern standards. In a forum I saw someone compare this game to RAW. This game is no where near as bad as that turd.While I like the game, I believe that the average steam consumer probably would want to pick this game up when it is on sale because it does not compare favorably to some of the other games available on steam in the same genre. What is interesting to me is that the game studio is based in Tehran. The story is based on a legendary prince of ancient Persia. Personally I believe that cultural engagement with the Middle East is important, and do not at all mind having paid full price for this game. I also believe that this game studio is capable of improving and doing better. Instead of giving up on the game after 10-15 minutes, play the game and give the studio constructive criticism.  "

												Awful, absolutely awful. Very, very simplistic Diablo clone. Combat is a chore, having to hold down right click on each individual enemy to kill them one by one, with only skills that deal AoE damage able to kill more than one at a time. Graphics are very basic, and are hardly worth mentioning, and that hideous green effect that persists throughout a long portion of the beginning gets very annoying very quickly. Questing goes by horrifically slow, with even obtaining quests being a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ When you pick up a new quest, assuming can even find a one, you're greeted with a slow, boring cutscene instead of a quick and simple popup text window, almost ensuring that nobody will pick up the details because they'll feel an urge to skip that damned thing. I wish I were more eloquent when it comes to describing games, so that I could warn everyone else of this awful clone of a game better. THANK GOD I PICKED THIS UP IN A BUNDLE FOR ABOUT 3 BUCKS! Stay away from this game, and save your money for the Diablo 2 battlechest, or even Torchlight!			"

												This may not be a bad game, but I could find no desire to keep playing it after 20 minutes.From the beginning the load times are atrocious. There were 3 times before I ever reached actual gameplay where I thought the game had crashed because I was just staring at a blank screen for over 2 minutes. The cutscenes at the beginning were beautifully drawn but shoddily stitched together and at one point there was a 3 second clip of in-engine gameplay that was completely inexplicable. Sometimes things were voice acted, other times I had to read the subtitles. Once I was finally given control, I was dumped into the most lifeless, barren, bland city I have ever scene. I must have wandered around a good 10 minutes before I finally saw the single object in the whole town I could interact with and when I clicked on him I sat for another 2 minutes staring at a black screen while the cutscene loaded (this time without any sound period). He made a bow and sword materialize behind me and I proceeded to roam the town with the objective “Finding the Gold” until my eyes finally began to bleed from the terrible aliasing and constipated character animations.If I’m going to play an aRPG I would reinstall Path of Exile; Legends of Persia brings nothing to the table that would merit overlooking all of it’s awful design first impressions.

												This game need a lot of work, so anyone can enjoy it. It look like an early acces production. The quest are idiotic. The difficulty level is not balanced at all, and fighting the last boss is extremly hard. The loot you find is almost the same. No many traders, and they have almost the same things that you find. The pet is very weak, and die in few second, so there is no need to spend XP on it. If you like hack/n/slash games, keep away from this game, and grab another one. There are so many good games.			"

												Well...I tend to be a fan of ARPGs.I very much try & play any game that plays similar to an ARPG & the list includes:Diablo 1, 2 & 3Titan Quest: Immortal ThroneDungeon Siege 1, 2 & 3.Grim DawnR.A.W. Realms of Ancient WarWave Of DarknessTorchlight 1 & 2Sacred 3Incredible Adventures Of Van Helsin& similar games of Neverwinter Nights 2, Divinity Original Sin & a few others that are turn based & more cRPG then ARPG.And despite it all & have ones like R.A.W. & Wave Of Darkness which both have some serious problems... I have to say this is one of the worst games I've ever played.... & I only played past the 1st fight so far.This game feels like a RPG Maker RPG does to a decent RPG like Dragon Quest (the original). Poorly.. it feels like it was pumped out using assests that were bought in the bargin bin with little thought to interface or animations & other similar requirements for a good ARPG. It's like the framework for a game... or something you would present to a teacher to show what you're planning on doing your grade 10 assignment on ""oh yes here's a quick example of what I want to do... the final assignment will be more flushed out"".Having waited until it was on deep sale... the currently 85% off because of how many bad reviews there were I actually regret buying this game for the $3.50 cents local currency. It is most definitely NOT worth more then $1.20 at best.... even that might be pushing it.... because it really does seem like you're playing someones failing grade computer programming homework.I cannot recommend this item in any way shape or form.  If you want an ARPG you're better off  going with something way older & hence way cheaper because you'll still get a better product.TLDR: Skip it. Failed homework project.			"

												I want to like this game, I really do.  Unfortunately, the setting is not one that is very exiting for me, and one I don't particularly care for.  That *may* taint my review of the game, so I am warning you beforehand.  In terms of graphics, I would say they are ""alright,"" but nothing that really screams out ""Man, this game looks great!""  Item placement on the maps (thus far) doesn't make much sense, and so far the environment is dull and lackluster.  The UI is ugly, in my opinion, but servicable, it does what it is supposed to do.  The character models are well done and well animated, but again, not very interesting.  The cutscenes for dialogues get really annoying, really fast.  You have to go by the speed of the cutscene if you want information, so if you read faster or slower than the text during the cutscene, you're pretty much SOL.  And if you skip the dialogue scenes, you miss everything that is said, which is unfortunate.  On the plus side, I really do like the art for the dialogue scenes.Can I recommend this game?  Not really.  Unless you get it drastically reduced in price, you'll probably feel that your money is better spent on another game (like enjoying the first two Dungeon Siege games again, or playing Sacred or Sacred 2, or even Diablo 3 is far superior to this game.)  Is it a horrible game?  No, but there are much better (and often cheaper) alternatives that you may get more enjoyment out of.			"

During the time I played it (All the time on record here, guaranteed, won't be launching it again), I experienced 3 soft-locks, a bunch of AI glitchiness, and to top it all off, the game locked and hard faulted right back to the desktop. Can't recommend, it's not very fun to begin with, and coupled with all the glitched, it's unplayable.			"

You want an action RPG? Get Path of Exile or Torchlight.The movement animation is painful, movement is slow, attacks are AGONISINGLY sluggish. I used a bow when I ran out of health, and by the time I'd shambled out of range and tried to attack, I only got as far as nocking the arrow before I was surrounded and gibbed.You can polish a turd, but the makers of this game didn't even do that.

												This game is realy bad. I do recomend... stay clear of it. Unless you really are desperate for another Diablo clone.The game does not look too good and the ""feel"" from it is even worse. I am not much into writing a review, so just some points which I realy hate about it:- Ingame movies and even most dialogs are more like static images, taking over whole screen, some of them even does not have voice actings.. hm. not good.- In game graphic and character and even enemy animation is prety decent, but the inventory graphic is prety ugly and small so it is hard to say what is what just from the look of it and I have to look at the popups. This makes the inventory hard tu use because there is absolutely unnecessary delay before description pops-up. and I did not found any way how to check the items in any other way. Also not good.Character control feels ""lagy"" - its like you click to attack and the character thinks an half a second before doing so. It is even more noticeable with ranged attacks. And if you decide that you need to move away during an attack animation, it gets cut of in the very moment, which looks very very ugly. And well, this is also true for enemies - most noticeable is it in the first (second?) boss fight when using a bow. This is not only ugly, but it also makes the bow usage a bit hard against the bos, because he just break of his atack and continue chasing you as soon as you gets out of range. This is not so ba as it sounds, it is mostly ugly/strange, but for me it is another negative point.Also interaction with game world is bit problematic - you need to click very precisely when you want to pick up something from the gorund. You can not actualy click the item itself, but you must click the ground in a place when your chjaracter will end up standing exactly over that item before he pick it up, which is sometimes really hard... this makes me angry very easily and it is probably because of this that I will not play the game anymore...Well, to summ it up: I am really sorry that I can not give this game to someone who will be able to apreciate it, because I definitely can't.

												Recommendation - Only for the most rabid of ARPG fan with NOTHING else to play.Whether you trust game critics or metacritic user scores or not, it says something about a game when not only are almost all the reviews for it negative, but only 2 of the positive ones have an hour hour play time. Seriously, go check out the reviews here in the community hub. Only TWO of them played the game for more than an hour. Odd, since you would think people that enjoyed the game would actually play it, right?This review will be short, since this game is not even worth the time it would take to write a detailed review.Put simply, everything about this game is sub-par. Graphics, sound, voice acting, cutscenes, animations, combat, load times, and even translation. There is nothing in this game at all that hasn't been done a hundred percent better (at least) by just about every other ARPG out there, often simultaneously.Play Van Helsing 1/2 first. Play Torchlight 2 first. Play Grim Dawn first. Play Path of Exile first. Play Diablo 3 first. Sweet merciful LORD, play Torchlight 1 or Diablo 1/2 or Titan Quest or any other PC ARPG first. If you have old consoles, play Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance or Champions of Norrath first. If you have a PSP/Vita, play Dungeon Siege 2: Throne of Agony or either of the Untold Legends games first.Play EVERY other game first. I got this game for about $0.20 in a bundle deal, and I can say I wouldn't play it even if it were free. It's not HORRIBLE (it... KINDA is...), but literally every other ARPG I have played in the past 5+ years has been more enjoyable, and we are not starved for choice in this day and age.			"

												There's really no polite way to put it.  This game is horrible.  Which is a pity because it almost wasn't.  It would be possible to overlook the Dungeon Siege 1 era graphics, the generic, repetitive music and even the shoddy user interface if the game-play was good.But the game-play is not good.  It's buggy and derivative.Straight off the bat the first achievement I got was for killing the second boss.  The first boss never appeared.It doesn't seem to be possible to transition back to previous locations which is a problem because that means one can't ever go back to the merchant to buy more potions.  Or sell the huge amount of cruft that gets picked up (assuming you can find the tiny off-center click point to pick up objects).This is practically game ending because there are no real save points.  The start of the area is the restart point and the start of an area could well be after a merchant.  If you didn't have the gold to buy health potions.  Or simply didn't realise the difficult was going to ramp up then that's it.  You're done.  Not enough health to continue.  Compounding the poor object picking - including attacking enemies - is that walking seems to work erratically.  Generally holding down the left mouse button makes the character walk but sometimes no amount of releasing and clicking will get them to move.  It's minor but adds up to be quite annoying.The combat.  The combat is really all there is to Legends of Persia and it is it's major flaw.  Slow attack animations with no ability to doge makes for boring ping-pong sessions of sword play.  It's a game of attrition as you hold down the right mouse button.  And press 1 occasionally if you've upgraded stun (stun being the only useful upgrade).The sound effects are either very muted or just don't exist.  They added nothing to the game and music is only slightly better.The user interface is a mess.  Different fonts.  Text not sitting in windows.  Items getting stuck to the mouse cursor in the inventory.  The truly enormous warning message text.Legends of Persia feels like the developer was told about Diablo 1 but had never played a game before coding it.  It's boring, repetitive and makes amateur mistakes that should have been simple to fix. Seriously, avoid.			"

												Where to begin. Oh boy. When i bought this game i thought to myself, hmmm this looks like a fun game. The screenshots look nice, it has RPG, Action, Indie, Adventure tags. What could go wrong? Everything. I am not a person who goes for graphic looks, they are the last thing i look in a game, but this game . . . this game. So much bugs. So much crashing and crashing and crashing and  . . . did i mention crashing. The minor things like enemy names with underscores, enemy names ending with numbers like ""zombie_lvl2_197"" or something like that. Desynced cutscenes and constant crashes. Inventory bugs, like items randomly unequipping from a character slot, not being able to equip items at all and then crashing. Did i mention this game crashes. I really want to finish this game i really do. But it looks like the game does not want to be finished. The price tag for this game 19.99 Euros is ridiculous when the game is at the state it is now. I would understand if this was early access or alpha or beta. But this game is a finished product that . . .  oh i hope i mentioned it before, CRASHES all the time. Until this game gets fixed i can't personally recommend this game to anyone.			"

												This is a copy of what i wrote about this game in the forums (i left out the horrible graphics as i thought that problem was way too obvious. also:if someone says that it's like diablo 2-> they blatantly lie. even diablo 1 had better standards UI/gameplay-wise than this):My first experiences in this gameWhen I first started the game (after the settings, which kinda confused me with the ""switch attack/run buttons"" and the fact that it changes the resolution if you uncheck the fullscreen option) I watched the intro cutscene just to realize that my mouse speed has been altered (sped up)....is that supposed to be like this? and if yes? WHY?D:anyway, i chose one of the character appearances (an actual model or a bigger picture would be nice...its quite small you know) and got started. I skipped the cutscene, got a loading screen just to experience....another cutscene. yay. Skip again. I found myself in a small town without a clue what to do (which was probably my fault as i skipped so much) so I run around looking what I could do. Shortly I finally knew what was meant with ""attack/run buttons"". Just...why couldn't it be like in most of the other games of this genre? why do you NEED to have 2 buttons for attack and run? I don't see the point. You can't change it either :/. Anyway, after a while I found someone with a ""!"" above his head. Thought i would get just a textbox i could click through to get some fast information but nope, another cutscene.(which i skipped. Is everything involving a dialog a cutscene in this game?I just want some quick info i can scroll through, not a cutscene that takes ages for each sentence :/)After that, I finally got my first quest (or rather my second, as my first was to find that person as it seemed): get some gold. Now that (while searching for something to do) I already found some gold from destroying some debris etc. I actually thought my quest is already complete (since that guys ""!"" didnt change. could have been greyed out...). So after some reading in the quest log it turns out i have to go to some graveyard south east of town. first i thought it would be outside of town, buuuut it wasn't. after some enemy bashing i got tons of gold, brought that back to the quest-guy and got my next quest: An escort mission. yes. (everyones favourite).so apparently i didn't know where to go, had suddenly the choice to get some kind of minion (which i just realized that those are fighting for me after reading the description of the LAST of them...)....oh and they also cost gold which hasn't been mentioned anywhere (didn't see it at least). after a while the to-be-escorted guy died and i had to start over, which was the point where i quitted.other complains:- why are things like ""character""-button, ""skills""button etc. in the skill bar??? they are neither skills nor items, so seperate them from the bar!- i have NO CLUE what skills actually do damagewise. is 20 dmg much? does it scale with my other stats? what dmg does it on the next level? what level is required level up that skill? those infos are mandatory imho-why does it tilt when i scroll in/out?-could leave the city only with several tries as it felt like a forcefield stopped me from proceeding (maybe a bug?)-clicking dropped items while npcs follow you is a complete mess. their boxes are HUGE-also, also...why do dropped weapons have to be so gigantic?-dropped misc item would probably be better displayed as a small bag instead of something that looks like a treasure chest full of potions (looked at least to me like one on first glance)overall this ""full game"" rather feels like a pre-alpha of an early-game. Sorry but 20$ is NOT an appropriate price for this game.1/10			"

												If you hate yourself, this game is for you. A tedious journey through terrible graphics, a boring and completely forgettable story and controls that are awful. It feels like this game was made as some intro to game design project that they thought they could sell for $20. Even if I got this game for free, I'd want my time back. Unfortunately I paid actual money for this atrocity. As I write this, the gameplay video is streaming above. Watching it, It's like they sped up the gameplay to make the game actually appealing. I wish it moved that fast! In reality, you run around through bland, muddily textured environments and fight enemies named ""Zombie_lvl3"" in what feels like slow motion. The excitement never ends, folks.I like supporting indie games and little known studios but when they put out crap like this at a high price point, it's extremely sad. If I was their gametester for this, I'd have strangled myself with my own mouse cable for having to play this so much and find bugs. This entire game is one large bug. The only people I can imagine enjoying this are ones who have never experienced a quality game experience IN THEIR LIFETIME. They're the ones who loved Superman 64 and ET for Atari. Even Atari hated ET so much they buried the game cartridges in the desert. There should be an equivalent to that for this game.Move on, for you have been warned. You'll find dying in Dark Souls 10,000 times over is more appealing than 15 minutes in this nightmare.			"

												I got this game as part of a Humble Bundle. Initially, it looked interesting, a Diablo clone, as everyone else has already said. Unfortunately, the game itself is clunky and frustrating. Picking up gold and items is a chore. The cutscenes are boring and drawn out. Upgrading skills doesn't work well and trying to equip items is painful at best. This game needs a total overhaul, because it feels buggy and unfinished. Don't bother with this game.			"

												Bland, soulless, amateurish ARPG. Bad English in the cutscenes.Everything looks exactly like what it is: an art asset positioned on a map- nothing blends or meshes together to create a believable level.Lack of variety in loot. (I got 2 of the same helmet, three of the same sword and three of the same bow before I got to the first boss).Awkwardness with clicking to pick up some drops rather than just walking through them.Incredibly linear levels from what I saw, where you are directed to the next encounter with seen-them-many-times art assets or the ever-unscalable low ground rise.It just feels very cheap and unloved, sorry. It's nowhere near Diablo and Torchlight in polish and it's nowhere near Titan Quest in fun.			"

												Bland, bad, boring.Controls are sluggish, 3D models are choppy, textures were made without imagination.I heard the story might be good if you give game a chance, but I won't risk it ;)I heard item costumisation further into the game is quite good, but I won't try to check it.The only good thing I see, are the cinematics (2D) - not that great in any manner, but many levels above the rest of the game.I heard the game came from KickStarter. Pity.The truth is, that You may even like it. I can belive it would fit some niche quite easily. But not for this horrendus price. But if You manage to catch it from some bundle (I gave 3$ for this and few other - better - games), don't hesitate to try it ;)			"

												Okay, it's terrible. Honestly. I constantly got stuck and about 15 minutes into the game I just about gave up because I could not equip my weapons at all, for some reason the NPC's were not working passed a certain point either. The trailer looks nice but the game itself, you get a game that had about 10% effort put into it. Don't by it, It's a rip-off			"

 3/5 Average game !  OVERALL First of all, don't be fooled by the cool cinematics, this game is abysmally different, it's like the devs hired an animation studio to do the cinematics and showed them none of the gameplay. This game is an average hack and slash, a Diablo 2 clone that's anything but memorable although it still manages to be fun if you don't set your standard to Diablo 3 kind of quality. You will beat it in about 5-6h and I don't think it's worth $20 (more like $5-8 IMHO) but if you're a fan of the genre or want a pretty simple hack and slash then you will have fun with the game as you progress. REPLAYABILITY The game lets you chose between 3 classes: melee warrior, ranged archer or mixed mage. So once I completed the game as a melee warrior I did play it as the other 2 classes and had my fair share of fun with it. A downside are the way the achievements are managed since if you beat the game on a hard difficulty you don't get the previous achievements as if you beat it on the easier difficulties, also there's an achievement for the First Boss that YOU WILL NEVER GET because the dev has stated that they have decided to permanently remove this boss, so bummer there for all the achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s around the world (such as myself).  GAMEPLAY You hack through a variety of enemies with melee, ranged and magic weapons (you can equip up to 2 at a time) and use mana on your magic powers (you can equip up to 4 at a time, also can invest on passive abilities too). As you level up you can spend some points on improving your character and making it more oriented to melee, ranged and magic to suit your preferences; each avatar is purely cosmetic since you can make your barbarian a warlock, turn the bow girl into a warrior princess or your mystic into a deadly marksman. This game has very simple mechanics and this may give you a good time if you're looking for a beat 'em up with some light mechanics.  AESTHETIC Visually this game isn't on par with other games of the genre, that's OK by me although it makes a little bothersome to pay full price for a game that isn't remarkable on gameplay or story either, but we shouldn't be so hard on the game visuals since they aren't THAT bad either as some people have said. The loading screens and cinematics present some nice visual art but you NEVER see those characters ingame, nor you see the armors and weapons depicted in them, which is why I start the review by telling that the developers most likely hired a separate studio for the art that they display. STORY To be honest the story is just a nonsensical filler, I was really excited after seeing the opening cinematic but then found a pretty bland and uninspired story, quite confusing since I can't even remember the name of the character you are supposed to be playing, at some point I stopped trying to make any sense and thought that characters call you different names on each level as if you are just supposed to represent a different mythological persian character. So yeah... forget about getting an engaging story from this game. MUSIC The sounds are ok and the music isn't bad either, I can't complain nor praise the game's musical score, all I can say is that I wasn't bothered by it but wasn't lost in it either.			"
