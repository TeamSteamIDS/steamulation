												I think it's about time to write a review of C9 since I've been playing it for nearly 2 years.What is C9?C9, or Continent of the Ninth Seal is an MMORPG run by Webzen. C9 has a heavy focus on PVP, which features an innovative combo system and a gameplay which requires precision and timing. PVE wise C9 has instance style dungeons that can be accessed from towns.If you are looking for an action MMO, then C9 could be your perfect choice.There are however some issues, which could ruin your overall experience:- Webzen does not care its' customers. If you get scammed or hacked they won't help.- The game servers are lagging, and the peer2peer system can be abused in PVP.These two things you must keep in mind if you decide to play this, otherwise great game.So let's see the PROS and CONS now in short.PROS:- Innovative combat system. This game is NOT a point-n-click RPG, you need to do all the action yourself, much like in a hack-n-slash game, like DMC for example.- 5 base classes, which divided to over 20 subclasses. All with their unique gameplay, as well as strenghts and weaknesses. - Game is well optimized. It will run well on a weaker PC too.- Easy to learn, hard to master.CONS:- Webzen. They are basicly the tumor of this game. If C9 would be run by another company, it would be way better.- Slow bug fixes, and recent updates are breaking the game balance, adding straight out broken classes and pay2win items. - Horrible community.So the verdict:If you are a casual player, then this game might turn you away for the reasons mentioned above. But if you are willing to invest enough time and effort, and maybe money then C9 is just the game for you, since it's a lot of fun once you get better with your class.......and the game doesn't lag, that is.

												i was a long time player in this game, the combat is great, its pretty much a hack n slash in mmo form, the dungeons are alright at the start but become better later on, there are SO MANY CLASSES, you start with about 6 that branch off to 3-5 different classes each that change the play style of the class tremendously, the difficulty is incredibly hard late game but simple early, BUTi cant recommend this, webzen is a horrendous website that will do ANYTHING to stop you from playing, if your a new player, it might not effect you but if your a returning player....good luck, the pvp is fantastic but full of people that will destroy you via great gear and its laggy most of the time, and finaly its P2W sadly its true, and not a small amount of P2W that might be tolerable, im talking full sets of INCREDIBLY difficult to aquire gear legit just dropped in your hands forever or for a limited time, upgrade stones (that make your gear incredibly powerful and is hard to find and harder to apply to gear, just given to you with a 100% succses chance if you buy it, pets that give you stats, titles that give you game breaking stats and so on, TL,DR great game horrible publishers wouldent reccomend it unless you dont care about P2W in pvp ( PVE is uneffected)EDIT: alright il get a little bit more descriptive of this P2W problem that this game has, you pretty much cant progress the game properly without some sort of payment or a massive amount of play time(including a massive amount of luck),Problem one : LuckYou might ask ""but why do i need luck?"" well then buckle up because almost everything needs luck in this game, first thing being the upgrade system, that you must do every time you get new gear (granted you dont get new get that often), its a pretty basic system most games have it, upgrade material tier 1 can make weapon tier 1 stronger, giving it a basic damage bonus that ramps up to an astronomical level the more you upgrade, and give extra stats every 5 or so upgrades, but weapons can break if you upgrade em too much, sounds like a fair risk/reward thing going on right? well it isint, first off the chances of an upgrade working is fairly low, its a damn miricle getting gear to +9 (the reccomended tier, any higher will risk it breaking) topping the maximum to about +16 i think?, but you can make sure gear dosent break by using a special material that saves it if it fails, where do you get it you ask, a special daily event? no, a difficult to do team dungeon?, no, the cash shop? yep, its a cash item, an item thats needed to keep your incredibly hard to get weapon from not breaking...is a cash item, to make matters worse you can get stones that instantly level your gear to a specific number risk free, and by the way, it costs gold to upgrade them, and the cost ramps up the stronger the tier of upgrade, most of your gold WILL be spent on upgrading ♥♥♥♥.and that cash shop comes with stuff like, buying pets, cosmetics that increase stats greatly,invintory slots (your guy has a handbag for an invintory by the way, its a mini space management game too!! how fun) that sort of stuff.now lets continue about this amazing pay system they have shall we? but before we do let me tell you about the ""skill books"", these skill books are end game items that you can use and find at lvl 50 and above, these books can only be used by a specific class, meaning there are about over 20 types of books for all the classes, these books can increase stats, give a special effect when using a skill ( when using skill A, book will activate making you do 50% more damage for 3 seconds) for example, and ADD ON to existing skills, makeing them much more powerfull and changeing the animation and visual look of the skill, dont worry you can find these game breaking books in dungeons.  that is, the common ones, the white,green and sometimes blue rarity books that give minor bonuses, you see to get the good ones you need to be strong and luckey, how strong? well doing end game dungeons in maximum difficulty, how luckey? luckey enough to find a ""dimentional"" boss, these ♥♥♥♥ers are much stronger then normal bosses, but drop fat loot, problem is, the show up once every 20 or more runs, but if your not up to impossible tasks you can always COMBINE books for a chance of a higher rarity book dropping, 6 books turn into one random book of your sacrificed book quality or higher, by random i mean literally can be any book from the 20+ classes, unless you sacrificed 6 of the same class books, but finding six of the same class books is difficult in itself, anyway blah blah blah how do i get these game breaking god items wihtout spending my life in the game? trade maybe? nah you cant trade em (have fun filling your invintory btw) cash shop, yeah thats the ticket, but thats also random, so you have to buy a chest with real money to maybe get something thats related to what you want, but hey its gonne be rare at least.damn theres allot to write about, im just gonna stop it here for now, theres too much to say, might update this again later or when someone has a question, but damn, all that and its pretty much just cash shop problems, thats an achivement in itself.EDIT: its been a good year since this review has been updated and looking back, i did a ♥♥♥♥ poor job at explaining the most important thing in this game, the Classes. specifically, ranged and melee difference.i was about to log in once more to see how this game was doing, maybe they fixed some problems they had in the past, curious on how my old account was holding up, but the game wont let me log in due to account merging issues and PC switching conflicting, its a long and confusing story and i wont get into it, so instead il add another bump on the old review page.so classes, the only thing thats this game is excellent at, giving you a large amount of varying classes to choose from that further along the lines become even more unique, but as much as il praise it, most of those classes are utter crap at the game, mainly due to the game mechanics later on.lemee explain, early in the game lets say till level 40-50, you will probably have no trouble at all at beating anything this game has to offer, but around the 50+ mark a huge spike in enemy difficulty will be apparent, there will be larger numbers of enemies that fight you, they will have more health will deal more damage, more annoying skills to use on you and overall will be harder to deal with. even with those changes most classes will be able to deal with them, but some classes, like assasin and basic fighter classes wont be doing so hot against them due to them naturally needing to get up close and personal in large piles of enemies, they will get hit often, ranged classes will still be able to beat these normal mobs easily.heres were fairness goes out the window - Bossesup till level 50 most bosses will still be quite easy, most bosses have a damage treshold, meaning when you deal certain amounts of damage to them, they will stagger, smaller bosses that are human size, are more likely to stagger and get knocked up, while larger bosses are more ressistant to these effects, but as the game progresses, Bosses will get stronger and more resistant, as well as gain a nasty set of skills, but players will not be able to reach this damage treshold to stagger bosses anymore, meaning that you cant just use all your skills in a combo without getting hit...as a melee character, ranged classes will still have no problems playing ring around the rosie with bosses till they eventualy die, but melee characters need to get up close and personal, meaning unless you deal enough damage to stagger them, (and you wont) or have skills that will make you immune to damage,end game bosses will be impossible without a team for melee classes.i had more to say, but i reached the character limit, guess i can answer questions if they pop up in comments.

Note:Ignore my shown play time, I always play on the non-Steam version. I've found that online games, and Steam don't tend to mix that well often enough, so use the non-Steam version whenever possible, and strongly suggest that others do the same, especially for C9.Basics about the game:C9 is a PvE centric (not massively) multiplayer online brawler/hack n' slash, with RPG mechanics like character and skill levelling, equipment, crafting, guilds, and loot to gather. You can largely play it just fine solo, but it can be more fun when playing with up to three of your friends. The controls are solid, and the action is fast, so if this is the kind of game you're into, it can be a lot of fun.This is one of those games with a town hub, and instanced dungeons like others of this genre (Dungeon Fighter Online, Dragon Nest, Vindictus, etc..). Major game zones are split up into continents, and as of the time of this review at least most of the sixth continent has been released. The level cap increases as more zones are added, then the difficulty of mobs, and number of mechanics at work you need to make use of increases the further along you go.One warning is that it's a peer to peer game published to a global area (bad combination), so if you play with others, it's best to stick with people that at least live in the same continent as you. If you join up with anyone, and they're on the other side of the planet or such, the latency/lag could be pretty bad.----Extra info on common questions, and discussions.----If it's a PvE game, why are others swearing that it's a PvP game?:Why people try to claim C9 is a PvP game, is completely beyond me. Here's the thing, you level up through PvE, get equipment through PvE, and the game is always trying to send you into dungeons to fight mobs, which is PvE. Everything in the game, including the PvP, and PvP related things by extension, requires you to do PvE, as your levels and equipment from PvE, carry over to PvP. In C9, PvP is really just an optional side activity for the sake of bragging rights, and can easily be completely ignored. If you don't like the PvE in C9, or in games on a whole, don't even bother downloading C9, as PvE is completely unavoidable.I've seen various people complaining non-stop about everything under the sun relating to this game, or other similar games, and more often than not, they're the people trying play a PvE game, just for the PvP. If asked why they think it's a PvP game, they will say things like ""because it is,"" or talk about how much they like the combat compare to other games, which is the same basic combat as in PvE. It just feels like they made a mistake in playing a PvE game for the PvP, but refuse to acknowledge their error, so blame the game, the publisher, the developer, and anything else they can think of instead. If you want to play a game for its PvP, it really should have a strong focus on PvP at a design level, such as seen in the various PvP arena games, or online CCGs, C9 certainly doesn't have such a focus.Is it pay to win?:I would say no. Although, the thing about pay to win (P2W) is that it is when a game provides a significant pay advantage, and as such is a completely subjective description. Different people have different views regarding what parts of a game are of importance/significance to them, and their tolerance levels to certain degrees of advantages, so the important thing isn't if other people call a game P2W, it's if you think it's P2W.Here's a list of some of the things sold in the C9 cash shop, and some notes on them.Buffs, and related. One provides extra XP gains, stamina, and an extra end dungeon loot chance, another has a mixed bag of daily rewards.Inventory, and storage expansions. New characters get two inventory expansions in their level up boxes, and there's a recurring event (Archery) that also can provide them.Skill books. Equipped items that enhance, or alter your skills, but don't work in PvP. Although at the same time, or before they started selling them, they also made getting them from just playing much easier, and probably not a month goes by where there isn't at least one skill book related in-game event to help you get them.Souls. Equipped items that when used with gear/costumes provide various buffs, including some not usually found on equipment. Certainly nice to have, and will make things easier, but not absolutely necessary.Enhancement related items, and an equipment bonus stats reroll item. They make it easier to get those really high enhancement levels, and ideal stats, but both could be done without them, it'll just take a lot longer, and require more luck. They have enhancement bonus chance events now, and then, plus most of these items can also be obtained through various daily activities, and the odd event, it's just much easier to get them in volume from the cash shop. Also by the time you get to the enhancement levels where you'd likely really want these items, I find the bonuses to be too high (ex: +300% - 5800% extra damage on weapons), which makes playing kinda boring as a result.Bonuses to damage, and defence from enhancing don't work in PvP, but bonus stats on items do.Some accessories. Accessories in C9 are mainly for bonus stats. The ones from the cash shop can provide stats not found on regular accessories, although like with souls, are helpful, but not absolutely necessary.Auspices. A set of bonuses you can equip. You'll get one, or two basic ones early in the game, plus it's not uncommon for some, even pretty good ones, to be in the random boxes you get from in-game events.Pets. Provide bonus stats, pick up most items for you, and provide an occasional buff, or extra attack. Main benefit to me is the item pick up aspect, but only in some places. If you wanted to use pets full time you'd want at least three of them per character, since they can only be used for so long before requiring rest, and are character locked. Then the ones you get are selected randomly.Main thing the people complaining about P2W tend to cite are certain bonus stats in PvP. Although as I've said, the game itself doesn't care about PvP nearly as much as some players do.Does it have a stamina system?:Yes, but unless you for instance spend all day playing, or hammer through dungeons you're over powered for as fast as you can, you likely won't run out of stamina. Then even if you do, with twelve character slots, you could always play another character.I've heard people say Webzen (the publisher) really sucks:For basically any foreign developed game that has been released for a while, you'll pretty much always see some people go on about how its publisher is supposedly the worst one out there. The ones saying how bad Webzen supposedly is are also generally the people trying to play it just for the PvP, which as I mentioned in the PvP note, doesn't work out well. Then some people will complain about anything really, no matter how crazy it may be. Seen people complain about how the free stuff you get just for logging in was supposedly not enough, or even too much. Welcome to the Internet.Webzen keeps updating the game with new content, has a continual flow of in-game events, cash shop items are decently priced, with no clear pay to win, they seem to be trying to listen and talk to players reasonably well as of late, and the rate they get back to tickets has picked up from what it used to be. Before 2014, I'd have said aside from poor communication, they're pretty good compare to others, now even that's not half bad.			"

												A good game, with some rather... Unfortunate technical issues.Now, I tried to get this game to work, honestly; on three separate installs, several times validating files through both steam and the launcher (which always seem to get at least a 1GB worth of files that fail to validate and must be re-downloaded).The game has constant ""Server connection lost"" issues, as well as random crashes. Especially once you get to the 4th continent and are already invested in it - both time-wise as well as just loving the gameplay of it. Possibly also money-wise, if you bought cash.Most of my time played is from a time before the game was available on Steam. I played a few (very brief) stages recently and found the game hasn't changed too much since then. My numerous uninstalls and reinstalls appear to have reset my time played.I personally still cannot play the game due to the many technical issues. So take that as a warning.Now, that said, this is a very entertaining game. The controls are nice and responsive, the character classes are varied and your success rate in combat is largely determined by your timing of skills and positioning, which is exactly what an action RPG needs.Combat is what you'd expect; you try to chain your attacks, getting as high a combo as possible without getting hit. It's very satisfying to eliminate an entire group of enemies without letting your combo break or time out (which is rather quick).In case you die, you are given five resurrection scrolls per day. It's worth noting that dying will reduce the durability of your gear, so unless you buy a (rather expansive) repair kit from a merchant (for in-game money), you might have some trouble with that.The stages are instance-based; you pick up your quests at town, then go to the travel map and select stage, difficulty level, whether or not you allow random players to join in to help you and also whether or not you allow ""intrusions"".Difficulty levels are pretty intuitive:""Normal"" is your basic enemies-are-one-hit-kills affair which you'll have to go to at least once for each mission. This serves as a chance to get a feel for the zone, as well as it's boss, more than anything.""Hard"" is slightly harder, but you'll probably still find yourself slaughtering the enemies and not caring if you're hit.""Expert"" is slightly more fun; the enemies have enough hitpoints to survive a couple hits, and deal an almost-significent amount of damage.""Master"" is where the fun is really at. Enemies survive a decent number of hits (but they don't feel like spunges) while dishing out good damage (you'll survive a good couple hits yourself, even as a witchblade with no defensive equipment).Stage difficulty decrees the quality of your reward at the end of the stage, and also the length of the stage; normal difficulty stages are extremely short, while master difficulty last a good few minutes.I should mention the hell stages now. They are few, and represent the highest challenge in the game. Obviously intended for a party of players who know what they're doing. Think of them as the ""raid"" stages of C9, except you have a party of four so your personal impact is much larger.These stages reward players with extremely powerful weapons and armor.Intrusions are other players entering your stage as enemies, trying to kill you and then kill the final boss. In order to intrude one must speak with the master of intrusions NPC, pay a fee and then they can enter. You are informed when a player intrudes into your dungeon instance.Intruders cannot use resurrection scrolls, but must instead re-enter through the master of intrusions NPC and pay the fee a second time.Killing an intruder gives you a token. A certain number of tokens gets you a crate with some random loot. Killing a defending player while intruding also gives a token, which also grants a crate. Don't know what this one contains, because I didn't bother intruding too much.For those of you who love PvP, and worry that the occasional intruder will not be enough to satisfy your bloodthirst, there are arenas and tournaments. I don't know how tournaments work, but the arena come in your standard 1v1, 2v2 and tag-team formats. There might be more formats by now, but due to the technical issues mentioned above I cannot check.Classes are divided into arch-types; there's the hunter, the shaman, the witchblade and the warrior.The warrior is your standard tank, the shaman can become multiple things (mage, healer or even close-range fighter) depending on their class advance, the witchblade is a fast-moving glass-cannon type that (as you'd expect from a glass-cannon) has little defence and lots of damage.The hunter is the most powerful. Sorry, but it's true; switching to hunter from Witchblade felt like going from master difficulty to normal.There is crafting, which is rather simple and not too exciting, but it gets the job done. It can be rather expansive at times, and you might be better off going into dungeons to get your equipment.That said, alchemy is extremely important because shop-bought potions are terrible, and you will need healing going into Hell difficulty (and quite possibly against some of the high-level Master difficulty bosses).You can only have one crafting profession on each character, so you'll want alts to pick up the less everyday crafts (weapons, armors) while your mains learn alchemy and cooking.Speaking of alts, the base inventory capacity in C9 is extremely limited. If I had one complaint (other than the technical issues) it would be this. Inventory extension items are cheap, but if you don't feel like spending the money you can have your alts carry your spare crafting materials for you.You have 12 character slots, so you don't need to worry about those.Guild system, mail, auction house, friends list - all included. Probably worth mentioning that guilds can have actual buffs that affect their members, so being in a guild is very beneficial. Guilds also want as many members as they can get because each time a member completes a dungeon he earns his level in guild points - so it's a symbiotic win-win situation.Guild halls are included as well, which guilds can add items to. Unlike most games, where those serve vanity alone, in C9 guild items also grant a certain buff to guild members.Now would be a good time to mention the stamina system; yes, your usual ""You played too much today, pay us money or you can't play anymore"" system. The good news is that the amount of stamina you are given is so high, you can probably play for over four hours before it runs out, and you have weekly ""reserve"" stamina in case you need it.I only ever used my reserve stamina on the first day of playing with a character (when stages are very brief). Never actually fully ran out of stamina.Finally, I think it's time to talk about the cash system. Yes, there is a cash shop. Yes, you can literally buy power in it, among other things. The question is, ""Is it a deal-breaker?""For me, personally, no; the the game asks for only a small amount of cash as a one-time payment to get the (sane) maximum amount of power - about 20$. You can go overboard and enchant your gear, but there is no real reason to unless you want to compete in tournaments or go to Hell mode solo, and I'm not sure whether tournaments allow you to bring your own gear or not.I have personally never bought anything, and found the game very enjoyable before the technical issues started. My main is a level 51 on a Punisher at the moment, though I have other characters.Would I recommend C9? Yes and no. If you can get it to work without disconnections and crashes, this is a very fun game you can sink multiple hours into. If you can't... Then you can't, and there's nothing you can do about it.So, give it a shot, if it works for you then you're a luckier man than I.PLEASE READ THE FOLLOW-UP COMMENT BELOW.			"

												C9 is would in my opinion be one of the greatest mmorpgs ever,with the really action based combat system, and pvp, which is one of the main parts in this game.It´s a free combat system, where you need to aim yourselfand not click and autofocus, like it is in most other mmos.Compared to other mmos, this game doesn´t have open world pve,all pve content is based on dungeons.Also there are no real raids, or sth. like this, since the max. amount of players in one group is 4.But anyways, pve in my opinion still is fun, until max. lvl,then there´s really missing some content.But sadly webzen as the publisher ruined the game totally.It became insane p2w over the years, in pve and pvp,as well, there are many bugs, that aren´t fixed for monthsand with nearly all """"events"""" they do, they´re yust fooling their players.Also the pvp system is to much dominated by lags and bugs,which were often caused by the peer2peer system for pvpand players from countries extreme far away from the serverregion,like brasilian players on EU servers.The game would be really good, if a company would publish it,that respect their players and community.

												This is hands down my favorite mmorpg mechanic wise. The combo based fighting game style combat and intrusion are probably the best things I have ever seen in a mmo. Unfortunately Webzen went full retard and decided they should publish their own game internationally and severely ♥♥♥♥ed up the launch. I played mostly immediately before and shortly after the launch. The server was having either maintence or downtime literally every other day. As a result the game pretty much died. A shame really, because I don't think I will ever have another game where me and my buddy go on a 16 hour intrusion streak having the best gaming moments of my life			"

												Updated Sept. 4, 2016:Now that the game fixes ""some"" bugs and those bots, ""gold seller"" had been removed from towns. I can say that this game is now playable. And they offer events for new players and returning players as well and I think it's a good move from them to make this game to come back alive..I now recommend this game especially to new players. Good work!PS:  I did not change my recommendation to ""Yes"" because it will reset the review.***********************************************I played this game when it was released OBT (2012). I played it for about 3 years until 2015. My playtime here is not recorded from the start because I created my steam account only last 2014 and the playtime is not fully recorded due to some bugs in the launcher. I stopped playing this because:1.) The server migrated SEA users from US Server (Im from SEA country, PH). I abandoned some of my friends there.2.) Webzen Customer Support Sucks. They reply to you 5-7 days after you report your problem.3.) Too many gold sellers and spammers in the world chat. And in every town you can see them spamming also in the normal chat. For 3 years of playing and until now they haven't find a solution for that! WEW.....4.) It become a Pay-To-Win game. They said that they will only sell costumes to make your character looks good in their marketplace and it doesn't affect the performance game. But look on their website now. You can see plenty of BS happening right now.5.) The community. The PVE Partying system is now dead. If you're a new player you'll end up running dungeons solo. And some only helps you if you got Dimensional Fissure in your dungeon run.6.) Dungeon runs are boring. Even the story in-game are boring too.What I love in this game is the PVP!!!! The best PVP experience I've ever had. Whether it's a team match or solo or relay match! (sadly to say PVP system now sucks because most of the players now there are big time spender in-game and they can easily beat you out of the crap even with no PVP skills. Crap crap crap pfttt.)-Stein78 (Council Guild, SEA Server)			"

												There's a lot of upsides and downsides to this game, by this current post.DOWNSIDES:-This game is graphically demanding, meaning if you wanted to have the best and smoothest experience and a constant 60 FPS, you better have a top-range computer powered by the ghosts of dead Microsoft certified system engineers. Otherwise, once you start using the Flashy and awesome looking skills, you're gonna start lagging. You do, however, get the option to reduce the terrible lag by looking around in the Preferences and turning things off or down to Low.-Research the classes before you're sure what you want to use throughout the game, you may find certain Main/Sub classes that are too problematic for you.-Everyone says (And whines) that C9 doesn't lag, but there always will be lag and in this game, its called Connection Lag.-Customer Support and Service is the WORST, in fact, it makes EA Games look like an active, and helping saint. No one responds to anything, and it even goes far as Webzen banning your account if you complain to them or about them in their own forums website.-This game is a GRINDER, meaning you go out and spend an entire day farming and looking for that one item that you'll need for something.-RNGesus.-There's a Trade Office, meaning you can buy and sell stuff to and from other players out there (Take a look at the prices  of what item sells for what before doing so, otherwise you're not going to get much profit, sell too little, you're ripping yourself off, sell too much, no ones ever going to buy it)-Typical prices in Trade Office are usually in the millions, meaning you better save up and grind as hard and as fast as you can.-You're going to be a constant customer to the Blacksmith, because there is a repair system and dying halves your equipment's durability.-Beware turning on Intrusion, at some point, there WILL be a P2W lvl 67 (current Level Cap) with full Perfect grade equipment coming after your head and will humiliate you if you do.-Beware using Intrusion, if you die while doing so, you don't revive in the dungeon while your target can revive as many times as they want (so long as they have spare Resurrection Scrolls), and if you strike unlucky with a veteran thats busy grinding away and you're not as good as PVP'ing as they are, your ♥♥♥ is automatically handed to you on a silver platter. (Some will openly humiliate you)-There is a plot.-There are bound items, meaning you can't store them in a warehouse, they can't be traded and they will take/waste space.-Gold dropped by normal monsters are rarely worth picking up, completing quests of any kind will ALWAYS give more EXP and money than what you kill.-Typical skimpy female armor exists here, meaning you get a LOT of fanservices, top and bottom.-That trailer you saw? Those are called Ultimate Fury skills, and they're the most laggy skills you'll find out there, and they come with a pretty hefty price.-The enchancing equipment part quickly becomes an all-or-nothing.-And lastly, this game is dying and becoming a heavily implied Pay-2-Win. Almost every person you'll find in-game is a veteran IRL money-spender, and if you decide to join the P2W crew, Webzen will squeeze every penny out of you.UPSIDES:-This game is fun, extremly fun, sometimes addicting and in a few morbid cases, very satisfying. Its the MMORPG version of Dynasty Warriors, minus the politics with NPCs. You're the Big Good who's the only one competent person out there (minus the few temporary NPC allies) that goes out, tosses and paints entire mountains with enemy blood like its another Tuesday to you, and the only ""Impossible Bosses and Monsters"" are ones scripted to be impossible. Theres even bosses that can be tossed about and thrown everywhere before they can do much to you. You can party with 3 other players to make the massacre even more enjoyable.-There is a plot, and its decent enough to keep you interested in the ""long struggle to save Glenheim"".-There's a lot of classes you can choose, just by the (current) 5 Main classes, each having their own sub classes. And if you want to make different characters, you have plenty of slots to use. (They all share the same Warehouse, however)-There are even Artisan Occupations which are available for you to choose at the very start of the game. (Research before you choose, though. If you pick an Occupation that won't do much for you, you're not even gonna bother using it and you can't change once you decide. Also, wait a few levels before you decide to spend time crafting, as they can be expensive.)-RNGesus.-There's a Trade Office, meaning you can buy and sell stuff to and from other players out there.-If you don't want to bother using the Trade Office, you can sell or trade them by typing out in the chat and Shift-Rightclick the item you want to sell/trade, theres even a Trade channel.-Friendly players and guilds do exist in the game, so ask around if you have any questions, they're likely to answer you. But don't be suprised when the guild you joined starts getting silent more often.-Auspices and Legends boost your character's stats, while Titles give you a sense of impressive accomplishment, the Titles and Legends are found and given by Acheivement Grinding. Auspices are usually gotten through events and buying them.-If you join a guild and they are at a high enough level, you can buff yourself up with Guild buffs and Guild skills (The buffs are made through Artisan Occupations such as Metalsmithing, Woodworking and Tailoring.-You can upgrade your gear with the Blacksmith and the Artisan Metalsmithing, making you all the more godly in the dungeons.-You can craft your own weapons, armor and accessories. Rare grades takes more time but is more worth it than the Magic grades, and the same holds true for Perfect grades over Rare grades.-Sold something you didn't mean to, including Bound items? You can repurchase them! For double the amount they sold! (So long as you didn't quit the game, or switched characters and you realized quickly what you did)-A LOT of scenery to go and explore.-Theres a mentor/student system! As long as the student is below lvl 25 and the mentor is above lvl 40, the student gets DOUBLE the EXP while the mentor gets double guild points and mentor medals, which can be traded for (most of the time) useful goodies.

												Overall of the game is good. It's pve is kinda boring but the pvp is one of the greatest I've ever seen in these kind of games. If you like pvp and if you want to download it don't download the steam version because it has some issues, download it from it's official site.			"

												I play this game once about 6 months or so. The core of the game--the combat and level design--is amazing, but the questing is far too repetitive. At least it's not pay to win, at least not from what I've seen so far, and my character is about mid to low level.As I said before, while this game is a huge grind as an mmo--expect to do the same dungeons at least 10 times each at some points--the combat is where it shines. It's very fast-paced and tight, and while there are a plethora of action mmos populating the market, I always come back to this game because there's nothing quite like it. In my eyes, it's perfect. I enjoy how difficult the combat in this game is, too, even in PvE, and especially if you choose a class that's combo-reliant and fragile like Slayer or Shadow. And there are 21 unique classes with unique playstyles, and they release a new class every few months.If you like action mmos and don't mind that C9 is instance-based, I'd recommend giving this game a try, at least until level 15 when you choose your class. You might be able to tolerate the grind more than I have.			"

												I decided to give it a go despite the fact that if you set the reviews to ""recent"" you'll see nothing but a see of don't recommends.There is some securtiy program attached to the game whereby it'll close it down if it detects a ""suspicious program"". I've tried multiple times to get this running by closing down things that I would rather have running but I wouldn't determine as being essential (including not having steam open which works for some), however, this was to no avail.From my googling it seems that maybe if you uninstall your antivirus then that may be the solution, but to me that 100% unacceptable.Whilst I get that people that bot or hack are incredibly annoying (and I'd hope this program sucessfully filters them out or it's entirely pointless to have) if you're going to implement a security system then it really should be designed to be far more accurate and not some sort of blanket, is there anything at all running on your computer, well no, you can't play - which is what it appears.So yeah, whilst I'm sure some people will get this working, I presume depending on the anti-virus you use (or if you use one at all) and other factors, I really wouldn't waste any bandwidth on it, which is a shame because I've enjoyed similar games like dragon nest (and and never had a problem with any of them despite having played most of them around).

												In over 20 years of beta testing videogames I have to say that the character creation in this game is absolutely outstanding. The fact that you can create your own combos of skills is unheard of in the majority of the MMOs out there. I will explain... I play a taoist which is one of the advanced classes from the shaman tree. The taoist has several types of attacks, charges, ground attacks, AOEs etc. you can mix and match these types of attacks into any combo you want to. Gone is the WoW type of best DPS rotation gameplay and instead you can create your own combination of moves based on what kind of attacks you want in your rotation in what order. I definately reccomend this game for people that like combat oriented MMOs and don't want to be forced into one kind of skill rotation.			"

												I've been playing this game for years (Don't let my play time fool you, I had no idea it was on Steam at first xD), and it's one of my all-time favorite MMORPGs. :D These are my own personal opinions of the game.Pros:• STUNNING graphics - If your graphics card can handle it. I usually only crank my settings up for screenshots and then switch back to playing on low quality. xD (I have a NVIDIA GT 740 mind you, that's not a GTX, it's just a GT and it's crap. >:U)• Really neat combat - The skills look AWESOME! It actually takes a bit of practice. It's fun to see how many combos you can get in a row. :D • Instance ratings - Once you finish clearing a dungeon/instance you're given a rating based on how you performed. It judges your kills, skills, style, and technic. It's fun to achieve the best you can in each instance. ^u^• Nice community - I've been in a couple different guilds and both of them were respectful. I've never had any problems with the community. • Doesn't beg you to buy whatever from item malls like other MMOs• Decent character customization - I like how you can add tattoos and change your lip color. Little details, little details. • Story line keeps you interested (or it did for me anyway)• Music is catchy and will get stuck in your head a lot, I don't consider that a bad thing though xDCons:• Female outfits are a bit too skimpy for my tastes• As most MMORPGs (for me anyway) it will be one where you will take months off of it at a time because you'll probably end up playing it for like a week straight and then getting burnt on it. Moderation is key. xDSo as you can see the Pros definitely outweigh the Cons in my perspective. If for some reason I run out of space on my PC and have to remove some games, this will not be one of them. Nuff said. :b			"

												First off, the playtime listed is false. The browser in steam closes after starting the actual game so the time tracked is not accurate. Now then, I have to say that this game suprised me in all the right ways. The combat is extremely satisfying and it provides a sufficient challenge at higher levels. The animations are quite good for a game of this style and melee combat is particularly satisfying. The story is moderately throwaway, but better than the absolute garbage ones of it's peers Dragons Nest and Vindictus. The game is more fluid than Vindictus and is generally more interesting than Dragons Nest, from Loot to Crafting. The major knocks I have against it are some choppy animations and buggy textures from time to time, and a slow start. All in all, if you generally like ARPGs, give it a shot, it's very good.TLDR: Beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of a bunch of goblins in a Victorian Era Dress with a giant steampunk hammer. 11/10			"

												Great game, guides you on rails. The best part about it isn't the story content anyway (though it is worth a read on the first playthrough), it's the combat. This is that God of War feel of slashing through entire armies! That's the initial appeal for the game, then you can get into PvP, and that's an entirely new fun element. There's lots of 'fresh' content, with events every 2 weeks or so. The only reason that I spent any cash on this game is because it is fun, and I was right in thinking that it would be more fun if I had more inventory room.			"

												C9 - ""This game ruined my life, good thing I can resurrect myself in the C9""Looking for insane action? good pvp, team vs team? Then you should download Continent of the Ninth Seal                                                                                             My rating: 8.4/10So lets take a look at pluses and minuses of the game:+ Deep skills and commands system (Super armors, invisible frames, combos)+ Good pvp, deathmatch, team vs team system.+ A lot of cities and dungeons to explore.+ 5 classes and a lot of subclasses to try.+ Pretty good crafting and guild system.+ No need to use real money to be equal to other players.Minuses:- Servers are pretty laggy.- Quests are boring, killing and taking stuff. Only a few quests are interesting.- Webzen (game hosts) aren't paying attention to C9 community needs and opinion- They are making more and more cash shop items (pay to win)In conclusion this game is really good and very competitive. And the best thing about this game is that you don't need to get the best items or boosts to be good at PvP or Deathmatch, it's all about skill. You can be like 15levels lower than your opponent, but you still can beat him up. Go and try it out!			"

												A nice game, but issues it has can prevent players from getting an enjoyable experience.At the beginning the gameplay feels quite enjoyable, slashing monters is fun, even if it requires little tactics in most cases, some combos you can make are pretty amazing and there's surely some skill involved. Skill trees alows decent levels of customization, crafting is pretty good and easy to learn. Leveling is fast and you can make a few characters without dieing from boredom while grinding. Graphics and sound are also pretty good, nothing that special, but above average for sure.BUT...The game is instable and so are all its servers. All the fighting is done in instances, and every crash or disconnect make you lose your progress (it kicks you out of the instance). As you can expect to get both DCs and crashes a few times a day, the game can become unbearably frustrating. Most of instances are pretty short (max. 15 mins), but you have to be very patient, or very lucky to not get discouraged by the stability issues. I had a lot of fun with this game thanks to enjoyable combat and fast progression, but becasue of those issues I pointed out I can't reallly recommend it to anyone.PS Also, don't buy the starter pack here on Steam, it's pretty much worthless.

												Ok so the game is freaking awsome. The graphics, the  armor, the costumes, the skills everything is really fun and addicting, but (there is always a but in a game) the game has some issues. As I said the looks and the skills, animations they look very nice and  thats very good because most of the time you  will be killing some mobs or other players. They're adding content new classes,levels,dungeons all sort of stuff. Ofcourse the game have some technical problems and in later levels when you want to upgrade your gear you may start thinking it's a bit P2W, but the game is awsome I have played over 1000 hours the steam hours say it incorectly because i downloaded it from the site a LONG time ago i played it for a very long time and i can give this 8/10 easily.

												Great game, it's really addictive, but as with any other you can lose interest if you're not playing with friends.Combat: The combat is real-time, it's not simply press buttons, you have to dodge and aim every attack. 9/10 for the implementationm the only draw-back being that the skill set is just as extensive as a classic MMORPG, it would really allow you to get more into the fast paced play-style if they would have cut down the hotkeyed skills to the essentials and keep some kind of evolving short skill set for the entire game with a combo system of set key combinations.Graphics: The graphics are exceptional for an MMO game, reflections, shadows, and even lighting are pretty darn realistic. If someone were to use real-life HD photos to generate the textures in this game, I don't think you'd be able to distinguish it from the real deal.Story: The story is unified and interesting.Gameplay overall: Is very satisfying, unlike a lot of games, it is pretty easy to get decent gear for your level once you get to the second continent. Nothing is more painful than when an MMORPG that makes it so that you can't afford or get items for your level without a week long grind to get materials or to raise the money. The fact that there are an abundance of dungeons to play, and that real-time combat doesn't simply test your button mashing skills, but your actual hand-eye coordination you will find every fight a new and rewarding experience.

												Webzen completed the merger with gpotato.eu and gpotato.com servers, which caused the accounts system to not merge over properly. As a result my account is taking up space on the database, but I am unable to log into the account due to an ""invalid email address"" error, however I am also unable to register with my email address due to ""address is already in use error"". Upon further investigation this is a major error with the server company of Webzen, and you have to fill out a massive questionaire to get your account recovered and merged, that would certainly be helpful if I was an active player who was continiously playing. I am not, however, and returning after a hiatus from the game of months on end, which means any of that information is lost in the server database. After realizing I can't give the information on the accoutn due to how long it's been since I have played. Giving up on recovering my account, I resigned to creating a new on and starting over, only to receive a ""channeling partner information is not valid error"" for a username and email that I have used for years and never used for MMO gaming. I have since uninstalled the game and felt I should leave this information with anyone who is attemptign to setup this game, you'll be lucky to get anything to work, and mercy upon you if you have to contact their support, some people have been waitign 2+ weeks since this announcement came out with the recovery information and no response from the C9 team either.

												A below average action MMORPG. I put a lot of time into it, only because I was playing with a group of friends. The more I played, the more I saw the flaws in the game, until I eventually ended up quitting. The only semi-positive thing I would say about it, is the combat is not too bad, but not that great either. You have to buy skillstones to use a lot of your skills. If you run out of skillstones, or didn't buy enough of them before entering a dungeon, have fun doing normal attacks the whole dungeon. The dialog is terrible and the cutscenes all look bad. The storyline is bland and generic. Your inventory only has about 20 slots in it and you are constantly getting all sorts of items that you need to hold onto, but never have enough space for. You can't upgrade your inventory space without paying real money for it or by joining a higher leveled guild. Theres also a stamina system that only lets you play a certain amount of dungeon per day. Once it runs out, you can't play anymore.			"

I've spent much more time than that in C9, and I can definitely say that this is a game that I enjoy. Dungeons are fun to go through, there's minimal P2W, as far as I know, combat is exciting, and I actually care about the story, which is rare for this kind of game. I could go on, but I'll wrap up with ""at least try this game.""The one problem I have is the text windows are a bit funky.			"

												I have played this game for about 4 months now and I have to say I am enjoying it very much. What I like the most about it is that you can make a ""party"" and play with your friends. This option gave many many in-game hours of fun to my husband and me and obviously finishing quests is a lot easier if you're not going alone. There's plenty of different classes to choose from and after level 20 you get even more options because every class splits into some sort of sub-class (normally there is 4 or 5 of them). The game allows you to have 12 characters at the same time so you can switch between them any time you want if you get bored. I like the variety of skills that characters have, each one unique and (for me at least) interesting to watch :-) If I had to say something negative about it, it would be very small inventory space but somehow between your personal inventory, warehouse and guild warehouse (if you are a member of one), you manage. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries to actually log into game but I'm more than willing to overlook that considering it doesn't take long to log back in and you get hours and hours of fun once you're in.Even though I played for months I have very little hours on record purely because I was too lazy to look into it and see why is steam not recording. A couple of days ago I looked around a little bit and found out that if you run steam as an administrator on initial launch it will record hours and show you as ""in-game"" . Steam did not record hours because the game has it's own launcher and apparently this is also the case with other games that have their own launcher.Game is free to play although there are in-game items you can buy through ""cash shop"" with Wcoins (you top up on your webzen account) but in my experience it is not essential for winning to buy anything, therefore I would have to say it is not pay to win, but that's just my opinion. If you are willing to spend some cash, you can get adorable pets that follow you around and have their own abilities or boost your own. You buy ""mysterious egg"" so you can't actually choose your pet, drops are completely random.I like everything about this game, from characters and their attractive attire to crafting and many other perks and options. I would recommend this game to anyone.			"

It's not that my PC doesn't meet spec, in fact it surpasses it, but my security software loses it's mind whenever this game boots and continues to throw a fit until every speck of this game has been scrubbed clean.

												Can't recommend this Game but first of all the Pro's:-Character Customization is decent. -Characters itself look okish. -The Class System seems promising. -No Tab targetting.-Good OptimizationNow we come already to the many Con's: -No Tabtargetting and yet ''Press 0-9 to use Skill XY''-Genderlock doesn't work here at all. -To much running around in Town. -Controls are clunky-Gameplay is clunky-everything feels clunky-Leveling feels pretty slow.-Gamepad is supported, but makes no sense at all. -P2W (Gear/Weapons and whatnot buyable with real Moneyz.)-Doesn't save Graphic SettingsOverall the Game feels like a Prototype that could've turned into a good Game, but just didn't.  The Class System seemed nice, the Character Creation was ok, but f.e the Tutorial started already... Lame. It could've been ''something'', but it's just not. I played a total of 2,5 Hours. That was enough for me, to make a myself a Picture about the Game. *Steam did not reckognize the Game anymore after the first Start. Whatever was the Reason, I don't know.			"

												I tell as it is:If you start without the gift that gives you more health and mana then its a pain to fight there.If i wish to charge wcoins trough steam then it wont let you.If i wish to get wcoins from the webzens main site then you dont have in-game achievements to purchase.Combat is fun, but sometimes you must beat the same dungeon twice or even more to complete the quests.The main fun ""Crafting"" is too expensive that your only fun can be collecting resources.Characters inventory is so small-sized that after every dungeon you must go to put your stuff into the storage.Graphic of this game is nice.Music is good.You must suffer so much before you can change your class at level 20. Before you can do that you must complete all challenging quests that your or other trainers will give you.			"

												Another unfinished broken Korean MMORPG. It's a bit less sluggish than many since it is more action oriented. No auto-target here. Still extremely janky and typical of what one expects with Korea F2P MMORPGs.On a side note, they have some kind of overzealous security function that seems to be killing a lot of legit players off the game rendering it mostly unplayable regardless of how much one may enjoy a good grindy actiony mmorpg.Final Verdict: Skip it.

Amped up Metal tracks for most dungeons and nice Calm Melodies for the Towns. (very kool mellow sounding guitar riff for Runnersville loved that) Combat system is very fluent and fun to use and has tons of unlocks and evolutions/styles per Character Class. PvP is ruthless unless you know what you are doing LoL. Ive personally had a blast grinding thru this game over the last few years and met some kool helpful people playing. C9 never asks for your money or a subscription or none of that, just download, signup for WebZen and away you go. My Guild is called ""StarrFyre"" join us if you like =)			"

The settings are certainly not the best for this game. I had my resolution size adjusted to 1280 by 800, which ♥♥♥♥ed up my screen in the game. And I could only see some things cut off, where I can't see the rest of the HUD.Avoid this game, if possible.			"

												I tried to download this game, but I ran into a bazillion problems just getting to the logon screen. When it finally got me there, it kept giving me an exception error. I finally gave up after a few hours of frustration, redownloading, and looking at forums for hours trying to get this stupid thing to work. I finally gave up, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that I wasted my night trying to get this stupid thing to work with no avail. Don't get this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing.			"

												A friend had mentioned this, so I figured I'd try it.  I'd never heard of the game before.It's yet another free to play MMO, but it looks dated.  Graphical presentation isn't anything to brag about, and the default resolution was so bad my computer warned me about it.  Text frequently breaks in the middle of words during the ""story"" and the plot is the same derivitave slop you've played a million times before.   Voice acting is mediocre.  Some of the enemy design was interesting, but still not anything really new.Everything about this game is trite and/or ripped off.  Character creation did have a couple of surprisingly neat features, but it's definitely not enough to warrant playing the game.Save yourself the time and energy.  This doesn't offer anything worth the ridiculous login hassle and dowload times.			"

												This game was originally fun. It had a lot of missions to do and had a fairly decent storyline. Why I dont recommend this game is because of the hosting company Webzen. Webzen is making false accusations against players who use the system Webzen built called The Warehouse. The warehouse is a storage system that is shared amongst all characters on one account and Webzen also allows up to 8 characters. With that, one could create 2 characters or more and.....YEP share GOLD!!! Who would think something like that would ever happen in an MMO with shared storage? So you could create a very powerful character and farm gold (oh and that gets really easy since you get treasure maps that are worth 2-5k for each play through) and yep store it in your warehouse for another character to use. If you want your account blocked for simply playing a game using a system the creators put in place this might be the game for you. Otherwise avoid this title.			"

												It is a beautiful game, as far as graphics go. The BGM tends to get on my nerves a little with the canned electric guitar. The control of the character feels clunky and there is very little voice acting; more of a reading type RPG. The text is always broken in the speech bubbles. Overall, I would recommend Dragon Nest over this game. C9 feels unfinished and rushed. The combat is not that fun and I cannot see myself staying in the game for a long period of time, before getting bored. This game relies too heavily on appearance rather than gameplay. It just doesn't pull me in.Games I like and have played through, to give you an idea of what I like. This might help you in deciding whether to give this review credit or to go ahead and play the game: Guild Wars 2, DC Universe, Path of Exile, Dragon Nest (currently playing).			"

												Have you ever wanted a facial for a face tattoo? Ya, I didn’t think so. In case you are one of those people, place C9 (Continent of the Ninth Seal) as the female characters have that option.Wow, this game really sexualizes females and though some are sexy, most, go so far it takes away from the actual game. The game itself, when looking past that, is really enjoyable. The combat is quick, the game is visually nice to the eye (whether it be environmental art style or… the girls), there is a good soundtrack and there is a story (even though it is a forgettable one).The community is also still alive and there are frequent giveaways by MMOhut and MMObomb that you can get free cash shop items every once and a while. I highly just trying this game. Personally, I think it is better than Vindictus (yet again, I haven’t played that since closed beta)			"

												I know this is an old game, lots'a games like this run for MANY yrs if they're populated (this game is, at least the NA server is)... I used to REALLY like playing some older MMORPGs in the late 90s, early Y2Kyrs right... I download, & try out literally EVERY 3D, real time MMO I can find that's in English... this one looks really neat set to max settings, and while atually in battle, it's the most fun ""Hack, & slash"" MMORPG I've played since the last Western PSU V.2 Illuminous (or the PSP PS-Portable if you like [the BEST PSO I ever played TBH]) servers went down some years ago... Invictus is pretty fun, but seems more limited to Me (& is harder to tell where to go for quests etc.), Tera isn't out on Steam yet, & yeah I know it's awesome... Anyhow if you're not playing Tera from the homepage, & want a really fun, combo oriented, hack, N slash type RPG that works GREAT with an X360 pad, or KB+Mouse (I use mouse+ controller on here due to the fact that it for some reason swaps My R-L on the right stick with the R-L triggers which lots'a Asian made games do when using USA X360 pads IDK why, and you cannot remap some stuff), plays/runs REALLY smoothly, has players/servers worldwide, and most importantly is FUN, then this is the best one on Steam ATM in My opinion... like playin Soul Calibre in 3D with slight cooldowns on some combo steps LOL			"

Not webzens primary money maker so it doesnt get as much attention as the others. The amount of customization for your pvp or pve styles makes it so unique but to change your skill set you must have alot of money because they are locked in once you select them unlike BnS. --- Best pvp ever--- Low pop and webzen's runt of the litter			"

												C9 is a MMORPG game that uses your typical class system. You can make up to 12 different characters and uniquely customize each one. Each class has its advantages and disadvantages, although some are better than others no matter what. This game requires large amounts of skill and devotion if you want to become ""good"". By ""good"" I mean being able to get through dungeons with a S rank in all four categories. This game is based massively on technique, character builds (including elements, stats, skill builds, etc), and a good gamer sense. I once watched a lvl 24 berserker woop a lvl 52 berserker's butt in the arena. The level 24 Berserker took advantage of every buff that the class was given including I frames and knockback/down. Watch out for scammers that try too sell gold too you. Gold can be hard to get if you hoard your items like me and only get gold from common weapons that you sell and that you pick up in dungeons. Usually there are two builds that people follow. PvE (Player versus Environment, a.k.a dungeons) and PvP (Player versus Player). I would advise you to get this game if you want to have a difficult, yet fun experience with other friends in your Guild.			"

												I have a problem with my computer keeping cool with this game at times. However, I played this during open beta, and I loved it. The witchblade is, in my honest opinion, the best class for those who just wanna beat the hell out of everything and not get touched. Strike, cast, dodge.			"

												5GB file and the game says that the game still needs to update tons upon tons of files more! The files are large, with no way of keeping track how much you have already downloaded and no way of telling how much more you have to downloaded cos there isn't any indication, percentage or any of the sort what-so-ever indicated by the launcher. And here comes the best part: no pause and resume download function, it doesn't even resume download when you closed the launcher and opened it to continue downloading it the next day. I live in another part of the world in Malaysia, server lag is imminent but at least provide options to continue updating where I left it the day before and not wanting to finish the download one shot. This just goes to show the commitment the developer is in making the game available to everyone, which in my eyes, there is none.			"

												This game is impossible to play, as in Webzen screwed up or something and linking it to your Steam account is impossible.  I even went to the trouble of creating a new account and nothing is working.  Not about to bother contacting CS as most likely they will tell me to do everything I have already done.  Just... bleh.

												Yeah its not bad played it 3+ years ago.Can't say I didnt enjoy it.my only gripe with most games though is the whole needing to spend money to buy potions. imo hp should just regen out of combat for most dungeon crawlers unless its a game where you die once and its over (no respawns no pick up allies etc)Imo thats just a waste of coins you could buy armor/items with etc. But that seems to be how most dungeon crawlers that are online work now a days.

												Foremost, account registration is a nightmare. Especially if you've an account for any of their other listed games and are in need of retreiving your username or password. New users shouldn't have any issues here. This game should not be on steam. Apparently the game and steam engine hate each other and refuse to work together. There was only one US server available and three channels within to choose from. There are only FIVE classes to choose from. Sadly, they are gender-biased. There are three female characters and two male characters only. Females are magic based and males are physical.Character customization is SAD. You will be forced to play as an asian character with limited options to hair style, hair color and skin color. So much for diversity in appearance. Actually, I refuse to waste my time to write a full review for this game. There are simply far more engaging, entertaining and well-built free MMOs out there to bother looking at this one twice.Three thumbs down.			"

												First thing first: ♥♥♥♥ THE ANTI-BOT SYSTEM THEY HAVE! its the most rediculous most annoying ♥♥♥♥ ever, it always come up mid battle and u will probably fail it coz u need to do some wierd precision ♥♥♥♥ while being ♥♥♥♥♥ by 70 bloody gnomes and once u fail it (which u bloody will) the game will wait untill your in combat again to throw another one at you, whoever made this system deserves to be condemened to the lowest level of hell.Alright so, leme start by saying that the 5 min steam claims i have played this game is wrong, i have spent afew hours (1 session) and for some reason it didnt count that.now for the actual review:This is a hack'n'slash korean mmo rpg thing or as they call it ""Action mmorpg"" which works fine for the most part, the skills are flashy animation is rather decent and the hits connect properly and lag dosent ♥♥♥♥ you up so this part of the game works pretty much as u would exepect.The game is rather minimalist tho it dosent look like alot of effort went into the game, the game is devided into towns and everything other then that is just a Hub-based dungeon thing - you go to a portal, you select an area u want on the map and ur teleported there for a fight and when ur done u can either restart it or teleport back into town which is kinda boring tbh.Dungeons can work on different diffuculty levels and the only difference between them is that mobs hit harder and have more health, the terrain stays the same, visualy the monsters are the same and thier ammount is the same so nothing too much exciting.Ingame you have 5 classes, each class have 4 sub-classes which could be counted as ""20 playable classes! woohoo"" but in reality its not as exciting as that sadly since the sub classes share the same ""Core"" skills with some unique additions.Also, the game seems to be populated by turks and anything other then WTS/WTB is basicly turkish chit-chat.Ingame store has mostly cosmetics BUT WAIT! thouse cosmetics have passive dmg/deff buffs so u can draw your own conclusions from that fact, tho it seems u can purchase this items from other players with ingame currency so if thats your sort of thing, go for it.Graphicly wise the game isnt impressive, its not bad either, its somewhere is that borring mediocre range when it dosent thrill you but dosent discust you either therefor uninteresting to talk about. Oh, and the game is littered with invisible walls which no1 even bothered to hide which seems abit lazy, but meh.So, overall, after palying for about 3 hours or so checking different classes and running into invis walls my game just crashed behind a loading screen at 99% creating and infinite singularity of spinning graphics and it was at this point that i looks up at my ceiling and realized how bored i have been. Still tho, some people might find this gam fun, there is nothing mechanicly wrong with it as i said be4, u press the buttons and the mosters die and thats all you can ask for really, so, if ur a fan of the genere and enjoy games like Tera but looking for something less good you can give this game a bash and see where it goes!

Line bottom of each cake pan with parchment paper, then brush again and set aside.In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt, then set that set aside too. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together butter and sugar. Slowly add egg whites and mix until well combined. Add vanilla and mix until fully incorporated. Add flour mixture and milk in two alternating additions, beginning with the flour and ending with the milk. Mix until well combined.Divide batter evenly between six medium bowls. Add enough of each color of food coloring to each bowl, whisking, until desired shade is reached. Transfer each color to an individual cake pan. Transfer to oven and bake until a cake tester inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, about 15 minutes (working in batches if necessary).Remove cakes from oven and transfer to a wire rack. Let them cool for 10 minutes. Invert cakes onto a wire rack, then re-invert and let cool completely.Using a serrated knife, trim tops of cakes to make level. Place four strips of parchment paper around perimeter of a serving plate or lazy Susan. Place the purple layer on the cake plate. Spread 1 cup of buttercream filling over the first layer so it extends just beyond edges. Repeat process with blue, green, yellow, and orange layers.Place the remaining red layer on top, bottom-side up. Gently sweep away any loose crumbs, then cover the top and sides with a thin layer of frosting (also use any of the excess frosting visible between the layers). Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.Optional: after refrigerating, cover cake again with remaining frosting.			"

												Continent of the ninth seal is laughably terrible. save yourself the time and dont download it, if you are curious look up a video.  In total the character customization consisted of 5 classes, which keep in mind all of them are gender locked, each one has 3 faces, and 3 hairstyles. Now to the gameplay, ever heard of Tera? cause its the exact same fighting just a bit more like vindictus.  The graphics are pretty much from 2009 with tons of sharp edges, in the first 10 minutes of game play i fell through the map and was forced to reload the game. The website is non responsive, so good luck getting any help there. All-In-All this game gets a 3/10 from me. This game was released in 2012 and the only reason that i discovered it was because of a me and my friends massive ammount of searching for a good mmo.DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS!!!!!!!!!			"

												Menus are garbage, graphics are hideous, zero voice acting, all cool attacks are press a skill button and wait for the animation to finish. There's so many little things that are just pure laziness. I mean words getting cut off halway through and the second half being put on the next line. Resolution is locked at a wrong setting until you've created a character and are already in game. Couldn't even hear the introduction because the sound effects were louder than the voice, and there's no way to adjust voice volume in the game. Conversation menus were messed up for me (probably because I routinely switch my left and right mouse buttons) so that I had to try to initiate a conversation 3-5 times before the window would stay open for longer than half a second.

												Yet another seemingly BS game on STEAM that doesn't have any indication that you need to open/sign up for yet another external service provider. Another game that doesn't indicate that you'll have to input user name and password each and every time you open yet another seperate launcher. Another game that apparently hasn't been fully researched by STEAM, in which has no liability for a product whatsoever even though it is in there games available list be it free to play, pay to play, or purchase straight out. Yet another game that STEAM claims requires only 4GB of HDD Space when in reality the main download of it itself requires 5GB of HDD Space and another close to 8GB of additional HDD Space for an additional 15K Plus Files that are required to download from the games server/launcher itself.I am going to give it the ""Old College Try"" once it's done but this review is not a reflection of the game itself but as to inadequate information partaining to a game by STEAMS apparent and clear failure to do there homework and research to give proper information on an item yet again. So at the time I am giving the thumbs down not to the game itself but to STEAM for there failure to Properly Inform Prospective Gamers.Thanks for the half a__ed information yet again STEAM.			"

												Now why the heck do I have to download roughly 5 GB of data via Steam to be able to start the launcher, which then starts to download another ihavenoideahowfrigginmuch data to actually be able to play this game? I mean, I already find it annoying that I'm downloading a launcher from Steam, which is kind of a launcher itself, but THIS beggars all description.I might change my opinion about recommending this game after I've finally been able to PLAY it, but as of now, this is a clear ""don't take the trouble"" for you as the players and a ""damn, get this ♥♥♥♥ fixed"" to the developers.

												1/10 there are way to many look alike games and im sorry this game has no origanalty it needs a 1 due to its just a cheap copy of vindictus(which was pritty good) the community died out and the players you meet in game are toxic to newcomers this game is dying and its only a matter of time before they close down the servers but in all maybe a 1/10 was to harsh but please if you want to save this game fix the login and change the game into somthink better add a counter attack system a dodge the only players left are the die hard few that have started there mmo and have stuck with it and dont want to start again on a diffrent game which is fair enough good luck to you all that are still playing i choose to refuse this game			"

												It's annoying that my hours played is not recorded on steam but it doens't matter. Although dragon nest has better graphics, I still prefer c9. Its awesome combination of skills and effects does really make me sweat lol. pvp is good and if rate this out of 10, I would give 8 for this. Well just hoping that they make more job/classes for mhystic after reaching lvl20 as there is only battle maiden atm. But yeah, my point is, I defo recommend this :) ^^			"

												First, I've logged more hours on this game on its independent client than the Steam download. More than any quality seeking player should...I could rant on and on about my opinion of this hit and miss game, so I'll just leave this TL;DR Version of my thoughts; The only reason I give this game a yes is for the combat. Its character classes are fun, diverse, and equipped with an admirable arsenal of flashy and brutal abilities that can be chained in quick, smooth, and cruel ways - Making for one hell of a fun ""beat 'em up"". Probably one of the funnest at the moment, even.But this game is literally underwhelming in the grand scope of its existance in EVERY other aspect. Who knows. Despite the quality of life the game currently hosts, the makers are certainly active in adding content to it with weekly patches and frequent events. Maybe they'll stop a moment and polish up the content it already has? Opptimize performance, stabilize the servers, fix text errors. . . Maybe. . . But to be honest, that would still leave it with relatively stale concepts and an end-all-be-all mindset. I guess that still doesn't stop me from coming back, because I still like to play it here and there. The combat makes up for all the flaws.Combat: 11/10 . . . Overall: 5.5/10			"

												Just another asian MMO. There is absolutely nothing special about this game, unless bad UI glitches count as special.The 3D models, textures and animations look and feel like every other asian F2P MMO out there - flashy, clumsy and just don't feel right. Female characters run around like a bunch of noodles. The voice acting and the story fail to immerse you, and you'll find yourself pressing ESC to skip through the overused dialog subjects.Questing is a bore: teleport to the area, kill everything, get reward, teleport out. Do that until you are high level enough for PVP. That is, if you manage to guess what you have to do, because buttons without text and UI glitches are frequent. Moreover, higher difficulty dungeon runs aren't necessarily harder - they just have more monsters, which are so easy to kill that they might make you feel like you're playing Dynasty Warriors.I guess you simply can't expect much from the company behind MU Online, Archlord, S.U.N. Rappelz and FlyFF. It's just more of the same.			"

												A ""very fun, quick-action based dungeon grinder, killing enemies, irritating allied npc"" game which has a fun community. However, at some points it just seem to be lagging and/or crashing all of the sudden because if you have 1 second no internet connection, then you will frozen screen. Also it is Free-to-play, you can have a total of 12 characters, the lvling system and xp-rate is rather quick early-on, and then there are the sub-classes that you can choose from Fighter, witch blade, hunter, shaman and mystic, and from there you can go to 4 different sub classes.A must if you are in MMORPG and free games, but be careful for the random connection losses that might cause you to rage to this.

												No matter how many times I try I can't get past the fact that I somewhat kept lagging in town. one thing i'm head twaord a portal to play a dungeon the next god damn thing I get slingshot back a few meters. *claming down now* Okay now my rage out of way. C9 or continent of the ninth seal is a dungeon crawling RPG and the story is I don't care. I usually care when the game involves you in the story via Elsword, Dragon Nest, vindictus/Mabinogi Heroes, grand chase the list goes on. The classes are warrior, hunter, mage, witchblade (named after and anime), and sage. when you get to level 10 or 20 you advance to extra classes via gunslinger. Question where the hell am i suppose to buy weapon and armor? I still reccomend this game even though I haven't gotten far in this game. If you experience the same town lag feel free to submit a ticket (if you're willing to give the your phone number to do it).			"

												I played this game when it was in beta, but the learning curve was pretty steep.  The action and game-play was great, but the tutorials were quite lacking. They still are as far as I can tell.  There is an event going on at the moment that gives you a level 20 character to start with, but you won't know anything about how to play it and they really don't tell you either.  I still like the game play and the action, and I hear the PvP in this game is excellent, but getting to that point amy be somewhat daunting to the average rpg player.  Still and all, I am giving this game another go.  I will post more as I learn more.			"

												Cons  (Management) : It was a good game in 2012-2013, but now its just another hard pay to win game, i used to play alot of this game so i know everything on it - 2300 hours isnt low , i guess .. . I can say that i was a trully hard cash , but now seems like all the money i have put on it , just made it be more pay to win . Its not worth it anymore to play or spent ur time and money on this game , their company used to be the worst one over all these years ,  also everyone who tried to say the truth about their company in their forums got banned by a simple reason -  they dont give any attention to what people does say or what their players think/want . They are a blind company only running for money without thinking if its a good or a bad way to manage this game . Recently ( 3 months ago) there was a server called EpicC9(u can search on utube) where people could get all the stuff without need to put cash , but after these 3 months, webzen just went there and closed their server cuz of copyright(also trying to get their players back to give them money), but till it , its fine okay , right nothing against  , ""laws""... alright but alot of the players from EU, some from US , and a good amount from SEA went to that server, and now that EpicC9 is closed , no one from there will back to global  cuz we all know this game is falling apart , just more 1-2 years and it will be gone ,  theres no more fun in playing it , by the simple reason called ""Pay to win"" . A player called ""Alxia"" from EU server , have spent more than 50,000$ dollars  to put her weapon on +20 ( she's/he's the only player who have it) , Letting another players say : "" I'll not even going to try""Pros (THE GAME) : - The game itself is really good and well made( i mean by the skills/skins and weapons) , its not open world but , well its k , still considerable .- Could be the best mmorpg,hack and slash,swag skills( more with skillbooks) in the world.-  PVP without lag by the server or by a player is incredible OP.- Dont have aim assist like 95% of the mmorpgs we have nowadays.- U need to dedicate urself to get skillboks, also , i think its the only thing u really need luck to get by ur own			"

												First of all, I would like to point out that this is a WONDERFUL game that can stand firm for many more years both graphic-wise and gameplay-wise. HOWEVER, Webzen is the currently the company who owns the rights to publish the English version of this AKA this Korean game you see here. This is where all the dissatisfaction starts.Before that, let me stress that I am a long-time player, and I'll start with the good things about this game:This game on its own is GREAT. You get to feel cool while playing. There's many moves and skills to learn but yet not too much to remember. There's great potential for combos and all that jazz, and you really DO feel so cool as you control every single aspect of combat. The characters look great, and the COSTUMES, gawd the costumes were SO good. Even with extra cash items you need SKILL to win.And here's the bad things about this great game as it stands now:WEBZEN, the current proprietor of this english version of the game. They've pretty much abandoned it 2 years ago, and they've pretty much more abandoned it now. About 2 years ago, it was the height of C9 and all the servers were filled to the brim. It was Christmas and the event costumes were SO good, and the costumes kept their consistency in attractiveness that prompted me to buy them. But now the costumes are SH*T. And the last few months were the last time I logged into the game to check out my character out of nostalgia, and the costume were the same as like 1 year ago, and the costumes are BAD. They don't look good on the characters at all. W-coin is their paid-cash system and may I mention after coming back from my hiatus, they ATE my remaining W-coins; it was then when I checked out their FAQ that they expire after 1 year (of not spending or not logging in, I don't know, but mostly the earlier), and it's their ""policy"" to do so, and they won't refund that.Customer service. I checked the forum out a bit. And I am kind of amused at how the forum moderator/admin was telling the forum users who pinged them for their problems was told the team ""will come back at Monday"" AKA NO SERVICE ON WEEKENDS LOL. And tell me when's the time people play the most games to relax? You got it. Weekends. The only saving grace was their moderator/admin of the forums who is trying so hard to calm everyone down and frankly I feel sorry for them. The bugs. The friggin bugs. Some don't even get to launch it. And here's a tip folks: For the ones who are stuck at the PhysX bug at the launch that prevents you from playing the game, open your Programes and Features window (you know, that window where you want to REALLY delete stuff), right-click your NVIDIA PhysX and choose ""Change"", then ""Repair"". You do not need to reinstall anything like they said. This sh*t spawns adware/spyware/viruses. At the launcher ALONE, it shows me messages of errors saying ""adultubeus.info script blah blah blah, run?"" among others, I of course choose no, and it's better you do that too, even though choosing ""yes"" still hasn't yielded anything bad yet. That alone, is freaking annoying and UNPROFESSIONAL, and DISGRACEFUL. SCRIPTS of website link google-able to be a BROWSER HIJACKER?? Are you SERIOUS?? Then when you die in-game, you press ""yes"" to resurrect, and guess what? The window asking you if you want to resurrect WON'T GO AWAY until you click it god knows how many times!! It was there 2 years ago, an it's STILL LIKE THIS NOW. REALLY?? Gameplay. It may be just me, but some classes are just ruining it for everybody else. Assassins, for example, it's like they exist solely to annoy players with their 1-hit sucker punches in PvE intrusions (an option for you to get better exp and possibly loot in a stage if you choose it, at the cost of there's a chance people who choose to ""intrude"" on you can kill you as well in that stage). In PvP I'm sure it's tweaked and balanced out a bit, but in PvE, their damage isn't based on PvP nerfs, and it's literally a 1-hit after they CLOAK THEMSELVES INVISIBLE, by the way. No special restriction of their intrusion amount, no nothing. Then the guardian class just needs to rush at you and bump you once to RIP. Are you kidding me. Then how long did it take for them to balance the Mystic? Did they? I don't know. Maybe that's just me. Feel free to ignore this if you think it's fair.The spammers. 2 years ago. Go watch ""C9 1st look"" on ANY of the top Youtube videos that come up in the search. Notice the bottom left corner AKA the chat. And after all that time, look at now, after coming back from my hiatus, it's still ""W'W'W~BLAHBLAHBAH (DOT) COM W-COIN SALE 10 MILLION GOLD FOR EUR $10!!"" by some random sh*t dudes, names changing all the time, and it's NOT STOPPED. PLZ. BAN THEIR FRIGGIN I.P. ADDRESSES FOR LIFE. HOW HARD CAN IT BE. SET UP PEOPLE TO WATCH THEM SERVERS AND BAN IMMEDIATELY GOLD-SELLERS. THE LETTERS ""GM"" COMES TO MIND.CraftingCrafting is awesome, except for the fact that when it comes to higher or even just medium levels, crafting equipment (which yields one of the best articles you can get in the game) is almost IMPOSSIBLE, even for seasoned veterans. The unique materials are almost impossible to drop, and when you craft it, it's a chance RNG and there's a high probability you'll fail even after collecting all those shizz to use MILLIONS of coin to craft them, and don't even talk about the enhancement of it. Like give them a break. You got all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly-hard-to-drop materials and you STILL fail them on high probability when crafting them? Then why the crafting/artisan level? Oh I guess artisan levels just open you up to new options of crafting and you just throw it there.And this applies to all MMOs, and these more are lacking from this game:Server transfer.Yep. They have EU, US and SEA servers, but they are independent from each other. I once was at EU to study, and now I'm at SEA and I can't play without lag and all my good stuff are still at the EU server. When I reinstalled the game and played it, I can't play without significant lag and the hopes of a server transfer was quashed when a forum search told me that they have ceased their server transfer service since about 1 year ago. Really. This is 20-freaking-15. Get some programmers. DO SOMETHING.Skill resets. Costs cash or it's a one-time reward thing. Seriously it's the 2010's. Just let them reset with in-game money and MOVE ON. Their cash items are not cheap. Their good costumes are VERY worth it but those were long gone, and the only way you can get good costumes now? Ho-ho-ho! Buy their chests to randomly roll for your costume pieces, one at a time! And may I remind you that costumes also come with 3 colour variations, and 4 classes?? So good luck opening chests, says Webzen, cuz f*ck you! That's why!""I can't think of more now, but here's my Verdict:Webzen is GREAT at coming up with GREAT games with GREAT design and replayability (in fact, they just came up with new classes for fighter and mystic again), but equally lacks the ability to MAINTAIN it. I don't know who they gave their management rights to in the English version. I imagine they do great in the original-Korean version, but what happened here??So now I can only wait in anxiety that they just want to grab whatever remaining cash they can and then LEAVE, because if they lack anything else, they do not lack in their ""sales offers events"" and all that; and after they've made their account books green, they'll shut down the whole thing and move on. I can only dread that day. And I HOPE they PLEASE sell the rights of this game to someone else who cares and has good business practices. Seriously go back to your roots about 2 years ago. Create visually-great costumes and people will spend money on them. Reduce the bugs. People will come to you.A pity. A waste. A disgrace.			"

												I've played the game for about 15 hours so far and in that time I've tried out all the different main classes. I tried it again today after a long break, but it didn't keep me playing mainly because of inventory space problems.Pros:- The combat and dungeon crawling in this game is fun- Great character customization- Decent soundtrack- Many different classes- A lot of abilities on each character, allowing for different builds- Se*ualized costumesCons:- Lag- Lack of inventory space and warehouse space- Animation delays- Some skills or animations are somewhat broken- Lack of co-op play at lower levels8/10, It's still a fun experience.

												If you give the game just a passing glance, you’d initially think the graphics are really nice. And don’t get me wrong, they aren’t horrible by any means, but as you look closer, you start to notice things that just aren’t right. It almost feels like the game is top of the line graphics, just on an older generation engine. It does a lot of stuff right in the graphics department, but it also has some blemishes. The most annoying, to me anyway, was when the game zoomed in on the characters for a cut scene, when they’re talking, their mouths don’t move. I know, it’s a small detail that doesn’t affect gameplay at all, but it just threw me for a loop when one of the very first cut-scenes I’m presented with is some dude who vaguely looks somewhat like a bulldog standing there staring at me all closeup… and I can hear words coming from him, but his face isn’t moving at all. Therefore I would give aesthetics a pretty decent 5/10.For gameplay I would give a reasonable 6/10. This being due to lack of character development available in the game. Also the creation of your character is very limited as well. This being due to the face that there are only 4 classes to choose from. These being: Fighter, Hunter, Shaman, Witchblade. I've only played as a fighter which means I cannot talk anymore about the classes.This game is a Free to Play title therefore it isn't bad value. Although the graphics aren't the best and you can't develop your character as much as you want, but it is pretty good value. There isn't much more I can say for this section of my review # apart from it's score. The score that I would give this game for vaule is sound 8/10.Now I come to the final part of my review, the over all score. Continet of the Ninth Seal isn't a bad game, I may not have given it this best review, but it isn't horrid. The action is fun and intense early on. It just gets a little repetitive rather quickly. Once you slog through the first 20-25 levels and reach your advanced class selection the game opens up quite a bit. Unfortunately to get to that point you’ll spend a lot of time running the same dungeons over and over. This bringing the final score to a nice 7/10.This is my first real review that considers the main factors I find helpful knowing in a game, anymore reviews that I post will be conducted in a similar style. I hope this helped!			"

												It's a very action-oriented game, with four starting classes branching into (at least) four advanced ones each, with different weapons and play styles. The early game is very linear, though, and playing the same missions over and over will get boring pretty soon even with different characters. It's free-to-play so expect a lot of handy stuff to be restricted to the cash shop, too.			"

												First, I've logged more hours on this game on its independent client than the Steam download. More than any quality seeking player should...I could rant on and on about my opinion of this hit and miss game, so I'll just leave this TL;DR Version of my thoughts; The only reason I give this game a yes is for the combat. Its character classes are fun, diverse, and equipped with an admirable arsenal of flashy and brutal abilities that can be chained in quick, smooth, and cruel ways - Making for one hell of a fun ""beat 'em up"". Probably one of the funnest at the moment, even.But this game is literally underwhelming in the grand scope of its existance in EVERY other aspect. Who knows. Despite the quality of life the game currently hosts, the makers are certainly active in adding content to it with weekly patches and frequent events. Maybe they'll stop a moment and polish up the content it already has? Opptimize performance, stabilize the servers, fix text errors. . . Maybe. . . But to be honest, that would still leave it with relatively stale concepts and an end-all-be-all mindset. I guess that still doesn't stop me from coming back, because I still like to play it here and there. The combat makes up for all the flaws.Combat: 11/10 . . . Overall: 5.5/10			"

												A ""very fun, quick-action based dungeon grinder, killing enemies, irritating allied npc"" game which has a fun community. However, at some points it just seem to be lagging and/or crashing all of the sudden because if you have 1 second no internet connection, then you will frozen screen. Also it is Free-to-play, you can have a total of 12 characters, the lvling system and xp-rate is rather quick early-on, and then there are the sub-classes that you can choose from Fighter, witch blade, hunter, shaman and mystic, and from there you can go to 4 different sub classes.A must if you are in MMORPG and free games, but be careful for the random connection losses that might cause you to rage to this.

												Yes, all my yes. the class system is refreshing and awesome, the battles are fast paced and fun, miiiight get a bit repetitive over time, but flashy and awesome nonetheless. crafting on the other hand isn't that fantastic.. it's the same MMORPG booger all over again. a boring screen with all your crafty stuff on it and crafted in a few clicks... we're waiting patiently for a game that has a innovative crafting system, FireFall did an okay job on that, we want more of that.there are only so many classes you can pick, and character creation isn't that WOOOW like some others e.g. PWI or Aion, but eh, it's not as crap as let's just say..

												The combo mechanics for this game are immaculate. Steep learning curve and intricate combos. Extremely tough to master and requires a lot of patience The ability to keep an opponent in mid air till you K.O. him/her but only if you're more skilled than your opponent is the best thing about this game. The end game PvP is very good and the game keeps getting tougher as you progress through it. It goes to a point where running solo into a dungeon isn't possible unless you are built specifically for dungeon brawling. This is the game to beat and thus very egotistically satisfying when you do. P.S. Casual Gamers hate it xP			"

												Continent of the Ninth is a fun adrenaline pumping action MMORPG that’s infused with just the right amount of fantasy and PvP mayhem to keep gamers challenged. Although the quests, NPC shops, and crafting feature could be better the game excels at player killing and engaging PvE combat. Fight mobs of swift AI monsters that seem to know your next move before you make it or duel a rival player for rank with spectators cheering you on. There’s also dozens of dungeon raids, an extensive guild system for higher level players, and awe-inspiring graphics. Comparable to popular titles like Vindictus, Dragon Nest, or WoW in terms of gameplay this dungeon based MMO is definitely worth checking out.			"

												Decent graphics and character customization.  The game itself has maps with repeaters but the difficulty and mobs/map obstacles differ as the difficulty changes, so it's not a bad case of recycled maps.  Very interesting and intricate clothing. There is a crafting system as well.  After about lvl 13 grouping is required to progress.			"

												If you give the game just a passing glance, you’d initially think the graphics are really nice. And don’t get me wrong, they aren’t horrible by any means, but as you look closer, you start to notice things that just aren’t right. It almost feels like the game is top of the line graphics, just on an older generation engine. It does a lot of stuff right in the graphics department, but it also has some blemishes. The most annoying, to me anyway, was when the game zoomed in on the characters for a cut scene, when they’re talking, their mouths don’t move. I know, it’s a small detail that doesn’t affect gameplay at all, but it just threw me for a loop when one of the very first cut-scenes I’m presented with is some dude who vaguely looks somewhat like a bulldog standing there staring at me all closeup… and I can hear words coming from him, but his face isn’t moving at all. Therefore I would give aesthetics a pretty decent 5/10.For gameplay I would give a reasonable 6/10. This being due to lack of character development available in the game. Also the creation of your character is very limited as well. This being due to the face that there are only 4 classes to choose from. These being: Fighter, Hunter, Shaman, Witchblade. I've only played as a fighter which means I cannot talk anymore about the classes.This game is a Free to Play title therefore it isn't bad value. Although the graphics aren't the best and you can't develop your character as much as you want, but it is pretty good value. There isn't much more I can say for this section of my review # apart from it's score. The score that I would give this game for vaule is sound 8/10.Now I come to the final part of my review, the over all score. Continet of the Ninth Seal isn't a bad game, I may not have given it this best review, but it isn't horrid. The action is fun and intense early on. It just gets a little repetitive rather quickly. Once you slog through the first 20-25 levels and reach your advanced class selection the game opens up quite a bit. Unfortunately to get to that point you’ll spend a lot of time running the same dungeons over and over. This bringing the final score to a nice 7/10.This is my first real review that considers the main factors I find helpful knowing in a game, anymore reviews that I post will be conducted in a similar style. I hope this helped!			"

												It's a very action-oriented game, with four starting classes branching into (at least) four advanced ones each, with different weapons and play styles. The early game is very linear, though, and playing the same missions over and over will get boring pretty soon even with different characters. It's free-to-play so expect a lot of handy stuff to be restricted to the cash shop, too.			"

												Yes, all my yes. the class system is refreshing and awesome, the battles are fast paced and fun, miiiight get a bit repetitive over time, but flashy and awesome nonetheless. crafting on the other hand isn't that fantastic.. it's the same MMORPG booger all over again. a boring screen with all your crafty stuff on it and crafted in a few clicks... we're waiting patiently for a game that has a innovative crafting system, FireFall did an okay job on that, we want more of that.there are only so many classes you can pick, and character creation isn't that WOOOW like some others e.g. PWI or Aion, but eh, it's not as crap as let's just say..

												Just another asian MMO. There is absolutely nothing special about this game, unless bad UI glitches count as special.The 3D models, textures and animations look and feel like every other asian F2P MMO out there - flashy, clumsy and just don't feel right. Female characters run around like a bunch of noodles. The voice acting and the story fail to immerse you, and you'll find yourself pressing ESC to skip through the overused dialog subjects.Questing is a bore: teleport to the area, kill everything, get reward, teleport out. Do that until you are high level enough for PVP. That is, if you manage to guess what you have to do, because buttons without text and UI glitches are frequent. Moreover, higher difficulty dungeon runs aren't necessarily harder - they just have more monsters, which are so easy to kill that they might make you feel like you're playing Dynasty Warriors.I guess you simply can't expect much from the company behind MU Online, Archlord, S.U.N. Rappelz and FlyFF. It's just more of the same.			"

The combat is very unique and polished and is similar to the Tera rising combat system where you have to aim like in Fps games, to actually hit with your spells/attacks. Thats way more funnier than to just spamm some buttons on your keyboard while targeting an enemy like in most of the mmorpg's. nowdays.The bad part about this game is the lack of work the ""owners"" put into it.
