Early Access Review
								First of all, this game is inspired by Titan Quest. However, it is NOT Titan Quest, don't be fooled with the title. I will compare it with TQ time to time but basically just to show differences than similarities.Is it good or bad? Neither. It is just another game. It inherits many features from TQ - the same engine (that's what makes some people to think the game is just a masked TQ), dual mastery system, basic skills ideas, itemization principles, inventory management and others. However, gameplay and overall feeling is not the same. I wonder why some people look at Grim Dawn as at skinned TQ because it feels very different in terms of pace, combat, quests, athmosphere. It is... err... faster. It's the best description I can imagine. Everything happens quite fast in the game. You start to feel your character powerful relatively fast - pretty since the first level. Many things support this feeling - from the actual raw power to hits animation which makes you feel impact on most of your hits. It could get boring soon if you would not unlock new skills with levels so you still will have something new to play with :)Basically, it's the game about doomed and dying world where mankind was pretty much eradicated by two powerful magical races. You're one of few remnants survived the just happened Apocalypse and trying to establish themselves in the changed world. So there are lot of remaining ruines and lore in the world. I actually like the way Crate has placed world information and story in the game - it does not come in forms of long quest dialogs but as pieces of paper here and where which you can read if you are interested or skip if you are not interested in learning the story and want just to kill things. I tried both and must say the story is very well-written which is rare case for ARPG genre. Just try to read that diary of the dead child... The world is also well-detailed with many small pieces adding the feeling of doom pretty everywhere. Overall graphics is probably not that detailed and eye-catching as it was in TQ but I guess TQ had it somewhat excessive while GD looks just fine for the fast-paced game where you won't pay too much attention to details most of the time anyway. It is still look fine when you stop for a while and zoom in to see details like a doll on the stairs. So the graphics is just fine on my taste. It looks much better with AntiAliasing and AnyzotropicFiltering turned on though ;) Overall story and graphics is much more mature than TQ with some of dark humor and some serious emotions it causes but much less pathetics. Bad guys actions are basically better reasoned and logical based (if you bother to read the story pieces).Quests. They are various enough to not get bored. You will meet those ""kill X monsters"" and ""collect Y pieces"" things along with exterminating big bad guys, securing areas (the last looks quite stupid with the monsters respawn but anyway), finding lost people and even uncover the treachery... or cover it. Yes, some quests seem to have several endings. Crate promises that you will meet consequences of your decisions later. Quests aren't necessary to finish the main story except first few ones which you will need to complete to get access to the stash. You can do even without them though - in my first playthrough I have got that access only after finishing the act as I just did not found the way to sewers to complete one of these quests :) Basically, if you have done what the quest requires already and then got to the quest giver, it will offer other dialog and accept the quest. Quite a reasonable system on my taste. You can just go forward and kill everything on your path and once you get to the end you will complete most of quests - just get back to the town and talk to people.Advancing the game. GD has other ways to advance than TQ had. First of all, the game is not linear. You have a single base and move in various directions from it but still return there for supply and rest. Second, directions you move are not a narrow long path but quite wide areas where you can just move along the road skipping pretty much about 60-70% of content or go exploring. In the last case you will find many optional areas some of which offer significant rewards. So you are free to advance fast from riftgate to riftgate or stop in the every area until you find everything in it. Or you can advance fast and then return to the areas you've been already to explore them in details. The last way has the hidden benefit related to monsters level scaling. You can find new more dangerous monsters in the previously explored areas.Monsters scaling. Monsters have limited scaling their levels with player in GD. So you can either advance to next area or just re-run the same one to find monstes have higher levels and you still get enough exp and better drops to advance in levels. Some people find it good, some blame the game for it. I personally think it is good because scaling is not infinite and if you run the same area for 3-4 times you usually will outlevel monsters there. So you still can feel yourself a stomping giant in you want :) Or you can just move forward as fast as you can - monsters will be either equal or slightly higher level than you. The system looks very well balanced and entertaining.Monsters. What can I say... incredible. Especially considering this is only Alpha (close to Beta already) and the first act of the game. Monsters variety is amazing. You will find about 8-10 basic types of zombies and other Aether corruptions (almost every type includes 2-3 variations with distinct look and properties), the same amount of mutated animals types (again, with several distinct variations inside every type), two semi-inteligent races, two types of human enemies and two types of Chaos creatures (all of these type groups have several variations as well). There are lot of hero monsters (they exist for every monster type in the game) with unique abilities which offer much greater challenge with an increased reward (sweet loot :)). Believe me, combat never feels boring and you never will think ""ahh, these zombies again..."" - GD has almost infinite surprises to you :) Moreover, as I said above, if you return to the area you've been already when you get 3-4 levels you most possibly will find new monster types there. Some of these types are unique to particular areas and don't meet anywhere else in the game. So if you want to see all enemies be sure to revisit areas you've met every unique monster type when you get max level.Combat. It is quite fast-paced but yet is quite controllable and leaves enough time to think your actions. Impact feeling is great due to various animations and screen shaking on crits. Crate has entertained new feature opposed to potions spamming - out of combat health regeneration (OCH). This feature is still questionnable and perceived differently by players. Some praise it while others blame. What does OCH mean? When you not get hit and don't hit for 2-3 seconds your health starts to regenerate rapidly and get to the max in 4-5 seconds. Some players are against it because think it can be abused and make the game too easy. Others argue that if you want to play reckless you can just continue hitting mobs instead of running around and avoiding hits. Anyway, this system really makes potions an emergency solution and rare used. Besides that, there are many ways to replenish your health during combat. I myself love this system and was upset when it was nerfed once already. However, we'll see what it will look like in the end of development. Comparing to TQ, combat looks ages ahead. Ah, I almost forgot about the new targeting system! Be sure to uncheck ""Classic targeting"" option in the game menu and try how it feels. I can't return to classic system now. The new one is pretty much the same you could get in Diablo 2 with right mouse button. Well, I could say more but seem to run out of space :)			"

Early Access Review
								Grim Dawn is one of the most richly detailed and beutifully sculpted unfinished game I've ever played! It's definitely one to keep your eye on.I'm a massive Action RPG player/addict with 1000s of hours in Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight, Van Helsing & countless others. Hell, I've even made a career out of making YouTube videos for them. Grim Dawn was little more than a curiosity to me when I first checked it out in the Alpha. But since then I have repeatedly come back to it whenever a new build is released and each time I play it I fall a little more in love with it!Development progress has been slow, I wouldn't expect a launch this year, but the quality of updates has been phenomenal. The devs at Crate have their finger of the pulse of the community and have a very clear vision for the game they want to make - it's the game they want to play. I recently spoke to Mediera one of the developers and he said that he barely even played Titan Quest when he was developing it - but while developing Grim Dawn he can barely tear himself away from it, with 100s of hours spent 'playtesting'.This game is the spiritual successor to Titan Quest, with some of the developers that originally worked on the game now making up the indie dev team at Crate Entertainment. The game is built on a heavily modified version of the same engine Titan Quest was built on. You'll notice the similarities between the games if you're a fan. But this game is not Titan Quest reskinned - it's a much better game in my opinion. It's taken some of the best features and mechanics from that game, put them into an immersive post-apocalyptic world and expanded themin interesting ways. Grim Dawn is the type of game early access should embrace - supporting great and communicativbe developers make games the fans want to play. Keep this one on your radar!If you want to see more of the game and my thoughts on it you can find me on YouTube & Twitch as 'ZiggyD'.			"

												As a veteran player of aRPGs, I want to share my feels about Grim Dawn with you, after about 90h of gameplay.Features I like:+ Involving, dark story.+ Beautiful graphics and style,+ Atmospheric soundtrack,+ Very satisfying and 'meaty' combat model,+ Faction system with bounties and nemezis hunting (though I've never faced any),+ Devotion system,+ Festival of loot,+ Good crafting system,+ Lots of components, aguments and item-granted skills which provide wide variety of builds,+ Day/night and wheater system,+ At some point it's quite challenging (over 70 deaths druing 90h of gameplay),+ I haven't try multiplayer yet, but I am sure it's very, very fun (instanced or FFA loot, combat with friends, etc.),+ Easy, reasonable travel system,+ Vast locations filled with details and less linear than in most aRPGs,+ Lots of hidden treasuers, places and secret quests,+ Possibility to rotate and zoom camera and map,+ Modding tools with huge possibilites,+ Class dualism..+ .. but it would be awesome to add new classes (TQ:IT had 9). However, it's definitely great with 6 various classes at the moment.+ One of the best price/quality deals,+ Hardcore mode.Features I'm neutral about:* Consistent world - I couldn't feel Cairn division into acts,* Lack of character customization (only male/female - same as TQ),* Absence of shrines with buffs (present in TQ), however I think they're not necessary here,* I have a problem with memorizing locations, NPCs and major bosses names,* Lack of Polish language,* After 90h of gameplay my character is at lvl.. 78/85.* After creating new character it doesn't show up instantly - player must go to options and come back to main menu to see it.Things I dislike:- Aetherfire (green flame on the ground) and poison pools are bit overpowered,- Few animations should be improved (e.g. stonetusks),- Sometimes vision gets too dark,- Ocassionaly crashes at alt-tabbing or game exiting.Incoming first DLC - Crucible - is a hope for a better endgame content with a chance for ranking rivalry and source of loot (hopefully also new).I believe that future content will make this game one of the best aRPG's of all time (for me it is now).A must have - not only for aRPG genre lovers!9,5+/10 "

Early Access Review
								Pros:  Rough around the edges, but still an excellent value.    If you loved Diablo, Torchlight, & Titan Quest then this is the game for you.    Combat is solid, the story is well presented, monster design is top notch.   Spiffy animations.   Art direction takes a few cues from Fallout 3 & Borderlands.    A few shout outs to H.P. Lovecraft.    No crashes for me & almost no bugs.    Very stable game! Cons:  has pretentions to being a 'Ye Olde Skool' hard core ARPG game.    Thus the game lacks modern rpg conviences like quest markers.     Expect to wander lost for stretches at a time.    Game balance is nightmare.   Playing a caster is easy mode.    Loot drops are a bit sketchy, but it is getting better.    Crate employees are swell & willing to listen to feedback.   Crate fans on the other hand...     Well, let's just say they are a bit defensive.    Saying that there are flaws with Grim Dawn is tantamount to calling their baby ugly.    The Crate Forums are going to be very interesting when the final product ships...In conclusion: post apocalyptic, low fantasy that doesn't pull any punches.    Some of the game design choices are real headscratchers, but they're being ironed out.     Crate entertainment is a pretty decent indie outfit  & deserve support.   It's a work in progress that takes you on fun, brutal journey.    8 out of 10, Above average.   B+   Four Stars out of Five.			"

Early Access Review
								In-Depth ReviewPrepare for a long read!First off the Story:Grim Dawn is full of interesting dialogue and well written textbooks that truly immerse you into the game. Furthermore there is a multitude of sidequest that often allow you to make meaningful decisions and sometimes even determine the fate of a whole village.Unfortunately these stories are hard to follow for someone who doesn't read through all the text. As much as I know the devs plan to voice the main story towards release.Atmosphere:The graphics present you with a harsh and sinister environment which is further emphasized by the great music and sounds. The handcrafted maps are quite large and feature hidden passages from time to time. It also feels great when you encounter hostile factions attacking each other and follow the transformation of Devil's Crossing from a small survivors-enclave to a small town as you progress through the story.Only downpoint for me was the repetitiveness of some maps, especially the 3 swamps in act 1 and arkovia/broken hills in act 2. I was told that the devs are planning to rework some of these areas though in terms of visuals.Gameplay:Gritty, fun combat, just as you would expect from an ARPG. The constitution system makes sure that you don't just wait to regenerate and the scarcity of potions underlines the fact that you are survivor of a perished world. Unlike Diablo 3 leveling feels rewarding and presents you with relevant decisions that influence your progression later in the game. The dual-mastery system of Titan Quest opens up a ton of possibilities and will further improve the more classes are available. The locational damage will probably not suprise TQ-veterans, but for ARPGs in general it's a really noteworthy feature that adds further depth to the game. (On a site note: There is an existing faction system that will be dramatically improved in the upcoming build)Since build 20 there is a well-working multiplayer, unfortunately the damage monster deal is also scaled if you play together. Resistances don't show much effect if they are not pushed quite high and casts and even aoe skills can miss enemies. Coming from WoW I was never very fond of a ""accuracy"" stat as it pretty much forces players to cap it.Itemization:The game features a multitude of stats to choose from: many types of retaliation, skill bonuses, damage modifiers, resists, etc. etc. This and the fact that there are procs and even entire new skills on items massively increases the number of possible builds and the fun collecting every item. Unlike other games in the genre there are not only random rolled yellows and greens but also static epic items which helps to reduce ""bad luck"", legendary items will drop from 50 onward, but are not available yet. Like Titan Quest there is also a huge number of augmentations to further personalize your gear. The two unqiue blacksmiths to choose from make use of these augmentations to craft a bunch of new items and relics from blueprints found in the world. All items are fully tradeable with other players.It seems there are some apparently obsolete stats though: Armor and physical resist pretty much do the same and ""increase resistance x by x%"" isn't really needed either.Interface:The game has a multitude of options and a fully scalalbe interface, which makes it highly customizable. The data sheets are well categorized and easy to access.Sometimes the text on items can get a little bit long though.Same goes for several skill descriptions, some of which only offer vague information, e.g. Solaels Witchfire - what exactly do the 1st and 2nd rune increase? You will have to try that out for yourself.Content:Grim Dawn is not finished yet, but it already has act 1-3 which offer fairly much to do and even on the second playthough reveal some suprises. Hallowed Hill, Depraved Sanctuary and Steps of Torment provide some lasting ""endgame"" content, the latter even comes with a cohesive and interesting story. Due to the fact that the current maximum level is 40 the number of build possibilites is limited of course, nontheless there is plenty of them already. I'd say there's roughly 150-200h of playtime right now if you don't try the more fancy builds.Bugs:I haven't encountered many bugs which is refreshing for an early access title these days, here are the most prevalent ones:- Getting stuck especially when using teleports/charge- Hit detection sometimes doesn't work for aoe skills like ""shockwave""- Some attacks can clip though walls, both hostile and friendly- Items occasionally drop through the floor, especially annoying with epics* The devs seem to be aware of these bugs and will address some of them in B24To sum it up:- in no way generic or boring quests that offer real decisions; story may be hard to follow if you don't read through every text though- dense atmosphere, brilliantly handcrafted world that sometimes feels repetitive because of the lack of different textures- good mix of fun gameplay, diverse builds and multi-layered mechanics with only minor problems here and there- interesting and complex itemization with a few debatable stats- well done interface, many options, but sometimes useless skill/item descriptions- reasonable quantity of well thought out content, likely 150-200h- few bugs, very polished for an alphaI have never had so much fun coming up with new builds and testing them right away. The gameplay is mostly fluid, the graphics and audio help create a unique atmosphere that supports the many stories you find about the world of Cairn and it's residents. It may take some time though to see through the complexity of the skill tree and items and appreciate the thought that has gone into it. All in all I'd say that Grim Dawn even in it's currents state is worth every penny as it not only offers the usal ARPG features, but also comes with it's own fresh ideas and shows promise of even more.P.S. I have noticed that many reviews on youtube are from people/magazines who invested less than 20h and therefore don't go really deep into the many mechanics Grim Dawn has to offer. This doesn't do the game justice in my opinion. Please don't take those reviews seriously and give the game a chance if above points take your fancy.			"

												I have been asked by several people to rewrite my review, as my initial review (written several months ago) inspired some to buy the game and so they wanted me to stay up to date with the times and offer my insights therein. I will first offer my thoughts on what has changed between then and now, and then introduce the game as a whole to those who have never seen it before. At its core, Grim Dawn has not changed vastly so in the last several months; I do not mean to say that there have not been updates, as there have and the game is certainly better for them, but the gameplay is very much the same as it was at release (in February 2016). This implies more than it seems; it means that Crate, the developing studio for the game, is not keen on upsetting the way players play the game. Sure, some balancing tweaks have been made here and there, and some builds have been nerfed or buffed more than others, but it does not seem as though Crate has ever intended to force its playerbase into a particular playstyle. Some may suggest that this means the gameplay is stale, as over the span of 10 months the meta has only shifted ever so slightly. I can't claim to see it that way; I see it as meaning that the gameplay is stable (see what I did there?) and does not need to change. Following Grim Dawn's release, a world-sprawling quest containing a multitude of very tough bosses has been added (completable in all three of the game's difficulties) for free, as has the paid DLC of the Crucible, which is an ultra-difficult arena-style survival game mode. We will soon be receiving the third of the ""roguelike"" dungeons for free, increasing the explorable world further with yet more content. We've also received several 'endgame sets' (and I use the phrase lightly, so as not to instill fear to newcomers that sets behave anything as they disastrously do in D3 - they don't) to promote some alternative, niche builds. Still on the horizon is Grim Dawn's first expansion...But what is Grim Dawn? For that, I turn to a (slightly altered) version of my former review for the game:Grim Dawn is a hack-and-slash ARPG that does everything it needs to and so much more. It presents a nitty-gritty world ravaged both my man's mistakes as much as otherworldly invasion. The feel of this world is perpetuated in every facet of the design of the game. Skills and attacks - player and enemy alike - are brutal and satisfying. The UI is precisely what it needs to be to get the points of its contents across to the player; it is no fancier than that. The quests have a purpose to them - 'We feel threatened by X, fix that for us by slaying him/her/it' - but they do not go out of their way in their descriptions to make their completion any easier than a rough idea of where to go. This game is designed to be played solely by you, your inclinations, and you intuition, not to help you play it with omniscient developer input and assistance. But you get what you give, and then a little more. You'll hunt across beautiful hand-crafted landscapes for terrifyingly monstrous entities, read immersive and haunting texts scattered throughout the world, and develop a character of your own design, one of your own play-style and skill choices.OK, so that's all the RPG stuff out of the way. So how does Grim Dawn put the Action in Action-RPG? At the beginning of the game, it does not do so wildly. Nor should it; if you started a god then any godly things you did throughout the game would feel all the same. But eventually the combat of Grim Dawn picks up to be fast paced and as brutal as the world around you. Every enemy in Grim Dawn is designed to kill you with merciless potency, and you'll have in your arsenal an array of spells, skills, and items to decimate you foes with terrific effect. Rarely will you ever feel truly immortal; the world of Grim Dawn has more than a handful of foes tough enough to go toe-to-toe with the most dedicated players.Grim Dawn is not a trading simulator, as its loot system favors self-found play. Grim Dawn is not made solely for endgame; that is not to say it does not have one (I've spent 9 days on one character alone), but the game's focus is on the journey to that endgame. It is, ultimately, a game, and so realizes that it must keep things fun throughout the experience, and does just that. Prospective players are always quick to ask something along the lines of ""Would you recommend this over PoE/D3?"" I would do so, yes, but I would caution them to say that Grim Dawn has no intention of replacing either title, as there are vast differences in their respective approaches to the ARPG genre. I would argue that without a doubt Grim Dawn is the superior title, however; if there is any ARPG in existence better than Grim Dawn, it would be Diablo II, but the veracity of such a statement may be tested. Indeed, Grim Dawn may well be in a league of its own, which the ARPG market has so very much needed. Perhaps, yes, I am a fanboy in that regard; I've spent over $200 on the game/its DLC in purchasing it for myself and some of my friends. But I can solidly and unquestioningly say I have no regrets in that regard. If you've read this far and still have your doubts about the game, then there's likely nothing one could write in a review to sway your opinion, and I wish you the best; otherwise, do yourself the favor and pick up Grim Dawn for $25. You'll almost certainly love it.			"

												At first this game seemed like one of 'those' Diablo copies. But as I played through it, several positives that other similar ARGP's don't have become clear:Positives:+ Grim Dawn has six well-rounded premade 'classes' you can invest in.In Grim Dawn, you start out with all options open and you can choose from a big variation of offensive and defensive skills.+ Grim Dawn allows for Dual Class mixing.After reaching level 10, you can start investing points in another 'class' skill tree, allowing you to mix with even more offensive/defensive skills from that other class.+ Grim Dawn has an item for most skill builds.The items in Grim Dawn are unique, but also generic in a good sense. Flat bonuses to whatever type of damage your character deals are widely available.+ Grim Dawn has a massive variety of item-enhancers (called Materials).You find these in the world and can attach them to items to make them more powerful in a certain way, or use them in the extensive crafting system. They can be somewhat compared to 'socketable gems or runes' in Diablo 2, but every item has a 'socket'.+ Grim Dawn has a very extensive 'talent' system (called Devotion).In the world you find shrines that once defeated/something sacrificed to award a talent point. This can be invested in a very broad talent system. This has a slight downside for those who do NOT enjoy theorycrafting; it can be a bit overwhelming.+ Grim Dawn plays fluently.Now this may seem irrelevant, but for those who played Path of Exile and were thrown off by the 'clunky' gameplay (I know I was) will have a much cleaner feel of gameplay flow in Grim dawn that is almost similar to Diablo 3. You character feels very responsive to your actions and he goes where you want him to go.+ Grim Dawn has a good mix between realistic and clear art style.To make a game both pretty in a realistic way AND still be able to see what happens where is NOT easy, and Grim Dawn does a good job at it. The minimap, map and color scheme are all clear enough to see (I am r-g colorblind).+ Grim Dawn is fun to play with friends.Once set up, GD is a very enjoyable multiplayer experience. You can easily build characters that complement each other, or slaughter each other in a duel.+ Grim Dawn items can (usually) be traded/given to friends.Yeah, this is good. Not like Diablo 3 where every-****ing-thing is soulbound. Some items in Grim Dawn are also soulbound, but with reason.+ Grim Dawn ultimate difficulty is unforgiving.It may remind some people of Diablo 3 Inferno mode, which is not for the casual player. I put this as a negative and positive on purpose, as this is a matter of taste.Negatives:- Grim Dawn has a seemingly pointless mechanic of stat points.You are allowed to invest in Physique, Cunning or Spirit. Physique gives hp and other health bonuses, Cunning gives crit and hit bonuses and Spirit gives more energy to spam your skills. It SEEMS like a choice at first, but because items REQUIRE flat amounts of these stats (715 Spirit for that great caster item, 715 Physique for that awesome armor) this choice is an illusion. In fact, this can be very frustrating for a first playthrough; you might not be able to wear something awesome you find. Diablo 3 doesn't have this problem (but many others).- Grim Dawn tends to stutter a bit with large amounts of monsters and particles on screen.Played on a high-end PC (2016 built), with 3 Wind Devils, 3 Storm Totems, 1 Wendigo Totem and 4 packs of monsters can give lag, even on the best of machines. This is not any worse than on similar games like D3 or PoE.- Grim Dawn leveling can become tedious.After level 50, the experience needed to advance increases rapidly per level. Reaching max level on a character is an every-day, 2 week investment at least. - Grim Dawn needs portforwarding for most people to do multiplayer.Right now, hosting a game in GD requires you to manually open port 27016 (UDP/TCP). Although this is easy for me, it may not be for those less technically inclined.- Grim Dawn ultimate difficulty is unforgiving.It may remind some people of Diablo 3 Inferno mode, which is not for the casual player. I put this as a negative and positive on purpose, as this is a matter of taste.I hope you found this summary review helpful! Have fun :)			"

Early Access Review
								Let's get my opinion across to you as a reader as soon and as clear as possible. I genuinely love this game.For an early access game, it feels very polished and content rich. But then, it has been in early access for some time now.If you like Diablo, you will definitely like this game. Because it offers the same hack&slash loot fest gameplay as that game, but without the frustrating bull****, such as the permanent character damage of Diablo 1 and the excessively restrictive builds (And rare respec) of Diablo 2. The game offers at present 5 different classes, of which you can combine any 2 of them to create hybrid classes. There is the Soldier (Typical warrior), the Nightblade (Rogue with a melee focus), the Demolitionist (Archer type, but with versatile crowd control options and traps), the Occultist (Debilitation and pets) and the Arcanist (Spellcaster). There are skills in each class that well complement those of another, but a pure class build is just as viable.There are no skills that are purely support, since the developers have made a conscious decision to make singleplayer just as playable as multiplayer. Instead, most classes offer some form of skill that applies a bonus or ability to you, as well as an equal one to other players and pets, allowing increased power and versatility in multiplayer without compromising the viability of the skill in singleplayer.It's a lot less restrictive than most similar games in how each class can be built and still be viable, but it is worth putting some advance thought into your build. Skill points can be refunded if spent on skills, but not if spent on class mastery (Which increase your stats linearly and unlock further skills).Content wise, the game currently contains 2 full chapters of reasonable length and 2 out of 3 parts of the 3rd chapter. A total of 4 chapters are known to be planned for the full release. There is a lot of various equipment to find with interesting items offering unique skills to complement the arsenal of your chosen class. There is also a lot of varied enemies to use your weapons and abilities on, with especially dangerous (mostly) randomly spawned unique Heroes to contest with, each with their own special skills and abilities. Four difficulties are planned, each which will be unlocked for a character as the previous is completed. At present there is only two difficulties available, Normal and the optional Veteran. These two difficulties can be alternated between at any time from the main menu and share the same campaign progression. Completing the game on either will unlock the next one, once it's added.I strongly recommend playing on Veteran difficulty in singleplayer, as Normal mode is a tad too easy. In multiplayer, the game scales the difficulty based on the amount of players, making Normal mode offer a decent challenge and making Veteran very challenging. Enemies do scale to your level, but as I understand the scaling will be lesser in the full release and is only set as high as it is now to offer a continuous challenge for higher level players.  Right now, the maximum level is 40, which is still plenty enough to allow the construction of very interesting character builds that do end up feeling extremely powerful in spite of the scaling enemies. Story wise, the game features an original world by the name of Cairn, with has an Victorian-esque aesthetic and technological level. It offers you the usual swords and shields but also black powder guns, bombs and magic. In this world mankind is at the brink of extinction with the event dubbed the ""Grim Dawn"" as it's cause, where the otherwordly and malevolent Aetherials and Chtonics invaded the world. The Aetherials seeking the enslavement of mankind as hosts of possession, while the Cthonics would rather mankind be wiped out, as to deny their use by the Aetherials. These two factions are enemies and will actively fight one another, in addition to humanity. The Grim Dawn led to the total collapse of the empire, leaving only scattered groups of refugees and army remnants trying desperately to safeguard their own survival. You join one of these groups in trying to secure shelter, supplies and to strike back against the invaders and Cairn native monsters threatening you. All in all, it's an interesting universe that manages to put a somewhat new spin on the overused post apocalyptic and dark fantasy settings. The story also feels much more grounded than many similar works, with the player not being a chosen one destined to save the world but is just another survivor struggling to survive. This is reflected in the quests you undertake as well, with quite a few of them simply being about securing the base needs for survival, such as drinking water, food and usable materials for clothing. Unlike most games of this style, Grim Dawn offers choices with permanent effects on the world. So for example, your choices can decide who lives and who dies as well as influence what equipment you can access. Or they can even turn another faction of humans against you, for siding with their enemies. There is a reputation system, where you earn the trust of factions by completing quests and fighting their sworn enemies, with increased trust letting you access faction unique bounty quests and a store offering equipment unique to that faction. You also accrue a negative reputation with the hostile factions, where you face stronger opposition the more of a threat you become, culminating in them sending especially strong unique enemies to deal with you. The choices and faction system feel very well integrated and can only become more interesting the further along in development the game gets. A sense of personal investment in the world makes it unique from it's genre brethren. Of course, you might make a choice that ends with an outcome that you don't like, so if that's a concern you would need to refer to a guide to make the choice you want.The game does however suffer from some unfortunate bugs, primarily a tendency to crash. This combined with rather extensive dungeons can make for a frustrating experience where you lose your progress and have to start over. The characters however do save properly though, so it's not an insurmountable chore to go through those dungeons again. There's a few performance hiccups here and there and some minor graphical bugs as well, but it is an early access title and such things are to be expected. If you can't deal with that, stay away from any and all early access titles. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Do I recommend this game? Yes.But with the reservation that it is in early access and thus not yet finished and full of bugs. If you can deal with that, buy it. If you can't, then wait. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Important note: If you have a router, to be able to host multiplayer it needs to support Upnp or be able to port forward UDP and TCP ports 27016.

												You hear an alarm beeping, startling you away from your screen. You turn around and stare at the neon letters on the clock. It's 5:30AM. Birds chirp outside as the tentative first rays of sunshine creep through the gaps in your curtains. You've spent an entire weekend slaying hellbeasts from beyond the void and now you only have an hour to get to work. You haven't slept.That's Grim Dawn.			"

Early Access Review
								By far my favorite ARPG I've played since Diablo 2. I've had a craving for years for something fresh that borrowed as much as possible from Diablo 2 and implemented it well and Grim Dawn hits an absolute home run in that department. I enjoyed Diablo 3 and sunk a ton of hours into it, but man does Grim Dawn feel like what Diablo 3 should have been. It's that good. It's like everything Titan Quest and Diablo 2 did well had a baby and this is our result.I've been a supporter since 2012 and playing on and off since well before the game ever hit Steam Early Access and man... it's incredible how far this game has come.If you're a Diablo fan of any sort and wasted away who knows how many hours of your youth on Diablo 1 and 2, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. Even at the full price of $25 it's an absolute steal.10/10			"

I never imagined to throw faeces at enemies as a method of obliterationGame overview*Genre: aRPG, hack & slash*Avg length: ~25 hours (1 playthrough on normal)*Developer: Crate Entertainment*Publisher: Crate Entertainment*Release date: February 25th 2016*Platform: pc<<<Pros and cons>>>+ Indepth (but not overly complex) character building+ Ability to (partially) respec+ Exploration is greatly rewarded+ 3 difficulties to play through+ Faction system+ Appropriate atmosphere+ Multiplayer available+ Multiple little features to make life easier+ Insanely replayable+ Aesthetically, the game is gorgeous, but - Graphics seem a little outdated in certain places- The soundtrack is good, however repetitive at timesFull game reviewIt is almost a miracle. After about 6 years of development, Crate Entertainment's Grim Dawn has finally been released. A game that had been in early access on Steam for so long due to the developers experiencing some personal difficulties. Not only that, they also greatly expanded on the game's original content due to fantastic support by fans along the way. The result is a superb aRPG that is currently among the very best. Having owned and closely followed the game for about 2 years, looking at the (finally) complete game is a pure joy. Hold on tight aRPG lovers, because you're in for a most wonderful ride with this one.<<<Story>>>Enter Cairn, a dark and mysterious world that was once a great empire, but now on the brink of extinction. At fault are the overly curious arcanists who brought Aetherials into their world. These spiritual beings seek to use humans as hosts and consequently turn them into powerful, yet abhorrent creatures. If that wasn't already enough, survivors also have to battle the Chthonians: they have the malicious intent of offering as much blood as they can to their almighty god. You, the player, awaken at the worst time possible: a grim dawn. For a little while, you yourself were possessed by an aetherial and thus have no memory of your former life. This possession almost cost you your life. However, those aetherial remains dwelling inside your body seem to grant you odd, yet useful powers ...<<<Gameplay, fun factor and replayability>>>Grim Dawn is an aRPG like there are quite a few others in the genre: Torchlight, Diablo, Van Helsing, Path of Exile, Victor Vran, Titan Quest ... While each game differs and has its uniqueness, they all have the same core gameplay: run around, kill monsters, find loot. And all of that in an isometric perspective. Even though a bit repetitive in gameplay (which is no problem if you're a fan of the genre), they have great replay value, mostly due to their theorycrafting: how to create and finetune the 'perfect' build(s). In trying to do so comes a lot of experimentation and farming, which can take quite long.Unlike certain other aRPG's, Grim Dawn does not force you into a specific class. Mages don't necessarily have to wield wands and warriors don't have to wear heavy armour and shields. Every character has access to all gear. However, you are required to invest in specific attributes in order to wear different equipment. Another feature that is quite welcome, which was present in Titan Quest also, is how the game lets you combine any of the 6 available masteries to create your personalized class (= 2 masteries combined). A first mastery can be chosen at level 2 and the second at level 10. There are so many skills that one can choose to build around, that even within the same mastery, there is a lot of room for variety. This allows for an insane amount of experimentation and theorycrafting, which is sometimes even more fun than actually playing the game!One day, Crate decided that character customization wasn't deep enough already, so they released the devotion system. What is this system exactly? It is basically another (yet smaller) layer of customization where players have a total of 50 points to invest in certain passives (e.g. +10% piercing dmg, +20% elemental resistances etc) or actives that enhance your main skills. Those actives can be bound to certain skills and will proc under various circumstances (e.g. 100% to occur when critically hitting). Devotion points can be acquired by restoring old shrines that are spread throughout the whole world and between the 3 difficulties (normal -> elite -> ultimate).Seeing the amount of customization, being able to (partially) respec is a relief. Reallocating is done by visiting the spirit guide in one of the major cities and can be done at any given time, granted you have the currency for it. It starts out pretty cheap, but can get extremely expensive for those who experiment endlessly. Both skill and devotion points can be reallocated; mastery and attribute points can not. This allows for decent experimentation, but also reminds you to choose carefully when needed.Cairn is a place full of mystery and secrets and is not afraid to reward players who feel like exploring everything. Exploration is rewarded by various things: one-time chests containing extra rare loot, hidden devotion shrines and notes. More loot is always good to have (this is an aRPG after all), devotion shrines keep your character's customization up to date and lore notes inform you of the story - which was better than expected - of Cairn. Besides the deep character customization and satisfying exploration, Grim Dawn offers other features that may interest you. The first thing that comes to mind is the 'fast travel' system. Your character can use rift portals anywhere, anytime (except in certain challenging rogue-like dungeons), which sets the game at a good pace. Don't worry about picking everything up, as you can sell it right away by teleporting back and forth. Another feature that is a nice 'extra' is the faction system: by killing certain enemies and completing certain quests, you gain reputation. This reputation allows you to buy certain goods and complete certain objectives. A last feature that is definitely more than welcome is the ability to play with up to 3 other people. There are no dedicated servers though, since the game is more single player focused. But the fact that it is there, is what counts.<<<Controls, graphics and sound>>>Like many other aRPG's, actions are mostly executed via the mouse: killing enemies, opening doors, speaking to npc's ... everything's done with the mouse, with the exception of using your skills. They are activated by pressing the corresponding keys. All keys are rebindable if desired.Graphically, the game seemed a little outdated in certain places, however, it is not too bothersome. Aesthetically on the other hand, the game is very well made and really brings that atmosphere of eeriness and desperation to life. Most animations are ok.The soundtrack was enjoyable to listen to for the first x amount of hours and certainly added to the atmosphere. However, certain tracks get replayed over and over again in way too many areas. A little bit more variation certainly wouldn't harm the game. Tracks that are most excellent are the boss tracks. They sound exciting and make the fights more epic. <<<The verdict>>>Grim Dawn is one of the finest aRPG's I have played in the last couple of years - if not my favourite of all time. Victor Vran seems a little too simplistic, whereas Path of Exile can be overly complex. This game brings the best of two worlds together: being indepth enough without being overly complex. Therefore it is recommended to all aRPG lovers for 100%, but even regular rpg/hack & slash fans might enjoy this one, if just for 1 playthrough.			"

Early Access Review
								Since i have played Grim Dawn, Titan Quest and Diablo 3 a LOT, here's what i think about this game:Pros: - Skill system is similar to Titan Quest and very complex, allowing you to customize your character alot. There are obvious builds just like in D3 (Pet-master, Fire-builds etc.) but you are not limited to them.- No allways-online, you can in fact play this game completely in offline mode, characters are saved on your harddrive. (similar to Titan Quest)- Many items with the same system as in TQ where rare pre- and -suffixes can occur on normal items. Also Epic and Legendary stuff (including sets and abilities granted by items)- Farming: A combination of TQ and D3, boss runs are still effective (TQ) but there are also Hero spawns in normal locations that can be lucrative (D3)- Simple Multiplayer system, you can either host a game (and others might join you, you can set a password or kick others) or you can join a game yourself (direct join to your steam-friends or browse existing hosted games)- almost no bugs, the few that are there allways get fixed ASAPThings i personally dont mind but might be important to you:- performance issues when ALOT of stuff is going on (R9 290, 16GB RAM, i7 and dropping to 20fps on high settings, can be improved by lowering the settings though)- Multiplayer MIGHT not allways work, make sure you have administrator rights when searching for games or it can crash (just like in TQ)- even though they are not popular, you might find cheaters online (since save-files are on your harddrive you can just manipulate them). In that case just host a game yourself and kick them :P- no voice acting and average grafics might scare you. but keep in mind that crate entertainment is a really small studio (""Crate Entertainment has grown from one man with a dream to a team of ten with veteran developers...."") so what they achieved is actually really impressive.Conclusion: A really good ARPG. not a tripple-A title like D3 with millions of budget, still managed to entertain me more than D3 personally. If you like these kind of games, just buy it!			"

												Disclosure: Review Written at Level 25Do you miss Diablo 2? Do you miss skill synergy that matters? Do you miss abilities not being worthless, and having options?Grim Dawn opens up an interesting school of thought: You begin as nobody, and at level 1 you're given your official class: Are you the melee tank guy? Explosive experiment guy? Arcane knowledge guy? The angry zoo manager? Pick your class and begin to carve your way. But don't lose sight of What Might Have Been.At level 10, you are able to pick up a second class. No penalities. You become a Something / Something. Want to play a Tank / Mage? Done. Want to play a Caster / Pet class? Done. Pick your flavors, combine then, and destroy everything. Right now, I'm a Soldier/Demolitionist that is made out of tank and explosion, and when things come near me they go on fire, and if they hit me they go on fire EVEN HARDER.You will get your fill.

Early Access Review
								this is probably the best ARPG i've ever played. - coherent and in-depth lore- very unique dual class system that allows for tons of customization and all the replayability you could ever want- beautiful and well-optimized (still looks great on lowest settings and can run decently even on a toaster). the art direction is better than Torchlight/Diablo 3, kind of reminds me of the first Dungeon Siege or Diablo 2. plus, a rotatable camera allows for every detail of the environment to be admired- quests are interesting and fit perfectly with the game world (no ""collect 20 monster hides"" for no reason)- loot is abundant, and i mean really abundant especially in the higher levels- crafting is done VERY well. probably my favorite crafting system in any game.- it's still in early access and it's this good, which is awesome, especially considering the devs actually care about the playerbase and release updates regularly.GET THIS GAME--EDIT: a few extra points that add some more perspective to the game- fast travel system that allows for you to easily traverse the (considerably big) game map. there are waypoint portals you unlock after entering major areas, but you can also throw down your own portal at any time, if you're in the middle of adventuring and need to sell your loot. the personal fast travel point doesn't go away after you die, so you can also use these portals as a sort of quicksave before major battles. your custom waypoints don't save when you quit the game, though.- loot that is automatically shown can be filtered. if you don't want to see anything but legendary items, you can set it that way. if you want to see everything but the billions of common items that enemies spew forth, you can set it that way too.- NO pre-game character customization (your only choice is your gender, no appearance options)- you can respec for some money, either piecemeal or you can reset all of your skills. however, you can't change your class, the points invested your class (aka points invested in the class mastery and not class skills themselves), or your attributes (physique/cunning/spirit).

Early Access Review
								Grim dawn is a deep loot driven rpg, with a unique setting, and good atmospheric graphics running on a heavily updated and improved version of the titan quest engine. If you thought that developers won't invest in this style of game again, think again. Love has gone into this. You start with a classes character, if you are a titan quest fan - you know the drill. If you do not, you start out without a class, think elder scrolls. Then you pick up an item, do some damage, and eventually you get some gear. By this point you will have leveled up and you can choose your class. Usually the player chooses something depending on what they have picked up, however you can choose something completely different and scour for items to match what you are going for. Once you level up some more, you can choose a second class. Allowing for two to coexist concurrently - also like it's father titans quest. There are large number of class combinations. I don't find that every combination is satisfying, however most are at least interesting and fun to experiment with. One issue I have with the second class choice is that they are usually targeted at a specific item combination. For example, the soldier tree has many two handed skills, whereas the rogue tree has many duel wielding. That means you won't be able to pick the major skills in either tree. Since it's wasteful to be good at a two handed weapon and duel wielding skills. Unless you hotkey weapon switching. It's far better to just invest fully in whatever items you choose. Which means you are scouring the second tree for non-weapon based skills. It's not ideal.  However almost any combination you choose will be viable. And thats good enough. At least it represents freedom. If you want you can just stick to the one class. The loot system is solid, although it lacks the ""pop you got a legendary"" sensation that diablo managed. The melee combat, while being weaker than magic, feels better due to the hitting animations being beefy feeling good on contact. This may make you want to play as a melee character even though magic is technically more damaging. A little more balance in this area would go a long way. That said, you need to take into consideration that this game still feels better to play at it's worst - than many action rpg's do at their best. It's just not quite as crunchy as diablo 3. This game's freedom of choice and depth of systems makes up for that. But clearly it would be great to have the best of all worlds. I find that visually the game can sometimes be a little bit over dark. And on certain monitors it may be an issue for players. VA panels in particular. Overall, I think this game is great. I've spent 150+ hours in the game, and have only scratched the surface. Restarting and playing new builds before I even got to the second act. That's right, that's 150 hours of build experimenting and grinding. And I loved every second of it. It's content rich. It's systems are deep. It's carefully crafted in many ways, without being as limited as diablo 3 yet not as free as sacred 2. Combat feels better than van hellsing and sacred 2, yet not as good as diablo 3. Although not that far off. And the world is more original than all of the mentioned games.9.5/10 - A master class in game development. One of the best examples of early access on the market. I'd love to see workshop support.			"

												Update: The game is now released, and it still doesn't suck. 10/10 Early access review below:I very rarely do Early Access reviews, solely because of how quickly a good game can go wrong, and vice versa. So when I say Grim Dawn has not only met, but surpassed my expectations, I want you to get my full meaning.Long before Act 4 was finished, Grim Dawn was always a very solid and playable Early Access title. Crashes were rare, nothing felt glitchy or unfinished. You'd just hit the level cap, or hit the wall of the next unopened area.Which meant, even when there was only 1 complete Act and a couple of class choices, there was a lot of fun to be had. It stood as a testament to how the rest of the game would play, and Crate has delivered. It's been a long time coming, and I mean a solid 5 year development, but it was always consistent enough to never have felt abandoned or misled. A trait I'm finding more and more important with Early Access titles.I'm not going to compare it to other ARPGs, as I'd much rather compare it to other early access titles in general. We had notes for every patch and hotfix. Always updates on what will be in the next patch along with future updates. I am glad to have supported this game in its early days, and am excited to finally see it's release, because I can absolutely say it does not feel rushed or unfinished. Crate put the time and effort necessary for a quality release, instead of giving us a half baked game and selling us the rest later.Grim Dawn sets the bar for what we should expect from Early Access development and release. Bravo, Crate Entertainment.			"

								There are three things that matter in an ARPG. They are:Build diversityItemizationFun combatBuild diversity:The game features dual classing. I can play the exact same two classes as my buds and all of us would have a character that behaves and functions completely differently. Want to be a melee summoner? Dual wielding spell caster? Tanky totem user? Alright, we gotchu. Stuff just sort of works. Maybe not for the highest difficulty, but that's part of the fun of this game. Because playing it is actually fun.Itemization:I've gotten items for character ideas in this game I've never even thought of. I've gotten items specifically built for the character I'm playing as. A plus? They actually look pretty cool, too.Let me put it to you like this. I have a tanky totem guy who uses spells to tank and does vitality damage. There are items specifically for this. Do you understand how cool that is?Fun combat:Alright, so, let's be real here. You are going to make characters that just don't work. You'll get to a point and maybe you didn't spend enough points in to your mastery and just don't have enough health. Maybe you don't do enough damage. Maybe you just kind of walked around and made it to the final difficulty and now you're stuck. Well, you had fun doing it.And you had fun doing it because the combat is a blast. Oh, you want to shoot a laser beam at enemies? We gotchu. Want to use a shield to destroy your enemies? Hey now, I got something for you. Want to use that same skill but make it spammable and useable with two handers? Yeah dude, no problem. Want to put a bunch of mortars on the ground and run around like you would in the real world? Ayyyy, yep.This game has it all. And it's all fun.If you don't buy this game, I feel bad for you.			"

Early Access Review
								So, in the entire time that Path of Exile's extreme skill customization was a nice change to the Diablo 3 habits of hand holding style. With Diablo 3 and Path of Exile now being moreso known as the top two of these kind of games, there's in between Grim Dawn.Grim Dawn for one, has the same customizations like the old Titan Quest, you don't have any skills to start with and you have no class, you make your class by progress. What makes that so special, is that there isn't a single class to choose from, one character can specialize into two paths(You don't have to). Surely not all will be fully suitable for another, but it takes a little curve in knowing what to choose and why. Rather then a path being chosen for you, you can make yours from scratch.Along with this in terms of skill customization, the game features a nice amount of loot, along with the entire factions offering you their items for trade as well, given you are on their good side. As for the looks of the game, its like the name suggests. Its grim, dark and grimy. Nothing in this world is given to you on a silver platter, and don't think you'll be quick to make friends. Along with the nice bit of gunpowder skills and weaponary given to you, it gives another feel to the usual magic and swordplay world that is like PoE and Diablo 3, the combat is nice and beefy, strikes feel like they hit hard and enemies are plenty, either to be vaporized by magic or chopped to bits by a gaint sword.Having played this game a fair bit, I can say it bring back the old feel of Titan Quest, in a new and fresh setting, unlike the PoE and Diablo 3 universe. I can surely say, to those that enjoyed Titan Quest back in the day or want something different from the two big boys that are Path of Exile or Diablo 3 to check out Grim dawn, its not done yet, and its not perfect. But its a really nice change of pace and well done so far I can say.			"

												Writing with only 16h of gameplay:If you loved playing Diablo 2 as a kid (like myself), Grim Dawn is THE ARPG to buy!Just forget about Torchlight (and all the b@#$%&t about it saying it was made by the same team from Diablo 2). And forget about Diablo 3+ (and all the b@#$%&t about it saying it's the successor for Diablo 2).And go ahead and buy Grim Dawn.Here's why:I played both Torchlight and Diablo 3 (and PoE and Titan Quest), and they won't even come close to make me feel like I'm back in my teens playing Diablo 2 with my friends.Grim Dawn does it! All the ambience, the sound tracks, the atmosphere, the theme. All the darkness, the condemned world, the shading, the monsters, the bosses. All the item hunting, the items themselves, the skill trees, the character evolution. They all feel very much like Diablo, WAY MORE than Torchlight and Diablo 3 (and Path of Exile and Titan Quest and ... ).Sometimes when I'm playing I get this strong feeling that I'm finally playing a true new DiabloSometimes I get the same feeling I get when exploring a dark, hellish dungeon from Diablo 2.I strongly recommend this game if you like Diablo 2, and I want to say Thank you so much dev team for making this game! This is like a dream coming true for me. This is the Diablo sequence I was waiting and hoping for. "

								This game should not be overlooked by anyone who is interested in either Diablo 2,3,Titan Quest, or POE. While all of the games have fundamental differences in gameplay. Grim Dawn brings something fresh to the table that I have found lacking in POE and D3. The Pros:- Attention to detail (for example piles of burning bodies in fields and outside of burrwitch lead one to believe there was a major fight against the rampaging Aetherials, which leads me to my next ""pro"".)-The story telling ( while it does lack in lore like some of the AAA games (Diablo) it does  a masterful job at telling a story  without spelling it out for you. Different scenes you come across throughout the world really get you interested in what had happened as you put it together.-Itemization ( the loot is both unique and visually appealing)-The Combat (the melee and spells feel really good)-The MUSIC ( is just amazing, nuf said)The Cons:- The Combat ( Ranged combat is somewhat underwhelming, althought it has come a long way since initial release)-Skills ( while I am not one for super flashy skills like D3 some of the skills feel relatively underwhelming, for example the soldiers and cultist last tier skills, while useful, just don't look or feel all that impressive)- Multiplayer (multiplayer is not all that great as there are relatively few people who have public games open and the latency with the person hosting is often terrible, if one day they can have their own dedicated multiplayer server, it will be amazing!)-It's not done yet! ( just cant wait for it to release)Needless to stay it is still pre-release  and there is much that is being done to improve the game on  all fronts, when fully releases there will be much rejoicing. Highly reccommended			"

												*12-20-16 edit at bottomI recommend this title, only to true ARPG fans, with some very strong caveats. While I have had a lot of fun (and frustration) playing Grim Dawn, it's unforgivable weakness is in its late game balance.  Obviously GD draws a lot of comparisons to Diablo 2 and 3. While it is better in some regards, worse in others, as those titles, it simply does not have their longevity. I've clocked in just over 2,000 hours in Diablo 3. I have around 10% that time in GD, and I feel that I've taken it as far as I can go.  First, what is not as good as D2 and D3, as well as some other ARPGs: Loot and balancing.I have ran 4 different builds to the point I simply couldn't get any further. The difficulty settings of D3 is what allows for endless gameplay. In GD you start on Normal (with an optional Veteran difficulty that I honestly could not tell the difference except that there was less loot), then unlock Epic after completing the campaign, then unlock Ultimate after completing it on Epic. That's it, 3 difficulties, 3 times through the campaign, done. With level cap at 85, and no further options to continue playing, the game basically stops itself. However, of my 4 different builds, only one made it to the bitter end. And this is what I'm talking about balance here. What makes Epic and Ultimate more difficult is primarily the reduction of your resistances. So basically, you just die more often, xp becomes a grind, common minions often one-hit you out of nowhere, and some bosses (the trapped-in-a-box, no-retreat bosses) are simply unbeatable without the right build and very specific resistances. All that wouldn't be so bad, IF the game's claim that more difficult = better loot. But in over 200 hours of playing, I can tell you that it's just not true. If anything, I consistently got less good loot, but lots more junk loot. In every case, I was using the same equipment for 20 or more levels at a time for lack of getting anything better. Obviously, this is untenable when the monsters level with you. And the best gear I had was purchased, not looted. Over the course of 4 builds to Ultimate, up to levels 65 and 75 on average, I accumulated a sum total of 9 Legendary items, mostly unusable because of high requirements, or simply not as good as the epic items I already had from 20 levels ago. What this means is that I got rich, with just over 3 million iron bits on my final character, but with nothing  worthwhile to spend it on. So yes, GD is miserly with the good loot. Not a good feature when we all know that ARPGs are all about the loot. Even after the latest patch, I did a test run from middle to late Ultimate, and only got one legendary; the same gun that the Warden drops every time. Well I already had 3, thanks anyway. One could put the loot, or lack thereof, down to bad luck, but after 4 playthroughs, I can reasonably claim it's the system.Now, what makes GD better than D3: Character builds and skills.In D3 you get what you get as far as skills, they will be the same skills every time, they unlock at certain levels and at higher levels you can choose between them. That's it. This is the weakest point of D3. It sucks. GD has taken a step back with skills, more in line with D2, and allowed you to choose skills, then build on those preferred skills. And the passive skill tree is actually a constellation of skills that unlock new abilities or new attributes that you can then attach to whatever skill you prefer. This system allows for a high level of customization and control in your build, and is where GD really shines. The innovation of dual-class hybridization exponentially expands on the possibilities. Other good qualities are the lore, which is enough to keep you reading the notes, and the faction system. Factions are probably the best innovation to set GD apart from others in the genre. One other detractor worth mentioning: Performance. Even on lower settings, with reduced resolution, I constantly got lags and hitches, little micro-freezes. The gameworld is graphically nice, nothing extreme, so I think the problem is with distant LODs. It's as if the engine is trying to render too much at full detail, even long distance views and off-screen terrain. And shadow rendering seems to be glitched. They only look normal on higher settings. At medium and lower settings, the shadows glitch in a frenzied flashing of black triangles. Also, the game almost always freezes on exit, requiring alt-tab-del and a system reboot. This is extremely irritating and almost unforgivable in modern games.In summary, Grim Dawn is a ton of fun for the true ARPG fan. Just trying out the different builds and hybrid classes is what makes it worthwhile. However, the miserly loot system and terrible late game balance gives it a short shelf life. My hours in GD had many frustrating moments where I nearly quit for good. But the character options kept me coming back to try again... with the same results. Certainly, D3 had a much bigger budget and amounts to pure candy for the ARPG fan, while GD is grittier, tougher, less rewarding. D3 has longevity, you can literally play forever. But GD got the most crucial part right that D3 got wrong; the role-playing. And that has made it worth playing.*12-20-16 Edit: With recent updates addressing some of the issues I originally wrote about in this review, namely late game balance, I felt it warranted an edit. They have increased resistance buffs almost across the board for epics, making late game progression much more balanced and viable for a variety of builds. There have been many other improvements, but I felt this was the most significant. CrateGames has continued to update and improve this game, with more on the way, including two new classes, presumably in a free update. This kind of dedication to their game sets them apart and could very well make Grim Dawn my favorite ARPG of all time.			"

Early Access Review
 Grim Dawn  is one of the best  Early Access  games on Steam right now, and one of the few Early Access games that I totally don't regret purchasing. I'll be using a few comparisons to other popular games in the ARPG genre, and giving some reasons on how Grim Dawn differentiates itself.Grim Dawn is developed by  Crate Entertainment. They are only a small indie team of 7 or so, but they have some noticible talent from from titles like Titan Quest and Diablo 2. It's actually amazing what they have managed to accomplish with such a small team as the game was originally going to be a lot smaller in scope, but Crate had a fairly successful Kickstarter Campaign, which let them increase the scope of the game substantially.So what does Grim Dawn manage to do right? What are some key features that are different from most ARPG's?Huge Open MapGrim Dawn features one giant interconnected map. Every Act has it's own feel and tileset, and areas connect and loop back to each other in such a clever way that at times, it reminds me of the level design of Dark Souls. There are plenty of Dungeons and Caves throughout these maps to explore, usually rewarding you with a cool side-boss. The big map design is a really cool feature considering games like Path of Exile have really small maps in comparison.ExplorationMost other ARPG's mostly focus on the combat, which obviously--should be a big focus for any ARPG. But Grim Dawn kind of encourages you to explore and pay attention to the environment a bit more then the others. There are breakable walls in Dungeons (which are quite well hidden), but if you manage to find them, you tend to be rewarded with secret areas and enemies, meaning every Dungeon is worth fully exploring.CombatSince Grim Dawn is running on the Titan Quest engine (though, it's been modified and upgraded), there are some very satisfying physics and ragdoll effects.Monsters tend to explode into gibs!Combat is slower paced compared to games like D3, but it is responsive and punchy.Animation quality ranges from good to excellent. There are some really nice looking abilities, but I have noticed a few animations could use a bit of work. The monsters are fantastically animated though!Combat and movement in general is smooth.Monsters Drop Weapons They Are Using!This feature was in Titan Quest I believe, but I'm glad Crate decided to include it in Grim Dawn, as it's an awesome feature that most ARPG's should have.What this means in more detail, is if you see a creature holding a weapon that looks unusual, and you notice after it hits you, you were drained of some energy for example, there is a good chance that monster is going to drop the same weapon it used to drain your energy.This adds such a cool dimension to the game, as monsters can already have random affixes on them.LootEvery ARPG needs good loot. Good thing Grim Dawn delivers on that too! I'd say the loot system is a bit more old-school in it's design and approach, as there are a lot of % based modifiers, which is pretty standard, but a lot of items also have abilities attached to them. Other then that, you have your usual loot rarity system that are similar to most other ARPG's (Common, Magic, Rare, Epic) and Legendaries--which are not in the game yet.Looting in general is just satisfying as hell. I love how loot explodes out of chests, and you even get loot piñata's from killing bosses/mini-bosses.Crafting & ComponentsThe crafting system is actually quite in-depth and deep. It's perhaps not as deep as Path of Exile's crafting system, but it's not as simple as Diablo 3's either--it falls somewhere in between. One great thing is it's not as RNG focused as other crafting systems I've come across in other ARPG's.Components are basically upgrades for your gear. They are found and crafted, and they can be attached onto most armour pieces. Components can also have abilities attached to them. Overall, It's quite an interesting take on an upgrade system, as components let you easily fix some flaws in your builds.Sound DesignAbsolutely amazing soundtrack! It's probably one of the best soundtrack's for an ARPG since Diablo 2, and I don't say that lightly.There are some very well done ambient sounds, such as hearing flies buzzing around corpses, crackling around fires, etc--which adds a nice layer of detail to the sound design.The Combat sounds are quite well done. The guns are punchy, spells sizzle, and weapons thud like you would expect.Day & Night CycleThis really adds to the games presentation and atmosphere, while also adding a layer of believability.Now, some cons:Lack of Cinematics & Voice ActingThere is some voice acting, and what's there is actually pretty well done, but there is no voice acting for quests and dialogue. The writing is overall pretty high quality, but I think some more voice acting would help sell the story more. This is only a minor con imo, as I think Crate are planning to add in more voice acting towards the end of their development schedule.Slow StartI gotta admit the game didn't immediately click with me at the start. This seems to be a problem with most ARPG's, as you have a general lack of abilities and gear in the first few hours. But, it gets a whole lot better if you decide to stick with it for a couple of hours and get a few abilities.Lack of Visual CustomisationGames like Diablo 3 let you dye your armour, as well as transmogrify a peice of armour to look like another piece. Path of Exile has microtranscations for those things too. This is a great thing for games that are so focused on character development, and it's one feature that is sadly lacking in Grim Dawn. It does suck when your character is wearing armour that is not matching, with random colours and such. I'm hoping Crate adds a similar feature in the near future.Lack of Randomised Dungeons & MapsThere is a rogue-like Dungeon which is meant to address this, and admittedly it is meant to be a pretty kick♥♥♥♥♥dungeon (I haven't checked it out yet, but I have seen videos). Compared to Diablo 3's Rift System and Path of Exile's Maps, it's missing a lot of Enemy and Tileset variety.Development is a little slow...The game has been in full development since around 2012 (counting from the Kickstarter date). The general consensus seems to be that new builds take a little bit longer to release then most would like.Most of these cons were only minor cons for me, but can be major cons depending on how you feel about them.Overall, Grim Dawn does A LOT of things right. It has some features that should be standard for ARPG's, and those features make Grim Dawn feel like a very believable, detailed and rich gameworld. There is a lot of depth and replayability here, and if you even have a remote interest in ARPG's--Grim Dawn should be a no brainer.			"

												Grim Dawn let me make a sorceress with a shotgun. More than that it encouraged me to, because that shotgun happened to be the perfect fit for the build I was working towards. I could have given her an enchanted pistol, or a giant warhammer, or really any of the countless weapons to be found throughout the world, and made it work. But as I was dashing through the ruins of a seaside town, ducking in and out of crooked doorways to blow zombies and floating eyes to hell with burning buckshot, I knew I had found my calling. At least until I find a bigger gun.Freedom of choice is the chief takeaway from Grim Dawn, one of the most recent entries in the crowded ARPG/Diablo lootsplosion genre. Unlike its peers, Grim Dawn decouples weapons, armors, and even skills from specific classes, letting you be anything from an armored shaman with a lightning scythe to an arcane fire-slinging gunman to a demon-worshipping hammer-wielding assassin. The only thing limiting your gear choices are your level and your three base character stats, which all rise as your character grows and you invest in your classes. And yes I said classES because Grim Dawn lets you choose two of its six archetypes to mix into your character.The classes themselves can be a bit of a hangup for new players because of the unique level of control you have over your skill progression. Rather than unlocking skills at certain levels, each class tree has a Mastery bar for you to spend skill points on. This bar grants you important base stat boosts and unlocks your actual skills with enough points invested. Of course, then you have to balance spending points on Mastery or the skills, and across two class trees to boot. It can be a bit daunting until you realize your greatest gains come from your Mastery, so you'll generally want to one-point your skills until you unlock them all.Many of your skills are passive, meaning combat tends to be less technical than Diablo or other competitors. Indeed, more than a few battles are won or lost in the preparation of auras, toggle abilities, and weapon selections. You'll also find skills baked into the gear and upgrade components you find, some powerful enough to design an entire build around. In another liberating design decision, class skills are much more focused and specific while item skills are your more general fireballs and lightning novas, allowing you to make a pure caster out of literally any class combination.Unprecedented freedom means nothing if there's nothing to do with it, but Grim Dawn does not disappoint here, either. The world of Cairn is in the throes of a magical apocalypse, with ruined towns and valleys and forests full of unspeakable horrors to bludgeon. Enemies and allies alike are divided into factions, with new quests and gearing options availiable from those that like you, and new bosses and challenges from those who don't. The main quest will keep you busy for a good 30 hours just putting down one of the major threats to the world, but building reputation and uncovering new secrets can last you dozens more hours.And my God, the secrets! I'm a big fan of exploration in games and few reward you so richly as this. Unmarked dungeons and unique bosses can pop up just about anywhere, providing unexpected challenges at any level. Virtually every map has breakable walls and hidden chests, and much of the best loot to be had is found in hard-to-reach containers. I once found a secret dungeon beneath a side dungeon inside a completely optional dungeon! On top of all this, there's another character progression system called Devotion that uses points earned from hidden shrines all over the world, a genius system that more ARPGs would do well to ape.Grim Dawn doesn't hold back in challenge, either, with some brutally hard side dungeons and optional bosses right from the first few hours. The main quest is easy enough to get through for even the inexperienced, so you have your choice of difficulty through exploration as well. All of this is presented with a gritty, moody look and some meaty sound work, though the soundtrack is pretty lacking and gets repetitive in a hurry. The Lovecraftian themes are well-realized and there's a ton of detail to the world, from engaging lore to morally gray decisions to make. Even if there wasn't so much to work with in the gear and skills systems this would be a solid competitor to Diablo and its ilk, but the wealth of options and progression systems easily makes Grim Dawn one of the top titles in the genre.

Early Access Review
								I was and I still am a huge fan of Titan Quest. Grim dawn has exceeded my expectations by miles so far. I like the graphics, I like gameplay and I like the way you can improve gear by using collectable items. Gameplay is great, resources are not too scarce but its still a challenge. I just love it!Yeah, progress is slow, the game is still in early access state. That's because developers resources are low and mostly because they are doing it right instead of releasing a half baked thing. Where I live we use to say ""do it right, or it's not worth to be done."" You guys seem to do it just perfectly, keep on doing so well! And don't listen to the voices of impatient kids, they know nothing about hard work...After playing another 80 hours I have to say that it's getting even better. I have played around with several builds and it has not become boring yet. New Items with incredible stats and abilities keep popping up from time to time, which then inspire me to make some new builds.The faction system and the long promised changes that devotion will bring seem to add some additional depth to the game as well as some new goals. Which means it's going to cost me even more of my lifetime... :)			"

								Hello. I rarely review.  40 year old gamer here.  Been gaming my whole life...TT and PC.  This is without a doubt the greatest RPG/ARPG I have ever experienced.  186.6 hours of play time later, I am still amazed at this masterpiece.  It may be the best PC game ever made...but I will stick with best RPG.  Seriously, the designers of this game have truly just created a work of art.  That is all.  Buy this game, play it to death and then play it more.			"

												This is one of those games where you can just feel that the developers poured thier heart and soul into its creation.  Solid from start to finish and challenging on the ultimate difficulty.  Skills are fun to use and the multiclass system adds additional depth to character creation.  If you enjoyed Titan Quest or Diablo 2 I would highly recommend that you check out Grim Dawn.			"

												MassDebates New Game Log - Grim DawnStart of Day 1:Saw an advertisement today and figured I'd buy this game to try it out for 2 hours. Looked like a new Diablo 2, but I knew not to get my hopes up too much after what happened with Diablo 3.  I'll log my thoughts occasionally as I play, so you can see a time-based breakdown and you know where the game is good & bad. 2:44PM-It looks pretty good. Graphics are nice; High contrast but I don't feel like I'm on acid (like some games) 2:56PM-Enjoying combat gameplay and found skill window hotkey. Really cool hybrid skill system. Must explore later. 3:02PM-I FOUND 3 RARE YELLOW ITEMS! BEFORE MY FIRST MAGIC! OMFG! LOOKING UP KEYBIND FOR INVENTORY NOW! 3:03PM-Discovered Inventory Hotkey. Items weren't rare. Angered, but still an awesome game. I'll get awesome♥♥♥♥♥♥later! 3:09PM-Had to stop gameplay to log a note. The plot is very well done. Story has got excellent writing elements, the characters really work well, and the lore is enoyable to read. I legit feel like I'm a savior to these people! No water, no food, evryone's turning into a total♥♥♥♥♥♥covered in evil green stuff... they were totally screwed before I came around. Great job, devs! 3:12PM-Found my first Enemy Hero. Luckily, I've got leech life for days. He looks tough, but I think I can take him! 3:15PM-DESTROYED HERO WHO EXPLODED IN A SLEW OF GREEN SET ITEMS- CANT WAIT TO SEE IF ANY MATCH!!! 3:16PM-Unfortunately, my gamer mouse seemed to have spontaneously crushed itself. Strange... Shooting over to the store for another. Oh, and minor, unrelated side note: Greens are not set items, apparently. 3:36PM-I've returned with a new mouse with metal-reinforced plastic and have resumed savior duties. 3:42PM-Discovered Devotion Menu after restoring first shrine. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game's character building has got some serious kick! 5:18PM-Sorry, Haven't logged lately. Uh, games great and whatever. Hold on, I'll log some of the plot after I clear this Wasp Nest I found. I'm really close to getting a poison mod for shadow rush! 9:57PM-Uh... totally would tell you the plot but that's a lot of writing. Really in depth though, it's awesome. Better then reading a book ever could be. I need to head to bed soon, so I'll port to town, sell my latest loot, and continue logging tomorrow. 4:02AM-Ported to town and sold my loot. Sure, it was about 5 hours ago, but I said I'd continue reporting the day after, didn't I? This is for you, Steam Community. Remember that. 4:18AM-Discovered bounty table. Amazing feature for a game. Diablo needed this. Stepping outside for a smoke real quick after I port to town. It's that time, after all, and I gotta keep up with my Diablo 2 Tradition! 4:32AM-A bit late; stepping out for a smoke break real quick after I grab that chest I saw. (No room in inventory) 4:35AM-Collected chest items. Selling loot and then finally getting a smoke break. Nobody is ever on time for 420 anyways. 5:41AM-I've given up smoking. It is a dirty habit that takes away from the important matters in life. 8:04AM-Called in sick for work- illness is too great, especially with this reduced resistance curse on me right now. 12:21PM-Wow, did you know how much better the crafting is in this than DIablo 2? Horadric cube was bomb, don't get me wrong, but man, components, augments, rituals, and powders?GIMMY MY GRIMMY, Puh-LEEZ! 1:11PM-Girlfriend called me 4 times in a row. Can't she see that she only has to wait until I'm done with the mob I'm fighting!? At any rate, I'm super psyched- She's cooking my favorite cut of steak for dinner tonight at 5:00PM!! She also told me my parents were trying to get a hold of me since 3PM yesterday and haven't seen me. 3:21PM-I've quelled all immediate threats of danger for an entire town. When they were starving and eating rations of rotten, corrupt meat, I've given them food and the gift of fertile farmland. When they were too thirsty to sweat, I've demolished a river blockade and allowed irrigated water to flow. When they felt unsafe, I provided security. I've personally saved over 40% of this town single-handedly, sometimes repeatedly for the same villagers. and just now, when I find 3 pieces of some♥♥♥♥♥♥stained fabric handkercheifs in some hazardous-as-♥♥♥♥ ruins (because, y'know, fabric isn't anywhere else, apparently) after 15 minutes of searching, I finally gain enough trust to be treated as ""Friendly"".Ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥.. 3:44PM-Found a new town. Cleaned up some worms out of a Farm. Very grateful people. I like 'Homestead' a lot more. 5:28PM-Girlfriend is furious, says that I lied to her about demonic forces taking over the local area and that I'm no longer invited over for dinner because she threw mine out after eating. After hearing Constance's voice while on the phone with me, she remains convinced that I'm hiding another woman on her. I said, ""Nonsense. She's a school teacher. I like my women promiscuous and sultry"". She hung up immediately after that while saying ""We're Done"". Why didn't she beleive me!?  I'll smooth it over with her tomorrow. 5:29PM-Phone died, but I'll plug it in to charge soon. 5:41PM-I've gotten up for the first time since playing to switch out the bathroom bags and grab the rest of my Mountain Dew & Dorito rations from downstairs Forgot to plug in the phone, but I'll get it on the next stand-up. 7:21PM-I've stepped foot onto the wastelands known as the 'Obsidian Throne' in my quests and my ambitions for amazing gear. This is one of the coolest areas so far. A whole new dimension, and better than Hell's Sanctuary was. 7:24PM-Girlfriend busted my room's door in while screaming about all sorts of stuff. She seems really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 7:26PM-Just got to 2nd level of Cthonic Rift Portal, and got my first summon (from Devotion's Grim Reaper). I've mentally decided that I'm going to explore the Shaman and Occultist characters after I'm done with this one. 7:52PM-Girlfriend storms out saying ""I give up. I'm not even going to try. Tell your Mom I said thanks for the flowers, because I'm leavning for good."" and throws a vase at the wall. Even though it amazingly landed face up, unspilled and unbroken, it was still totally uncalled for.  11:59PM-I'm out of Mountain Dew, but I have plenty of Doritos left. If it were the other way around, I'd be really annoyed by seeing ""Untouched Meal"" every 5 minutes. 1:22AM-I'm now out of doritos, but there's still at least a half-cup of water left in the flower vase. I should be good to go for a while before I go downstairs to refill it. 2:44AM-The police have arrived at my place and are forcing me to shut off the computer before they take me in. I told them I didn't do anything wrong, that I have an alibi, and that it's all even logged right here! They gave me some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about a 'missing person' and that they have to bring me in for Fingerprints to make sure they know whether or not I'm 'the guy'.♥♥♥♥ing idiots... I wasn't missing. I knew where I was the whole time..Originally posted by author, days later:Please, if you value your life, do not get this game. I've been released after treatment for malnourishment, video game dependence-based anxiety, hallucinations, and an inability to separate fantasy from games. My gf and family have left me.I'm so alone....Update: Found multiplayer "

												One of the best early access games I purchased. I love the world, graphics, combat, and skill trees. If you enjoy these types of games, you know how satisfying it is to think of a build and go for it, only to see it work better than expected. Good stuff.  In my opinion this is better than Van helsing series and Diablo 3,.. As of others have said, this is closer to Diablo 2 and what Diablo3 should have been. Also, you can play offline and online if you choose.			"

'If it bleeds, I can kill it‘Jarvis when confronted with an Aetherial that possesses a human__________________________________________IntroductionA world on the brink of destruction, plagued by aetherial spirits, demons and insane cult members fighting for power, awaits a hero to stop these evil hordes - welcome to 'Grim Dawn‘.To cut the whole story short: this game is among the best ARPGs that I have played to date and provides hours and hours of fun for fans of the genre and loot-grinding in general. It has a good amount of character customization (stat and skills points, the devotion system, active and passive abilities), an atmospheric world with a 'grim' style, some good lore and background information, a good amount of sidequests and secrets and of course: tons and tons of loot.__________________________________________Important points in ARPGsAt first I want to focus on some main points that are my most important requirements for a loot based ARPG game:The character creation should provide a good amount of variety and depth, there should be several different characters with lots of (viable) builds, even for endgame: Check!A fast-paced fighting system with interestings skills and combinations and a quite tough difficulty curve for having some challenge: Check!Loot! Lots and lots of interesting and varied loot plus crafting and augmentations (that awesome stuff you need to grind for several hours because your character REALLY needs those 25 extra points of DPS): Check!An interesting world with lots of atmospheric areas and some interesting lore: Check!Exploring the maps should feel worthwile and sidequests, secrets areas and mysterious stuff should await courageous adventurers: Check!An acceptable length plus additional difficulties and a hardcore mode to provide some long-term motivation: Check!A coop mode is always a great feature because every now and then it's more entertaining to grind for stuff with others: Check!__________________________________________Gameplay, builds and all the other stuffAs usual in every ARPG you run around, killing hundreds and thousands of enemies while looting every stash and treasure that you see on the screen. The fights tend to be very fast-paced and require some fine-tuning in terms of skills and equipment in higher difficulties.Grim Dawn does many things right. There are some visually very appealing areas, the soundtrack is fantastic, the atmosphere and style is splendid and there's a lot of stuff you can kill and loot aside from the main path. One of the most important points in an ARPG is certainly the character itself. You play with him/her for quite some time and you should be able to develop everything in the way you prefer it to fit your playstyle. Luckily 'Grim Dawn' provides a good amount of character customization:At first there's a dual class character system. You can combine two of the six classes to get one of the 15 available Masteries. This allows a lot of interesting options to specialize in different skills and mechanics and trying out new combinations is a lot of fun.Stat Points: Physique, Cunning, Spirit. Those are the three stats where the stat points can be allocated to. Not very special though, that’s basic stuff.Skill Points: the dual class systems gives you two skill trees with several levels and lots of passive and active abilities. That way you can specialize your character in different ways. Reallocating your points is possible though.Devotion: There are lots of stars on the sky and they belong to a lot of different celestial powers. While exploring the world you can find devotion shrines and by cleaning or restoring them you can get points to spend in the devotion system, another layer of character customization. There are many different signs and options that provide lots and lots of passive abilities or even new active skills.Equipment: It’s an ARPG so there’s a lot of equipment for sure. The common rarities (normal, magic, rare, legendary and epic stuff + set items) wait for fearless adventurers and skillfull heroes. Some epic and legendary items even grant your character new active and passive skills. Additional special attacks or even more passive or automatically proccing skills can make quite a difference when you face some nasty bosses and enemy hordes.Augmentations and Crafting: Yes, you will grind a lot for several ingredients and recipes. It will annoy you. But you’ll do it nonetheless to improve your gear even further. Add some additional damage, get some more resistances or provide other usefulls points by adding augmentations to your equipment – never say no to additional positive stats. You’ll need them. Those bosses are not known for mercy.So much for the character customization. With two classes you can try out really interesting combinations. Should your Soldier class get some magic power as well by choosing the Arcanist and becoming a Battlemage? Or should he fight with the skills of a Nightblade, annihilating enemies with two weapons at once as a Blademaster? Your choice.The character system is backed up by an interesting world with lots of secret areas, side quests and neat little stuff to explore and a very good atmosphere throughout the whole game. There are also several factions that you can side with and some of them (and some sidequests as well) require some simple decisions as well: choose option A and Side B will hate you or the other way around. Nothing too special but it adds some replay value.The story itself is (typically for the genre) solid but nothing more. The lore and the background information however are quite interesting (yes, I actually read the little journey entries) and increase the atmosphere of this mad world even more.__________________________________________ConsOf course there’s some shadow as well. The game is not always working completely stable, I had approximately 10 crashes in the hours I spent so far (funny: most of them while closing the game), though the last update reduced the amount of crashes a lot. As usual you need to grind quite a bit for upgrade materials and reputation points, the dialogue windows are somewhat ugly and… yeah that’s it. That’s all I can think of at the moment. Compared to the game‘s positive aspects it can be ignored easily.__________________________________________ConclusionWhenever I start the game I play more than intended at first. Every time. That’s quite a good sign as the game is a lot of fun and combines several advantages of amazing ARPGs of the past while providing neat little comfort functions (e.g. show only loot of a particular rarity or higher) and requires the player to actually read and listen to dialogues and journal entries because there are no quest markers on the world map (only on the mini map when you are close to them). That’s perfectly fine and encourages to run through areas again.Overall 'Grim Dawn' is among the best ARPGs that I have played so far and in combination with the mod support, the regular updates and the co-op mode it provides fun for a looong time. Sure, there are some rough edges that could use some more polishing (.e.g the dialogue windows needs getting used to, personally I think they are ugly) but even now I’d gladly rate it 9 out of 10 points as it provides nearly everything that you want from an ARPG.Okay, that was enough talk. Time to grind! Only 16 more chipped claws to craft that little component. Sweet!__________________________________________This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.			"

												I am a great fan of the diablo series, but this game feels like how diablo 3 should feel. You start off in some small city and from the first moment in, I felt it to be ''just right''. Even when they used the same engine as Titan Quest, the graphics in this game looks amazing and stunning. Its like the developers didnt want ANY place in this game to look like it has been created on a hurry. Every single bit of environment you encounter looks just right. The trees, the little abandoned cottages, the looks of mobs. As far as I have played, which isnt that much yet, even the most outlying places looks great. I am a fan of multiplayer, and the way this games handles the ''drop-in'' and ''drop-out'' of multiplayer works like a charm. Indeed, they dont support their own servers for multiplayer, but they did an awesome job here. No port forwarding needed. Just enter if you would like to play single player, multiplayer using LAN or INTERNET, or joining one of those. Everyone with a decent connection should not have any problems with this game playing over either Lan or Internet.The dept of this game overall is amazing. The skilltrees, the devotion points (Points that can be acquired through shrines around the world), the dual specialization, the different classes. The blacksmith who can craft amazing and lots of items and add-ons for your character. The shared stash tab, so you can share items between other characters instantly. Although Grimdawn is an ARPG, the different playstyles you can combine with or without friends feels so good. I have played a lot of RPG's and ARPG's before, but Grimdawn feels like something ''new''. Not the standard hack and slash experience, but something feels different in this game. All the variation in it makes it so great. You even have an option to turn your camera around, so if you're bored with this game (I cant image why), you could turn the camera 180 degrees and its like you're playing a whole new world!Would I recommend this game? Well definitely I will! And that for only 25 euro's? Thats amazing!			"

												Grim Dawn is a top-down Action Role Playing Game. I would have said Isometric if the camera wasn't adjustable though. With many similar gameplay elements to THQ's Titan Quest, the game has its own distinct art style and unique flair with plenty of modern day ARPG improvements. As I mentioned, this game is a great spiritual successor to Titan Quest and although it's a little slower paced than...say...Diablo 3, I'd say the rewards and overall character progression feels much more satisfying. At the time of this review I'd still say this game and Path of Exile are the two best ARPGs out there right now and I've played them all except an obscure few. Difficulty progression is along the lines of Diablo 2. Where you start at normal difficulty, complete it and redo the whole story again in the next difficulty tier and so until a 3rd, final playthrough. You can also enable a veteran difficulty option that makes your current playthrough even tougher.Let's get the bad out of the way first. The multiplayer can break your character if you're not careful, unless they've fixed this since this happened to me and my friend. If the host is further along in the game than the friend you invite, it will break your friends' quests and replace them with yours, making it possible to skip everything they haven't done yet and miss important NPCs and quest items with no way to return things to normal other than starting over. But as long as you stick together with fresh toons on the same quests throughout your playthrough, you'll be fine. The story is okay, it feels like it drags on at times but it is well told and thought out. With dozens and dozens (hundreds?) of NPCs to interact with as well as a few plot altering choices along the way, Grim Dawn manages to stay fresh up until the very end. Compound that with an amazing variety of multi-class options and skill selection mixed with all types of weapons and armor to supplement your playstyle, it's a joy to play. And hey, if you screw up your skill placement there's always an NPC that can fix that....for a price. There's also an added feature called Devotion, whose points are earned from shrines scattered throughout the game and can be used to further solidify your position as a walking weapon of mass destruction.Speaking of NPCs there are blacksmiths that will craft items from blueprints, faction based shops that will sell you items based on how friendly you are to the different factions in the area. A respec NPC, a few different types of item merchants and even a bounty system. There are tons of sidequests to be found along the path and given by NPCs.The music, sound effects and ambient noises mix well with the game's ""grim"" atmosphere. Everything fits together nicely. If you're interested I suggest looking up the Grim Dawn OST on youtube at the very least.More content is still being added, which is great. There will be an Illusionist NPC that lets you transmogrify equipment to look like other equipment you've found, much like Diablo 3's Mystic. An expansion on the way and there's already some extra dungeons and events like the Crucible that have been added over time too. Even for the full price I still think this game is worth it. I recommend it, highly. One of my all-time favorite ARPGs.			"

Full Review BelowHover to see my verdict-->Double Thumbs Up from Royial!Grim Dawn, a spiritual successor to Titan Quest (check that out if you haven't already) a new standard for ARPGs by Crate Entertainment, better than Path of Exiles, Torchlight 2, and WAY better than Diablo III.Full character customizationMix 6 different classes for different play-stylesExplore a HUGE worldCraft Gain reputation with several factionsReap great rewards and fight big bossesThe world of Cairn is gritty and dark, with interesting lore that definitely is inspired from Lovecraft and music that reminds me of the good old days of Diablo and Diablo II. All in all my new standard for all ARPGs, Path of Exiles is a great ARPG, Torchlight 2 is a goodARPG, Diablo III is not a funARPG, for me, Grim Dawn has everything and then some that all of these other titles don't have, and for that reason alone its worth the purchase. Need another reason? Its only$24.99USD, that is what I like to see on PC gaming, great games and great prices. Support these guys now!

								After 30+ hours of playing the first act i'm still having loads of fun! Plenty of replayability due to experimenting with different character builds, tactics, and the awesome dual class system. From what i've seen in act 1, the difficulty is good: A gimped character will die alot, as well as players rushing head long into the fray. Graphics are awesome, although carts on fire still eat up all my frame rates...Definitily buy this game if you are a fan of TQ, or if D3 wasn't enough to satisfy your hunger.			"

												I've been playing ARPG's since Diablo, am a firm believer that Diablo II: Lord of Destruction is the best ARPG ever made and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls is not a true successor to the series. Besides that I've also put time and effort in Torchlight II and Path of Exile, which I both found to be better than Diablo III but which still couldn't satisfy my ARPG need. Now I've purchased Grim Dawn early on but due to performance issues I was unable to play it at that time (which have been fixed) and I left it until recently.My experience comes from playing Act I in Hardcore Veteran mode, both solo and with friends in multiplayer. The difficulty at Veteran -which is a modifier to Normal difficulty, increasing the amount of ""Hero enemies"" and the rewards that you reap from them- is very solid. You will roughly level from 1 to 18-20 during Act I, during which I got the feeling that this game is quite well balanced. Sometimes you will feel weak, but most of the time that is to be fixed with reassigning your skills.The overal look and feel of this game is, like the name implies; Grim. It's dark and ""serious"", like Diablo II and Path of Exile. No cartoon art-style as Diablo III or Torchlight II. Personally I find this to be a big plus, seeing as this gives the game a more serious presentation. The unique point of this game is that you start the game without choosing a class, called masteries in Grim Dawn. Once you reach your first level you gain the option to select one out of six masteries; Arcanist, Demolitionist, Nightblade, Occultist, Shaman, Soldier. Each mastery has an unique and fun skill tree with enough skills to keep you trying out stuff for a while. Just like in Diablo II you will have to assign attribute points to either Physical (health), Cunning (melee) or Spirit (mana). A lot of gear you will find will require X points into Physical and either X points in Cunning or Spirit, depending on the kind of gear (weapon type, heavy or normal armor).This goes on until you reach level 10, at which the game presents you to choose a (optional) second mastery. You can choose to combine masteries to supplement your character with additional skills that would otherwise be impossible to get, or to ignore this and go deeper into your previously selected mastery. Based on the combination of masteries you've chosen, your character class title will change to something else. The option of adding a second mastery will stay definitely once level 10 has been reached. The current level-cap is 85.All in all this game feels refreshingly good and comes close to the feeling I've got while playing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, but without the bots running all the games. If you need something different from Diablo III, Torchlight II or Path of Exile, this is it.			"

I would recommend 100% for any ARPG lovers out there... Only good things to come in the future. Very much worth the $30 CAD on the game, better than any ""Popular"" game in the RPG genre			"

								Holy S.h.i.t !   It´s not very professional to start a review like that but I really had to do this. I played Diablo 2 Classic Ladder on Closed Battlenet for like 10 years and I could´nt wait for Diablo 3. STOP. It was an Epic Fail for me, so i began to search and search for a ""better Diablo 3"" and i played games like Torchlight 2, Path of Exile and Others. Then I ´ve heard about Grim Dawn and I was like ""that sounds very promising to me"" Some months later I found it here on Steam and I was like ""Its an instant buy, you cant go wrong with that!"". STOP. After the first 5 minutes the game totally got me. Just like Diablo 2 did, years ago. The atmosphere is wonderful and dark, graphics are nice but not kick a.s.s, Sounds are also very dark and just fitting. The Skilltrees are the way they had to be in Diablo 3 and the whole itemsystem with blueprints (not yet working though!) is really motivating and interesting. So far I´ve played 70 hours, testing alot of nice builds, checking out fix ideas and such on this ALPHA on GREENLIGHT, which gave me TONS more fun than Diablo3 ever did. So to come to a conclusion: you CANNOT make anything wrong with this game, IF you are into A-RPG at all.			"

At the moment of this review I have played for 119 hours. Previously I have played to Diablo (I,II) Torchlight II, Path of Exile and Van Helsing II and this genre of game is not my favorite.This game has been in steam early access for a time, and the players feedback and testing were used to improve the game to the version that we can play today.Do I think this game is good and can I recommend it? YES, absolutely. I bought it on steam sale, but believe me, this game is worth at full price. A few words about this game? DIABLO 2+TITAN QUEST+PATH OF EXILE= GRIM DAWN. Is the game alive? Yes. Average of 4000 players/day  Steam database source  [steamdb.info]

Graphics: This game has a dark-gore-Victorian ambience that, personally, I love. All the decoration, the colors, the houses, roads, each cave, the entire map makes you feel that ambience. About that, the scenarios are not randomly generated, each map is almost the same each time you start a game: rocks, bodies, some enemies will change their position, but the maps don't change. And ""that"" is something really GOOD. Why? If you have been playing to torchlight or diablo, each dungeon are random each time you enter. But it lacks of personality. Here, you will find secret areas, secret caves, which don't appear in the map, are hidden from the sight, sometimes you need to find a secret lever to open the entrance. There are hidden areas, which you will unlock with some explosive help, runes or... well, I won't tell you all the secrets. There are letters and books that will teach you the story of Cairn, or simply a love letter from a dead body to his loved and beside that, the ambience, because here you feel the love that their creators invested everywhere, with little details like a tree, a clock, a sewer, the office of a doctor, the lair of a thief... You will think that you know a zone perfectly, but you will find secrets that you didn't notice that were there before, and THAT is surprising in this kind of games. The isometric view is correct, much more better than others like path of exile. The shadows, textures, details etc... excellent (for a game like this, don't compare it with Doom)Spells and attack effects? Really good. Fire and ice, venom, caos, guns, temblors... Just watch a gameplay and you will see it. Music: Do you remember Diablo 2 themes? Some tracks of Grim Dawn makes me remember those moments where I was following to the vagabond ""east, always to the east"". The atmosphere that the music makes, it's the right balance to this kind of games where you start to walk and your goal is to arrive to a point smashing and murdering everything in front of you.

Story: You begin your steps as the only man/woman that has been able to survive to the possession of a form of life from another dimension, the aetherial. Soon you will know more about this invasion from another world, that has upside down your world, from a prosperous empire to the actual moment, where humanity hardly survive fighting against the aetherial, their puppets, and their rivals, which are not your friends either. That has give you a reason to fight back and maybe you have become into the last hope of humanity. How much time to finish the main quest? More or less 40 hours. Depends if you like your class from the beginning. In my case, I played a conjurer to level 48 and liked it a lot but tried a warlock and I prefer it, so I have finished the game in normal with this one. Gameplay: Just... perfect. In other Action rpg games you lost your objective, and soon you feel like a monkey smashing the same button to kill hundreds of enemies. Grim Dawn with its two classes build style, allows you to search the way you want to play, for fun. At level 1 you will choose your class, at level 10 you will be able to choose an additional class. So, If you are soldier + arcanist you are a Battlemage, sword plus magic. But if you are soldier + demolitionist your are a Commando, sword plus guns. Each class can be played in a lot of ways and if you are interested, I recommend you to visit this forum, where you will find massive information about the different classes and possible builds, guides, gameplay videos... so you can see if that class is the character you will like to play.Build Comendium [www.grimdawn.com]Negative point: * There's no way to hide the HUD. Max you can do is to downsampling, change to minimal hud scale, hide the map and quest log. Crop and paste that shot.Besides, If you want to take a shot from another angle, you have to use a mod that allows you to move up and down the camera. That shows you that there's no sky, literally. The sky is black and the roof does not exist. No need to be there because you only play with isometric view xD* Sometimes when you exit the game, it doesn't, and you get a black screen. In my case, this happened when I used spanish language patch.* If you want to craft, you have first: get the blueprint (the recipe) then you have to craft the different materials but someones have a very low drop rate from mobs. This can get you mad but if you like this... it's not a negative point.			"

Early Access Review
								Edit:  Posting an update because we just got the final release (build 31), and I've put in about 200 more hours since my first review.  Multiplayer is much improved from a month ago.  We now have Voiceovers and an intro video.  It's hard to describe here, but the overall ""smoothness"" feel of build 31 is significantly better than it was in b29/30.  We have gotten some added content in act 2, drops were slightly increased for Elite and Ultimate, the skill tree has been modified significantly (in a good way), many items have been altered, many skills have been updated... overall, I'd say that, as good as the Early Access version of GD was, this final version is even better.  I'm so excited that I deleted my 81 blademaster, 80 witchblade, 70 commando, and 63 battle mage this morning, and started everything over from scratch.The game is going live in 2 days, on Feb 25.  I highly recommend that you buy it.Oh, and watch out for Karraz, Sigil of Ch'thon, he's gotten a huge buff.  He almost took out my 63 battlemage on Elite Hardcore last night.Below is my original review.I tried out Grim Dawn about 15 months ago, and it was still pretty rough.  However, I came back to it after b29 made it content complete, and it's now ready for Prime Time.  Grim Dawn takes so many elements from Titan Quest that I loved, and it mixes them up with the gritty flavor from d1 and d2.Pros:  ItemizationCustomizationGritty FeelVery Large WorldMuch more Polished than most games at releaseCons:Multiplayer could use some workOverall, I give it a hearty thumbs up.

Early Access Review
								After nearly 500 hours of early access playtime I feel i should weigh in on Grim Dawn. Also at 491 hours and rising it should tell you i've enjoyed this game greatly, and have paid for two other copies that i gave to my brother and a friend. Now lets get to the actual Review.Grim Dawn as a game does not hold your hand, in quests you are told to seek out something or someone at a location, after that you are left on your own to search for your objective, only once you get near your objective(about near the edge of your screen) does a marker show up. This encourages exploration of areas in full and i also reccomend that you fully explore an area there are many secrets in the game to be found, from loot, to quests, to bosses that may or may not kill your character when you first meet them.The world is also not sectioned off like say as it was in Titan Quest or Diablo, it is instead one continous worldspace, akin to Sacred, some complain about this giving the games world areas too similar to one another, i personally enjoy this as it creates a more cohesive world.As for the games story, i find it enjoyable enough, when you start the game your character was to be hung at the gallows for being possessed by an Aetherial spirit, said spirit abandons ship before it dies with you, you're cut down, then asked if you want to stay you need to earn your keep by assisting the settlement of Devils Crossing, i wont spoil much more, but another thing i would like to address about the games story is that some NPC's you meet arent helpless sods needing rescue, bar some casses. theres quite a few times in the game where you find the odd NPC camped out somewhere surrounded by slain monsters, I find this a refreshing change of pace compaired to other ARPGs. Lastly much of Grim Dawn's history, backstory, and lore are found via notes scattered throughout the world, some are journals from before the game, others history of the world, or just the odd bit of why a particular foe is with a faction. Again encouraing more exploration of the world.Now to the meat and bones of any ARPG, Character customiztion, progression and loot. Lets start with the Masteries, in Grim Dawn there are 5(and a 6th coming in the next build, Build 27) Masteries, Soldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade, and Arcanist, and soon to be the Shaman. the Soldier is your melee specialist,  hearty and strong, a robust choice for someone new to grim dawn.The Demolitionist is all about explosions and fire. Like seeing the world burn? then this is the mastery for you.The Occultist Focuses on debuffs, pets, and debilitating attack spells. command minions to maul your foes or debilitate them with vile curses.The Nightblade is your melee dual wielder, focusing on speed, and very fast attacks, want to shred your enemies into ribbons? chose the nightbladeThe Arcanist is a pure spellcaster  that rains down destruction and devastation. the glass cannon of the gameEach of these masteries can be combined with another to create a dual class, covering one masteries weakness or bolstering anothers strengths. in my opinion this lends the game a great deal of replay value because i am the kind of person who will explore all avenues of play. with the varied skill pool of a single mastery there are quite a few dual class combinations you can take advantage of and explore different playstyles.The loot in Grim Dawn is quite good, the qualities ranging from White(basic), Yellow(magic), Green(rare or rare monster infrequent), Blue(epic) and Purple(Legendary, not yet in the game). Curiously magic rare and epic are competative, in some character builds a good yellow might be all you need to properly outfit an equipment slot,  while another can get by with some basic epic items, or builds looking to gear in all rare equipment. there are a number of affixes to suit any and all builds, as well as epics.There is also a Faction system in Grim Dawn, there are many groups you can aid, and many you can anger. Increasing your standing with friendly factions allows you access to their equipment and augments. these augments offer additional bonuses to your items and can be worth the effort to obtain access to them. Conversely further angering hostile factions makes them send more dangerous enemies at each threshold, culminating in the chance to encounter a Nemesis, a random boss linked to the faction you angered. these nemesis bosses while rare drop incredible loot, and assure an epic from their defeat, and once they are in the game, an increased chance of legendary drops.this last section I am going to adress some deal breakers: Many ask ""will there be secure servers?"" at this time there are no plans for such, it is however under consideration if Grim Dawn sells enough to pay for the required infrastructure and personel to maintain them. Tying into that, Grim Dawns files are all stored locally, every game file and every save file is on your hard drive, to those with the ability to edit and modify them, they can. this leads to seeing some oddities in multiplayer games, like players exceeding the current set level cap, items that are unobtainable legitamately, and stats that are likewise impossible. Grim Dawn is going to be moddable, this is why the games files are on our hard drives, so that once we have the mod tools we can edit the files as we please. Lastly while there is PvP, it is not the focus of the game and is not balanced accordingly, in fact most pvp matches tend to be whoever gets hit first dies. Grim dawn is primarily PvE and will remain as such.To close this out, if you want an ARPG that offers very deep character customization and itemization and great gameplay and atmosphere then this game is for you. If you want a secure multiplayer experience away from what you would consider cheaters this might not be your cup of tea.thank you for reading my long as hell review.see the full version on the forums here: http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?p=249496#post249496 "

Early Access Review
								Well... I suppose I'll write a review after testing the game for over 1k hours though after the game's release I will definitely update this.So. Let's start with the company. Crate Entertainment currently consists of a team of 8 people who not only communicate with the community (this is amazing) - but also know how to create a kick♥♥♥♥♥game. They started with only 2 people for quite some time while receiving off and on support from people they knew who also worked on TQ - gradually and with help from Kickstarter + Steam Early Access sales they have managed to expand and continue to amaze the fans who are eagerly waiting for this game to be released (even now it is defnitely worth it imo).Grim Dawn takes all the good things from Titan Quest and makes it better while also distinguishing itself in it's own way. The game plays and feels like Titan Quest while it also reminds me of Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 when it comes to the grittier/darker visual appeal. This to me is the ultimate combination of ARPG games and to be apart of the development process in testing and providing feedback for such a game is an amazing experience.Now to the game.Story - Grim Dawn is actually what the peope of Cairn (world of Grim Dawn) call what is pretty much the apocolypse in that an invasion of 2 otherwordly races have invaded the world. One race, the Aetherials want to possess everything that lives all the while pretty much terraforming the planet in order to make Cairn a more liveable place for them - while the other race, the Ch'thonians want to stop this from happening which means butchering those that the Aetherials are interested in possessing which includes you and any survivors that managed to live through the initial invasion.That is the overall plot in which the beginning of the game is more stressing the survival aspects of living in a now ruined world - while also building a foundation for future encounters with the Aetherials and Ch'thonic invaders. The danger is very real - and there are other nasty beasts, creatures and outlaws that also pose a threat to your survival.There are Quest Options for choosing different outcomes in a quest, and there will be factions that will be added later on in development (perhaps late this year or early next year hopefully).Combat - Very much like Titan Quest but having a faster pace. So far it's been quite good and the devs continually update animations, balance skills, and fix bugs with skills when they can. Definitely not Diablo 3 which admittedly has some good combat that flows very well (one of the few things that I'll give to the game) - but it's still pretty good. Hopefully as development continues whatever issues that people find will be fixed and improved upon.Characterization - Creating a character has only male/female options but this will probably change later when it comes to having different options for faces/hair as pertaining to a dev post. As this isn't hugely important it will be done later on I would imagine. However the main thing: replay value and creating Skill Builds. This is definitely there. Just like Titan Quest, Grim Dawn has the dual mastery system where you start off with one mastery/class at level 2 and once you reach level 10 you can choose a second one. With 5 Mastery's that is 15 combinations of either sticking with 1 mastery or using the dual mastery system. Itemization also expands character builds by a lot which brings me to...Itemization/Crafting - Really good. Common/White items are useful for the couple low levels in which you can then turn them off (making them more of a visual look when it comes to enemies dropping stuff they are wearing/using(!!!)), Magic/Yellow items are next in line which although not usually as powerful as later tiers they can roll a lot higher with their affixes, Rare/Green items have affixes that are unique and can be quite powerful, Epic/Blue items have set affixes with merely the rolls being varied + they can be set items, and Legendary items are not yet in the game.Needless to say the itemization in this game is fantastic and compliments both the skill building aspect of the game and the loot hunt part of the game.Level Design - Handcrafted world means the level design looks really good but of course trades that off with less randomization. Enemy camps can be randomized in some cases and there are randomized barriers which players can encounter and have to find a way to get around them via an alternate route - giving some slight randomization and also promoting exploration. The level design for each area is done in such a way that the player can continue on in the direction of the next area quickly - or spend time to explore the area for loot/dungeons/caves/quests. Essentially levels are short but wide - so later playthroughs you can choose whether or not to spend more time exploring or continuing on with the quests. The game isn't finished yet so content on Act 3 and perhaps the miniature Act 4 that may be added will also be quite interesting to see.Enemies - Are quite diverse and are also in their own faction which means you can actually see Aetherials and Ch'thonic enemies duking it out before you even get to the fight. As with Titan Quest later difficulties means secret bosses/challenge dungeons that would have been locked in the previous difficulty.Some more Positive things: -Modding - is amazing. Titan Quest and Diablo 2 both have great mods that I have enjoyed and since GD's modding tools will be better I am hoping for some amazing mods later on in the future.-Survival Mode. Sounds just like it says in that you need to survive against waves of enemies, modding can definitely expand on this.-Open World PVP. Though the game's skills/itemization isn't based on PVP modding could definitely create balanced PVP and probably some interesting game modes I would imagine.-Camera that is fully rotatable and has decent zoom.  Might not seem like that much of a deal but after playing GD - trying other ARPG's or even Moba's can be relatively frustrating due to lack of camera control.-Weather + Day and Night System.-Will be DRM free on release - for those that are wary about Steam and want to fully own the game.-No economy.Some possible Negatives:-Single player based with optional multiplayer. Single player mode is perfectly fine while multiplayer can be a bit iffy mainly due to it being just released - optimization will definitely improve on the multiplayer experience.-No closed servers. Like TL2 and TQ there aren't closed servers. Should the game do amazingly well the devs have expressed their interest in such a thing but they would rather spend money on more content before considering closed servers. That being said public games are usually pretty good and if someone joins in with a modded character you can always ban them from the game/server. A con when it comes to modding but the pros definitely outwheigh the cons.-No economy.-Slow development. Though I expect the game to be finished either early or middle of next year - the pace is relatively slow due to having a small team. That being said they do communicate well with the forum users and give updates every other Monday.-Costs $25. For some reason people really like F2P games but I'd rather pay a flat price for a full game rather then have a gimped free version of the game. For what you get out of the game $25 is super cheap even with the content that is available now.-Not optimized. Though I can run the game at max fine, that doesn't mean everyone can. Obviously lack of optimization is a given that will be improved later on in development - however both the devs and the community are pretty good in trying to help those who are having issues with running the game.Conclusion: Grim Dawn is definitely worth $25 if you enjoyed Titan Quest and perhaps Diablo 1 or 2.10/10 for an excellent Early Access game. Will update on release.			"

Early Access Review
								When I was a wee lad, I had an addiction to Diablo 2.  Sure, other games would find their way on to my 500 MB HDD, but they were just visiting.  That's where D2 lived.I waited 13+ years to Diablo 3 and, well, we all know what happened there.  I was left without a new ARPG that could scratch that itch. Then stumbled upon Grim Dawn.  It scratched.The visuals are stunning and gritty.  The atmophere is oppressive yet relaxing.  Hit detection is perfect.  Balancing seems on point.  Classes look and feel unique.  Skills are inventive and beautiful to execute.  Loot is expansive. Mechanics are sound.  MP community is wonderful.  Story is awesome.  Etc., Etc., Etc.Serioulsy, if you're like me and haven't been able to find that ARPG that satisfies that craving, this is it.10/10			"

												Think about a post apocalyptic world, but not the usual ""Mad max"" or ""Fallout"" ones. More the ""Diablo won this one"".Take basic archetypes. Mage, Druid, Warrior ... And mix them as you want !Finish the game once. That was tough ? YOU KNOW NOTHING JOHN SNOW !This game truly shines when you start looking at the depth of its gameplay and possibilities. Each dual archetype have multiple builds. Some are very laid back (hello Occultist summoner build, aka ""Pokemon master build"") some are way more active and hard to master. Another big plus ? MODS ! Another thing ? Additional content with free update !Trust me, an anonymous stranger in the crowd. It's a ""Good ol' game like we don't get anymo'e""			"

TITAN QUEST 2.0After 550 hours of playing Grim Dawn, I think it is time to write up my review.So, what is Grim Dawn? The short answer is that it is ""Titan Quest"" 2.0. The long answer is that Grim Dawn is an ARPG from Crate Entertainment. The game takes places in the world of Cairn, where it is basically destroyed by 2 supernatural warring factions (Chthonians & Aetherials). The Chthonians seeks to rid the world of all humans, while the Aetherials seeks to possess the humans and use them for their own gains. You are the survivor of one of those “possessions” and this is where you begin your adventures. The game has some great features (PROS) and not so great features (CONS), which I will be detailing below.In terms of greatness / Pros: 	6 core classes with the ability to select a 2nd class (at level 10) to further customize your character. (various character builds) 	Lots of customization for different playstyles & characters, including the Devotion system. 	Crafting systems is really cool, especially once you start collecting the difference recipes.  	Multiplayer is fun once you get a session started and are in a good group of players. 	Offline play / no “always online"" requirement to play the game. 	Modding Tools. 	Dev updates (aka: Grim Misadventure). 	Dark but beautiful world (dead bodies everywhere).In terms of lackluster/ Cons: 	Multiplayer can be frustrating as the connection can be subpar & some games are laggy. 	Graphic performance is underwhelming in some areas of the game. (i.e. Plains of Strife, where I get ca. 30 fps on a 980ti) 	Melee characters have a harder time, compared to magic / ranged based characters. 	Can get boring running through the same levels with different characters as there are no Pre-Generated levels/dungeons and depending on the player, the end game can be lacking. 	No “secret passage” like in TQ IT ;) This was a secret area in TQ: IT, where the bosses were named after the developers.  I am also aware of Dalia's SUPER SECRET QUEST, but for me it is not the sameConclusionGrim dawn is the spiritual successor to Titan Quest. They took the best of the core elements from TQ and improved upon them while adding new features (i.e. Devotions). In the end it is a worthy buy and I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a great ARPG set in a dark atmosphere.**********************SIDE NOTE: Another aspect, which I find interesting is that the developers have already stated that they are working on a survival mode and there is already an expansion planned for the future. This level of support for the customer is really nice to see and they are continuing with small updated to the game (i.e. patch 1.03 - Devotion changes)			"

												Since the release of Diablo 2, way back in the year 2000, basically every ARPG has been trying to be Diablo 3, yet none have truly succeeded, not even the actual Diablo 3. I'm not going to go so far as to say Grim Dawn is the 'real' Diablo 3, but its the closest an ARPG has come IMO.For starters, Grim Dawn (GD) has just about everything you would expect. Multiple classes, the ability to mix classes, an additional alternate advancement system, lots and lots of loot in different color flavors, and hordes of various enemies and bosses to slay. You can play solo, or with up to 4 others, and you can even enable PvP if you so choose. Perhaps its one outstanding difference is that the maps aren't randomly generated (for the main campaign, you can play custom maps, though I haven't explored that option), which initially felt odd until I just got over it and realized fully hand-crafted maps look better and are more logical than what even a good random generator can do. Will that hold up through multiple playthroughs? Not likely, but I've never been a huge fan of grinding an ARPG over and over again anyway.The graphics are very serviceable. They won't blow you away, but they also don't feel cheap, and there are some nice lighting effects and the overall style is a slightly different take on the traditional fantasy doom world full of zombies and other creatures. Same for the sound, which includes a bit of voice acting; its not top-notch, but once you get into the game you find that it all fits and works well-enough. The game runs well and I've only seen it crash once (on my wife's computers during multiplayer).The pace is good, and main storyline so far has been interesting (mostly told through lore text items you find), and I've liked every area I've seen so far. And since the maps aren't random, they all connect in a logical manner that gives the world of GD a more... worldly feel rather than just randomly connected zones. I think that last part is one of the major reasons I'm really like GD too; it has a better sense of progress as you uncover more of the world and the problems facing it.I also like that you aren't bombarded with abilities. Or rather, you have that option, as its very easy to focus-in on a few abilities that sound interesting and skip others during the leveling process. You can go so far as to only unlock and upgrade your auto-attack and passives/buffs, which means less button pushing but without gimping yourself. Again perhaps more min/maxing is needed at the highest difficulty, but for an initial run, that flexibility is there.GD is also pretty flexible in other areas too. You can undo spent skill points for a small cost, and many skills aren't exclusive to one type of weapon. So for example an auto-attack modifier will work whether you are using a 1h melee weapon or a 2h ranged weapon. That's nice and lets you switch up what gear you are using pretty easily as you find new and better drops. A constant flow of upgrades is a huge key to ARPG enjoyment, and GD nails this.Finally, the game is very co-op friendly. It will auto-party you if you select that option, and loot can also be personal until you drop it, making 'sharing' loot much easier. Simply scoop up all the stuff you see drop, and if you find something you think might be good for your buddy, drop it and they can grab it. Easy, quick, and painless. Quests also update for everyone in the party, so it doesn't matter who landed the last hit or who talked to an NPC. It basically feels like playing the single-player in terms of pace and function, only you also have a buddy running and killing along side you.If you enjoy ARPGs, Grim Dawn really is a must-play.

In the grim dawnness of Crate Entertainments' ARPG, there is only excellence...Grim Dawn has had one of the longest journeys through Early Access, I've been there right from the start, when it was a very rough and ready prototype with the first act, when the frame rate was choppy and the scenery was a little bit flat to say the least. But gods, the core gameplay was satisfying. It scratched the itch that only Diablo 2 and more recently Path of Exile had scratched in a very specific, and pleasing way. Over the intervening timeframe, it has grown, evolved, and refined itself, and matured into this majestic, noble thing. Scalable across a wide variety of systems, able to look beautiful on the very highest of rigs and still managing to look good on systems of modest means whilst maintaining a good framerate, the levelling and class development has grown with six base classes available, and the ability to dual class means that in effect you've the choice of no less than fifteen possible combinations from which to pick your build from. Twenty one if you decide for whatever reason to stick with a purely single class setup (which is eminently possible, but who wants to just go one way these days when you can swing two...). That's not even touching on the brilliantly insane devotion system, which unfolds like something that looked at Path of Exile and went ""You know, we can go one better...""And unlike Diablo 3 and Path of Exile, you can play THIS ARPG entirely offline.Waking to misery, trudging through despair, fighting through bleakness...The backstory of Grim Dawn is suitably black, tinged with plenty of sadness and horror along the way, and the story gets really dark in places, make no mistake, there's bits of the narrative which would serve as excellent nightmare fuel. This is going on for some of the less pleasant bits of Path of Exile, and makes Diablo 3 look like a nice and cheerful jaunt through the land of happy and merry. You -start- by fighting resurrected corpses and the recently raised villagers, sometimes loved ones of the very survivors you're actually trying to help, and things will only get -worse- as you take on demonic beings, aetherials and creatures dragged up from the very depths of whatever plane they saw fit to drag themselves up (or down) from.Despite this, the world manages to retain plenty of detail and colour, even if the overall atmosphere is unremittingly one of a world that has seen the coming of the end of days, and now clings on to existence by its' very fingernails. Villages are forced into fortified structures and natural defensive choke points, clinging to any kind of survival they can scratch out in this new, terrible world, everyone is on edge, and trust is hard to earn. This is particularly the case since you've had the ""good"" fortune to escape your demise by hanging as whatever posessed you decided to take leave, but in turn has left you the ability to create riftgates, these tears in reality are your fast travel around the world, but as it turns out, enabling them can just as readily draw aetherials to your location, a harbinger of what messing with such things might portend.The sweet rhythm of loot...On a mechanical level, the game will be instantly, and comfortingly familiar to anyone who has played Diablo 2 or Path of Exile, and reasonably familiar to anyone who has played Torchlight or any ARPG along these lines in the last five years. You move from place to place, picking up quests, clearing out monsters and champions, collecting escalating piles of loot, slowly building up your hero from a nobby nobody into a churning engine of destruction that can bring havoc upon the battlefield. In this the game works exceptionally well, the combat feels meaty, the skills are well balanced, most classes harmonise together in various ways (even class combos you wouldn't initially expect to work CAN work with the right gear and devotion star signs), and the loot drops at a steady clip. There's always new places to explore, new dungeons to plumb, new points of interest to look at, new shrines to cleanse and new things to -do-. Going back to your character is a bit like settling into a comfy sweater, it's comfort gaming at its' finest, and a great way to sink a few hours if you need a time out from the world. It's terrifyingly addictive and you'll find at every step of the way there's something to hook you in to keep you going just that little bit further, and it's not the skinner box approach, here it's the interest of ""what shiny will I grab next"" or ""what new dungeon will I get to see"" or ""What awesome new boss might I fight?"" or ""What will the story reveal?""This game eats time. It eats it with an appetite that borders on the scary. You'll sit down thinking you might do a quick session, you'll blink and two hours will have elapsed. It's that easy to get into, and it makes it that easy to just settle into a rhythm that is practically hypnotic. Don't play this game if you have deadlines to meet the next day, bad, bad idea.Closing thoughts...Crate Entertainment have finally answered the calls for a true blooded ARPG in the vein of D2 and D2X, a proper old school game that can be played whenever you want, wherever you want, that showers you with insane loot with all kinds of prefixes and suffixes, a game where builds are many and varied, where working out what KIND of Arcanist you want to be might need an A3 sheet of paper just to fit the devotion starmap onto, but would I have it any other way?Absolutely not. This is the ARPG that Diablo 3 wasn't, and Path of Exile, despite being -good-, sadly falls short with the need to be online all the time. This is the one I can take with me wherever I go. This is the one YOU can take wherever you go, that it's thoroughly excellent on top makes this a complete no brainer.Verdict : Essential "

												Ok calling all RPG fans....Grim Dawn was made just for you if you likedDiablo 1 or 2, PreSkyrim Morrowind cycle, Throne of Darkness, Van Helsing, Titan's Quest, or any of their closest kin.The opening plot starts with you being possesed, tortured for inforrmation, and being hung. The hanging exorcises the aetheric infestation (4th dimentional being has no desire to die stuck in your body). Your rope gets shot down and the game starts with you enhanced body being asked if you're willing to redeam yourself and help save a small parcel of humanity. No spoilers there folks, watch the trailer (nicely done).The setting is as if someone took magical Renaissance era Europe added a touch of the old West, a dash of Tesla, and iced it all with some Soloman Kane.GraphicallyYou've got the 3 person top down angle camera view. And well folks... while the detail level isn't bad. This game is dark, grubby, and crumbling in looks. A while one occationally gets to walk through areas like this

more often you'll get dungeons like this and darker

I turned up my brightness. Cause everytime I was in a dark area at night. Even with light enhancing items, it was bloody hard to see. Which is realistic (and can be nice in a horror game) but I personally don't find it fun in a dungeon crawler.Audio 30% of NPCs have voice acting. The rest speak only in text format. The hacks, shots, grunts, ect are worthy; but nothing special. The background music is your typical ignoreable mood enhancer stuff.GameplayNow here's where it gets enjoyable. It's your standard mouse point directional walk, left click attack, right click ect.. with the customizeable 2 layered slots for potions, spells, special attacks, and the permanent spot for your personal rift portal (that your lovely modifed humanity grants you). A great class system and you'll get to choose 2 of them eventually. Then you get you devotional choices once you restore your first shrine (on a nice astrological skill map). Your inventory will expand with some quests. You have a storage chest and the ability to send items to your other characters. You get enhancement bits to add to your items. Once you help the blacksmith, the ability to craft. And if all that seams familar to you (to any core rpg player it should) there's the truth of this game. The developers have taken nearly every well working gameplay aspect from all the games before and used them.This isn't a bad thing even if it's not truly inovative. It's nostalgic without being hokey.There's also multiplayer available.........Overall I really think if you ever enjoyed a 3 person view RPG you should buy this. It's a premium experiance and a excellent dungeon grinder.			"

												I haven't enjoyed an ARPG so much since I summoned my first Clay Golem at level 6.Ya know all those other ARPGs that have come out since then? Each one tweaked Diablo 2 just a little bit, and added or altered stuff, but never really quite hit the preposterously high bar D2 set. They were good games and I enjoyed most of them that I played, (except Torchlight, wasn't a fan for some reason) but they still left me wanting.If you can relate, Grim Dawn is what you've been looking for, its cherrypicked the best systems and ideas of all the recent well-done ARPGS, and basically jammed them back into a reimagining of Diablo 2 with great resultsIts the most worthy among a slew of competitors for the true successor to Diablo 2 (including PoE, D3, Titan Quest:IT, Torchlight 1 & 2)If you feel like this genre had gotten stagnant, like I did, this game will renew your hope.+1-4 player, instanced loot, trade loot, enemy difficulty/loot scaling by player+Atmosphere and feel of Diablo 2, but with guns+Class/level system of Titan Quest+Tons of components, crafting, and enhancements that significantly alter playstyle and can easily alter build path, like Path of Exile+Fantastic character build options+Shoulder slot+Totally needless amount of isntanced loot+good loot variety+good enemy variety+huge enemy groups, frequent enemy heros+fun, satisfying combat+Main quest is decently long, high replayability+reasonably priced=some pretty blatant recreations of Diablo 2 encounters (definitely more of an homage than a copy)=Class-granted skills are varied, but uninspired. (The excellent customzation comes from combining them with various other effects)=Lots of skills that prock on or or are dependent on % chance-per-hit-Environment variety isn't so great, simialr colors and titlesets pretty much the whole time-Summoners can only have one of each summon, no hellhound army builds :(-Storyline is meh. Not terrible, but clearly not its focus "

""Faith is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark.""Grim Dawn is an action role-playing game (rpg) developed by the company Crate Entertainment with emphasis on hack & slash.Atmosphere & presentation:+ Convincing presentation of a bleak world after a post-apocalyptic event.+ Fitting background music enriches the melancholic atmosphere.+ Creative level and monster design with much love for detail.+ Diversified side quests with challenging boss encounters.+ Exploration of the locations and its secrets is awarded with good loot and interesting lore.o General layout and art direction of the game show parallels to its spiritual predecessor Titan Quest.Combat & gameplay:+ Fast-paced gameplay with a very good balance between combat and exploration.+ Elaborate dual skill tree system, known from Titan Quest, allows various class combinations, each of them supporting offensive and defensive playstyles.+ Alternative devotion system, basically a skill tree, adds further depth into character development.+ Well done crafting system gives the player a multitude of customization options, providing useful items and trinkets.+ Faction based bonus item system creates long-term motivation and additional customization possibilities.+ Broad spectrum of enemies with different strengths, weaknesses and unique abilities. + For the masochistic gamers among us, the legendary Hardcore mode is available.o The game follows the traditional concept of increased difficulty levels (normal, epic, ultimate), featuring tougher enemies and better loot.Characters & story:+ Interesting side characters provide the player with entertaining information about the current and past events of the game world.o Solid, slow-paced storytelling.o Limited identification of the player with the protagonist.Summary:Overall, Grim Dawn offers high-quality hack & slash gameplay with solid action rpg mechanics. It's a challange to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into this. Addicitve and awesome all around.Amusing quotes:“I am fully confident that it will function as intended. Well, uh, there may be a slight chance that we will tear apart reality when the artifact is consumed by the conflagration… But chances of that are low. You’re safe. Really.”Trivia:In an earlier version of the game you were able to provoke the avatar of a god. In doing so, he would strike you with a lightning bolt, instantly killing your character in one attack with over 35.000 damage.Achievements:Estimated time for 100% completion: +300 hoursSingleplayer achievements: 80Multiplayer achievements: none			"

Early Access Review
								I actually had low-ish expectations going into Grim Dawn as I'm not the biggest fan of ARPG games, but I've really enjoyed playing this. This game has TONS of loot, many different class combos, exciting combat and a decent story to hold it all together. I picked this up when it was 50% off, but I would have still been happy having paid full price of $25 as there is a LOT of content here.This game is still in Early Access (full game due around Q1 '16) but you wouldn't know it while playing. The dev's have focused on releasing one act at a time, and releasing quality content instead of a full game of bugs and glitches. I've played now for about 40 hours and haven't encountered a single bug, which is quite impressive. The only negative I could think of is the frame rate gets a little choppy at times, but I'm guessing this is just an optimisation thing, which will no doubt happen before launch.In short: Great game and really good value considering the content within and the asking price. I totally recommend this to all ARPG fans or just RPG fans in general.			"

												It's like the creators went to the salvage yard, found the old and rusted remains of Diablo II, Titan Quest, and Fallout and thought ""Hey, I remember these. You know what, I bet we could make something out of them."" So they hauled them back to the work shed, where they were carefully looked over and disassembled, then they began to draft new designs and tinker with the parts. As time passed, what began as sort of a hobby turned into a real undertaking. And then a work of passion. Now, 6 years later, we are looking at the end result of that work, all new paint, polished up and ready to drive. So was the wait worth it? Hell yes it was. This game is a masterpiece. If you're a fan of ARPG's and don't have this yet. Buy it.Thank you Crate Entertainment. You have given us something truly special.			"

Grim DawnIm just having a blast with this game, I wish I had bought this game sooner none the less Its still worth every penny in my book. Seeing some friends playing it made me want to also delv in and enjoy the game, and that I most certainly am.The maps are huge, there are tons and tons of quests to aquire and complete as you play through, the lands are massive and beautifully detailed compared to what I have played in the past. There is stacks of items to pick up, crafting, and alsorts of stuff to do in this game, so much so Im so lost with it all. I mostly just equipt the best weapons and items  checking the stats then sell the rest, so I can stock up on health and energy vials. You can also store your items in storage places in the towns as wellYou get to make rifts (portals), but only 1 at a time, so I use this when out exploring hacking & slashing away while having fun, so if I die I can warp back to where I was or nearing a mission and OR a Boss fight. When you die you will loose your experiance points, so make sure you go back to your grave marked with a skull to reclaim them. At times I could not do this as I lost my place and or was a dare devil and ran through the green stuff, dont run through long paths of green stuff ok, try find a way round.  There are also pets you can earn to help you, I have 2 plus a pet that spawns on his own, dont ask me how I got them, I have no idea, but I have them now. Maybe thats why Im slower at leveling up in the game, because Im sharing my points I earn around to my pets, as they not strong yet. But they do help me out, I love my pets :)  Anyway there is just to much to explain with this game, and I cant possiblly explain it all, nor word it all appropriately. I just wanted to share that I am having a blast with this game, its addictive but only if its your kinda game. I will continue to play this game and hope I can finish it as well. Who needs more games ?, I now have Grim Dawn :)  Price wise to me its worth the full price, BUT if your patient wait for another sale, this game does not disapoint.;)  Just for the record, game plays great with the Xbox controller, but was a pain to work out how to get it all set up. I managed and I now play this with my Xbox controller :)  This is the set up guide for the Xbox controller, a friend was happy for me to share on my review for anyone looking for help in setting the Xbox controller up. Thank you @powbam for the guide and letting me share it as well http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=34072 "

								Disclaimer, This is my first review.First and foremost, I was highly skeptical about this game before I bought it. I saw it and thought ""Re-skin of Titan Quest."" I am happy to see the spirit of TQ perserved while establishing itself as it's own Intellectual Property and its take on Action Role Playing Games. I was let down by the charactor creation (I spend a lot of time on charactor creation in games like Saints Row 3, 4 and Skyrim etc) and thusly wasn't able to creat a persona that felt like mine. However I've come to expect this from ARPGs so I wasn't to let down.  After playing Diablo 3 from launch and being terribly dissapointed by it's lacklustre story I was impressed by how fast I took to the setting and story being told here. In a nutshell you are a ""Taken"" and about to be hung. Once the game began I noticed zombies assaulting the town and was actually excited to get into the swing of things. 5 hours later, my wife is giving me the stare and the fog clears. This is the first ARPG to legit suck me into the zone. Story wise there are genuine choices to be had and content ""can be skipped"" (Zones have a minimum monster level however).Gameplay wise I've only played as a Demolistionist/Occultist but the skills are rewarding and the weapons have an oomph. One gripe i have is being unable to undo mastery points (Something I learned a little late) full on respecs should be a thing.Graphically the game looks well, the setting and the monsters fit in and match the games tone. I highly suggest this game to any ARPG lover.			"

												I love this game, its so addictive and I really enjoy farming there. But there is one issue and I'm stuck here.  I have a 85 lvl character and my attribute points were always oriented mostly on cunning. Now I realised that i need to change them on physique, but there is only one way to do it and it's that trainer program.  So please, add an option so players can reset attributes as well.			"

												I wanted to write my review when my Hardcore character dies, but he's still going strong and I'm about to reach the max level. Anyways, this game has all the best elements of an old-school aRPG game, with some new mechanics to keep it fresh. The environment is interesting, the classes are fairly archetypal but with a nice spin, and the hunt for loot keeps me excited. I liked the story, it kept me immersed and was my main incentive to finish the game. The graphics are very good - not amazing, but authentic for the type of game. Not cartoonish at all. The pace is great and there's enough play diversity to offer plenty of replayability. It's a great mix of challenge and depth - this game was obviously made with a lot of love!

								This is a damn fine ARPG that doesn't insult your intelligence. Every skill, class combination, and item has value. The Devs have so far avoided micromanaging the number of viable builds down to one per class like other ARPGS (looking at you D3). There's no always-online nonsense to deal with so you can actually play the single-player mode of the game you spent legal tender on without connecting to some corporations' server bank. There is no trade restrictions barring certain augments, which can be stripped beforehand to allow that item to be traded again.Combat isn't too flashy, which is good because the screen isn't filled with so much♥♥♥♥♥♥you can't see what the enemy is doing so you can avoid it. Skills can still be visually impressive but without the Michael Bay special effects barrage so common to latter-day ARPGs. It fits the artistic and narrative theme of the game while still letting your skills feel impactful but not so overwhelmingly powerful that you can't imagine why anyone would have died to the enemy in the first place. It just FEELS right.Furthermore, the story presented in Grim Dawn is actually quite compelling especially if you take the time to read through the dialogue and pick up all the scraps of paper left behind out in the world. There is genuine tension in the story as you piece together what happened to Cairn, and how you can help save it. Speaking of which, the world here feels connected and alive, without immersion-breaking nonsense like the copy/paste hero squads with yellow auras just in case you were too stupid to notice them or randomly-generated terrain that looks like someone emptied a jigsaw puzzle onto the table and scrambled the pieces up. There is even a legit lore reason why you are the only person who can control the teleporters too.All in all if you like ARPGs this game is worth every single cent of the asking price.			"

												TL;DR-  Grim Dawn is a fantastic game with an immense amount of depth that might intimidate casual players... if it weren't so Dag Nabbed fun and hooking right out of f***ing box when you fire it up.I've been playing since I believe March or May 2013ish... TBH, this game is the whole reason I initially downloaded Steam. For awhile, I wasn't a big fan of the whole Steam idea. Now it's a part of life. Strange how things work out. Anyway, deciding I should actually start supporting these talented small teams early instead of just crossing my fingers like I did with GGG, I backed Crate pretty heavily on Kickstarter (for me at least) and had to install Steam to test their Alpha releases. My opinion has, of course, wavered throughout the last few years. At the finish line, I can assure you that this is a top-notch aRPG that belongs in ANYONE's arsenal who claims to be a fan of the genre. My pet-peave at the moment is that with it's stellar reviews on big-name sites such as ign and such it is of course getting the indoctrinal ""which is better"" treatment.Grim Dawn is it's own beast. Path of Exile is my social aRPG. I play it for teamwork. I play it for that economical atmostphere. Sure, it still has a great single player feel. It's just a little more casual in that regard. And hey, if you're not a PoE fan, I can totally appreciate that. It's not for everyone. I just mention it here because the comparison between the two seems constant lately, and I happen to very much like the title and respect both GGG and Crate highly for their work ethic regardless(note to readers, I play PoE almost exclusively OFF steam, so my time logged is not correct, because I did not have steam yet when I started the game).Grim dawn is a more serious single player aRPG. I play it for those serious solo-theorycrafting craves I get sometimes. Sure, it has multiplayer, and it's great with friends. It's just more casual in that regard and wasn't really designed around it. It also will have amazing modding capabilities that PoE will never have (see below).Comparing the two games is really an easy thing to do since they're in the same genre, so I understand why all the youtubers do it, but it's actually unfair, get it? In reality, both games are not at odds for our attention at all, but actually are different enough to work in concert together. Basically what I'm saying is, I'm a fan of both. if you're a fan of one, it shouldn't mean you shouldn't be a fan of the other. Especially in what I'm convinced is the Golden Age of Action RPG's where a game like Grim DAwn can offer so much depth/complexity for half the price of what I paid for that disappointing night out with my GF to see Nolan's ""Interstellar.""***********************************************If you are wondering why I left out Diablo 3: Reaper of $ouls, it's because I'm only considering Professional Titles, not amateur ones.***********************************************-WHY 50% OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT ""HACKING PROBLEMS"" ARE WRITTEN BY IDIOTS-It's important to understand that there is no  Online Warden in this game like in Diablo 3 or Path of Exile and that seems to be upsetting a lot of people. It is the reason for 50% of the ""Negative Reviews"" you see above. Those people are ignorant, and let me explain why:Crate never wanted the game to be server-side. See, when they made TQ clientside last decade, they discovered something HUGE... that we as a community... are fricking amazing at supporting games we love. We took TQ and we 1. Patched it2. Fixed it even more3. Improved it4. Added voice overs5. Translated it into foreign languages like... I dunno Samarian & Klingon probably [chk source]6. New Mechanics7. More DLCs8. Even more DLCs9. User Tools for more fun10. ENTIRELY NEW SEQUELS11. ""HOLY F***, GUYS, SOMEONE JUST RECREATED DIABLO 2: LOD ON OUR GAME ENGINE!!! WE ARE NEVER EVER EVER MAKING A GAME SERVER-SIDE AGAIN. IN FACT, THAT GAME WE'RE WORKING ON NOW? GRIM DAWN IS IT? LET'S JUST RELEASE THE GAME WITH ALL THE TOOLS WE USED TO CREATE THE DARN THING TOO TO THEM. OUR FANS ARE AWESOME!!!""--This is the reason for 50% of the negative reviews. Because Clientside unfortunately means that, if you WANT TO, it's also really easy to cheat and have any item. Other great aRPGs use clientside too. Torchlight 2 does as well. The point is, who cares? Don't not buy an amazing aRPG in the Golden Era of Action RPGs simply because your friend MIGHT not have actually found his ""Sword of a Thousand Truths."" Get a new friend, I dunno.  You're getting an amazing game for $25. And if history with TQ taught us anything. In the next couple years. Us fans are gonna give you a few more amazing games for free with this engine too. FREE... provided you have purchased the GD engine, of course ;-)Lostman-			"

								I have one rule when it comes to games:  for every dollar I spend, there had better be at least one hour of enjoyment.  I can't tell you how many games I own that can't even live up to that very simple rule, and some of the worst offenders come from this current plague of ""Early Access"" games.This is the exception.  I've only put 8 hours into Grim Dawn thusfar, but I can already tell that I have many more ahead.  This is exactly what Early Access should be - an incomplete game that benefits greatly from the community involvement.  Grim Dawn isn't some barely stable trash that some useless studio decided to throw on Steam, it is a solid title with all of the meat and seasoning ready to go and all the developer needs now is, ""how would you like it cooked?""Get this game.  If you like anything about Diablo-esque games, you owe it to yourself and the gaming community to support the development of this title.			"

								Design.  That I feel is the key with Grim Dawn.  I wont go over the mechanics and options as they're fairly well covered here already, but I will discuss why I hope Grim Dawn is a big success.In something that seems increasingly rare these days, Crate have focused on making a quality product with solid design and a clear target audience, at the expense of 'mass market appeal.'A game not rushed, not relying on cheap tricks or addictive gimmicks, DRM free, moddable, with great communication from the dev team and attention to detail and feedback.Their approach should be rewarded, their integrity and honesty applauded.  This may all seem a bit 'fan-boyish' but the example they set here should be supported and encouraged.Will it be perfect at release?  No, I'm sure there will be balance issues as the wider customer base test out the limits of builds, but that's of secondary concern in a game where the focus is on playing through the content, not pushing leaderboards.  The end-game is limited, but you're missing the point a little if you're rushing to get there ;)			"

								Grim Dawn is what ""ARPGs"" are supposed to be. It's difficult - nee impossible - to write a review of Grim Dawn without comparing it to other, existing ARPGs. So rather than dance around it, I'll just do it: Grim Dawn is better than most. I'll compare it to games you might have already played. * It's harder than Diablo III, and has more punishing monster abilities that require more attention. * It's less punishing tha Path of Exile, with more focus on attack skills that make the game fun (rather than defensive skills that make you run around). * Similar to Titan Quest, you pick two paths and combine them into a unique gameplay style. And, similar to Titan Quest, you can seriously gimp yourself by picking two fundamentally incompatible paths.* The world is static, with loads of side quests if you want to do them, like Sacred 2. Unlike Sacred 2, the world remains interesting and isn't as generically massive. Fewer enemies have cheap tricks to one-shot you.I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said... this is an excellent game. I've tried many different characters and only found a few completely gimped builds (summoning is, as always, not balanced yet). I can't believe this is still in Early Access and it's already so good.			"

												Grim Dawn is the spiritual successor to Titan Quest, an ARPG set in Greek Mythology, only this time it is an original setting with an original story.  The game begins as you awaken from a hanging.  Your crime: being corrupted by Aetherial energy.  Coming under the influence of this energy gives the gift of superhuman abilities (aka the skill tree), but can also turn you into a shambling undead.  You are sent to investigate this Aetherial energy in a nearby cave to win the influence of the town that tried to hang you, and the story carries on from there.  There are 6 different classes in the game: Soldier, focusing on physical, bleed, and internal trauma damages with a focus on defensive shield-use; Shaman, a two-handed weapon focused character that deals a combination of lightning, bleed, and retaliation damage with defensive life leech and regeneration abilities, and can also summon a briarthorn beast; Nightblade, a very offensively minded melee dual wield character with a cold, pierce, and poison/acid damage focus, and can also benefit from guns or crossbows; Arcanist, the spell-caster with a bevy of elemental skills but is very strong with fire and aether damage, and uses damage reflection and damage mitigation sphere skills for defense; Occultist, a summoner focused caster strong with chaos, vitality, fire and poison/acid damage that uses a combination of acid retaliation and life leech for defense; and finally Demolitionist, a bomb tossing, trap throwing gun toting pyromaniac using mostly fire and lightning damage and uses a variety of stuns, blinds and fumbling attacks for defense.You pick your first class on your first level up, with the ability to pick a second class at level 10. It is highly recommended to do so as each class has multiple synergies with another and leveling up two skill trees instead of one provides you with more character stats: PHYSIQUE, CUNNING, and SPIRIT. Physique regulates your hit points and ability to wear heavy armor. Cunning regulates your pierce and bleed damage as well as chance to hit and critical chance. Spirit regulates your mana pool, and elemental damage.Another important part of your character is the Devotion map.  Throughout the game there are shrines that require certain craftable materials in order to restore them. Restoring a shrine gives you a devotion point.  On the devotion screen are many constellations, each a cluster of connected devotion points that provide themed skills and abilities.  Some of the skills gained from the completion of a constellation can be attached to a skill on your skill tree, making it more powerful.  It adds another satisfying layer of complexity to your character, and is absolutely necessary to master in order to tackle the harder difficulties.Crafting is very deep and involved.  At around character level 15 you recieve a quest to recruit a blacksmith. There are two different blacksmiths to pick from, one is stronger for magic based characters, the other for physical damage characters.  This blacksmith can make either a random magic weapon armor for you or you can find rare and unique recipes dropped by monsters.  The ingredients for these recipies are also dropped by monsters. The ingredients can also be infused into weapons to give them different stats and abilities.There is also a faction system.  Defeating certain types of enemies raises your influence with the 5 or 6 different factions in the game. Different levels of influence allow you to buy different tiers of equipment from faction vendors. It should also be noted that defeating enemies also lowers their standing with you, and you can even become so hated that special super unique enemies can spawn from that group of enemies, and hunt you down.Combat is very visceral and satisfying.  Critical attacks shake the screen and send send your enemies flying.  All skills have a unique animation and are very fun to use.  There are 4 Acts and 3 difficulties.  The max character level is 85.  I've been playing the game since build 15 and every build since then to the release and beyond has drastically improved the game.  I highly recommend this awesome ARPG. Editing for the badgerino.			"

												This might be the best value for any game I've ever purchased. I got it on sale for 15$, but after putting 200+ hours into it, I can say it is easily worth double or triple that. The only ARPG's I've played that can compare to Grim Dawn are D2, D3 and PoE. I'm not trying to debate which is better, but those 3 are universally recognized as 3 of the top ARPG's in the last 10 years. The only knock against grim dawn is that the multiplayer is a bit weak. This is a game meant to be played in single player, but has some multiplayer capabilities. It's not horrible multiplayer, but I wouldn't describe it as a MP game.There is what they call a dual class system. You have a skill tree for your main class and then at level 10 you can invest into a second class or put everything into 1 tree, whichever you prefer. There are multiple viable builds and tons of loot. Another negative could be that there is too much garbage loot, but still this is knit picking. For those ARPG veterans the game can feel easy until you have beat it once at which point it gets a bit harder. The objective is to beat it 3 times all the way thru, the 3rd time is pretty damn tough. It doesn't feel boring going thru it 3 times because various things carry over each time, you will also spot new areas you missed or couldn't unlock the first time thru. The DLC out is also really fun. It's basically a never ending mode of constant waves. Every 10 waves you can either leave and take your reward or keep going and risk it for a higher reward. If you even remotely like Action-RPGs then this is a must have title. If this game came from a well known company it would easily be selling for 2-3 times more. I know it might not look that great in the photos and all. That's what held me back for a while, but this is definitely one of the better games I've ever played.			"

												Grim Dawn is one of the best ARPG. You can make a variety of builds like pet army, magic caster, dual blade/gunslinger, or even a tanky afk build. 15 class combinations from 6 bases with over 25 skills per class, excluding lots of skills from devotion system and items.If you had difficulties with the game early on, there's a ton of guides or shared characters for testing purpose from Grim Dawn forums[grimdawn.com] (always backup your save files first). Sometimes you'll find a fun build that's yet to discover.If you like Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight, or Titan Quest, this game will suits you.			"

								A wonderfully crafted Action RPG, by the makers of Titans Quest. The game has a very nice look to it and the gameplay is just a blast, tons to do and it feels like a dark fantasy version of Titans Quest, made with love and devotion. If you are looking for a arpg to play by yourself or with a friend, pick this up asap. It just got to 100% CONTENT COMPLETE today, so now is a perfect time to hop in and enjoy some Grim Dawn!These devs love the games they make, you can see that right away by playing Titan Quest or Grim Dawn, so much effort and love has gone into these games. There is a ton of content and it was really cool seeing this game get made along the way. Grim Dawn now joins Pillars of Eternity, Divinity Original Sin, Shadowrun Hong Kong and Wasteland 2 in the old school rpg resurgence we have had over the past few years.If you want an action rpg that has the atmosphere of say Diablo 2 but the gameplay and unique feel of Titans Quest, this game is for you! Tons of cool items to loot, a bunch of awesome characters to pick from and music that hits the soul.Now go get a friend and get ready to slaughter some baddies, explore a gorgeous and messed up game world! Grim Dawn is waiting for you and what awaits is a ton of fun! If I had 3 thumbs up I would give this 3 thumbs :)Having played about 20 hours of the full content version now, I must say thing game is even better. The huge variety of enemies and landscapes is unmatched in action rpg's, so much variety with everything!  The look and feel of every new area and all the new monsters/items is unreal. Grab a friend a get ready to party! I have been pretty worn out on action rpgs lately but I am loving this!			"

												That was a great game. Arguably one of the greatest ARPG's ever. The graphics were super cool, the story was interesting and at times intense, the action itself was seamless, the upgrade system was super deep and yet accessible. You could play this game countless different ways and have a great time. I put right around 40 hours into the campaign playing solo before finishing it, and after I was done, there was still another area at the top of the map to unlock, and probably 3 or 4 that I missed besides that. There is also an area called The steps of Torment which will challenge any hardened players, and that area features roguelike qualities. This game carries a lot of obvious influences as well, from Diablo 2 to Torchlight to even Dark Souls, and wears them well, while still managing to create it's own distinct personality.I'm thinking that I can still easily put in another 15 or so hours solo before I'm just grinding loot or decide to change difficulties. The game also leaves definite room for a sequel and/or expansion, and really, this is a game world that could persist for a long time. There were things said via notes in the game that absolutely open up other potential story arcs. The Aetherial Betrayer, Ulgrim, and quite a few others.So, some cool features of the game: you can dual class, and it changes your actual class if you do so. For example, I played an Occultist/Arcanist, which made me a Warlock. The upgrade system for the actual classes is broad enough to give you a lot of variety, but condensed enough that you wont feel overwhelmed. However, there is a second upgrade system that you get points for simply by cleansing shrines, and that my friends is as expansive an upgrade system as I have seen in a game. You could spend a while reading through all of them, and then you still have to decide what will best suit your play style. They are set up as constellations, and there are a lot of them! It can seem daunting, but actually, I dont think there are really any wrong choices, although some will obviously suit your preferred playstyle better than others, and a lot of them only unlock after unlocking constellations closer to the center, where you basically choose your upgrade arc. That was quite impressive and again, lends itself to a lot of experimentation. There is a respec NPC in the game, but I never actually made use of it, so I cant say how that works.Also, some merchants will only sell you stuff after you have gotten your town or faction disposition maxed out, and they of course have the best items, lol. You can sell to them, but I personally didnt max out any factions yet, so I havent been able to purchase those super cool items. You can also craft items via another type of NPC, and that system is also pretty deep. You can craft all the basic stuff, but you have to find blueprints to craft anything truly spectacular. Items also have one slot for gem/material upgrades, and the gems/materials can be made stronger by fusing as many as 4 of the same type together. This will often unlock a special ability like casting fireballs or gaining Aetherial defense, slams, and so on.There is actually a ton more to this game, but I think I will leave off for now and maybe revise this once I finish the map, play through higher difficulties, and/or play through this in co-op mode.I cant really find much in the way of flaws in this game, so I'm maxing out this skill tree with a 10 out of 10.

								Honestly? This is what Diablo 3 should have been. Crate Entertainment delivers a spirital successor to the magnificent legacy of Diablo 2 - with a blend-in of popular features from Titan Quest (they even had a designer from the former Diablo 2 team join them recently & Crate themselves consist of many of the old devs behind Titan Quest).Even the game being in early access (as of when this review was written) it already has kept me occupied for around 100 hours and there's still so much to do.Pros+ Rich storyline.+ Beautifully crafted environments!+ Choices matter - for example killing or saving a person will have different consequences, adding to replayability.+ Six classes to chose from & being able to combine two classes if you wish, broadening your versatility.+ Easy to respecc skills, allowing lots of experimentation.+ Addicting reputation-system (similar to WoW). Also enemy factions will spawn more bosses/heroes to fight you the more they hate you - while friendly factions unlock rewards, additional quests & even dungeons!+ Nemesis bosses! Once you've maxed negative reputation with an enemy faction, legendary bosses/heroes will hunt you out in the wild! Some of the strongest in-game! Run!+ Modding-friendly! Toolset to be released after the game is finished.+ Expansions/dlc planned! Bring on more content! My money awaits!+ Multiplayer/Coop-friendly (unless you play with awful connections, then you might experience desyncs/lagspikes).Cons- No character customization.- No hide helmet toggle (for the occasional ugly helmet).- Soundtrack does not seem complete (hopefully more songs are planned), too few tracks replaying over and over again.- More epic item variety would be nice, but I assume this will be added before the final release. Gief more content!! Now!Summary: If you loved Diablo 2 or Titan Quest, getting Grim Dawn is a no-brainer. Expect hundreds of hours of gameplay!Game is planned to be released at the end of 2015.			"

												Great game, encourages restarting and trying new builds, hearkens back to the old d1/d2 days.Pros:-Many varied build opportunities and it is fun to try things out-Fairly long level curve, love the journey not the destination-Great atmosphere-Lots of different modifiers on itemsCons:-Story ends a bit abruptly-End game has minimal randomization-A lot of the game will be played with 1-2 skills until you get to a higher level (for passive type builds)-You don't often seem to pass the power curve, that is, you never seem to completely destroy level relative enemies-Hard to determine what builds will work out due to huge number of modifiers and engame equipment (but not necessarily a con specifically to this game)I detailed the cons a bit more because these are really the only things I can pick out that become more glaring after spending some time with the game. This game is worth playing. Period.			"

Early Access Review
								In the summer of 2000, a new era in video gaming dawned.Diablo 2 was launched. Blizzard was in their prime.The game was excellent and a year later they improved on an already polished product with the release of Lord of Destruction.Video gaming was never the same.Since then we have had many attempts on carrying the flame of D2:LoD.Torchlight honorably carried on the genre the best it could.And when D3 was announced, I got aboard the hype train and rode it to it's fiery crash.It wasn't D2:LoD. It didn't feel like a successor.Disappointment was rife. Later that same year, Torchlight 2 released.The balance in the genre was secured. The gameplay was solid, if not a tad too fast-paced.But with the disappointment that was D3, I greedily ate up all it had to offer.And now, we are here.There's a new dawn in this genre.It is a Grim Dawn.And grim has never been so good before.I do not want to give the impression that this game merely plays off the nostalgia from franchises before.Those at Crate Entertainment picked up the baton from other games and ran off in their own direction.The influence is clearly there and is masterfully done. But, being an early access game, they could take feedback from the community of players, and mold it into something we've always wanted.Another game to take the mantle of D2:LoD, and raise it to new heights.Cheers, Crate Entertainment and all of your employees.You have done something great here, and I thank you.

												My first review ever and English is not my native language so please bear with me.Grim Dawn is an awesome arpg that takes place in a fictional world. The game provides fast and smooth gameplay with intriguing lore to uncover. The game looks dark and grim which I found very appealing compared to the cartoony look other games may have. There’s enough diversity in the different area’s to explore. Some areas are looking absolutely gorgeous. Most of the game is hand-crafted  with some randomization. There a plenty of different enemies to fight against providing enough verity and challenge. Sometimes you have to prioritize to kill a certain enemy otherwise things may get really tough. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG), which means that an enemy could have an epic weapon or armor equipped that you can see him wearing. So kill him and he will drop that item, however if he might be tougher to fight against as the item can grant them more power than usual.You can play this game single-player or multi-player with a party up to a max of 4 people. There are currently 6 classes which are called masteries in the game. They each have their own unique skills. When you reach level 2 you can choose a mastery to start with and at level 10 you can choose a 2nd mastery if you want. This way it provides enough build diversity for your taste. Melee or ranged and a mix of both it’s all up to you to choose. You can use 1 handed weapons and shields, 2 handed weapons, dual wield, pistols, scepters, focus and pets (summons). So you are not bound to a few skills you can choose from. Items like armor, components , relics, etcetera could also grant extra skills to use. And let’s not forget about Devotion, thought out the game you can find Devotion Shrines to restore, which grants you loot and a Devotion point on which you can invest in the Devotion Window providing more stats and skills to customize your build. You can use any item you want just as long as you meet the required stats for it. You can reassign skill- and devotion points but not mastery- and attribute points.There’s plenty of loot in this game which can be obtained from enemies, chest, bought at a vendor or you can craft items. Blueprints can be found to craft different items at the blacksmith.I like the faction system on where you have hostile factions with increased negative reputation against them, brings increased enemy spawn additional monster spawns, increased Hero spawns and, upon reaching Nemesis status, Nemesis spawns. With friendly factions, increased reputation unlocks access to the bounty table. There you can do small quest for a gaining faster reputation with that faction and that unlocks more items at the faction vendor.I love it  that certain quest can change the appearance a little bit of a refugee area. Bringing more survivors there and a cosmetic change. There are also quests that brings choice and consequence to your decisions. So the outcome for that quest could influence a small area.The lore is great for those who are interested in that like me. You can find notes in the game that provide more information about certain events. But also by talking to npc’s and reading the description in the devotion windows. There’s no magic arrow that points you into the right direction for a quest, only when your nearby you will see a star on the mini map that your close. Personally i think this is a big plus, i love to explore and find the area myself it’s way more immersive.There are enough options in the game to change the camera angle zoom in and out. You can set the loot filter to only show magic items, so that your screen isn’t cluttered with loot.Secret areas who doesn’t like them, i always have the urge to explore everything. Some secret areas are small others are larger. You can find them by breaking a wall or perhaps a hidden path to reach it. Explore and you shall be rewarded because there are plenty of secret areas to uncover.Small things that matter like kicking in doors or at barrels, destructible objects like furniture walls that collapse. Weather changing effect that make the area darker with a bit or rain or just a sunny day. Enemies of different factions fighting each other.Challenge dungeons  that provide a real challenge, where if you die you have to restart the game to start a new session. That means you have to redo the dungeon to get to the end. I play softcore so i won’t lose my character but still have the excitement of trying to survive and not to get killed.Modding tools are released, so expect the community to create their own content, items, classes and even entire worlds.The developers are very passionate about the making the game, since the Kickstarter the game has grown bigger and better with more features than they originally planned. There is even a free content update coming out soon!Some very useful links besides YouTube and Twitch:To find out more about the game i highly suggest to the a look at the official game guide at: http://www.grimdawn.com/game.phpWant to take a look at the masteries and the skills and plan your build than take a look here: http://grimcalc.com/.Want to know more about the items than you certainly want to take a look here: http://gracefuldusk.appspot.com/ "

Early Access Review
								An early access review for an early access game. This review is based on a playthrough of one character to level 25ish, partly played alone and partly played with a friend.Things to Expect: Action Role-Playing Games tend to lack role-play options that actually relate to game-play. Such situations do occur in this game, and can decidedly change your experience or even what equipment you can gain. Progression trees that do not exactly guide you in their use, but most of the level up choices you make can be undone to repair mistakes or to optimize. Crafters are decidedly useful, as they will always create at-level gear you can use for the same amount of materials (so far.) Gritty world, gritty characters, and a dark atmosphere. It is not exactly bland, but it's not exactly pretty. You can only duel-wield pistols if equipped with a specifc item. Damage can be sudden and it is hard to determine where it comes from or what causes it due to all the graphics and effects.Opinions:Kill, loot, rinse, repeat. You're a dude or lady that was nearly hung for being possessed, but was spared because of context. And now a gathering of NPCs look at you with hope/despair in wondering if you can save them from the end of the world. Which already happened, but they hope you won't make it worse. Given I've not personally completed the story, I cannot give a nay or yay regarding it.I can state that it does set the post-apocolypse in semi-fantasy land well. Everyone looks unclean and filthy, and your equipment is no exception. None of your equipment shines or glows, or looks elegant. It is rough or practical looking, and portays the scavenger look as you are picking up fantasy pieces in fantasy land. Most of the land is in ruins, garbage strewn about is a constant land image.The music is there, and serves its purpose but is lost under combat noise. I've not heard a track I would listen to outside of the game, but I've not had a reason to turn the music off.Playing as the Soldier class, 1 of 5 classes available currently (six planned), I have not felt the need to dual class. Though I played on Veteran difficulty, and was underleveled for the first boss, I managed to defeat them by myself with the skills I invested in and resources I earned/purchased. Healing potions did not ensure my victory, and I definately needed them. From my perspective, devoting time to gaining levels to match the boss or finding more appropriate equipment to defend myself would have made the battle easier. But ultimately, like all ARPGs of this sort, it comes down to loot/equipment.Loot in the game is not generous, but it is not lack luster. While my luck may just be poor, and I keep finding high qualities items that would better suit other classes, the pieces that I do find I have yet to replace. Add onto the componant items that can be collected and combined to impart even greater bonuses, which can be placed onto equipment to ensure their longevity, means there are always options to improve gear.In multiplayer, loot can be set to personal or shared. With personal loot, all loot seen by you is yours.There are tools within the game to help you determine what gear you need, though I personally find it hard to track incoming damage. It is hard to determine what enemies will attack what sort of defence immediately, and for me it was always trial by fire. And gear is not immediately available to immediately counter enemy attacks, it all has to be earned with time.But that's the point of these kinds of games: repeatedly charge into dungeons to find better and better gear, for multiple situtaions. And, to the games great credit, their NPC crafters are not simple gamble-based machines. Despite the random statisics on the items, they will always make gear that is at least at your character's level.One major complaint I have to make is the text box for NPC interaction is small, and that makes reading hard to do.Conclusion:I have not seen all of the game yet, but what I've played I have enjoyed. It is a game that asks the player to micromanage their gear to fit their needs, but allows them headstrong acts of determination to push through challenges at the cost of resources. Character customization benefits from augment gear, to dual classing for combining skill sets, to a mostly passive bonus system gained from exploring and slaying monsters.The game's look works. It does not strain the eyes, and sets the mood it intended to set. While more color would be appreciated, what I have seen I've not been distracted (beyond all the literal garbage. Loads of trash in places! Fantasy kingdom lacks littering laws.)The story is there, and while not bad it can be overlooked. This may be a dangerous thing, however, as a choice made in the first portion of the game drastically changes the loot available to you. And the game does not give you the luxury of making that choice's importance to you apparant. Squint your eyes to read that text, because it may make your adventure all the easier.This is a solid enty into the ARPG library. Not too easy, not unforgiving, but demands you pay attention.			"

Early Access Review
								Five hours into Grim Dawn and my Witchblade is happily swinging around a pipe with gears attached to the end of it with both hands after applying some parts that make it do poison damage. With his little buddy Raven flying behind him, shooting electricity out of his eye balls, my Wicthblade is demolishing every foe he encounters, waves at a time. And just when I think this may be too easy, I hit a boss level monster that makes me start quaffing the few potions I have. I finally crush the boss monster's head like a grape with my two-handed ""mace"" and get the loot. All is right with the world.I have a few Early Access titles in my game list, but Grim Dawn is by far the most polished one I have played. Heck, I've played big production titles that don't work this well (I'm looking at you, ""Rise of the Argonauts"").Add this to the fact that I played Diablo and liked it. Played D2 and liked it. Played Titan Quest and loved it, and add that I tend to enjoy apocalyptic game settings and that makes Grim Dawn something that will not be uninstalled for a very long time.For an ARPG, the writting is superb. The letters and dialoge are on par with what you would expect from a classic western RPG.I cannot reccomend this title enough, and although I am nowhere near being done playing this game I have to wonder with a benchmark being set this high: what will Crate do next?I am excited for the future.

Early Access Review
								I love H&S games. I played it only about 40 hours in EA because I don´t wanted to spoiler myself.After release I will change my home to a vault with plenty food and I will play this game til the Dawn of the Apes.Short: Best H&S gameProsHuge world to exploreGreat SoundtrackDual Class SystemItemizationQuests with choices and little consequenes like Dragon AgeNice challenges like roquelike dungeonConsMultiplayer still needs some polish.I am a guy who loves hack&slay games. I played nearly every H&S Game the last decade and my biggest disappointment was Diablo 3. It is not a bad game but it was not the sequel I was hopping for. The biggest issue D3 has is its degree of difficulty. D3 is less about skills. It´s about the equipment you carry. Then there is the repetition of all the dialoges in the game which makes me feel like I am in a limbo. Last but not least: D3 is not very complex. You walk a straight path-there is nothing to explore, you have some skills you are using depending on your equipment and thats it!Yes I know. Many H&S games are like that but I wanted more. Lets talk about Grim Dawn. It´s somekind of a sequel of Titan Quest (TQ). Back in the days TQ was having the best combat feeling beside Diablo 2. You were able to play a multiclass character which made the game very interesting for people who loves customization.Grim Dawn took all the good stuff from Titan Quest and enhanced it to a new level.GD is one of the few gems who deserve the titel ARPG.You have a huge world to explore. There are secret passages, hidden chests with epic items, pathes you have to unlock, breakable walls, shrines which gives you permanent buffs..There are quests where you have to take a choice. Later in the game you will see the consequences of your choice. There are many factions you can join. Its like in World of Warcraft. Each faction give you different benefits and quests.The combat is really awesome. It´s not as fast like Torchlight 2 but at least its nearly as good as Diablo 3.There are some interesting skills for multiplayer and because of the multiclass system there are a lot of skillsets you can try out. In one point GD surpasses the other games: You really have to use the environment to survive. You can take cover behind walls against enemy archers or you can use narrow ways to avoid to get flanked or surrounded by enemies. Some enemies are shooting in an arc or from the sky so you should take cover under a fabric.Lets talk about the music. It is one of the best fantasy soundtracks I have ever listened beside Age of Conan.It fits perfect to the game world, never gets disturbing and feels really unique.I would buy the soundtrack.Please guys, buy this game if you love hack&slay. I followed this game since it was announced. The Devs are really great guys. They are really active in the forums and they put so much content in this game. I can´t believe that a small dev team could create such a good game. They didn´t have a million budget like blizzard but they delivered something awesome.This game is like Diablo 3 should have been. It´s like Dave vs Goliath. BUY THIS GAME AND SUPPORT IT!			"

Early Access Review
								Grim Dawn is Incredibly well done. With an old school Diablo like feel but with a more modern asthetic. Personally I'm not a big fan of Steam Punk in most games. Grim Dawn however does a great job making it feel like a part of the world and not just ham fisted fan service. There is a great grit to the world that helps make it feel all the more real and in depth. Grim Dawn is yet another in the recently flooded ARPG Market but it sets itself apart with it's beautiful visual style and incredibly immersive world.    If you're looking for something to fill the void left in your heart by the ARPG classics of your youth, this is it. Enjoy.			"

												After 9 hours of this game I am very VERY impressed. The game feels like Diablo 2 steampunk version. I could say many things are made perfectly for my taste atleast.+Skill tree. You can combine two skill trees from 2 classes which is new for me atleast and you actually need to know where to put your points.+soundtrack. The music and ambient sounds are very good in the game.+So far the areas seem very nicely made. Act 1 was made dark and scary and full of scary monsters and enemies.+I like that the game has different difficulty levels. I am playing veteran and it really feels like veteran difficulty.+loot system is what it is supposed to be.The harder the difficulty the more loot, simple. So far I've been getting very good items which help me against harder enemies.+voice actors. I think this is personal taste, but in my opinion the voices fit for the NPCs.+crafting system. So far I've haven't tried it that much, but in higher levels my guess you will need it more.+You can remove one point from skill tree for a price which is good. You can try out other builds without starting new character.So far no cons come in my mind, but I am going to definitely recommend this game for all ARPG lovers. I bet if the game becomes more popular we might see a expansion for the game and the developers will keep patching the game to keep the game popular.			"

												If you like ARPGs definitely get this one. Also be sure to complete it on Veteran at least once, drops are much better in it. That being said, do try Normal when you want to test out a character build because once you chose your classes for a character they can't be changed. (You can still change how you allocate skill points in those classes though, but not mastery points those are fixed as well)Pros Dual class system makes each character play differently. A big world to explore and secrets to find Different factions, whose quests unlock as you increase your reputation with them. Good crafting system, and some nice abilities and passive bonuses can be imparted to your gear from components you find. Notes scattered around the world are well written.Cons No option to hide quest from being displayed at all times. (There's a toggle to hide the entire panel but no option to hide individual ones) Also quests once taken can't be abandoned. "

Early Access Review
								So, here I am, 400+ hours into the game, without a single forum post or a review. I feel like I own it to Crate to write one, so here it goes. I'll cover 5 topics: World, Story, Gameplay, Graphics and Sound.World: I thank Crate for not making world randomized. The map is hand drawn, same every time, but the boulders and obstacles block certain paths, so you'll never go the same way twice. The pros of that approach tie with the story.Story: The story itself is okay, much better than other ARPGs though (looking at you, Torchlight 2 :D). The best part about it is the lore behind the world. Random notes make world alive and some of it are really beautifly written, like mini novels all around you. Gameplay: The skills feel responsive and overall, combat is very satisfying. The punches are hard and spell effects make combat seem very fast paced. There are occasional glitches and fps drops, but this is an indie studio and an early access game, so I believe it will be resolved (I'm playing on a 8 year old toaster by the way, and i get 25+ on low/med settings, which is awesome). Skilltrees and devotion system make each individual character different. Components and relics are an awesome way for customizing your character further.Graphics: Crate didn't go for beautiful graphics and eye candy. Instead, what you get, is dark and grim world. The look of the game is awesome, Areas are distinct and every single one feels like it's the part of the world, not some random desert here and lush green woods 10 minutes further. Graphics are here for the atmosphere, not the beauty.Sound: Abilities sound great, even though the autoattacks could use some love. The soundtrack is awesome though, resembeling the Diablo one (overly reverbed instruments).Overall: This game is awesome. Buy it now. Support the developers and the game, you won't regret it. This is by far the best ARPG I've ever played. "

												I hesitate to make quite so blanket a statement as “this is the Diablo III that many Diablo II fans wanted”, both because there are key ways in which it’s not and because I can’t speak for people who’ve spent years memorising loot tables and now expect very specific things. However…Grim Dawn is a huge and slick affair which clings tight to a doomy tone, eschews online funny business and is careful to keep lore overload at arm’s length. A lack of overblown cutscenes aside, you’d never guess that it was made comparatively under the radar and on surely a fraction of Diablo III’s budget. The Titan Quest (with which it shares several developers) influence is as strong as that of Diablo, though sadly the Harryhausen monster aesthetic wasn’t retained. We don’t get many tottering skeletons or screeching harpies, but both loot and powers ramp up dramatically quickly. It’s rarely a question of if a murdered monster will drop anything, and more how the hell you’re going to fit it all in your bags. The same excess extends to the many and often wildly over the top powers. Grim Dawn, despite the downbeat title, is determined to make you feel good. It’ll keep you busy for a long damn time too, even if you only play it once – though, of course, for many there’ll be later playthroughs in co-op or at unlockable higher difficulties. I think it’s the desire to be the spiritual sequel to Diablo II which holds me back from heaping breathless praise on Grim Dawn, though. The need to be grim first and foremost forbids a clear personality from shining through, and the result is that I’m not sure how to finish a sentence which begins “Grim Dawn is that game where…”Well, other than “…I'm having a better time than I did in Diablo III”, anyway.

Early Access Review
								With the double-edged sword that is Early Access, it is great seeing that it does work when used right.It took me about 14-15 months to pull the trigger on grabbing this game, as I was not sure which end of the spectrum Grim Dawn would fall on. I am happy to say that - after being patient - this game is to me everything Early Access was called into life for.If you are an avid ARPG fan like myself, I find it hard to make a case against buying Grim Dawn, even though it is technically unfinished. The content available presently is quite fleshed out, considering how much more there is to come. I find myself collecting an insurmountable amount of items, just so I can prepare for the next character build I have in mind.  That is not to say the game makes you play alts in order to get the most out of it, rather it is a testament to how the build diversity makes you want to experiment and gets you excited to try other things. You are free to make a 'pure' build, using ony one class, or supplement it with one or more skills/passives of another class. Alter your skills' damage type to make it mesh better with your ideal build, or change the way it works entirely, making your big AoE skill a continuous basic attack. The Grim Dawn world is your oyster.While Grim Dawn has its flaws, like any other ARPG, it absolutely nails that which it strives to be. It's grim, very much so. Many of the choices you get to make during quests have a sense of moral ambiguity. Some more or less than others, but a refreshing breeze in the genre, which often relies on simple ""Kill X mob or boss"" quests as you trot down the storyline. Not in Grim Dawn. Well, at least not in its entirety. Many of these quests certainy fall into the well-known standard we all experienced. Others have you decide on lives and allow you to shape the game to an extent. You can end up with more or less people in the game as you decide on whether or not to save them. You may or may not get access to a certain item if you decide to choose a particular path. It certainly allows for you to experience a slightly altered world next time around, adding to the replayability. But what does all of this mean in the larger scope? We all look towards ARPG's for the same thing, I would think. Killing stuff, lots of it, in order to get stuff to kill more stuff faster and/or more efficiently. Grim Dawn certainly provides plenty of both. There are lots of armor sets to collect, some of which allow you to completely change your playstyle, sometimes in a way that seems counter-intuitive at first. It's in these details that the game shows its true self. The small mechanics that could change the way you think about some of the skills in the game, which you will likely only discover a good while into the game. Are you not concerned with these mechanics? That's ok, the game lends itself perfectly to those who simply want to barge through the game wreaking havoc. It's all up to you.For those of you who are on the fence about the game, in regards to its similarities with Titan Quest, I can only say this: Grim Dawn is no less than a worthy spiritual successor to Titan Quest. It adds plenty, from a new narrative, new classes and areas, to new mechanics and playstyles. All in keeping with its roots, and building on that solid foundation that many of us look back on so fondly. This is not the same game, but it 'was' built with the same eye for detail and the same type of devotion to the genre we know from Titan Quest. It was made by people who love the game, for people who love the game. If you ask me, that's how you get a good game. Which leads to my verdict as the game stands at the time of writing this review:A solid 8.5/10 Highly recommended for fans, certainly worthwhile still for those with a passing interest.If they keep up the hard work, and after implementing the announced features and planned content, I might bump it up to a solid 9/10.BUILD 28 UPDATEWe are now a good chunk further in development since my initial review. I let the game 'ripen' a bit and have not played much since build 24, giving me a wealth of new content to play around with.I have to say, I was not prepared for what I'd find. Including the Factions (with the Bounty and Nemesis systems), Devotion System and new class on top of the remainder of Act 3 and first part of Act 4 and the additional 20 levels there is so much to do. The ability to diversify to this extent will make this game last as long as you want it to.The prospect of almost unlimited replayability is exactly what I had hoped when I put down my money for an Early Access game.With Build 28 also came a much needed boost in performance, and some polish in the graphics department, giving me a buttery smooth 60 FPS across the board.Having seen this game grow from its infancy, where Act I was the entire game, to what it is now has been an experience that has made me truly appreciate the developers. I thank you, and all the other people who supported this game. Early Access is always a leap of faith on behalf of the consumer, with a trackrecord that is not without its blemishes. For a developer to follow through on their promises to this extent has been a breath of fresh air and spark of hope that this business model can produce wonderful products.I was reserving judgment for my initial review score, as the game had so much to grow yet. We are nearing the full release at this point, and I have only become more hopeful for the end product, as it truly feels like a full game already.It's easily a 9/10 for me at this point and a huge recommendation for anyone who wants to enjoy a new ARPG.There is no better time to show your support for a developer who has earned my complete trust and support. I highly doubt you'd regret it.			"

Amazing Hack & Slash ARPG !Man this game is so good ! Im a big fan of the Hack & Slash ARPG genre ! I'm just going to say this one does not disappoint ! The game has real good GFX and the games Engine runs real good. The controls are pretty much the same as in Titan Quest if you owned or played it. I myself have a dino of a comp at the moment and im running it full out settings wise with rez set to 1366x768 75hrz and the game runs 100% with no issues at all.The game has nice effects also like TQ's Ragdoll and being this game is newer they have alot of nice looking spell and death effects. I also like the lighting effects more in this one also.One thing that stands out in this game also is the Blacksmith ! You can make Weapons and Trinkets , Armor , Amulets , Medels , Relics and other stuff to help you. I dont think i seen that in any H&S ARPG!Me being a big Fan of THQ/Nordic's Titan Quest and knowing this game runs on the TQ's Engine, i just  had to get it ! I love this Genra being i have Diablo 1, 2 , played 3 and I also own The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut , Victor Vran ARPG and the new updated Titan Quest Anniversary Edition. So in short if you like Titan Quest or any of the games i listed GET THIS GAME NOW!! Im sure if you like or are a fan of Hack & Slash ARPG's you will enjoy this one just the same !			"

												Bias: I am a dinosaur. I like to loot and smash things.This is probably one of my favorite games I have played this past year. Graphics, story and action were all very interesting and intense. I will admit I have placed 30+ hours in the game, I still enjoy playing it - still have not finished it completely on solo. I do have a second character I did start with a friend, which took a bunch of those hours as well. The game allows for different builds of characters, which can allow for replay-ability with different formats - with melee based, assassin-esque based, mage based characters. Cool feature is the ability to play as a dual class. Which allows for different combos and sets. There is an ability to respec as well via an NPC if you decide to reformat, so you can choose a different format if you find you are having issues.There are wide range of merchants that usually have the best stuff if you are able to friend a town, faction to the max. You can also hit certain areas again for possible drops, to help improve your weapons and armors. In addition, there are different gems to upgrade abilities of weapons - from shooting fireballs or causing poison damage. I personally, have nothing to complain about the game. I personally wish I had more time to play.I would give the game a 10/10, as it is one of my favorite games from this year.I do hope they create a sequel or even extend the universe more. "

												Feels good man. Clocking in decent hours and enjoying it still like it was a good old Diablo game (first one was the true love in the early days of gaming, maxing all 3 classes multiple time and spending a fortune on dial up fees with modem). This is a game that keeps on giving despite me purchasing it on the very first week of the early access years back. I play it like a madman for a week or two and give it a good break for month or two and it always feels just as natural to come back to like Diablo series did. Easy to pick up and hard to let go off, the traits of a good game are showing up here.			"

												First of all: If you liked Diablo I and II but were disappointed by Diablo III this is the game for you. That said, here's my review:Very good ARPG, takes about 50 hours for the first playthrough on normal difficulty which is, in my opinion, decently difficult for an ARPG. The classes are expansive and interesting and you can even pick two of them for double the fun. Then there's the Devotion system where you get points for restoring desecrated shrines which you can then invest into different star constellations that give you passive bonuses or skills. So all in all customization is very in depth and requires a bunch of playthroughs to see all of it. Except for the part where all characters look the same bar differences in armour and gender.It's probably really fun in multiplayer but since I don't have any friends I can't judge that part of the game, though it is very fun in singleplayer.There's not too many different kinds of enemies which isn't great but for me personally it's not a huge problem though some people may grow tired of killing the same dudes over and over again.Overall it's a very solid game with many different ways to play it that'll keep you entertained for many hours. Remember to get Chaos and Aether resistances for the late game, or at least a pet.			"

												This is my first review  of  a game on steam. And I'm  writing it because  I think THIS game deserves it.I grew up with Diablo 1+2 and loved those games. I think Grim Dawn really carries their legacy forth  and improves on nearly every aspect of it.And the best thing is: With every hour I play (260+ now?) I enjoy it even more and want to try different thinks.It's simply a must buy for fans of the genre!			"

Early Access Review
								Ok, I've put a little time into this game. Enough to where I can start to form an opinion on it. First off, let me precede this with a disclaimer. The game is currently in Early Access so parts may change once it hits the final build.This game does have a dark atmosphere similar to Diablo series of old. I've played around with several different builds to date and they all offer something different. However, the true magic happens once you can combine 2 professions to make your own hybrid class(think Titan Quest and you'll completely understand what I'm talking about). If you enjoy that idea and don't mind some occasional weirdness occuring during gameplay, then this game belongs in your library.Here is where I explain the weirdness I spoke of earlier. Controls can be a little wonky(there have been times that I've selected the enemy that I wanted to attack and my character simply ran over to stand next to them). You will occasionally come across an area that you should be able to reach but an invisible wall will prevent you(to date, I have only seen this a small handful of times and is nothing too major). Also, there is some popup issues where I had to be actively running to have an object appear in front of me.If the Early Access thing worries you, then I would state that they appear to give regular updates on the game. I'm unsure if they are planning a final pass once they finish the primary development of the title but since they are apparently trying to create themselves and have shown an openess to the community, I cannot see that they will leave issues remaining in the game.I currently cannot comment on the co-op as I have not yet experienced it other than saying that the game does offer LAN and Online modes.If you enjoy ARPG's of old and want to experience something both new and old at the same time, I would recommend this. If you are looking for a graphical masterpiece, then hold off. For myself, I fully intend on grabbing a few copies for friends once it is finished so we can all have a grand old time loot grinding.

								Recommended : Highly YES, don't miss this true gemBased on beta B27Many devs from Grim Dawn (GD) are those who builded this nice Titan Quest immortal Throne (TQIT) from past. That mean they know what they do, they are one of best team ever to create this kind of game.This is addictive hack'n'slash with RPG based on 6 classes, full of skills in use in dual-class system like TQIT was.- Dual class system ; choose your gameplay style melee, ranged/magic/summoner based on 6 classes with tons of skills to unlock. You must balance your character between overpowering & protections. Classes are more experienced than TQIT- Generous loot system better than mostly others game on same kind. Rare/epic/legendary items, based on classes, with   20,000+ possible magical affix combinations and over 200 rare affixes.- Innovative quest system : you can choose your destiny which affect world. Choose which factions to help and those to fight. Make peace, make hell or stay neutral : but face consequences of your acts. Your goal is to rebuild world from human extention - Factions system : help factions what you want and be awarded with discount from merchants, exclusive items to unlock. When you help a faction, you automatically fight against others which are ennemy. Entire world is based on factions, except beasts. If you fight too much against a faction, this faction will give you more challenge in fight in future, sending to you better mobs & bosses to kill you.- Multiplayer : 4 players can coop or pvp.- 4 difficulties mode : normal, veteran, elite and ultimate, can be conbinated to hardcore game.- Great gameplay : fast-paced combat with many visual effects, freeze/stun/knockdown, furnitures to demolish- optional rotatable camera : always fight from the most optimal angle- Intelligent mix between open-ended world and corridor, with outside & underground maps, 20+ secrets passages, exclusive quest map (depending on your choices based on quests)- Bestiary : 200+ enemy heroes and bosses, hand-configured with their own unique arrays of deadly skills.- Additional rogue-like dungeons :  special challenge dungeons (require rare crafted key) where enemy levels increase as you progress and player can't teleport. Win or die.- Dynamic weather : - The world is brought to life with region-specific climates and a variety of weather effects. A sunny day can cloud over with mild rain showers that builds into a booming thunderstorm. Variable wind gusts blow grass and affect objects like windmills. - Crafting system  : with 250 recipes to learn (weapons/armors/jewels/potions), combining/salvaging components, augments- Respec system : cancel your skills allocation points to create new build based on same mastery.This is one best game ever. You can buy it, closed eyes, even in beta or at full price. You'll don't regret it.			"

Early Access Review
Stay awhile and listenAfter the Grim Dawn, the world is in turmoil and everyone is trying to get by with what they can. There are death and despair everywhere. The world is big, based on a single map, and the game is semi linear. That make up for a great game experience! For the naysayers, I only have this to say to you[www.instagram.com]. ;)   Speaking for the game Graphics and design:Grimy, grim and rough. When it comes to graphics Grim dawn is spot on. The game is dark, and include the same type of gore and feel of doom that was present in Diablo 1. You can toggle the view of your camera, the game is in full 3D and plays smooth (not laggy/jerkily as it seems to be in the promotion video clip).The game stays simple yet effectful regarding to spells, skills and weaponry. There are colours, but not overdone and the gear are “simple” in design fitting within the context of the world. Even though the skills gets more expressive and effectful the more you level, it will never, as far as I know, become like the Diablo 3 roaming discotheques of coloured lightshows and smoke grenades I am used to. And I am greatly thankful for that.During Chistmas I only had my laptop to play on, and even though my laptop has a really poor graphic card the game runs smooth (but can barely handle Diablo 3 and absolutely not games like Cities Skylines). It feels great to play a new and good looking game that is not forcing you to buy a new computer.  Sound effects and music: The sound effects are really neat. My first character was a Pyromancer focusing around a gun build, and the swooping falcons have a nices punch to them, likewise the sound of the gun when firing. It is almost like you “feel it”. The music enhances the graphic expression of the death and misery that surrounds everything.Attributes, skills and leveling:The leveling of the character is in all ARPG:s, but apart from for example Diablo 3, Grim Dawn allows you to put out points after each level in core attributes like “Physique”, “Cunning” and “Spirit” affecting everything from health and energy to damages output and chances to hit and get hit. Each level you are awarded skill points to build your character in your chosen mastery/masteries. There are six masteries and if dual classing there are additional 15 different classes, each with a number of great synergy builds to create. I think the leveling experience is good. As used to Diablo 3's minor variations, I think the different build possibilities are enormous, which do greatly enhancing the leveling experience.Mechanics:As fare as mechanics goes, it seems to be totally transparent. I do not have that much to say on this matter. Yet again referring to Diablo 3, I think this fact is a nice change of pace. Inventory/backpack and stash/bank:The system for inventory and stash are as such: Inventory on the character are bigger then Diablo 3 and do I even need to mention Path of Exiles totally lack of inventory space? The inventory is expandable through quest rewards. As far as I have progressed, you have one personal tab in the stash/bank and four shared with your other characters. But as in all of these type of games inventory and stash space, even a great amount of space, is not enough. ;)Bugs:I have not noticed any major bugs. Miscellaneous:  Exploration: As I let on in the beginning, Grim Dawn are composed of one whole “overworld”, a continuous map that, for the most parts, are open and not depending on the game progression (there is no fixed acts like in Diablo 3 or Path of Exile, where A leads to B and B to C). This makes exploration one extra dimension of the game and the environments are nice; varies a lot with high level of detail. There are randomly spawn dungeons that does not show on the map, as far as it seems. This makes it harder to find them, but you do not need to enter them to progress through the game. It just gives a nice flair to the game. There are also lots of hidden areas that will not show on neither the mini map nor the big map. The dungeons has that great feel of dungeon crawl around, with some of them in a roguelike-ish style. In some extent it feels like Diablo 1 but with much better graphics.  Questing: As for questing, there is no holding hand style of gameplay. So do not expect a World of Warcraft path finding system for quest completion. This is more old school. You have to rely on your reading skills. Thus far I have never experienced any problem with completing any quests, and I find it nice for a change that the game is not playing for me. The “hardest” get around finding are the faction bounties. Even though I have taken to account the increasingly laziness of players, I do not think those are demanding in neither reading nor thinking skills.  Factions: The game as a faction system that reminds of the systems in MMO:s. There are different steps rewarding you with discounts at vendors and access to quartermasters. You gain negative reputation with your enemies resulting in increasing monster spawn, hero spawn and spawn of nemesis at the most negative stance.  Crafting: The game has a meaningful intriguing crafting system. During the game you can buy and find blueprints to learn new craftable items. At your Blacksmith you will be able to craft weapons, accessories, armor, components (things you can use in further crafting or to “enchant"" gear you have), consumables and relics.   Story: The game has a nice story and as you progress you can make choices through dialogue with NPC:s that affects the game in different ways. I have made some good ones, and some bad ones. One learn as long as one live.  Difficulties: There are three difficulties: Normal, Elite and Ultimate. The first unlocks the second after play through. For experience players I would recommend to play normal mode with “veteran” checked. Normal (veteran mode) will provide a greater challenge; stronger and tougher monsters in increased number of spawns.  Speaking against the game  No random generated maps, as far as I know. With that said I want to point out that so far it has not been something I thought about. If we are to be fair, the random generated maps in Diablo 3 and Path of Exile “are not much to hang on the Christmas tree” (Swedish idiom for “that's not much to boast about”). However I would like the game to have random generated elements in endgame, maybe in player open “rifts” or something like that (maybe it already exists… I have not made it to endgame yet).  No voice acting when giving a storyline, quest or lore. This I think is really negative. There are so much lore that it would be great listening to it instead of reading. I hope the rumor is true, that they are planning to voice the lore, but I do not know if that is the case.  Even though I like the storyline and lore of the game, it can be corny to some small parts. As I do not want to spoil the story for someone I will not go into it.  It is not a major problem, but worth mentioning: sometime the pathfinding could be better. I think it would do well from some polish, but otherwise I have no complaint regarding that.  I have played around 10 hours in multiplayer mode. The experience has been really good, but a couple of times we have gotten off sync for some minutes. I do not think this is a big problem, but when it happens it is a source of great irritation.  Conclusion I give Grim Dawn a clear thumb up. The game is an impressive achievement, and has huge potential for further expansion. When I look at the map, it seems like that game developers has prepared for an almost doubles sized map. I hope that is the case! :)			"

												My first love is Titan Quest obviously. I reckon that is down to some deep, buried within, primordial memories we all share about ancient mythology. Dragons and Medusi and Tigers wearing armour. The Great Wall of China for heaven's sake.The Torchlights were pretty good to. Don't have time for Diablos.So, can Grim Dawn match the others and be worthy of hard cash in the hand thank you Ma'am? Short answer? Yes it is.Long answer? This is what swayed me.Story: ARPG don't really need one and that is more true for a Diablo clone. This one though gave me some surprises. First time around I did not even read the various bits of paper you find on your journey, they were just XP. I started reading them second time around and found them mostly well told. It seems the developers had taken on criticism about TQ and got proper writers in. What was happening and how it affected normal people was simply fascinating. Sad too. Some stories made me angry.Factions: An advancement on the other games. You come across a few towns and communities who for some reason won't sell you their best equipment even though you save all their children from torture. You save their farms. Kill a dragon. Save a virgin. Provide free dentistry. BRING THEM FRESH WATER.And the man from town still says NO!There is a reputation system where you gain points by doing quests and killing their enemies. The good bit here is that you can see in advance what reputation improvement can get you. For example if your character specialises in fire it's better to concentrate on the faction that can provide you with +fire damage equipment. Later on in the game you have to choose between factions and one of them won't like you very much.Strays: Every now and again you encounter some guy(s) and there are different options on what to do. Kill them. Talk them around. Give them money. It's interesting as it's not obvious what the consequences will be and sometimes not even for a while. Some guy turned out to be an evil piece of work despite that I saved him. Other people down right lie to your face. Character build and classes: I think the horizontal planner for each class make it more difficult to decide on where to make improvements. At first glance the classes looked very similar to me. I now believe that unlike in TQ the developers made each class viable in its own right. So there are no wrong choices. Whether that is good or bad you can decide. One of the classes for example seems to specialise both in two handed weapons and in magic which seems odd. Pets seem to be a real decent choice now where before they could have been considered as add-ons.The Devotion section allows you to tailor your character as reflected in constellations. You can only do this if you ""Cleanse Shrines"" and once done gain valuable points to tweak your perfect killing machine. I found it a bit complicated and you can think of this section as a puzzle. Once you start thinking and planning on what choices to make here you will find your character become supreme ruler of the universe. As you complete a star sign you get a points bonus which in turn helps you to access the star signs towards the edge of the sky - they can be very powerful indeed.Gameplay: I like the new mechanism where you don't have to chug potions all the time. After battles your character will renew health automatically based on their constitution which can be increased by items and skills and renewed by finding food and some items. Good stuff. Since you don't have to focus on health *that* much, combat can be more tactical than in TQ and even I managed to train myself to click on a few different combat skills. I consider this quite an improvement as one of the criticisms of these type of games is that combat is ALWAYS THE SAME. Death by 100 of the same clicks.Now we have 100 different clicks!The world is grey and brown and missing the bright colours of other games in this genre. There is no grass breezing in the wind and no butterflies. I suppose the colour scheme is dictated to by the setting and story and part of me wonders what the engine could do if the chains are taken off. There is a decent variety of baddies to fight and a large section of bosses. Later on in the game your resistances become important and I found it handy to keep a decent collection of armour and items that cover the whole spectrum as it is unlikely your one set of equipment can cover them all.Some of the end levels in the various Acts are pretty large and sprawling. Larger than I expected which was a surprise. Towards the end of the game some of the levels feel like boxes and have nothing of consideration in them except trash mob baddies which make me think the designers spent most of their time in the beginning levels. In summary I think this game has hidden depths and statisticians can fully enjoy meaningful conversations about +% this and that. It's a good update to TQ and I can't give a bigger compliment. Would like to see a bit more variation in the environments but builds and items and classes and devotions seem to hit the spot. "

												As somebody who loves Diablo 2 with a fiery passion that edges on peverse, and someone that just couldn't get into Torchlight 2 for some reason, and was utterly uninterested in the world and characters of Van Hellsing, Grim Dawn has finally satisfied my needs for a modern Diablo 2.I think the biggest thing that Grim Dawn gets right that most other D2 clones fail to recognize is having an actually interesting world with a good premise. It starts off by just throwing you in blind and doesn't tell you much other than you were possessed, but as you explore the world you find journal entries that give you insight into what happened.Much like Diablo 2, Grim Dawn has a dark world where horrible things have happened. You awake in the apocalypse, the world is ending and only a tiny sliver of humanity remains to fight back. The world is filled with gruesome tales and your decisions(that's right, you actually get to make quite a few as you progress) can frequently have nasty unintended consequences.In other words, the setting is wonderful.The second thing this game does right is have a good skill system with satisfying special abilities. Too many Diablo clones fail because their progression system just feels dull, here you are always eager to level up because it gives you new or more deadly abilities.The combat has a lot of weight to it, and when you smash an enemy with a crit or a special attack it feels super satisfying as their corpse flies away from you with an explosive thwack!Length: no idea, not even done on my first play through, wayyy over 30 hours worth of content though. At 25 bucks this is a steal.Loot system is basically Diablo 2's, maybe not quite as good as D2's but that may be the nostalgia talking. There is a ton of loot to find, and it encourages you to try other classes and builds as you find epic loot for those classes.Overall, this is a fantastic game. And if you've been waiting years for something to scratch that Diablo 2 itch like I have, then this is definitely a game you need to try.			"

Early Access Review
								To sum up Grim Dawn, imagine Diablo 2 crossed with Titans Quest, with a tiny hint of roguelike thrown in.This game is being developed by some of the developers from the creators of Titans Quest, and is using the Titans Quest engine. However, within the engine they have managed to change the game enough to make it distinct from a Titans Quest mod. Think similarly to Unreal Engine. It may not be as flexible, but god damn if Crate can't bend it anyway.The game heavily favors exploration, with secret quests, bosses and chests hidden around the world. Its fun to find new stuff, and even more entertaining to blow a friends mind by showing them where a level 30 boss is in a level 18 zone. Yes, he will destroy you if you aren't very prepared.There is very little hand holding inherant in the game, however the community more than makes up for it. Due to a previously successful kickstarter, there is a large community who have been helping guide newbies, and also to just have fun together. I would highly recommend joining the forums, and atleast reading the developer journals 'Grim Misadventures' as they provide sneak peaks at upcoming content.Yes, this game is incomplete currently, however, what they have released so far is well worth the price in my opinion. Torchlight 2 was a similar price, and may currently have Grim Dawn on play length (I think it would actually be close however) but only up to Act 3 Chapter 1 is currently playable.The build system will be similar to anyone who knows something about Titans Quest, with the combination of two different skill trees, i.e. Demolitionist+Nightblade=Saboteur.  Simply put, if you enjoyed older ARPG's, filled with secrets and crazy builds, then you will most likely enjoy this. Atleast give the forums a peek. - Ham			"

Early Access Review
								It may only be early access at this point, but the game deserves massive props. On first playthrough, there are scenarios that are placed that will try to deceive you and force you to use your better judgement. Using your judgement incorrectly can force you to kill otherwise 'mostly' innocent NPCs (Julius & Helen in Arkovia for example). Things are not always what they seem with the setups.The class system is brilliant for an ARPG, two characters playing the same class-combo can end up entirely different depending on playstyle. It's a fairly new take on things that ARPGs have been building on for decades now; For example, two Blademasters (Soldier+Nightblade) can end up with one being a two-handed using tanky warrior type, while the other ends up more like a dual-wielding assassin with an arsenal of area effect abilities at their hand. All the skills are fairly decent and there isn't a wrong way to build your class --and if you feel you have built it 'wrong', you get a second chance with skill resets whenever you want.The game is also very fluid. Other than the given glitches that will most likely be fixed in full release, I have no complaints about this game.			"

												Just read through a bunch of negative reviews for this game...and cannot stop laughing. I got the strong feeling that the majority of those reviewers didn't even play the game beyond Warden Krieg (final boss of the games first chapter) or were expecting some arcade-like game as Diablo III.42/10, would read them againPS:Played ~5000 hours of Diablo II, still the best ARPG out there and my favorite game of all time.But Grim Dawn gets as close as a game can possibly get. Don't waste your time on Path of Exile or (even worse) Diablo III - join us to save Cairn.			"

								I believe this game has much to offer the ARPG genre in terms of over all presentation. Its the hardcore ARPG with its veteran's mode and you can progress with a challenge and get rewarded with extra loot. Plus they still have the rare item hunting and rewards for farming with a twist. Look up Monster Infrequent (MI) for more info. Extensive crafting and personal economy that can be traded with friends or the community. Lots of storage space but you will need it when collecting your components and crafting with them + storing your great finds. You will be challenged as much as you want wile farming with a modest level scaling feature.The first 2.5 acts are out. 3 acts are confirmed there have been rumors of a small 4th act. You can level to 40* with its 116** skill points available to spend once you figure out your build idea get ready for some choices as your allocating 3 skill points a level you can respec your skills but not your mastery level so choose wisely between stat and mastery rushing or leveling your primary attack skill, aoe skill, defenses, auras, debuffs, cc and more. I would recommend with your 116 skill points aim for having at least 1/2 of them in your mastery and you will want to focus mastery > skill ups to a degree for the first 15~ levels. Ideally you will want to have a good lead in your mastery level, it should be 10+ points past your current level and you should feel safe and have the stats you need to scale your damage and HP.* 40 is the current level cap, I have no official news on the final number but they say it should be close to 50 - 75 at last estimate but I assume closer to the 75 side.** 116 skill points is 3 a level (for now I could see it drop to less at closer to the 70+ mark. 1 bonus skill point for the current game we may get more skill points before we progress to the second difficulty. So final number of skill points and skills to be determined, build ideas over 9000, sorry had to.			"

												What can I say? I'm 6hrs into this game and I'm already amazed by its complexity and variety in skills and builds, only surpassed by Path of Exile.This game is the ultimate ARPG cocktail. Titan Quest's and Diablo 2's perfect child.Only thing that I really don't like about this game is the monotonous atmosphere and the very limited color palette that the developers chose for the artwork. Every single zone seems to be the same as the previous one. But the fantastic gameplay itself compensates for this flaw.Pros:- Huge variety in skills and builds, only surpassed by PoE- Every character can have two classes at the same time and you can combine their skills and traits- Many different upgradeable items, armor and weapons- Very interesting boss fights- Faction system, where you can get reputation points for doing quests/slaying monsters for each faction- Huge replay value, your decisions matter in every playthrough + you have to try all the buildsCons:- Monotonous artwork and atmosphere- Questlines can be confusing, you can get stuck and might not know where you should go nextI would totally recommend this game to any RPG/ARPG fan, especially ones who miss the good old Diablo and Titan Quest days, and the game has a reasonable price as well!9/10, Nashud			"

												In my opinion this is the best ARPG currently on the market. It plays a lot like Diablo 2 and Titan Quest but with nice graphics.It is a loot-based game which focuses on boss farming to acquire good loot (like in Diablo 2 and not like in Diablo 3 where you farm whole areas to get loot). While your character gets better when you level up and spend points on your stats and skills, you can be godlike when you have godlike gear. The game has 6 ""pure"" classes with its own skill tree. You can dual-class which gives a total of 21 possible classes (15 dual classes and 6 pure classes). The skill system is very in-depth but still easy to understand and the possibilities of different builds are very enormous. The max level is 85, after finishing the game at normal difficulty you will be around level 50 and there are two more difficulties.There is also a Hardcore mode, multiplayer, an extensive crafting system and an achievements system.Overall a very good game, I would recommend it! The replay value is really high and if you like ARPGs you can expect a few hundred hours of fun from this game.			"

Early Access Review
								This is honestly one of the best games I've played overal and easily the best ARPG. It's obvious to see how the developers are in this to make a great game they're proud to put their name on, and they rightfully have a lot of loyal fans who have been with them since the Alpha or some point in the Beta. I started playing in late Alpha, and the game was rather good even in that early state and they only continue to vastly improve it. It's really great to see developers not try to get away with the minimum amount to make X sales but pay great attention to detail and continue to go above and beyond of what would be an 'acceptable release'. I can't wait until this game is finished, if you enjoy ARPGs at all this is a MUST buy.You pick a class at level 1, and once you reach level 10 you have the option to pick a second class, although you can do it at any level after 10 as well if you're not sure what to pick. This allows you to have some really great hybrid builds with huge replayability potential. There are currently 5 classes, so the combinations you can make are quite large, and they plan to add at least 1 more class in every expansion.Grim Dawn has a great mix of C'thonian elements, undead and other demensional demonic enemies. The environment is beautifully crafted and the plot/quests are well thought out, the additional info diaries you can find are fun to collect and read, although not a nonsense mundane task like some games make finding such things to be.  Grim Dawn has a good difficulty level and can further be increased by choosing a Veteran mode, and later when the game is released more difficulties will be released.10/10			"

Early Access Review
								Let's get this out of the way, is this game worth buying even in Early Access? Yes. Why? Well, first of all, it's further along than most early access games. I've already put over 40 hours into the game and still haven't seen most of chapter 2. The amount of content is huge.But while content is king, gameplay is God for most. The easiest way to describe the game is to compare it to Titan's Quest, but improved. It makes sense since Crate Entertainment is made up of some of the same people who worked on Titan's Quest. It's also built on the same engine, though that's been improved too. The art style is more how I wanted Diablo 3 to look, and I absolutely love it.Unlike Diablo 3, in Grim Dawn you can have two skillsets or you can just stick with one, but each level only gives you three points to spread over the skillsets, so you have to choose. You also are able to choose your attribute points, though there are only three choices. It's simplified, but not to the point of Diablo 3.The game has a faction system that looks like it could be promising later on, but at the moment it's simple and mostly meaningless. You gain fame and reputation through killing big bosses and monsters which can open up other side quests, but you'll usually open these up just from playing normally and not paying attention to your fame stats. I dropped $58 on this game during its kickstarter, it was money I had saved for Diablo 3. I don't regret a penny, and after picking up Diablo 3 on sale, I think I made the right choice. But, it is in early access so there are chances for bugs. I haven't ran into any since they've released  Act 2, but keep in mind it's still a work in progress, but even then it's better in my opinion than some full release games.If you love ARPGs then you owe it to yourself to pick up this game, especially when it's only $25.

Posted: January 3
												To start, I've played just about all of the major ARPG's. Diablo, Diablo 2 and 3. Titan Quest and expansion, Torchlight, Torchlight 2 and Path of Exile.I saw numerous reviews prior to purchasing this stating the game was easy and had no difficulty. They either played a different game, or only tried the lowest difficulty. I just finished the main game on Veteran(2nd difficulty), first playthrough. I had at least 100 deaths. The game brings a huge challenge on higher difficulties, especially if your gear is behind and your build is not optimized. Which brings me to my first gripe. You picked 2 classes of the bunch as your character. The max level is 85, which equates to around 228 skill points I believe. Each class has 20-30 skills with ranks going from 1 to anywhere as high as 12. So to rank 1 skill to max you have to use 12 skill points. For me, I have never been good with theorycrafting so this is a big challenge for me and a stresser. There aren't a ton of builds out there on the web to go off of, so you kind of have to make good choices or your character won't have enough resistances or skills to kill the bosses. If you love theorycrafting and TONS of different options for builds, you will love this. It's not as complex as Path of Exile, but there's a ton of build variety. My next few gripes I will lump together. There's a weird level scaling system in place. Some areas have a max level for scaling while others seem to not, or have a higher threshold. If you find yourself getting slaughtered by a boss, and go level 4 or 5 times and come back, the boss will still be 4 or 5 levels higher than you. It makes it hard to want to keep going sometimes, because you feel like youre on a stairstepper that doesn't end. I occasionally had crashes/freezes. There is also some line of sight issues with ranged abilities. I also found the navigation to be buggy sometimes when dealing with areas with multiple platforms or levels. As this game was made by the people who did Titan Quest, this game throws mountains of loot at you. 99/100 pieces of the loot will be useless, but it's good for making money. Which you'll need to buy lots of potions, and some nice gear upgrades from the reputation vendors. The game has reputation factions which you gain rep with and each rank of rep has different rewards. It's a nice side grind/progress checker. The music, level design and art is great. I found the main theme to be very nostalgic of Diablo. I finished the game in just under 30 hours on my first playthrough and managed to get to level 50. I found myself wanting to keep progressing each time and keep finding those upgrades and getting that next level so I could get a new skill or new buff. If you enjoy ARPG's, you really can't go wrong with this game. I am glad I bought it, and expect to try to get a char to max level and try the harder difficulties. I do not regret buying this what-so-ever, and fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the genre. There's a ton of stuff to do, the areas are huge, there's tons of loot, great music, great build diversity, and it's quite challenging.			"

Posted: September 2, 2016
Better than Diablo?tl;drThis game is a very well-executed ARPG. From the vastness of the customization to the richness of the gameplay, you're bound to have a fresh playthrough, even mulitple times. The world's atmosphere is also inviting and imaginative, even if the story is difficult to grasp. 8.5/10. GameplayThis is where the game shines. You have six different masteries (classes). You choose your first at level 2. You choose your second at level 10, and you can harmonize them. You feel in complete control of your character and what sh/e does best. This is refreshing. Diablo was tons of fun, but the character development is a bit locked. I mean, you can choose what kind of demon slayer or barbarian you want to be, but you're still just that character and nothing more. And as you level in Diablo, you get stronger and unlock more skills, but there feels like there's always a best way to play your character. With Grim Dawn, you don't feel that way. Choose a class, and then have seemingly complete control over what that character does best. You level the character's abilities, but you have a choice between what skills the character employs. You don't unlock one skill at a time, you unlock a handful as your progress through your mastery, and you can ignore one for another, or choose and level all of them.You also come across shrines in the game. Cleanse the shrines and you get a devotion point, which can be used to further enhance your character's abilities by choosing a constellation to populate (it'll make sense when you play it). Choosing the right constellations means that as you progress you'll become even stronger. It's like leveling inside leveling, and is definitely an added plus. Fighting, attacking, talking and looting are all typical for any ARPG, which is fine. The Diffculty: Where is the Blacksmith?The difficulty options themselves are typical. There are three levels, Normal, Elite and Ultimate. You unlock each difficulty as you beat the game, according to the wiki. But, if any of the diffculties are too easy for you, you can toggle the ""Veteran"" modifier, for those who are veterans of the genre. More enemies, more elite and champion enemies and better loot. Torment mode in Diablo seems more fleshed out, but this is a streamlined, simplified process for the same thing.Another neat point of emphasis is that, like Diablo and Torchlight, you can find characters that give you even more to work with. The blacksmith can make weapons and armor, vendors sell them. One person allows you to unsocket a gem, etc. What's really cool is the ease with which you can respec. It's available fairly early in the game from one of the characters. ""Wait a second. Why did you begin this section asking where the blacksmith is? Didn't you just say he's there?""Yes I did. But what's neat about this game is that you can miss him. Or even if you find him, you don't have to send him to town. And so it goes with at least a handful of the characters I've encountered. You can just not ever find him/her and progress the game anyway. This adds an enriching aspect to the gameplay. So, you're forced to fully explore areas, but not merely for loot. This is huge. Diablo at points (particularly when you're a lower level and especially before the DLC) felt like it had you running through areas simply to find loot. That's ok, I guess. It's cool to find stuff, but it feels like it's just extending the game.Not so, with Grim Dawn. Fail to fully explore an area and you might miss something very important. How many ARPGs can boast that? I mean, I killed the boss in Act I and was merely searching for scrap in an area I already ""cleared"" (enemies return) to advance the story. I ran into a note while on this endeavor, and it eventually pointed the way to a challenge dungeon. An entire challenge dungeon would have been missed if it weren't for my proclivity to sell all the scrap I get.This adds to the diffculty and makes playing the game feel exciting. You never know who or what you'll find so long you look in every nook and cranny. Oh, and there are challenge dungeons (hehe). They contain good loot, and they level as you level. The boss of the area is always several levels above you. Good luck. MultiplayerMultiplayer does its job. Play with up to four friends. Enemies get stronger and loot gets better with the more players you add. This is cool. What's especially good about multiplayer is that you don't need to play with a friend. Although, it's much more enjoyable hooking up with a friend on Curse (Steam chat sucks) and playing this together, you can search a vast list of servers and join anyone who's decided to host an open, passwordless mulitplayer game. So, you can play with friends, or you can make friends and play. Win/win.StoryI want to make it known that it's clear the developers put a lot of effort with the budget they had to make a vibrant world including characters that are full of life coupled with an immersive, if flawed, story. I mean, I came across an NPC that was about to commit a terrible act, and I could either fight and kill him or talk him down. The tension was adaquately palpable; I had a very real feeling that I could influence the story. You don't get that very often, even with games that offer so-called choices. But, I'm playing with my third character where I've reached level 20 (I haven't yet finished the game, just trying different builds), and I'm finally starting to get a grip on the story. And it still somewhat feels a bit convoluted. Part of the reason this review begins asking if this is better than Diablo, rather than outright saying it, is because in Diablo the story is laid bare. Perhaps slightly less immersive, it's at least very easy to follow. It's easy to sort of get caught up in the fighting and looting and miss the lore the devs worked for in Grim Dawn.Now, being that this is an indie dev, I understand why much of the story is relayed to you via Lore findings. Instead of having a budget for tons more voice acting, much of the story is given by finding a journal, book or text that tells you what's going on and what happened in the area. It's not that I mind reading per se, but you have to stop in the middle of the action and read a lenghty discourse about what's going on.Controller or kb/m?First off, this game works well enough with the Steam Controller. Good job devs on including a comprehensive default donfiguration.But, the controller versus kb/m debate is still there. There are two dominant aspects of the game: Exploring and Fighting. The tool you decide to use clearly shines in one aspect or the other. Controller is by far preferable when in the midst of a fight. You can map your unlocked skills to the buttons (in-game!) and very easily just press that button when you want to execute that skill. But where the controller falls short is exploring. Moving is made better having a stick, but it just feels like a chore to click the right pad to get my cursor to appear, then move the cursor before I do essential actions (traveling to an area, opening character screen, talk to NPC, picking up items, etc). Kb/m shines in this area, but fighting is slightly more work.Also, every time I go to change controller configs (using Big Picture Mode), whenever I return to the game my controller doesn't work anymore. I have to restart the game to get my controller to work again. It saves my config changes, but this hinders the ability to change configs on the fly, which is a defining characteristic of the Steam Controller.The VerdictScore: 8.5 of 10Controller or kb/m: Kb/m is better, both work fine.Single or multiplayer: Does both well! Good job, devs!Buy it?: $25 is a deal. A great buy if on sale.Replay it?: Yes.			"

Early Access Review
								As a Diablo I/2/3 player, current PoE player and past Torchlight I & II player - it's safe to say I thoroughly enjoy the genre. Grim Dawn has since been added to the collection and thus far I have absolutely no regrets.The game provides appropriately 'grim' visuals, complemented by a very catchy and memorable soundtrack, all of which makes your impending murderous killing spree (in the name of questing and loot) all the more enjoyable. Having said that, Grim Dawn does a few things differently compared to the above commonly referenced titles. The lack of handholding is welcomed, as are the various but noticeable quality of life improvements that are easily underappreciated. In addition, gone are the procedurally generated maps, opting instead for a lovingly crafted world that throws in randomly spawned locales and dungeon entrances, alongside numerous quests with different outcomes and consequences, as well as picking a side between warring factions -- all of which ensures that despite the more 'static' settings, you still have uncertainty spliced with a bit of randomness and replay value - enforced through multiple difficulty settings of gameplay.Class/character building is a decent mix between repairable/configurable stats/abilities, and permanent decisions. It is also pleasant how you can essentially mix together two classes to form your own hybrids, rather than pick X and be stuck with it, adding onto the replay value thanks to all manner of class potential and experimentation in your mission to explore and survive in the absolute highest difficulty.In short, Grim Dawn is as familiar as it is unique - a 'must try' for fans of the genre looking for a nice mixture of all that is currently on offer today, with its own twists and turns.There are negatives, sure - but they are drowning in a pool of competant and well handled positivies.

Early Access Review
								This is one of the best games I've played in a while and it's early access! I got hooked on this game hard. The graphics, sound, abilities, combat, inventory management all fantastic. The upgrade system for enhancing your gear allows for a lot of variety. I explored every inch of every map, hacking away at the endless relentless hordes of evil that plague the beautiful and varied landscapes. You start in zombie infested swamplands. Then you unlock the other side of town and it's like something out of the wild west. There is strong variety in enemy design. The ability to open rifts (teleports) anywhere in the game is a dream come true for inventory management. You don't have to make tough decisions about what to carry. Just teleport back to town, sell stuff, and return to where you were. Monsters don't respawn from teleporting. This also makes tough boss battles easier. Sometimes I would die repeatedly to a boss, but a rift in that room let me return back to it quickly. Another great feature is that enemies don't regenerate health, so you can eventually whittle down even the toughest challenges.A few downsides are that the grind can get tiresome due to the extreme amount of enemies standing in your way. They don't respawn  unless you exit the game, however, which is nice for keeping track of where you've been as the maps are enormous. You can't save the game, which makes it hard to play shorter sessions. If you start exploring a map, you're in for the long haul until you either clear the entire area or find a new rift. Otherwise, the next time you log in you start at the city and all the monsters you cleared on a map have respawned. Exiting the game removes any existing personal rift you left behind also, so no quick teleporting to where you left off on a map. This was the most frustrating feature for me, because I can't always play for hours at a time and would have to play something else when my play time was shorter.Sale prices of items to shops is really low. Buy prices are really high. It needs better balance. It's not that huge of a deal, since the best items keep flowing from combat loot and treasure chests.I also felt we don't get enough points to boost our skills each level. The game boasts combining two classes but it takes around 40 skill points just to cap out tier 1 abilities in one class. You only get 3 points per level. So you have to sacrifice boosting your main class just to scratch the surface of the second class. I pointed out a handful of downsides, but it is early access. It's in incredible shape for an EA title, most of which we all know aren't that well off. I highly recommend supporting the game. I played 42 hours before I ran of content as of May 4. New content is coming soon according to the developer notes. In the meanwhile I started  playing Titan Quest, an older game from the same creator. I just can't get enough!			"

								Honestly, it's like what I wanted out of Diablo III, with the ability to mesh together two classes and become, in essence, what I want to be.In my short timespan in the game, I may have hit the end of the 'content' but I didn't quite hit the end of the 'content.'  There's far more to the game than just the main quest.""I wonder what's in this cave?  Oh, a nice demon thing and OMG IT'S 8 LEVELS HIGHER!""'We should run.'""Nah, we got th-OMG okay he hurts.""'Nah, you got this!'""No, we should ru-OW!""'Okay, maybe we should go....'""Oh hell naw, this guy's going down now.""You'll run into that.

								Sometime ago I promised a review to the dev, so now I'm going to correct that mistake.Grim Dawn is a great action RPG title from the ex-Titan Quest dev (also a great ARPG), with a lot of offering in terms of very good graphics, multi-class characters and a lot of depth in gameplay. Even though Grim Dawn looks like a classic Diablo clone, it is actually a lot more than that, because of the several reasons: the world is much larger; you have an ability to create a balance in the world between the factions (if one faction likes what you're doing, you can buy cheaper stuff from the merchants etc.); and dynamic weather - which is an awesome visual feature.There are areas that could be somewhat improved, like combat animations and an ability to move the inventory around the screen, or at least to choose a position of the inventory in the GUI.To sum it up, a very good ARPG offering.

												Grim Dawn has been worth the wait since its Kickstarter campaign ended four years ago. Using the Titan Quest engine provided that essential first step to greatness, and it helped create awesome locations populated with diverse monsters. The levels are huge and joined together in a cohesive manner. The inclusion of faction alliances, and numerous written logs, helps strengthen the role-playing aspects. Character customization, class combinations, equipment upgrades and Devotion skills allow for a titanic range of viable builds. Once you finish the game, additional time can be spent with bounties, faction quest, and exploration of obscure areas. If multiplayer was more polished, there would be nothing holding it back from being strongly recommended. For solo adventurers, there are few better hack-and-slash games than Grim Dawn with its tremendous depth and excellent world design.Read full review[www.newgamenetwork.com] "

								Diablo 3 is too simplified and baby-tier.Path of Exile requires six spreadsheets and a bible to pray with.Titan Quest has a weird Greek theme to it and needs mods to run as intended.So why not play Grim Dawn? For starters its offline so you're not waiting on anyone else's servers or connections (unless you want to play multiplayer) and while it isn't free like PoE its much cheaper than D3 and you don't have to run it through a redundant client. Everything you need to play Grim Dawn gets downloaded through Steam which shouldn't be a selling point but in today's time not coming saddled with DRM or always-online requirements is quite the bow on the box.As for the game itself its typical ARPG fair. Find monsters, bludgeon them until they die, pick up loot, rinse and repeat. Grim Dawn manages to make that pretty satisfying though, on par with D3 actually (although the gritty aesthetic does appeal more to me than D3s aesthetic) and much more so than PoE where a lot of attacks seem to not even connect. It uses a tri-stat system and is very similar to a finished, polished, and reskinned Titan Quest with more stuff in it. Making a return is the two-class system which is pretty good fun and encourages lots of replay to see what each combination feels like in play (even if you can see, on paper, how they appear if you go looking.)The mechanics encourage a wider variety of things than D3s 'Add more to your primary stat' equipment. A lot of the time you have to think about things and make sure that the extra +5% Physical damage bonus is worth the loss of 3% of your armor value and all of your Cold resistance because you don't know the next time some random frost-covered skeletor is going to show up and hand you your♥♥♥♥♥on a plate. There are hardly ever any 'pure upgrades' if you keep upgrading your equipment consistently and the crafting system helps this out a lot.The real shocker is that making equipment is actually worth your time instead of the usual 'I can just pick it up off the ground, why bother?' mentality that plagues most ARP games. A lot of the time you can make better items than what you find so you're going to be almost always short on supplies and currencies which is really pretty unique considering the mountain of gold I'm sitting on in D3 and the bank stashes full of PoE currency items. There just seems to be a lot of attention to detail to make the game better than its competition.I can't make a sales pitch to people who don't know the genre, you're going to just look deep inside yourself and find out how much grind and loot hunting you're ready to commit to, but for everyone else? You're looking for the buzzwords of 'Its better than Diablo 2' but I'm not here to give you that judgement - I'm here to tell you that its better than everything else in the modern market.If you want to know if it beats out the classic D2? Try it out.			"

Early Access Review
								Highly recommended game for fans of any Diablo game, Path of Exile, Titan Quest, Torchlight, Fate etc.The things that drew me to this game was two things:1) It has single player (offline with no latency or disconnect issues)2) Dark atmosphereOther things that are awesome about this game:-Grim Dawn developers have paid high attention to details, both visually and also dialogue. Graphics are very nice (although needs optimizing, but that always happens just before actual game release) and dialogue is quite good and sometimes funny as well (serious funny, not childish funny (not that there's anything wrong with that)) and there are no inconsistencies as far as I have noticed such as how Leah in Diablo 3 is powerful enough to open a gate, but the main hero is not, yet can defeat Diablo etc.-The game is friendly to people with certain disabilities such as sufferers of motion sickness (option to turn off camera shaking) and people with colour blindness (several clolour blindness options to suit the type of colour blindness you have). I cannot tell you how well these options work as I do not actually suffer from these disabilities, but I really like that the developers pay attention to this.-So the fact that the environments are not randomly generated like other ARPGs worried me a little but they are a large part of what keeps a game interesting for me, but I can assure anyone that the environments do indeed stay fresh because of a number or reasons. There are all kinds of debris that can block your path in one game session, then in a different game session it'll be elsewhere (they vary per game session) meaning you still have to explore the map a little further. There are also many caves/dungeons that are optional but there are many and exploring them does reward you nicely, adding high satisfaction to the gameplay.-Again, the darker atmosphere of this game is not necessarily scary, but it is indeed gloomy and people who enjoy Diablo will particularly enjoy the atmosphere of Grim Dawn.-I have not looked too much into the lore, but what I have heard and read about does make me want to look into it further. The idea of the game taking place after a recent kind of apocalypse is always cool and it does make you think of Fallout 3 in that sense. You meet characters in the game who are struggling to survive in the post apocalyptic environment with dangerous monsters (and people) roaming the wilds that were once safe in the past.-Like a lot of people say, the game is built on the exact same engine that the game Titan Quest (awesome ARPG from 2006 and STILL very good and quite up to date with newer games in every aspect, including graphics). You can easily tell as most of the UI also looks very similar in both structure and art style as Titan Quest. Not only that though, the physics feel exactly like in Titan Quest and the character animation has the same kind of heavy feel to them as well.-Items. Similar affix system as you get in most ARPGs. Random stats will be applied to each item that you pick up. It's nothing revolutionary, but it's a system that is used in many games because it works and actually manages to keep the game fresh for a while. There are magic items, epic items, legendary items, all that kind of stuff. It's all good though!-The game has factions similar to ones you see in World of Warcraft. You complete quests for a certain group of people and you increase your reputation with them, making them respect you more and there is a meter in the character menu so you can keep track of it. It's exciting to see what more the developers will do with this as there are a lot of possibilities they could play around with in such a feature.-Levelling, stats and abilities. Most abilities are cool, but I have not explored it much because I have only played 1 character for about 19 hours as of this review and another small character for less than 1 hour. I can say though that you always anticipate the next level you reach in the game as you get to apply point into stats and also abilities and you do actually feel that your character grows every level. As of this review, the level cap is only 40 which will increase as more of act 3 gets accessible (I think act 3 is the final act..?) but I don't think anybody knows what the max level will be yet but it seems to me that the developers want the game to remain fun and add endgame. They have mentioned on their website that after release they are planning on implementing a game mode where you defeat endless waves of monsters and then you can test how far you get etc, although not much detail has been provided yet.-Another thing I would like to mention is that the developers do not believe in pay-to-win or small useless DLC updates. However, they do want to create expansions to the game after release (paid expansions such as Lord of Destruction, Immortal Throne, Reaper of Souls etc.) which is awesome really.-Music is very good.The developers are very active and update the playable game regularly. Check out their website http://www.grimdawn.com/ for information on the content and features of the game on the Game Guide menu.Very good game. Happy I contributed to supporting the developers.9.5/10EDIT: I would like to add some cons about the game as to not be too biased towards the game.-So obviously the game needs work on the optimization but that always happens near the end of development.-Combat COULD improve in a way but is not a large problem. I feel (as a melee character) that not much strategy is involved. My class does not really use energy (mana) and I have never ever run out of it before. A lot of monsters' movement speed is faster than you so you cannot avoid their attacks and it ends up with you using potions. The frequency of using potions is similar to that of Diablo 2, give or take, depending on how much healing your class is capable of. I am okay with this, but I do enjoy the way that in Diablo 3 it is balanced in a different way where potions are an emergency heal with a long cooldown, rather than your main source of healing. Basically the combat could do with slightly more strategy as the only strategy I do is to run away from mobs real quick, heal, then go back but it is far from ruining it. It is a smaller problem than I may be making it out to be. Also it is in beta stage.-User Interface is not that smooth, but it was not in Titan Quest either but easily forgivable as it is not a huge issue or anything. It isn't unresponsive or anything, just not smooth in anyway, although the placement of the UI during combat or any activity is good and does not get in the way.Might update this review as time goes on, if I remember ;)			"

												This is one of the best ARPGs I've ever played.  The graphics, sound and music create an atmosphere that just keeps drawing me in.  The story is not deep, but it doesn't seem to detract from the enjoyment of the game.  There's must be something drug-like about melting, blasting, and generally laying waste to everything that stands in my way.			"

								I LOVE this game. But then, I already had a good feeling I would because I have also loved Titan's Quest so when I heard that Grim Dawn was also being developed by the same development team, I was super excited!Staying true to their roots, Crate is bringing the best of what made TQ so fun and keeping true to a very similar class system that they used for Titan's Quest where there are base classes, in this game six I think, each combine with one another to form masteries but I've seen plenty of gameplay videos that show just playing through as a pure class is as viable as is mixing it up to create the masteries.So besides the fact that this game takes place in a really gritty, dystopian reality,  this is also the first ARPG where I actually experienced choice and consequence!!  Before now, when playing the typical ARPG like Diablo or Torchlight, I'm so used to just clicking through text because none of it really matters, it all would lead to the same thing, so imagine my surprise when I was doing just that and found out I managed to annihilate an entire settlement, who were just trying to stay alive best they could, but my sloppiness ensured their destruction, of course I got another quest out of it that I wouldn't have received otherwise but still, I know for a fact I have never felt so guilty before EVER when playing an ARPG in the past so now I'm more careful when I read through text because it doesn't matter if you quit the game and come back to farm loots, that poor rickety shambles of a village will still be just as dead as it was when I destroyed it so carelessly the first time.  That is simply AWESOME!!! And on top of that,  there is faction gameplay as well so you can align yourself with certain powers that be which will give availability to cool gear and items you wouldn't get otherwise but also increases the replayability as well, over and above what the class/masteries provide alone.As of right now, it's not possible to choose factions that could possibly royally screw over the first settlement where your character starts and is accepted into for story reasons. Even so, with the factions mechanic they already have in place, I wouldn't be at all surprised if a future expansion or dlc will make such a thing very possible because your starting area is coveted by many, so this faction gameplay they've added to Grim Dawn makes the future possibilities of the game's potential really exciting!I just can't recommend this game more highly!!

								This review is based on (Build 28).UPDATED 11.29.15Have you been looking for the next ARPG to try?  If so, this game should be at the top of your list.  When I first read a Grim Dawn article from RockPaperShotgun.com a long while back, I was left with hope for an ARPG that would deliver a gaming experience akin to mashing up several characteristic of some of my favorite games:Diablo/Diablo 2 - Loot Variety / Quality, Rune/Rune word system, and the dark, mature, and savage atmosphereTitan Quest:IT - Graphics, Class system, Essence system, Relic system and Loot Variety/QualitiesGames of the late 90s era - Innovation and challenge at the risk of appealing to a niche / mature audiencePath of Exile - Deep passive skill tree offering immense amounts of customization and replayabilityThus far the game is delivering a very enjoyable gaming experience.  Below i've touched on the aspects of the game I've enjoyed most.  However, recently Crate overhauled their website and added a Game Guide [www.grimdawn.com].  This guide provides considerably more depth into the masteries and systems which build the foundation of this game.  If you're on the fence about the game poke through the guide to get an in depth view of what the game has to offer, read on to get a flavor of what my experience has been, or read both, but don't waste too much time; the game is begging to be played.  The current 5 mastery choices are bound to provide an option to suit almost anyones play style and to top it all off Grim Dawn uses a dual mastery system that provides excellent character building depth and game replayability. The Component System is Grim Dawn's version of the Titan Quest Essence system or Diablo's gem, jewel, rune system, which offers the ability for players to collect components dropped by enemies which can then be combined to create components with greater stats and sometimes active skills when socketed to armor, weapons, or accessories. The Forge system is an enhanced version of Titan Quest's Enchant system, which now allows players to craft relics, gear, and accessories from completed components, scraps, and iron bits. Relics which require formulas are Grim Dawn's answer to Diablo 2's Runeword system.  The forge is a much more engading/indepth version of Diablo's Gambling system and Diablo 2's Horadric cube crafting system.The Devotion system is Crate's version of Path of Exiles' passive tree.  Notable difference that I find more enjoyable is the means by which one obtains devotion points (passive tree points).  Instead of being given the passive point on each level; the player must first find the devotion shrine and either restore it with the requested materials or kill whatever has been locked within it.  This system provides the player with even more reason to explore this atmospheric world and additional challenges to ""fix"" the shrine thereby adding more depth to the enchancing your character instead of just purely leveling.  The loot system is addicating and gratifying. Loot erupts from slain enemies and chests and glistens on the ground begging to be picked up.  The qualities range from ( Unique Item sets, Purple - Legendary, Blue - Epic, Orange - Components, Green - rare, Yellow - magical, White - common, Grey - broken).The post apocolyptic dark and gritty fantasy victorian environment is splendid!  I really enjoy all the detail of the graphical assets for this game so far; they are varied and really don't feel over used. The lighting and shadow system is done in a way that makes the environment come to life and feel real.  The weather/atmosphere system is very appealing and includes aspects such as day/night cycle, fog, lightning, rain, etc. and the ability to mix it up to varying degrees to create climates/weather patterns for different regions within the game.  I also appreciate the graphics tuning options that allow me to crank up the visual details for my desktop rig, and allow me to scale it all down for my outdated laptop. The ambient soundstage and sound effects is probably one of my favorite aspects of this game. Between this and the grahic asset detail the immersion is top notch.  Here are some examples:Ticking of an old grandfather clockPopping and creeking of old wooden floorsCrackling of a roaring fire incinerating coffins and the deadThe buzzing of flies over a rotting corpseHissing wind and the babbling creeksCrows squawking and monsters growningMetallic reverberating undertones (sounds a little like deep church bells in the distance with overtones of ringing metal being pounded on by a blacksmith.)The combat sound effects are extremely satisfying! The character actions/skills seem to integrate flawlessly with the sound effect in a way that just seems to ""fit/resonate"".  For example flaming musket shots crack as they leave the muzzle of the weapon and sizzle/ignite as they penetrate the target's flesh. A landed melee attack has a solid satisfying thud the seems as if it were capable of shattering bones. In previous builds of the game I found the soundtrack left a lot to be desired.  It was distracting and felt repeative and grating.  I'm happy to say the soundtrack is changing in a very positive way, now blending and interweaving into the ambient effects of the game.  It's really starting to fit the atmosphere and rhythem of the game in my opinion.  Overall, I'm happy to say I have zero reget being an initial founder for this game. I'm also glad I cancelled my Diablo 3 per-orders and upped my support for this small indi developer when it became a Kickstarter project.  I have full confidence Crate will deliver a highly polished finished product boasting an amazing challenging, replayable, and indepth ARPG experience that other games of this genre will be judged on. It's definitely worth the asking price of $25 as it stands, and I expect it will become an even greater value as more content is added, adjusted, and balanced.        Many thanks to Arthur Bruno and his Crate Entertainment team for continuing to deliver on his original vision dating back to 2010.			"

												Grim Dawn is an awesome hack-and-slash RPG, and here's why I like it:- neat-looking graphics;- post-apocalytic atmosphere: badass, stylish armor, quests and written pieces of lore that help you submerge;- decent soundtrack;- 6 playable classes with possibility to combine any 2 of them, creating the array of different playstyles;- secrets everywhere;- soiled trousers (an epic item).Nothing special about the story, though: we're saving our world from the Great Evil again, but with the difference that the Evil has almost won by the moment we begin. Though, in process we discover that there is another, even greater Evil, so we fight it too.I barely tried multiplayer with random people, got no friends to walk through the game with.Grim Dawn is created on the same engine as Titan Quest, and they have a lot in common, but Grim Dawn feels more serious and deep. I'm enjoying this game, and so will be you if you like hack-and-slash RPG genre. 9/10 ragequits on hardcore character death.			"

Grim Dawn; rather, The Incredible Adventures of Titan Diablo's Exile.More specifically, take the oppressive atmosphere of Diablo I; the addictive gear-hunting and build-planning of Diablo II; an expansive passive ability system a la Path of Exile; the visceral spell-slinging and skull-bashing of Diablo III, an aesthetic befitting of The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. Beat gently in bowl along with the engine of TItan Quest. Makes one game worthy of the title of Diablo II's spiritual successor.Even more specifically, the sound design is excellent: Matt Uelmen-esque electric guitars and drums are accompanied by eerie ambient noises to create a genuine dungeon-crawling experience, and the environments are wonderful and befitting of the setting and mood. Maps are not randomly generated, meaning every cave and cellar is hand-crafted by the level designer, and worthy of tireless exploration.Your character begins as a blank slate- you decide on a class only after you've cut your teeth, and acquire a second class to progress in alongside your first. This makes character building more unique and provides you with access to new playstyles that incorporate different skills. In addition to this, finding shrines and offering them the right item rewards you with points with which you can progress in a Path of Exile-style map of passive effects ranging from small stat boosts to useful procs and playstyle modifications.Finally, the loot system and available gear consists of item tiers typical to the ARPG genre, but some rarer items heavily impact specific playstyles to the point entire builds can be centered around one. This, coupled with the fact no item is class-restricted, means your character can develop in several different directions at once to suit how you want to play. Grim Dawn is visceral, addicting and packed with eye candy that will satisfy for a long while. Stay tuned for its proper release, but don't hesitate to buy now to experience the game yourself.			"

												Grim Dawn, the hidden gem. With all the hype of AAA games nowadays, it is easy to miss the release of smaller games. I am grateful I got recommended Grim Dawn, as this is an excellent ARPG. The game design is super impressive, with the subtle changes to the game world, to make it feel like you are making a difference, the intelligent and organised UI to the beauty of the world itself. This game is fantastic for its price. I give it 9.5/10. Well done Crate Entertainment, you have a new Fan.Pros:- 6 Classes, you get to pick two which makes your actual sub-class. (Soldier + Nightblade = Blademaster etc.) 15 Total. + The Devotion Tree (almost like a third class).- Massive Customization for Skills- Playstyle is unrestricted from class. Play how you want to play. (Firebreathing Dagger Warrior? Duel Wielding Pistol Demonologist? No problem) - You can see physical changes to game world after completing certain quests. (I love this one)- NPC Voice acting feels real. (main quest only)- Can be played online with up to 4 people. PvP is an option for servers. (Also works on Hardcore, although Permadeath still applies)- Can trade between characters and other people online.- Singleplayer / Multiplayer can use the same character.- Massive amount of items & crafting.- Armor & Weapons have different skins and effects depending on the item.- Easy Weapon Switching + Hotbar Switching.- UI has neat tricks. (Auto Show Loot Filters etc.)- Account Shared Warehouse (for loot transfer) + Personal Stash- Teleport system for quick travel and trading. (Can make a Personal Rift (Portal) from anywhere.- Multiple difficulty levels. (Normal, Veteran, Elite, Ultimate) + Option of going Hardcore (Permadeath) aswell.- Grim Dawn is Mod Friendly. Neutral (Can be both depending): - The game is abundant with RNG. Items & Skills.Cons:- NPC Voicing only in main quests and could be completed.- No character customisation. Limited to Female or Male.- Game sometimes crashes, (not often, three times in 40+ hrs + has auto report crash function)Conclusion:If you are a fan of Diablo or Path of Exile or would like to get into the ARPG genre, this game is for you. For its current price, it is definitely worth it. All in all. Phenomenal game.Don't forget to rate this review! "

												I love this game quite a bit. It's probably my third favorite Hack and Slash RPG ever after Diablo 2 and PoE. Why? Because it understands what makes the genre so great and so beloved by so many people, and it delivers on all that. Like most ARPGs, the story is nothing special, and isn't really the main focus here. However, the world that the game is set in is very unique and intriguing. It's sort of like the old west mixed with fantasy and the post apocalypse. It really reminded me of the world of Stephen King's Dark Tower series, and that in no way is a bad thing. Grim Dawn's world is, as you might imagine, dark and grim and desperate, and that desperation comes through in the world design and in the people you talk to. I also think that this game nails something that most ARPGs forget about, and that is the actual role playing. While only a few NPCs are fully voiced (this is clearly a budget game, and is priced as such) most NPCs have interesting things to tell the player about the world and their place in it. Furthermore, there are several points in the game where you have to make choices, for instance, whether to trust a certain person, whether to hire this blacksmith or that one, etc. Some of these choices are minor and others are more serious, but they all feel important and weighty when you are making them. But the gameplay is really the star of the show here, and the reason why you are buying Grim Dawn. And it's great. Your hits feel meaty and visceral. Your enemies are fiercesome and unrelenting. Your skills feel useful and powerful, and there's a real sense of progress as you level up. You are given tremendous freedom in leveling up your character; you choose two classes to specialize in as you level up, and then can choose freely from both of those classes' skill trees. The great thing is that all of these classes feel interesting and fleshed-out on their own, but when you have the ability to combine any two, you get some truly unique combinations. You can be a powerful warrior who swings a two-handed weapon and throws molotov cocktails. You can be a gunman with dual pistols and a pet raven. You can be a battlemage with a sword in one hand and a spelltome in the other. Pretty much any combination of classes and/or playstyles is viable here. I don't think I've played any other game that offers so much freedom in how you build your character. You might worry that because this is a budget game that the loot system might be bare-bones, but that isn't the case. There's tons of different weapons and armors that can have tons of magical properties, and that's not even counting the game's rare and legendary items. Whatever type of weapon your character uses - pistols, rifles, one or two handed melee weapons, magic off-hands, you name it - the game has tons of variations on it. This is game is a spiritual successor to Titan Quest, and like that game Grim Dawn also has crafting materials that you can combine and add to your gear to give you new skills or better attributes. I could go on and on about all of the various things that this game does right but I'll just say this: Grim Dawn is fantastic and if you like Hack and Slash RPGs, you must own this game. Even if you've never played a Diablo clone before, I think that you would enjoy this game if you give yourself some time to learn the gameplay systems. Grim Dawn is, in short, a masterpiece of the genre.			"

												If you are on the fence about this game, just get it, i have 700 hours played and i see myself getting many more. It class customization is huge, for example, there are 6 classes, you choose 2 of them, each class has atleast 2 types of damage, and some have 3, they are also releasing an expansion soon thats bringing 2 more classes. If your thinking you are just gonna go play D3 instead, don't, D3 has 1 or 2 sets per class that are viable, but there are sooo many more viable combinations and variety in this than in D3. This game also has an intriguing story line and decisions actually change what happens in the future, and can change the story in some minor ways.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm not typically compelled to write a review, but after playing about an hour and a half of Grim Dawn, I'm totally drawn in. I was a huge Titan Quest fan back in the day, and it's great to see this format of ARPG in top form.Grim Dawn is basically Titan Quest mixed with Bloodborne, and the combination is pretty intoxicating. It's a bit rough around the edges (some clunky UI and voice acting) but from the little time I've spent with the game, hits hard where it matters. Really satisfying combat, compelling classes and systems, fully realized world, and most importantly, controller support. What surprises me the most is that the game was made with some constrained resources and circumstances and with a relatively small team. Congrats to Crate and I hope this thing takes off. It's a really fascinating game.			"

								I can sense it; you've come here for asylum after getting man-handled and betrayed by other action rpgs, and you lie awake at night wondering, ""Will I ever love another action rpg the same way again?""  Don't lose hope, you WILL love again, and your love may blossom as soon as THIS VERY MOMENT.  After all, the night is always darkest before the dawn, and Grim Dawn will make you praise the sun once more!  What's good about Grim Dawn?  I'll try to avoid direct comparisons to other games in the genre, but here are some of Grim Dawn's highlights:+the game feels impactful.  Every strike against an enemy is accompanied by a satisfying thud, and ragdoll animations send enemies flying all over the screen in tiny bits+there is near infinite levels of customization.  The game awards you plenty of skill points, but not enough to to able to invest in a wide variety of skills.  You'll have to plan carefully and pick your favorites, which increases replayability.+There is a hardcore option.+There is multiplayer+There is a huge variety of loot.  +Making a functional build requires thought.  +crafting exists.  If you're having trouble finding the item you need, you can either craft one using a blueprint (which you can loot randomly), or by having the blacksmith craft a random piece of gear. +There are plenty of side areas to explore.  Exploring is almost always worth the time, since you may find unique bosses or Devotion Shrines which grant you points to use in your devotion skill tree.  +multiple difficulties are available to the player.  Every character you make progresses through normal, elite, and ultimate difficulty.  Once you beat the game on normal difficulty, you can play Elite difficulty with that character, and once you beat Elite, you can play Ultimate with that character.  +The world changes in meaningful ways as you play.  Your choices in sidequests have a lasting impact on your game, and aiding the npcs in town may cause them to treat you differently. +Factions exist in the game.  For example, the first settlement, ""Devil's Crossing"", will only tolerate your existence at first.  As you prove yourself to the settlers, you will gain access to new quests and new equipment sold only at that settlement.  By contrast, enemies also have factions.  The more that a specific enemy faction grows to loathe you, they'll throw tougher monsters at you. +the game is moddable+The plot is extremely good for a game of this genre. +Last, the developers of Grim Dawn are extremely receptive and transparent. So what are some of Grim Dawn's flaws? -drop rates for rarer items are low.  I personally like the droprate though.-Even on pc's with good specs, some people have framerate issues with lots of enemies.   Some users do not experience this issue.-stash space is limited.  If you are willing to mod, this is a non-issue.-it takes FOREVER to reach ""nemesis"" status with enemy factions (this is the highest status possible). Overall, the game is a solid 9/10.  If the developers can manage to further optimize the game and improve framerate, I would give it a solid 10/10			"

												Complete list of reasons not to buy Grim Dawn:1.  You don't own a computer.2.  You don't like ARPG's.That's about it.  Everything about the game is solidly well done.  The skill trees feel like fun, meaningful upgrades.  The combat animations are rewarding, and I mean that turning something was once a large fanged monster into a pink mist with your big hammer feels like you'd want it to.  It's well polished.  Abilities do what they say they'll do.  Bugs probably exist, but I haven't experienced them.I played it for about 40 hours so months ago and felt like I got my money's worth, got bored and put it down.  What made me start playing it again?  Well, I re-installed Diablo 3 the other day, and it made me miss Grim Dawn.  Diablo 3 feels like a Zynga game compared to this.I suppose the question you're really asking is ""But how does it stack up against Path of Exile?""  And that's a reasonable question.  In terms of quality, I don't see where one is better than the other.  The meaningful difference is simply that while Path of Exile aims for a sandbox-y feeling emphasizing customization by randomizing absolutely everything, Grim Dawn takes a much more traditional, structured, approach.  I couldn't really say one is better, but I prefer Grim Dawn.Probably the only criticism I have the game doesn't really innovate at all.  You've a few classes with skill trees, you can dual class and use 2 skill trees, and there are shrines you can find that give you points to put in a secondary skill tree system.  There's loot with stats.  Better stats let you hit things harder and kill tougher things to get better loot to kill tougher things.  It's arguable how much that matters.  I want something more innovative, but I recognize that most attempts to re-invent the wheel end up wrecking it, so I can't really blame developers for just creating a really good standard wheel.So, the bottom line is:  I bought it, played it, and enjoyed it.  If you like ARPG's, you'll get your money's worth out of it.			"

												Great game. Despite the tag, doesn't feel like an indie to me; everything is crisp and well made. I only have minor complaints, mostly issues of personal preference. Not actual flaws with the game design. I enjoy PoE and the Torchlights, but for my time Grim Dawn captures my attention far better.No cheap deaths or useless skill selections, unlike Torchlight 2. Has a variety of endgame builds and choice, unlike the narrow builds, unnecessary ""complexity,"" and illusion of choice in PoE, though you can definitely still screw up.I perused the negative reviews to see if there is anything I could address. Just about every one is pretty laughable. Two people with 1200+ hours giving negative ranty reviews rambling on about PoE. You had more than 50 full days played on a game before you realized it was bad? You paid $25 or less for 1200 hours of gameplay; even if I hated a game by 1200 hours, it was still compelling enough to keep me playing all that time and warrants a recommendation (unless the game is entirely different than when the player played, in which this game is not). Bunches of people complaining about enemy hero difficulty or energy regen problems who clearly couldn't be bothered to choose their skills a bit more consciously or stack some regen stats/skills, and not try to facetank hard hitting heroes with low defensive stats.All in all, I had a blast playing this ARPG and will come back to it for DLC and random playthroughs in the future. Best $15 I've spent on Steam in a while.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been following this game for years, and have been playing since the first available released Alpha. It has come a long way, trekked through many zombie infested bugs. It has true potential to be a successor to the Titan Quest series. The Dev's are friendly and listen to most of the community and the community has been mostly awesome back. Dev's take bug reporting seriously and will remedy a BIG patch with each build update, unless there is a serious bug that breaks gameplay they will push one out fast asap. The game just keeps getting better and better as time goes. I dont play it all the time, i do go on a week like binge and take a break here and there. Yes everyone knows its a Diablo esque hack & slash loot game. I see no problem in that. Just lots of SHINIES! :DGameplay - Its improved and fantastic!Story - Is very interesting (probably matter of opinion because some spots can seem bland) with a good amount of lore in between. Soundtrack - its perfect, goes with the atmosphere of the game.Loot - is ever improving and some amazing stuff drops yet the loot table is not even 10% available at the current build!Classes - Whether main specing or dual specing its impressive to see what kinds of character builds we can come up with and what skill combos we can do to make our characters pretty unique.Multiplayer - OMG we have multiplayer! Its a little buggy at times but we have multiplayer! And its fun!P.S. Dont let your friends break the game making OP characters, my friends are no longer friends XD			"

												In early access I said this game was already a top contender for best ARPG sense Diablo 2's Lord of Destruction. Now well out of early access and looking at an expansion in the hopefully-not-too-distant future I can say without a doubt this is the best ARPG I have played. The loot system feels rewarding for a single player game without it being too easy to aquire loot or too hard to get the items you need. The lore is strong with a H.P. Lovecraft vibe and well written characters. Highly recommend this game to any fans of the ARPG genre or wanting to give ARPGs a try!			"

												Grim Dawn is an amazing ARPG game, built on the Titan Quest engine. With all the best elements of classic and newer ARPGs, such as Diablo 2, Path of Exile, and Torchlight. GD smartly avoids the tedious mechanics present in some games (PoE), and the way D3 forced you into certain builds if you wish to be viable at the highest difficulty. GD's class building system is extremely customizable, with its multi-class system and giant devotion tree on top of that. The class building possibilities are extreme and you will find yourself comming back again and again starting new classes and builds to try out. Hopefully finding a playstyle or 2 that suit you well, you will be in store for about 100hours of content, through 3 difficulties. So you will be playing through the same world / map at least 3 times. If this is a big problem for you, then some of the more randomized ARPG games might be better for you. Yet the designers of GD have done a good job at keeping it interesting and exciting, with higher chances of more Nemesis bosses spawning as you progress through the difficulties, and of course the LOOT you will find better shinier gear as you move up from normal - elite and finally ultimate where the majority of epics will be found. There is also a faction reputation system, allowing you to buy useful items from faction vendors as you gain reputation completing quests for them and killing their enemies.The loot is always an important factor for ARPGs and this is another area the devs have excelled at. The loot is varied and many pieces have their own usefull skills. Playing a soldier / demo / nightblade but want to summon pets to fight with you? You can do that, provided you find the right items. There is a crafting system which is the standard fair and includes an extrensive socketing system with components which you collect, combine and craft into more powerful components. Eventually culminating in what is called Relics, the most powerfull of which will take you many many hours to be able to complete and bring powerfull benefits to your character. It is my opinion that GD, is the gold standard for ARPG games, it's basically what fans of the classic Diablo 2 wanted out of Diablo 3 without the online-focus. While online play is definitely available and working in GD, it is a very fun game with a group of friends (4 player co-op). Beware though, the more players and effects on-screen the more powerfull of a computer you will need. Even with high-end hardware, I need to turn down the settings in-game when I plan on playing with friends who use a lot of special effects. (lighting, effects). I have also experienced very rare crashing, about 3 or 4 times in 150 hours and this only when I was multi-tasking having multiple other applications running. Other than that there are of course few others issues with the game, somewhat limited inventory space specifically early on. The over-abundance of trash loot, which if you are a compulsive looter might be annoying trying to vendor everything all the time with limited inventory. Certain bosses, feeling over-powering when playing specific class builds and certain crafting items / components seeming particularly hard to aquire. GD's faults overall are very minimal and easily over looked when compared to the fun gameplay and depth of content.Get this game if you are a fan of Torchlight, Diablo 2, Path of Exile. Consider passing on it if you already have and enjoy the game design of Diablo 3, as this isnt your casual friendly ARPG with class-based loot drop systems and speed-leveling. There is also a full expansion being developed if support for the game is a concern of yours, you can rest assured the devs are still at work and supporting this product. Mod support is also open, with many creators working on new classes, items and game balance for your customized desires.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Crate Entertainment Publishers: Crate Entertainment Initial release: Feb 2016Genre: ARPG, Loot#Worth/NotWorth: #SortofWorthBSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): Every ARPG ever. Diablo/Victor Vran/Torchlight/Van Helsing and the like but namely Titan QuestExposition, Concurrence and SummationNow, Grim Dawn is an APRG. Should you not be familiar with this genre tag it basically equates to a dungeon crawler wherein you control one character, kill monsters then apply skill points into a specific tech tree or build of a certain style of play. All the while trying to land some, and please excuse my verbiage, “sick drops and hawt loot” in order to kill stronger enemies faster; rinse and repeat. Grim Dawn is from Crate Entertainment which is comprised of old members of the now defunct Iron Lore  Entertainment who are responsible for Titan Quest. The remnants of that system are still quite apparent.To be upfront, I'm slightly dismissive of this game because the way I see it. It's a very good “one of those”. And doesn't really do a ton to stick out above the rest. Here are some complaints in comparisonOften, the argument I hear against what I'd considered to be the most recent and prominent ARPG, Diablo III: Reapers of Souls is that it takes away proper character building. Allowing the changing of abilities and runes at will with no cost. Well, I'd argue that Grim Dawn does the very same; re-specing is basically of no cost (should you not posses the iron bits or aether crystals, it's nothing a few moments of grinding can't fix) and can be done at any time back at devils crossing which you can  return to at no cost and at will stay from Chthonic Rifts which are rare. An additional thing about classes is that in Grim Dawn the classes are chosen after starting a few levels into a new playthrough. Each class uses a spirit gauge regardless of what you decide to level into; Dual class or not. As an example, in Diablo 3 the Demon Hunter alone has 2 gauges to pull from and must be managed throughout play and style of build for the abilities chosen to be effective. This isn't a real complaint, it just is sort of antithetical to this idea of proper classes being something that you need to build and somehow the ability to change that build quickly negates it's enjoyability. Another thing is that is takes a very long time to even remotely level deeply into one class. I also had an issue and this is another small complaint but I feel it should be said, there is very little direction for objectives to be completed. By the end of the game I had so many side quests I was unable to locate and had leveled past that they were literally spilling off screen. A little direction would have gone a long way. But I digress, Grim Dawn is again a very good “one of those” so if ARPG's/Dungeon Crawlers aren't your thing this will not change your mind. However the game does have full gamepad support. So during your tenure of monster slaying you can get real lazy bones about it. Additionally, through the weapon sets and control schemes you can essentially have four hotbars at your disposal. The art style is very nice looking, the environments diverse. There is some faction play which is relatively interesting but doesn't hold a ton of interest in the long haul unless you become deeply involved with the narrative. It seemed very “not Diablo” to me. I wish there were more cut-scenes to be honest. They adopted this sort of Darkest Dungeon look, a sort of Gothic cartoon that I'd have loved to see more of. THE GISTGrim Dawn is a good game, I just don't think it's as inspired as it has been made out to be by Diablo 3 detractors. If you are looking for a Torchlight replacement that's a bit more “adult” and dark. This is it. Follow my curation for more "

Do you like Diablo I and II? So you know Grim Dawn. No? Well, you should!Before you begin read, let me say that I will make a short review. Long reviews take the pleasure of discovery!Unlike this review, Grim Dawn is a game that you know will be long. Despite the rapid introduction with you surviving the unexpected and forgetful, the game has long texts (some dubbed), with every detail of this world and explained dramatically motivated missions. This can scare the novice in ARPG's this kind. Especially the assembly of your character, the amount of power'ups, weapons, armor, spells, special attacks, is huge and as if this were not enough, your character does not have to follow a pre-established trend (classes, professions or races). They exist, of course, but you can choose more of a trend, or path, or simply, after all ready process, reallocate skill points. The possibilities are very varied. Same!The story of Grim Dawn, as the name warns us, is very hard and sad. Sometimes bothering. Demons, undead, natural evil forces, ancients spirits. All this seems to have destroyed life as we know. And the places look all destroyed and abandoned of human life. You are a kind of chosen who survived a possession experience. Now you help those who saved and you and earn your trust, making increasingly dangerous and difficult missions. There are rescue missions, destruction, killing or collecting.The art of GD is stunning and thorough. The scenarios you visit are very well looked after in every detail. The destruction and appearance of evil seen everywhere is clear and thoroughly planned, as the paths where you can walk and where you cannot. The models both the character as the enemies are incredibly well done. The items in addition to carefully designed, when equipped appear in the character changing their appearance. Amazing! The monster design itself draws attention to the variety of creatures.The sound is immersive and dense. The songs are wonderful! Some seem Orchestral other acoustic, or heavy metal guitars. All with a very somber mood. The effects are also first-rate. Do you recognize the kind of monster that is in an area without even seeing it. Some dialogues are voiced and the voices are good. Not fantastic, but they are good quality.The gameplay is as I said: Diablo II, mostly. The game takes you a lot with the assembly of the character and crafting. And loot, loot, loot and more loot! There are portals that facilitate their progress around the world, as you will want? Back a lot to places to sell loot and buy items. It's a huge world! Beautifully decorated for the apocalypse!A single default hanging over our heads in GD. The story is so dense and sad that sometimes becomes unattractive and you will skip some text or get a little bored.If you like big games and that make you go terrifying scenarios to look for loot, Grim Dawn is waiting for you!Art: 9/10      Sound: 9/10	        Gameplay: 8/10	       Fun: 8/10         Total: 8.5			"

								Pure ARPG goodness and bliss. The game is like an onion with more and more features unlocked as you play. Before you know it, you have a very deep, engaging ARPG on your hands. The character progression rivals Path of Exile's and is better in some aspects. The builds are almost endless in scope so you won't see as much cookie cutter (though cookie cutter isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as there are other optitons - and, boy, are there options). The maps are huge and varied with as much to explore under ground as there is on the ground. The story is solid with actual choices that affect a lot of gameplay. There are even factions to grind rep with that give you access to gear and other helpful items. Have I mentioned the bounty board that each faction owns? Bounty boards give you access to more difficult quests without a lot of help from quest text that offer more xp and rewards. Think ""daily quests"" mixed in with the monster hunting from FF12. The best part? Crate is giving access to their builder which will allow player's to make their own enemies, maps, stories, items, dungeons, etc, basically increasing the lifespan and depth of an already endlessly deep experience. I cannot reccomend this game enough if you are a true APRG, dungeon diving			"

It's a 10/10 from my side ... I have no clue why this is less than €20.00, it already entertained me more than many of the so called ""AAA full price"" titles.			"

												TL/DR:Easily the best ARPG on the market today, and easily in my top favorites of all time.I give it a 10/10 - not something I do often. It's got a few minor flaws, but nothing I consider to seriiously detract from the game.Real review:What with this review having been originally written when the game was still in Early Access/Alpha days, I knew I would eventually need to update it. I chose to wait for 2 particular milestones:200 hours playedActually beat the main story.I originally put over 100 hours in between Alpha and Beta, and mostly set the game aside for a while after that, to allow myself the ability to return to it 'fresh' after the full release. My main character on release has cleared the main storyline, along with most of the side quests, tracked down every shrine in normal, etc. It's taken I think about 40 hours or so, and I tend to be a map-clearer, plus farm on occasion and get distracted.So, if you plan to obsessively full-clear the game once, you're looking at 30-60 hours of play depending on your play speed and style. IMO, that alone is a decent amount of play time for the price.For an ARPG, Grim Dawn has a fairly solid storyline, I mean, it's no story-driven JRPG or the like- but it's a little bit better than ""Hey look, BBEG, go kill it and save the world."" Followed by the expansion going ""Oh, look, even worse BBEG that we totally didn't know about, go re-save the world!""Without spoilers, or spending an hour explaining it, you start out an expendable goon being sent to your certain death to prove yourself to a small community of survivors. Stuff ensues, you find yourself in the middle of a war between otherworldly factions and eventually get sent to stop a ritual to summon an Elder God in to the world. Once you stop the ritual though, the war is still going. The immediate danger may be passed, but no rest for the wicked.They launched with 6 base classes, for a total of 21 possible classes. Each of the base classes plays similar to some classic ARPG fodder, but most have their own spin on it. Unlike Titan Quest, each of the base classes stands alone pretty well, for at least a while (eventually I suspect that you will start to suffer for sticking to 1 class, probably somewhere in the 40-60 range), and none of the class combinations feel supremely broken or underwhelming.There's a ton of room, both as far as storylines and in the world itself for expansions.They also have a faction system. In addition to the 2 BBEG factions, there's a number of additional lesser evil factions, and a few various survivor factions- some of whom are at odds with eachother. Lower reputation with the evil factions makes them spawn more bosses against you. Higher reputation with the survivor factions unlocks quests and unique items for purchase, plus discounts on wares from that faction. It's pretty simple, sure, but it adds another layer to the world.Original review follows:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The ARPG genre has evolved over the years. I was introduced to it in the days of Diablo, yes the original, and have beeen addicted ever since.I've played a good number of them, only a select few have grabbed me the way Diablo did. My top three of all time are Titan Quest, Diablo 2 and Sacred- in no particular order, I love them all for different reasons.While only in Alpha, Grim Dawn may find itself with a rare honor. Being named my favorite ARPG ever. I don't name something my 'favorite' lightly, because my mood may change, or there may be something this other one did better so I like it better for that. Grim Dawn is no exception, but the parts I do like are vast and done super well.Grim Dawn plays like Titan Quest, no surprise same people and same core engine. It's fast paced and chaotic, bodies fly everywhere. Unlike Titan Quest, it actually likes to challenge you, you run in to bosses that actually slow you down and make you rethink the ""run in and hit it until it dies"" strategy.The class system is definitely a throwback to Titan Quest, only improved. You select your first class when you ding 2, and at 10 you can select a second class. On launch there will be at least 5 masteries, which translates to 15 potential character options, and each one of those has several build options.Unlike Titan Quest though, in Grim Dawn your masteries are all complete classes and you do not NEED to take another to actually be able to play the game. It is balanced such that any combination is a viable build, and even most build options within each combination are viable.Loot, they've done away with the crappy 'broken' items, limiting it to only 'non magic' and better, which come in 5 flavors. Magic, Rare, Unique, Set, Legendary. Magic items have 1 or 2 enchantments on them, but can have really good enchantments, Rares have multiple enchantments but don't have the same maximum power as magic, sets and uniques are self explanatory to anyone who has played an ARPG, Legendary are basically uniques on crack.The world is one of my favorite parts of Grim Dawn. Victorian Post Apocalypse with an occasional light steampunk aesthetic. It's gritty, it's dirty, you feel like it's really a world that's been attacked and nearly destroyed. The dead are piled like they've been given up on, bodies are burned to prevent them from coming back, buildings are half destroyed. Survivors are taking refuge in a prison, because it's one of the most secure places left.The economy feels apocalyptic too, even basic items are expensive, and the currency is no longer gold, it's iron. A staple resource needed for many things. While the game has iron coins, I like to think of it as scrounging scrap bits of iron from those you defeat and trading that, coins are simply used because ""Iron junk"" is kinda an odd currency.There's a few minor issues with the game, but I'll wait to reserve judgement on the negatives until after the final game launches. In the mean time, I consider even the alpha alone to be well worth the $30 it costs. I backed it on Kickstarter for $85 and consider myself to have already gotten more than my money's worth out of it.			"

Early Access Review
								Genre - Fantasy/Steam Punk Action RPGI was put under peer pressure to buy this game as I couldn't see if it was worth it with Path of Exile on here, getting regular updates. However, I am glad I invested in the early access as it is different enough to be a whorthwhile purchase.I did a quick survey on the discussions page where people rated it against several other action RPGs. The general feeling was it was in most people's top 3, especially as everyone dislikes Diablo 3, which I actually enjoyed as a single player experience.You get more character customisation here than Diablo 3 but not the amount of Path of Exile. You pick one class and then later on pick another to make a hybrid. A simple but effective concept for making the character you choose. Although PoE Ascendecy is doing something similar now.It is fun to play single player and I haven't tried any multiplayer yet, but I don't tend to online with Action RPGs as you get too many loot grabbers.I think if you had the choice I would go PoE as it is a completed game and free, with cosmetic pay to look good options. If you want a new Action RPG to trial then your money won't be wasted here. This game has potential and I feel I will definately get my monies worth overtime, but whether it ends up in my top 3 Action RPGs is another matter...			"

												A lot of love was put into the development of this game and it shows. It offers the very best of the genre, providing fantastic build diversity and character development depth whilst also offering a satisfying set of mechanics and great combat - something that you must, up until this point, have chosen either one or the other in this genre.Plot is decent, if somewhat lacking in focus and general flow but it is better than most ARPGs. Writing however is great and the game really shines in the smaller stories it tells, which add in building this fantastic world.The biggest plus for me is the fact that you can play this game offline! No more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers killing off your HC characters and no more desync ruining your experience. I'm not the person who has played games like PoE or D3 competitively so the lack of a competitive scene does not effect me in any way so this is a BIG positive for me.My one criticism is that many skills are very similar to each other in playstyle (at least in the early game), and many skills just augment the basic attack which, to me personally, is very boring. However, the Devotion system does add a new dynamic to these skills and it does emphasise the minor differences between skills, so this criticism may be unjust.Also, modding tools are to be released so time will tell if a modding scene will exist but if it does, then any question of longevity will be eliminated.

Early Access Review
								A promising ARPG that has set its sights at surpassing the Diablo franchise, offering the old-school ARPG formula and mixing it with new gimmicks such as Constitution (health regen based on how satiated you are), Devotion (another layer to character progression and building), Factions with the Reputation system and many more. The gothic setting, with a pinch of Wild West and post-apocalyptic atmosphere, appeals to my tastes much more than the mythologies presented in Titan Quest. It is still a bit rough around the edges (for example, the intro and ending cinematics are missing, the NPC's are not voiced, some bugs remain to be squashed and the overall balance of the game is not finite yet), but that won't stop this gem from reaching its full potential once the game exits EA in February next year.If you are a true fan of hack 'n slash approach to the ARPG genre, with a couple of innovations to freshen it up and a nicely crafted world to explore, and if you're aching for some loot hunting, then this is the game for you. Buy it and enjoy the best bang for your buck, you can thank me later.			"

Early Access Review
								I have never been compelled to write a review for any game and I have been playing pc games since the Commodore 64 came out.If you could take the good parts of the Diablo series, Sacred series and Titan Quest and combine it into one game you would get Grim Dawn.I have played over 1600 hours and still haven't scratched the surface yet. There are so many builds I want to test and gear to try out. It really is amazing what a small group of dedicated developers can make. Even though it's still early access the game is very polished.This game has grabbed me the way Diablo II did. And that was the last game I was truly addicted to. For me the biggest plus is replayability. Diablo III didn't have it (not knocking the game but replay value was low for me). As I stated I have 1600+ hours in and not even close to being bored or wanting to take a break yet.If you have enjoyed Diablo, Sacred, Titan Quest, Torchlight, PoE etc you will enjoy this game. And for $25 it's probably the best game investment you could make.			"

Early Access Review
								Grim Gawn is very fun, and from a guy who didn't like other ARPG before ( Diablo 3, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing ), I think that means something.I'm not 100% sure about the setting of the game but basically, Aetherial came,♥♥♥♥♥♥happenned, end of the civilized world. Your character got posessed by Aetherials but, as the peoples of Devil's Crossing were about to hang you, the Aetherials left you alone, for some reason. So here you are, with mad powers and ♥♥♥♥♥, to save the day!You can level up your character in two different classes and each class have enough skill so you won't be able to get them all. This allow for a great customization of your character along with with the items that can help you improve your build even more.And one of the best thing in my opinion is that the stats system is not totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Your stats climb linearly with levels. The three main attribute are Physique for health, Cunning for physical damage and hit chances ( both yours and your ennemie's ) and Spirit for magic damage and energy. You'll probably end up maxing one or two but you'll have to find something in your build to make up for your lack of health, hit chances or energy.Hero Monsters are also something I thinks is very fun. They are like small bosses with unique name and design and most of them actually feel like they have an unique twist.On top of this, Grim Dawn is set up in a dark world with well done characters, complex backstory and factions, amazing areas to explore and secrets to discover. If you are into ARPG or want a new game with a nice dark setting, you should try this!			"

												I've been playing Diablo 2 for the past 3 or so weeks and then decided to spice things up by giving other ARPG games a try, and so I came back to Grim Dawn.Let's get one thing out of the way - I think Grim Dawn is a great game environment and story wise, it's a game I was expecting Diablo 3 to give us. Dark graphics with terrifying aspects, great and appropriate variation in music regarding areas and a great variation of character skill trees, splitting between them having it simple, yet complex at the same time, so you have the opportunity to create whoever you want, adapting to any playstyle with a lot of variation.The first 30 hours were fun, but at the same time, I was kinda peeved by the fact that gameplay/loot/leveling mechanic wise, it feels like a revamped Titan Quest game, which don't get me wrong, from the developers side it is good, they took inspiration from Titan Quest in that regard, seeing that it's way easier and a lot more adaptable to play, with more possibilities and flexible character creation, compared to a lot of other ARPG titles of it's time (Diablo 2 for example). I think that was the right choice, at the same time, it took me some time to look past that, seeing that they did keep a one con of the Titan Quest game, which is that once you have a set character at the middle game with the playstyle you were aiming for, you kill everything in sight, except for some high burst damage/tanky enemies that you either don't notice in the high numbers of enemies later on, or you just don't react quickly enough. Additionally, because of this you try to buff out one ""skill tree"" and just a few skills from it to have a good combo and rotation between them so you don't die. The issue with this is, if you are new to the game, you just wanna jump in and go on killing stuff while creating your character and don't take interest in any of the atmosphere they put so much effort in, you will get bored by level 30-50.My suggestion - try a different character, with a different/opposite approach and try getting yourself interested in the story, give it some time and play it with a new look and some fresh air, you will have fun with it.If you give this game a try and read the different pieces of lore, pay attention to the environment, story, characters, read dialog and so on, you will enjoy it and the ""Normal"" mode of the game is going to be a nice breeze through, after that I'm guessing you move on to the actually start of the game: farming items, trying out different skill trees, etc. (Haven't beaten the game yet, can't tell you.)Compared to let's say PoE - you're not as dependable on the community and it's not as much of a grind. Depending on what kind of ARPG enthusiast you are - casual, medium or hardcore player - you will find this game worth your time, unlike PoE, which is difficult to get into in my opinion and eventually just makes you want to give up, unless you are set on trying and retrying different gear/gem/skill sets and have the time to grind for them.In short, this is a great ARPG title, especially from indie devs, seeing that they took the inspiration and best qualities from our favorite titles. This is a game you have to appreciate in whole, otherwise - you won't enjoy it.			"

												I play a lot of ARPGs. Over the years, I've probably lost more time hack n' slashing than playing all other genres combined.That being said, Grim Dawn is fantastic.There's great build variety, choices to be made that effect the world, and piles of great loot. I would recommend this game to all fans of the genre, and anyone who likes RPGs in general.I need to wrap this up so I can go start all over again.			"

Early Access Review
								One of my favorite games in the genre.The soundtrack, the environment, the artstyle, everything about this game is dark and gritty. People are comparing it to Diablo 3, but this game doesn't take a page out of Blizzard's World of Warcraft artstyle that looks like it came straight out of a Disney cartoon. Instead it tries to show you a bleak world where there is little hope of a better tomorrow.The story isn't spoon-fed on a silver platter, but instead small notes you read along the way really set the tone of the game. SLIGHT SPOILER: It starts with a sense of mistery. You WANT to know what happened to fallen kingdoms, forgotten cities, destroyed families. The notes you read at the start only give you clues to the events that befell the world around you. It really grabs you and immerses you into the world (if you actually try rather than just mindlessly killing things). This isn't an ""MMO"" like Path of Exiles or Diablo 3 claim to be. Instead this is more of a single-player game WITH multiplayer elements (CO-OP). Even in its early state this game is worth the money since it already has a large amount of playable content that will keep you entertained.The gear is great, the abilities are fun, and combat is good. I did experience some crashing when playing in CO-OP though. Overall, if you like this genre and like the dark setting Diablo 2 had and enjoy a decent story then this is definitely a purchase you can't pass up.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is really awful...First of all it has loots. Many loots... I have found white, yellow, green and blue loots, so many that I got confused. I know that if blue and yellow loots fall in love they will make green loots, but what about the white ones? Are they just really old?Also, the game is very violent. I took a stroll just outside of Devils Crossing and a giant insect/bug came out of nowhere and threw up bile and acid in my face. At first I thought it was an accident, but whwn I moved to the side it turned and did it again... The only way to make him stop was to kill him. I'm a pacifist, and I just wanted to give the poor thing some pepto-bismol and get on with my questing. For some reason everyone in this game is very angry and just want to pick fights with you. You will also meet people that come out of the ground. I guess they are dead and has risen, but it's not very realistic... I have seen pictures of Jesus when he was resurrected, and he looks all handsome with wavy hair and a well kept beard - these guys looks like they fall off the ugly-tree and hit every branch on the way down.I have searched everywhere the game lets me so far, and I have yet to come across a unicorn. All games should have atleast one unicorn!! If you don't know, unicorns are awesome, they look just like horses - only they have a big shiny carrot on their forehead. Unicorns comes in all colors, and I would really like to find a pink one because pink is my most favorite color in the whole world. I guess unicorns will be coming in the last part of act three.There is also a lack of romance in this game. I play video games to escape reality, and in real life I'm not very good with the opposite(or the same) gender. Therefor I was disappointed when I couldn't find a special someone to share my nights with. This is also something I guess the devs will make available later.The game has some good things going for it though. Water for instance. If you squint really hard and look at water on your screen from about an inch away it looks almost wet. I also like the sound of rings falling from mobs as it reminds me of my cooking timer. I like food. This is good.Last, but not least - I would like to say that the game would benefit from some more customization. I would like my Demolishionist to sport a nice Lacrosse turtle-neck, slim fit jeans and perhaps some RayBans. None of these options are available. I found some helmet-thingy with sunglasses attached to it, but they looked more like protection a welder would use, nothing Prada about them.TLDR; Awesome game, just buy it and never look back!This is what Diablo III tried to be, and more!It's still in early access, there is no end-game, and yet it's the most fun I've had i years. I love this game.Can't wait to see it progress and mature. GOTY 2015 - easy.			"

								I played this game for over 1000 hours and it's still in early access!I beleive that the strenght-s of this game are :1.  Really good itemization --> Sure there is epics and eventually we will get legendary items but ""rare"" items also have a chance to be the best in the game with good affixes!!2.  Exploring is part of the game. In fact whether you want a specific component or a specific Monster Infrequent item or a specific challenge, there is specific location accross the world for them all!3. Build diversity! There is a lot of build diversity that WORKS! With the upcoming Shaman, this will be even better. And later on with the Expansion (which is assured from the Kick Starter!), it will add even more diversity / more masteries!4. Depth.  We can talk about the mechanic of the game, build diversity, or even the upcoming Devotion System which will add another layer of customisation for the skills!!! Yes this game as quite a nice lvl of depth and I like that!5. Rogue-like Dungeon. We got one yet, Step of Torment. But we can expect to have 2 others :D ... Also we will get a Survival mode which will send the players against increasingly difficult waves of monsters !!<3  Grim Dawn  :) "

												Grim Dawn is a fantastic ARPG with a unique design and very interesting, almost lovecraftian, lore.While the game borrows heavily from the developers privious game, Titan Quest, Grim Dawn has added several new features and improved privious features, such as the new crafting through the Blacksmith. While the game is still in development, it may be too early to list any pros and cons with the game as issues are being fixed constantly. However, if the final act(s) of the game are anything like the first 2 then Grim Dawn would be a strong contender for the best ARPG of all time, along with Diablo 2 and Torchlight 2.			"

 Great ARPG, but with certian flaws.	 Crate entertaiment are the same guys behind Titan Quest, which was a love letter to D2, and so it Grim Dawn. Positives:+ Deep customization. Rivals PoE (Path of Exile) in terms on customizability.Level 2, you choose a class, level 10 you choose ANOTHER class, doubling your skills, ablities, and creativity.You also have another layer ontop of it, called DEVOTION, which is well thought out, 'cause it rewards you for exploration.DEVOTION is another big skill tree which adds passive skills ONTO your active skills.You can also add stat points onto your character. It's really dull, 'cause you only got 3 stat points and you get 1 stat point per level up.Physique (Health and armor)Cunning (Damage)Spirit (Magic damage and Mana) + Lots of replayablity.Your first playthrough will get you to level 40, but the level cap is 85, so you got lots to progress towards.Lengthy campaing consisting of 18-22 hours + Has co-op. Negatives: - Environment.Areas in this game can feel very samey, leading to repetition on long play sessions.""Oh, I'm in a green forest, oh I'm in cave, oh I am in another forest, oh I am in another cave, oh I am in a crypt,"" yadda yadda. - Optimization.Everyone has iffy frames on different kinds of builds, even mine 970 with 8350 chokes really hard, dips to 30's and 20's.This can be damaging to certain people who want to play 60+ at all times.Main culprit I can think of, could be that they are using same engine they used in Titan Quest (PathEngine) which is already old. TL;DR	Long and replayable ARPG with more customization than you could ever asked for, low side for having repetitious enivorments and enemy variety with♥♥♥♥♥♥poor optimization.Worth buying full price.

 Review of: Grim Dawn  ~ by Silvio  The successor to ""Diablo II"" I've been waiting for over a decade! Little overview for all you nice people reading:- 1) Overall- 2.1) Character-creation in Main-Menu- 2.2) Character-creation In-Game- 2.3) Character-Info In-Game & Difficulty- 3) Factions- 4) Recipes (also: Crafting)- 5) Story and Voice-Acting- 6) Conclusion 1) OVERALL: Now, what does this game have?For me, it's dark.Like Diablo II dark back in my childhood.From its ambience, the soundtracks, the graphics.When my character hits someone, it feels heavy. Like that ""I-connect-my-fist-with-that-monsters-face-violence"" heavy. 2.1) CHARACTER-CREATION IN MAIN-MENU: There is not a lot of selection going on when you first start the game up to create your character. Which isn't bad in my book. I'm not playing Skyrim here. Dis an ARPG yo!You can enter a name for your character, you can choose between male and female and if you want to go hardcore.If you go hardcore and get your character killed, you will be notified that ""You are dead"" and you will respond via button with ""Okay"". After that your character remains as a ghost on your character-list (not able to be played any further). 2.2) CHARACTER-CREATION IN-GAME: There might not be a lot of selection during the character-creation.But......damn.When it comes to choices how to develop your character? These developers hit the nail on the head! You have the freedom to choose between six classes/masteries:Soldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade, Arcanist and Shaman.You need to put skillpoints into a mastery first, before you can access its skills. For every point put into a mastery, you get buffs for attributes, health and energy (da new/old-mana thing). You best look here for more in-depth information:http://grimcalc.com/ Exactly at level 10 you can choose a second class to complement your first choice. But that is optional and completely up to you! There are enough skills in just one class which want to be maxed out to cause devastation. You get 3 skillpoints for each level (just 2 at level 50 and on). Maxlevel currently is 85. But from what I understand (and I don't understand much - haven't enjoyed a lot of education) the developers want to create an expansion. So maxlevel might get a raise there. You get 1 Attribute Point for each level. Attributes are: Physique, Cunning and Spirit. The Items. DA ITEMS! They range from (in that order and in increasing rareness (that a word?)): White, yellow [magic], green [rare], blue [epic] and violet [legendary]. You can equip items in the following slots: Helmets, chest-armor, leg-armor, boots, bracers, shoulder-armor, belt, 2 rings, necklace, relics and ribbons. They can give you access to unique skills and you can add to them... Components. There are so much of them. It's like sand on a beach only with diamonds instead of sand. Every component is unique and again, they can give your character access to unique skills with which you can bust these monsters nuts in.For more depth about this topic best look here:https://gracefuldusk.appspot.com/items Devotion: As if picking two classes from six available ones were not enough, you can devote your character to certain paths. You can gain so called ""Devotion-Points"" by cleaning shrines. Once cleansed, you gain a point.I should note that you can set skill-/devotionpoints back for a price (Iron - the ingame currency) at a vendor. I found a lot of iron so I assume that's no issue. Only problem is, that you can't redistribute attribute points and no masteries/classes that you have already invested points in, since you can't respec the points put into a mastery. 2.3) CHARACTER-INFO IN-GAME & DIFFICULTY: The developers included a lot of information about your character that you can check upon at any time through your inventory/character-window. You will find it necessary. Especially when you hit the next difficult modes after ""normal"": Elite and Ultimate. With each rank of difficulty your character suffers from a 25% penalty to some resistances (resistances are: Fire, Cold, Lightning, Poison & Acid and Piercing, Bleeding, Vitality, Aether, Stun and Chaos).If you're playing on normal and find it to easy for your likings, because you're to pro for that♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can switch to veteran mode. Harder enemies, more heroes, more loot!Vereran mode is not available on Elite- and Ultimate-Difficulty anymore however. It's veteran enough there, you power-hungry being. 3) FACTIONS: You can side with factions! There are eleven in total:- Aetherials [hostile by default]- Chthonians [hostile by default]- Conley's Gang [hostile by default]- Devil's Crossing [friendly by default]- Homestead [friendly by default]- Kymon's Chosen [hostile or friendly; depends on a choice in the game]- Order of Death's Vigil [hostile or friendly; depends on a choice in the game]- Rovers [friendly by default]- The Black Legion [friendly by default]- The Outcast [hostile or friendly; depends on a choice in the game]- Undead [hostile by default]If you're an enemy to a faction and gained enough hate (through killing members of that faction or fulfilling quests with factions hostile to them) a nemesis will spawn. These beings will blow your character away like a firecracker if you are not prepared. Now I might not have enjoyed a lot of education, but I have never met an enemy that powerful yet rewarding like a nemesis in a game!If you have gained enough trust with a faction, you can waddle-daddle to a ""faction-vendor"". He, she (or it) will sell items unique to them. Like... 4) RECIPES (also: CRAFTING): YUS!There are recipes in game. You played Titan Quest? You know what I mean!If not, let me explain:You find a recipe through farming (busting monsterheads in over and over) or through methods mentioned before.You read it and then its knowledge is saved forever. You can access it as often as you want. No real need to find it a second time.If you have the right ingredients (that you have to farm and gather first as well), you can craft whatever that nice and beautiful looking recipe promises you.At a smithy. Now theses NPC's have special bonuses unique to them. So wherever you craft your thing via recipe, these bonuses will be applied. 5) STORY AND VOICE-ACTING: The story is nice, I guess. The game is set in Victorian-times (for my defense > no education). I don't want to tell much (if you are even interested in the story at all) but you start as a ""Taken"". One being which's body has been invaded by a powerful spirit called an Aetherian. The ones who ruled the earth before they have been banished by the gods of the humans.And now......NAOW they want IT BACK!And it is up to YOU to stop them!But overall I have to say I enjoy the little notes you can find here and there. They add alot to the atmosphere and tell you how it came down to this apocalypse.The Voice-acting is nice. Main characters will speak their lines. Though most of them seem a little to silent for me. Might be just a problem on my end. So that's no minus there.Bit of a problem can be, that, if you are playing multiplayer, only one of you can talk to a character at one given time. So if one accepts a quest, it is not readable for you anymore. 6) CONCLUSION: Overall, I have to say my thanks to the developers here.Obviously my paid 24,99€ are not enough to compensate for the fun you have given me, so I wrote this review to tell people about what great of a gem you created with your dedicated work.Seriously, every punch I do ingame is like a massage for my soul. Whenever I had a stressful day, I just gonna play.Grim Dawn.			"

								From someone who loves the ARPG genre, maybe too much, this is one of the best games out at the moment - even in early access.  The gear and character customization has much more depth than Diablo 3, but isn't as overbearing as Path of Exile. Three friends and I bought the early access and are having a great time running around, getting very interesting/exciting gear, and smashing enemies. The one who didn't like Diablo 3 at all loves this game. The one that really hates how complicated PoE is loves this game. For me, the one who likes them all... I love this game. Get it.			"

Posted: May 9, 2016
												Hello all and welcome to my review of Grim Dawn. This game is a third person aerial view action game where the object is to save the town/world from a menacing invasion or two. Like mostly all games of this style, there are four flavours of bad guys; your peons, which are there to die in droves, your lieutenants which soak up some damage, but are otherwise disposable, heroes which usually soak a lot of damage and dish more out but not extremely so, and bosses which both deal out and take a tremendous beating. When you level, besides the attributes you can increase Mastery level or skills. You have a limited amount of points (255); you might hear people whine that “I need more points for this build”. Ignore them; just realize that there is a budget in this game for your points, and that you can’t always get what you want. But if you try sometime, you just might find you get what you need.One thing I would like to point out if someone is interested in this game; there is no ‘right’ build nor is there a great need to find one. Certain skills are meant to work together with good synergy and you can choose a less-optimal skill selection, but if you want to play a certain style you can. For example, a ranged character is just as viable a character as a melee character. A ‘tank’ can play just as well as a ‘DPS’, if a bit slower at times (I’m assuming that you if know what a ‘tank’ is, you know this already).There are also many builds out there, “perfect” builds where “this build absolutely needs these 7 purple items of lvl 75 to work”; ignore these people. If a build requires Nemesis to work, it’s not a build. What I would recommend is have an idea of what you’re looking for in a game (do you want ranged or melee? High armour or high deflection/maneuverability? Slime and snails or puppy dogs’ tails? Thunder or lightning?) Most classes can do most things well enough that in Normal/Veteran you won’t be that put off. By the time you hit Elite, either you know what works, you can find out what does, or you make a new char and try that; it’s all good. I have played multi-player with friends and I find that quite fun and highly recommend it if possible. Pro’s:•	The ability to play how you want (within reason)•	Fast paced•	Lots of different bad-guy selection/abilitiesCon’s:•	In Elite/Ultimate, gear dependency increases and efficiency becomes more important•	Some skills are pointless (or ‘not as efficient’) to increase above one point•	Much higher requirements to get heavy armour than to get ‘magic’-type rings or amuletsOverall, I highly recommend this game. It’s not perfect, and there are things that could be done better, but it’s a fun game to play and I enjoy my time playing it. The first act is very good for easing someone into the game. The classes are all quite different and all provide something fun and exciting to try.			"

Early Access Review
								I waited until I had over 300 hours in the Early Access version of the game so I could give it a fair opinion. The game is excellent. Especially if you like ARPG's such as the Diablo series, Path of Exile, Titan Quest, Nox, etc. Fans of hack and slash RPG's will be more than satisfied with the purchase. There are now all 6 classes in the game as of Build 27 and each one has a distinct style of gameplay. I chose the Soldier for that old school sword and board melee feel and I couldn't be more than happy with my first character. First, the obvious comparisons to the other giants in the genre. The game feels a lot like Diablo 2 with the Diablo 3 improvements such as blacksmithing, heroes, nemesis mobs, etc. Whereas D3 was more of a go-faster, kill as fast as you can while hoping you have the resistances to avoid this chain of boss mobs and Path of Exile leans more toward competitive gameplay, Grim Dawn has that explore, kill, dirnk a  potion and continue feel of Diablo and D2. It also has larger acts and a loot system that rewards you often (and just enough) to help you build a character you are happy with much more quickly. There are also is a deep modification system that allows you to make your gear fit your gameplay style. I never felt like I would never get the gear to make a certain build and I did not have to follow a certain build to be able to finish certain content. Currently in Early Access the game is worth the purchase price. It is complete through ACT III and I experienced no crashes and no bugs that killed my immersion or frustrated my gameplay. The graphics are excellent for an ARPG with enviromental damage, destructive enviroments and spell effects. Plus the devlopers have promised more polish. While on the subject of the developer I would like to add that they have continously fulfilled their promises throughout development. Crate is a very small developer at this point and have been extemely transparent and communicative about the game. It is not a game you fear won't reach full release or continue to be supported with additional content.One thing I wanted to address in previous reviews I have read stated that there was no voice acting in the game. There is. While the quest and lore content is not voice acted you will hear the familiar, ""That skill is not ready."" and various shouts and chants from the enemies such as ""Kill the non-believer!"" throughout the game that make it feel fully complete. There are not hours and hours of lore and quest text so do not be daunted thinking you will spend more time reading than playing. It is a true hack and slash with multiple systems to modify gameplay that gamers have come to expect.As you can tell from the review I have been very happy with my purchase and if you can pick it up on sale it is even more worthy of a buy. Hidden areas, large game map, crafting, faction and reputation rewards (including quests), excellent loot and an interesting setting with highly varied mobs all combine to make it a worthy competitor to the other, more well-known ARPG's on the market right now.

												Titan Quest was better than Diablo 2 in many ways.Grim Dawn is better than Diablo 3 in almost every way. What gave me pause was how similar Grim Dawn is to the absolutely stellar Titan Quest. So after four hours or so in to the game, I looked up Crate Entertainment, the guys and gals behind Grim Dawn. Turns out that they're made up of a lot of the people behind Iron Lore, the company who did Titan Quest and Dawn of War: Soulstorm. Why is this relevant (besides me being happy that this gives me everything I love about Titan Quest)? Because with Grim Dawn it shows that these guys have done this before, and done it well with Titan Quest. Dawn of War shows that they are familiar with the Games Workshop IP. And this all ties in to the big statement as to why I love Grim Dawn:It's like Titan Quest and Warhammer Fantasy decided to mate to breed the perfect child. Is Grim Dawn perfect? No. Is it almost perfect as far as ARPG's go? Yes. I would even say that it is the better of them. It is much better than the Diablo games (I love those too, so this isn't bias), it is better than Titan Quest (the world feels more vibrant and steeped in history than even the historical-fantasy setting of it's predecesor) and it sure as hell beats out all of the other Diablo Clones I have placed since Diablo 1 came out.It follows the same formula, but I feel like it is better balanced, with a better setting, a cooler plotline, and much better skill/stat progression. And do also like how every stat is useful to every class. And thus far I like every skill I have unlocked.TR;DR: Buy this game. It blows Diablo 2 and 3 away, and is also better than it's ""predecessor"", Titan Quest.9/10, which is SOLID for an early access game. I cannot wait for the finished product.UPDATE: Now that the game is finished, and I have about 90 hours in the game, I can say that this game is an absolute gem.			"

Early Access Review
								From the people who brought you Titan Quest comes another great ARPG. It's currently in early access, but there's a lot to do in game, as they just released the first part of Act 3, and multiplayer was added a few patches ago. The first thing you will notice is how fun combat can be. A common issue in ARPGs is boring combat. As fun as Diablo 2 and PoE are, the combat can feel very boring. In Grim Dawn when you attack stuff you see the enemy corpse really take damage, you see the gore and the corpse fly off depending on what you hit them with. The sounds are also good quality which helps make each hit you do feel powerful and rewarding. With good combat, the return of Titan Quests unique skill system, and a dark world to explore, the game is very much worth buying even in early access. The devs are good about responding on the steam forums and their own, so you can easily follow the development as this goes towards release.			"

												I sit in my office, sippin' a bourbon and smokin' a gasper, thinkin' about some hop-head I put in the slammer last night. He kept going on about a Mr. Grim. Said ""I might throw his keyster in the jug, but I'd get mine when Mr. Grim came knockin' around."" Well I gave him a good bit a chin music for throwin' around empty threats, and he clammed right up. But something wasn't right, sure some snowed-out dopester's usually on about some crazy malarky any time I pick 'em up. This felt different, and it was making me sweat, so I decide to make a trip back over to the joint, see what he's on about. Just as I drain my glass and flick my butt in the ash tray, this leggy dame walks through the door like she's giving somebody a tour of the place. I ask her if she'd heard a knockin' but she puts out her hand and introduces herself, in that self-assured way of a girlie who comes from money. She says her name is Dawn, and she has a case for me. I say I ain't taking cases right now, my library's full-up and until I shut some of them up, I ain't handling any more. She ignores me again and starts chinning about this supposed case she's got.  I'm annoyed but I figure I'll tip another one down, so I pour myself another whiskey. I ain't much hearing her as it's the usual talking about her husband. I assume the cat's cheatin' on the broad or playing the Bruno with her, knocking her around, and she won't have it anymore. That's nine out of ten women who walk through my door anyhow. But it's the opposite. She's complainin' about she loves him so much and he just won't let her go. So I interrupt, saying ""Doll, I don't hear a problem here, you're acting like pulling the Dutch act, why? 'Cause you love a 'fella too much?""But she says she don't wanna love him so much, there ain't else she can think about and everyone who meets him is the same way. She wants me to pop him. I shake my head at her going all goofy on me. Just when you think you met the craziest broad in town, some nut goes and ups her. I'm about to go tell her to climb up her thumb when she slips in the cat's name, ""Mr. Grim."" I nearly flop off my wheels. ""How's that,"" I reply. And she says it again, ""Mr. Grim, surely you've heard of him, he's running the new game in town."" Well, I tell her spit it out about the bird and she does. Telling me when you meet him you start out weak, but he builds you up in whatever way you want. You wanna learn to build things? He's got that. You wanna learn to shoot? Fight? Even give someone the old Harlem Sunset,  he'll show you that too. But you have to work for it, you've gotta complete jobs for him, but it's worth the reward, and when you wanna stop, he'll let you, but only because he knows you'll be back for more. He's running all the people in this town, and apparently I'm next. Well, that convinced me. I gotta find this trouble boy before he finds me. I nod to the broad, grab my coat and my heater and take it on the heel and toe. I knew this one would be different. This Grim Dawn case was going to consume me for god knows how long.11/10 Would hard-boil again.If you liked this review, please check out my other steam reviews "

												****Review summary at the end****I bought Grim Dawn about a year ago, when it was in Early Access. I played it for a few hours, but didn't give it enough time to realize the beauty hidden underneath the upgraded Titanquest game engine.Because, up to this point, Path of Exile has been my absolute favorite ARPG, I follow ZiggyD on YouTube. He posted a video about how the game was just about to be fully released in a couple days, and recommended the game for people who like PoE and ARPGs in general, so, remembering that I had the game in my library, I figured I would actually give it a real shot this time.A few hours in, and I realized this game had a lot of potential. About 43 hours later, I'm now realizing this game is incredible. One of the things that bugged me about the game initially was how my character movement sort of felt like I was gliding over the ground, instead of actually being affected by gravity like someone in real life. It's the same phenomenon you can experience in Bethesda games like Fallout 3 and Skyrim, if you zoom out to third person (haven't played F4 so I don't know whether this has changed). However, this is a very minor misgiving that I quickly got over. I soon realized that the game has a lot of other really, really good things to enjoy about it, and truth be told, the engine ain't all that bad. In fact, I think they did a great job on the lighting and some of the particle effects in the game, especially the blood, vitality, and chaos effects.Enough graphics talk, though!The action does feel very good, and it doesn't take long for your character to start feeling powerful. I feel like Path of Exile struggles with this. While maybe not as pronounced as Diablo 3, Grim Dawn does have ragdoll physics and great sound effects to make combat very enjoyable. There are also nice additions like combat numbers that aren't in PoE.The class system is fantastic - you'll be able to choose a primary class at level 2, and then at level 10 you'll choose your secondary class. You get to combine two of the six classes in the game. Initially, this doesn't sound groundbreaking, but the skill trees for each class have so many different options that it opens up an incredible amount of builds that are possible! I've only made 2 characters so far (one of which was my first one, a year ago), only one of which I really count, so I can't wait to try out some amazing builds!I have only completed normal difficulty so far, but one thing I love about this game is how I have been able to experiment liberally with my build, without being severely punished for doing so. I feel like Diablo 3 makes builds completely trivial, while on the other hand Path of Exile has a ton of amazing build options, but is harshly unforgiving if you make a mistake with your build.Grim Dawn (again, so far - because I haven't played the second two difficulties) strikes the perfect balance between the these two extremes by adding a small cost to each point you refund in your skill tree. This gives you the ability to experiment, but doesn't trivialize character builds by just letting you swap them out whenever you want.Another thing the game has going for it is the exploration. Normally with ARPGs, I reach the endgame quite quickly and start the usual grind. It's to be expected that you'll be grinding for gear in this genre. However, I feel like I get burned out leveling new characters quickly these days in ARPGs. Maybe this is my own fault, but a lot of times there just isn't much reason to explore, so it becomes a race to endgame.In Grim Dawn, the game gives you great reason to explore every nook and cranny, because there are actually secret areas that spawn randomly. These areas may even contain questgivers and new hero monsters to fight, and they must be found by searching around the map for hidden walls and other places that are not indicated by the map. This really makes the leveling process enjoyable, and it gives you a reason to explore the game!The loot is also great. I feel like they found the right balance between frequency and rarity. Fun loot drops all the time, but not so much that it isn't exciting anymore.Summary:Visuals: 8/10Sound: 8/10Visceral-ness of combat/Character combat feel: 9/10Lore: 8/10Class system: 9/10Loot system: 9/10Replayability: 10/10Overall value/bang for your buck: Off the charts!If you like action RPGs, stop thinking and go buy it!

												TL;DRIf you've ever enjoyed playing similar games, then you'll love this. It follows the formula in a fairly straightforward manner, but it's impeccably refined – one of the best, in my opinion.My bullsh*t:I'd had my eye on this game for a couple of years, frankly, but the thought of playing an ARPG in delayed, unpolished segments seemed miserable. After reading that the game was 'content complete' with the release of Act 4, I decided to finally dive in (it was also on sale, which was sweet).To be clear, I love this genre. Diablo, Titan Quest, Torchlight. Loved 'em all. Hell, I even like Diablo 3 (because I think its streamlined nature makes it an amazing local co-op console port, but I suppose that's besides the point). All of this taken into consideration, Grim Dawn, as an all-round experience, is better than some of the most prolific titles of the genre.To start, it offers a wonderfully refined balance between the min-maxing ARGPs of old and the mash-to-win fair of today: the gameplay is modern(ish), character-building is back-to-formula without being too overbearing (respecs are cheap, and the dual-class system, in addition to being damned fun, provides a lot of versatility), and the questing is considerably deep for the genre (a blend of story missions, side quests, and bounties – there's always something to do). The late-game also incorporates Factions, which adds another layer of (admittedly shallow but nonetheless enjoyable) immersion – and a good amount of gear, at that.To the benefit of its well-crafted content, level progression is such that you never find yourself grinding, and gear progression is perfectly consistent, even at later levels.  As a result, the game plays fluidly, offering us junkies a true-to-form “Wiki-this” experience whilst maintaining an almost action-adventure pace. This is in part due to the impressive amount of content, which keeps the game from ever feeling wanting for ideas / challenges. Like all ARPGs, the progression is certainly linear, but this game does a better job than most at making its limitations unnoticeable.  Moving on to the artsy side of things, Grim Dawn looks pretty great. Others have likened the tone and art direction to Diablo (going so far as to label it a “true successor” to the series), but I think it's really carved a style of its own. Unlike other games, Grim Dawn never seems overtly “fantastic” - even as you're having your kneecaps mauled by an outer-dimensional being (borrowed straight from the pages of Lovecraft, mind you). As a result, the early, critter-laden environments contrast brilliantly with some of the wierder sh*t down the line. This grounded atmosphere allows the escalating doom-and-gloom to feel genuinely threatening, which is something I haven't felt since my first encounter with D2; however, unlike the Diablo series, I can't say the game ever felt “scary” at any point. Dark, for sure, but never scary.In line with the game's intriguing atmosphere, there is a clear effort invested in the environments (evidenced by the player's ability to rotate the camera 360 degrees – a rarely utilized but none the less cool and welcome feature). As a result, the environments never feel paint-by-numbers or overtly themed (looking at you, Torchlight 2), and the game does away with the randomly-generated levels of yore that, while intended to keep things ""fresh,"" really just end up being a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The only bit that I'm not terribly impressed with are the characters, themselves. Player models, as well as most other NPC humans in the game, just don't look that great. Passable, but not great. What's more, the gear, perhaps in keeping with the game's relatively down-to-earth aesthetic, just never pops or impresses the way it does in other titles (a disappointing lack of dishwasher-sized pauldrons, for certain), and because of the necessary mish-mashing brought on by the dual-class system, there's never much visual differentiation between classes.I know that nobody really reads this crap beyond the “buy it” part, so I'll go ahead and close this off with the usual: 11/10, would die in aetherial fire again. But seriously, if you're a fan of the genre, this is worth a look, especially when it's on sale. It's business as usual, no doubt, but it does everything just a little bit better.Stray observations:Other downsides? Maybe crafting. Crafting is always either a miserable grind (every title but Diablo 3) or an oft-disappointing time-sink (Diablo 3), but this game manages to make it altogether irrelevant, minus a few relics. Keep in mind, it isn't necessarily 'bad,' but it's the one thing that feels sort of phoned in.Also, I'll admit that I haven't dabbled in the multiplayer AT ALL, and I've read less than favorable reviews regarding this aspect of the game, so if you're looking for a more social experience, I'd recommend checking out Path of Exile (which, despite being free-to-play, is excellent in its own right).

												I'm not a huge ARPG player. If I look at the discussions on the Steam forums I can't understand about 40% of what's being said because I don't know the lingo of the genre. I played Diablo II back in the day and enjoyed it a lot, especially the atmosphere. I also played Titan Quest, and while it's undeniably a good game, there was just something about it that didn't grab me, which is strange considering that I love Greek mythology. Without meaning to sound too harsh, it felt kind of soulless. The game of this type that I undoubtedly played the most was Ultima VIII: Pagan. People don't usually associate the Ultima series with ARPGs, and rightly so, but Ultima VIII was the odd one out because whereas the rest of the series focussed on complex story telling, Ultima VIII was all about the action. Like Diablo II it has an amazingly dark atmosphere that stays with you and it's what kept me playing despite the game's obvious technical issues.I saw Grim Dawn on Steam one day and something told me ""buy this game, you'll like it"". Perhaps it was the cool title, perhaps it was the moody image of the Solomon Kane style character, or perhaps I just felt like trying to recapture some of the fun that I'd had with Diablo II and Ultima VIII. Whatever it was, it served me well, because I absolutely love Grim Dawn. I seriously love it.I suspect that a lot of what I enjoy about Grim Dawn is not what most other people enjoy, and may perhaps be the exact opposite. You see, the reason that I'm not a huge ARPG player is that it seems to me that the focus of those who love the genre is essentially power-gaming. In other words, it's all about maxing out those all important numbers as quickly and efficiently as possible. While I can respect that, I can't ""feel"" it.I'm all about relishing a game. I will painstakingly take my time to explore every nook and cranny, read every word of flavour text, and I'll happily wear inferior gear if it means keeping my character consistent with my vision of him or her (which makes the forthcoming ability to change the appearance of gear a God-send to me; Crate Entertainment know how it is). At this point you might say, ""well, if exploration, immersive-storytelling, and role-playing is your thing, the ARPG genre isn't ideal for you, because it's all about the stats and the loot."" Well exactly, and that makes the fact that I enjoy Grim Dawn so much just about the biggest complement I could ever pay the game.I started on Normal difficulty, making my character choose the occultist mastery at first, and then the demolitionist mastery at level 10 when I had the option—a combo that turned him into a pyromancer. After playing for a little over eight hours, I just had to start the game again with the ""Veteran"" checkbox enabled. I was having such a great time developing my character and exploring the world that I felt I'd be robbing myself if I didn't experience all of these wonderful environments for the first time at their deadliest (at least at the deadliest currently available to new characters). So now I'm a level 35 pure occultist with nearly fifty hours under my belt and I have no reason to believe that I'll tire of Grim Dawn any time soon. In fact, rather annoyingly, I keep having the urge to start yet another new game with a different mastery as cool character ideas come to me. That's an urge that I must resist until I've finished the game for the first time.You know what's rare in gaming these days? Those ""oh wow, that is so cool"" moments. Nineties gaming was fully of that, mainly because genres hadn't been as rigidly defined and had therefore not become as predictable as they are now, and developers were far more experimental for the most part. The fact that I'm now a jaded thirty-something probably doesn't help either. But despite that, Grim Dawn has managed to elicit an ""awesooome"" from me twice now. The first time was when I noticed that I could interact with and use a certain object that I had previously assumed was just part of the scenery. The second time was when I gained the ability to access blocked routes, fully expecting them to lead to a small area with some nice loot, only to find that they took me to entirely new lands, lands that I'm quite sure I have no business being in quite yet. I can't remember the last time that I experienced that good old fashioned joy of discovery in a game.Stylistically, atmospherically, and thematically, Grim Dawn just hits all of the right notes for me. I do love my dark, depressing, and oppressive gaming worlds. I very quickly realised that if there was any game in which you could turn your Solomon Kane, Chakan the Forever Man, and Blood fantasies into an action role-playing reality, Grim Dawn is it. In fact I could swear that the developers have put some sly references to Caleb and The Chosen from the classic Blood FPS games into Grim Dawn. Or maybe I'm just interpreting certain elements to my own liking. Either way, when you're running around in a cowboy hat, wearing a trenchcoat, wielding a pistol and voodoo doll in one weapon set and a double-barrelled shotgun in the other, as well as wielding occult powers, it's hard for me not to be reminded of my beloved Blood series. The world of Grim Dawn is very much like that of Blood—a vaguelly post-apocalyptic horror setting where technology never progressed beyond the 19th century. It would also be the perfect place to recreate Garrett from the Thief series and its dark, steam-punk world. He'd be right at home. Though he would have to give up his professional thieving ways and be prepared to slaughter thousands upon thousands of foes. Oh look, another character idea that makes me want to start a new game again. You see? This is what happens when Grim Dawn makes love to my imagination—terrible and abominable things are conceived.The gameplay of Grim Dawn is flawless from my perspective and throwing a globe of poison at a mob of enemies and watching them rush forward for a few milliseconds before scumbling to the deadly liquid just never gets old to me. The music helps tremendously in the flavouring of the game and is the perfect complement to its gritty visuals and tone. I've seen some people be a little down on the graphics, but they look great to me. Then again I'm someone who regularly and happily plays games from the eighties, so take that statement for what it's worth.All I know is that I'm loving every minute of Grim Dawn and I'm greedily anticipating not only the upcoming expansion, but any future ones too. I really hope there will be more, because I can already tell that this is going to be one of those rare games that I return to for years to come. Grim Dawn is made by people who not only know what they're doing on a technical level, but people who clearly also have a passion for the project. The fact that the game is a work of love is obvious from just how much soul is spilling out from behind every element. The fact that I banish said soul to the abyss with an occult circle of power does nothing to change the fact that I honestly could not recommend Grim Dawn more.			"

												Early Access combined with Indie developers prove they can hold their own against the heavy-weights.  Grim Dawn is a great ARPG, akin to Diablo, Torchlight, Titan Quest and Path of Exile.It is grittier than Torchlight, more refined than Titan Quest, less buggy than Path of Exile and more customisable than Diablo 3. It's good. Really good, even for an Early Access title. If you have even the slightest interest in the genre I highly recommend it.Jimbo Rating: 9/10			"

								Without a doubt one of the best dungeon crawlers available!  This game is still in its very early alpha version, but everything that made Titan Quest great screams out bigger and bolder in GRIM DAWN.  It has been a long time where a game has pulled me in with its story and its ambience, from the momnet you step foot in Cairn you are part of the story, its fantastic!  The multiplayer is set to drop in early 2014 along with the second act but don't let that deter you! This is a brilliant title already and its only going to get better! if you are still hating on the epic disaster that was diablo 3 and need something to scrath that dungeon crawler itch then get in now and become part of the community, I don't normally do these review things but everyone on my friends list needs to get this game it is AWESOME!

Early Access Review
								A great Diablo-like, in the vein of Titan Quest. It follows genre conventions pretty closely despite all the prior talk of the open world and faction system - it is separated into discrete, linear acts much like D2, and the factions are so far more of an afterthought than a central game mechanic. Despite that, it's a lot of fun to play if you're into the genre - combat feels good, and the staggering amount of options you're given for how to build your character give it a lot replay value. Like in D2, some items offer you unique abilities that you can base entire builds around, and loot in general plays a big part in hinting at spurring new playthroughs. If you're like me, it's not rare to find a rare item and have your mind immediately start to consider how its unique bonuses could be ridiculously abused with the proper build.I'd highly recommend it if you like the feeling of your character getting stronger, the feeling of finding sweet loot and the feeling of taking out huge crowds of angry monsters in ever more efficient and spectacular ways. It's a bit easy to begin with, but that at least offers you freedom to experiment - and the game is fully moddable, to boot. I'd heartily recommend this.			"

Early Access Review
								As it stands, in Early Access, Grim Dawn is full of potential to be one of the best ARPGs.  Allow me to give a brief history of the development team, which is comprised of seven developers and some of those developers are former Titan Quest employees.  Since we are on the subject of Titan Quest, please keep in mind that because you may have not liked Titan Quest, that does not mean that you will not like Grim Dawn.  Grim Dawn is not Titan Quest reskinned.  Repeat:  Grim Dawn is NOT Titan Quest reskinned.  It is a completely different action-RPG unlike Titan Quest.  The only similarity that they share is the fact that Grim Dawn runs on a heavily modified version of the Titan Quest engine.  Grim Dawn captures the spirit of the setting with excellent mood, tone, and atmosphere. From the lush marshlands overcome by the walking dead, to the dark, damp caves of the lowering isle, accompanied by the tactful display of gore among the hollowing darkness, Grim dawn sets the mood and tone as you traverse through the hauntingly well-designed maps.  The themes of Grim Dawn consist of medieval and steam punk inspirations that lends to the game's attitude and style.  Whether you're a fan of Torchlight 2, or the fantasy-like Diablo series, you'll find a nice blend of attractive themes that cater to the action-RPG genre crowd.  Weapons and artilery like muskets to shields are within these premises and stick well to the underlying themes.  Given the chance, the player can dual wield a shield with a musket and cause mayhem while taking a physical beating by a horde of monsters using your shield.  The combat sticks to the same ARPG formula that we have grown to appreciate and love from the genre.  Why ruin an established formula that works?  Grim Dawn is just that.  It is not attempting to claim new innovations and ideas.  At its core, it sticks purely to the ARPG formula.  The player can invest points into attributes and skills as they rank up.  The skills is represented in a horizontal matrix intead of the typical ""tree"" design.  This allows you to really customize your character the way you want without making faltering mistakes, yet it allows you to adjust accordingly to your playstyle.  Didn't like the ""firestrike"" ability?  Invest horizontally in another branch of skills and don't waste any more of your points.  When you use an attribute or skill point, you have a chance to ""undo points"" before you finalize it.The musical score in Grim Dawn is rhythmic and it underscores the layered aspects of the game in spectacular fashion.  Any composer and or musical artist that can utilize an electric guitar to capture the sense of dread on a soundtrack and quickly lift you up by giving the player hope in a frenzy of battles has my vote and wallet.  The soundtrack is beautiful and unlike anything I have heard of before in a video game.  Instead, it uses a nice blend of many instruments over the overly used ""epic score"" or immediate type of music that typically tries to replicate an adrenaline-like feeling.  The soundtrack is excellent.The screenshots and video gameplay that have been released for Grim Dawn does not do it any justice.  The graphics and visuals are great.  With all of the video options turned up, you're getting a crisp-looking game with a rich amount of detail.  The video options consists of several high and very high settings (on maximum settings).  Based on this, you know that the developers are pushing the graphics as far as they could on this specific engine.  You won't be disappointed with the aesthethics, considering it was one of the aspects that I was little concerned about, although not the most important.  You can breathe easier knowing that the game looks really great on max settings.  There is are no concerns in this department.Despite being in Early Access, Grim Dawn has a ton of potential to become one of the best ARPGs around.  You can really tell that a lot of work, heart, and passion went into this game's development.  It truly shows in a product that is not even finished yet.  Imagine when it is complete.  I have played Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Torchlight 2 (which I think is the best ARPG to date as a finished product), and other action-RPG, dungeon crawlers and I honestly believe that Grim Dawn has the potential to best these video games in the genre.

												After six years of waiting, four of those since a successful Kickstarter, I find myself asking; was it worth it? Yes. Yes it was. I thoroughly enjoyed my 80hrs romp through the grim gritty post apocalyptic hell that was Grim Dawn :D This was pretty much everything I ever wanted from an aRPG .. Loot. Loot. More Loot. Made by some of the same developers of the legendary Titan Quest, it's not hard to understand why they managed to get the formula down so well, making the experience a true joy to play through and not just an arduous, dull, slog. The visuals were nice, not exactly CryEngine levels of pretty but the art design and overall atmosphere was delicious, and the audio was really good too - though the VA was a bit hit and miss at times. Tons of quests, near infinite replayability due to the Bounty system, and with six classes that can be multiclasses to create more combinations, there's always something to play for. Everything that made Titan Quest great has been improved, in my opinion, most especially the overall feel and weight of combat.My only serious laments would be the frankly appalling performance mid/late game, sadly caused by the aeons old engine being hamstrung with its legendarily bad multicore performance (100% on core0, 0-15% on cores 1-3) and a small dev team without the ability or resources to really pump into optimisation. My system is no slouch, being a 4Ghz i5 2500k and a GTX780, but the framerate dropped down to mid 20s during heavy combat and that is simply unacceptable. Sadly the Steam build also plays host to some nasty anti-piracy ""triggers"" that the devs put in, despite the fact that they're also releasing DRM-free builds on competing services.Lastly, the ending, or lackthere of, as once you beat the final boss.. that's it. Nothing. You barely even get a single paragraph from a quest giver and... that's it. Such a huge letdown after an otherwise fantastic experience. It feels like the entirety of Act 4 was just slapped together too quickly, and finished even quicker.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who loves loot-focused aRPGs, such as Diablo, Torchlight or the predecessor; Titan Quest. Just don't go in expecting a world-class story or any real ""ending"", the obvious goal is the character building.			"

												Not many A-RPGs are being made these days and out of the few available, not many are worth mentioning. I have played most big titles these past years (Diablo III, Path of Exile, Titan Quest, Torchlight I&II, Grim Dawn...) but have been able to stick to only two of them over the years: Path of Exile and Grim Dawn.What I like about Grim Dawn:- It's playable without an internet connection which means no lag and no disconnects.- The campaign is pretty long- The classes are interesting enough to provide plenty of replayability- The gameplay mechanics are pretty solid (not as complicated as Path of Exile but still allowing plenty of customization).- Crucible expansion that finally offers an alternative to playing the campaign over and over again.What I dislike about Grim Dawn:- No real incentive to play multiplayer- The campaign is too long and the game can get boring when playing higher difficulties.- The crucible expansion could have been so much more exciting and is getting boring quickly. - Graphics could be a lot better given the technology we have these days and that the game is mainly offline.In a nutshell, Grim Dawn is a dark themed game with a long campaign. The game mechanics and controls are good and the game was mostly designed for offline solo gameplay, although multiplayer is available via LAN / internet. The skills / attribute system is decent but the devotion system is what made the game more interesting. PVP is, like in all ARPGs, pretty pointless. I love traditional C-RPGs so it's hard for me to love a game that doesn't really have a rich storyline and well-developed characters but the gameplay is interesting enough to keep you addicted for a while. I've played GD for about 700-800 hours over the years and the only regret I have is that the Devs could have made the crucible DLC a lot better and the animations / spells could use some eye-candy given that the game is played mostly offline. If you like laid back solo gameplay and don't want to get a headache, Grim dawn is probably what you're looking for. If you like number crunching, optimization and endless possibilities, then I recommend Path of Exile.			"

												Since comparisons to Diablo 3 are inevitable, I'll just give my two cents about how I feel on the matter. Just note that I play both games exclusively on hardcore.Diablo 3's fun is in the crazy power fantasy of sets and legendary powers. All of your time is spent at level cap maxing out gear and attempting that next Greater Rift. Unfortunately if you want to stay competitive you'll probably have to take a build from the internet.Grim Dawn's fun is all about figuring out a new build with each new character. I never felt the need to find a build online because the game isn't about pushing leaderboards. I feel that the game really rewards people who like to min/max but don't want to get all their builds from the internet.Grim Dawn really is a very different game from D3, but I enjoy both. Do you play a little D3 each season and get bored two weeks in? Afterward return to Grim Dawn for more build experiments and tinkering. To me the games work very well in tandem.			"

								I've always been a big fan of hack'n slash games: Torchlight II, Diablo 3, Titan Quest, Path of Exile, Van Helsing and so on. I can assure you that Grim Dawn is superior to most of them. Despite of still being in early access, this game is solid and already has a dozen of well-designed game mechanics like crafting, factions, and multiple choices quests, which is rarely seen in ARPGs.Pros:+ post-apocalypse Victorian world! SLAY ZOMBIES WITH SWORD AND REVOLVER BAM BAM BAM!!+ 6 different skill trees, mix any two of them to according to your playstyle.+ challenging and rewarding at the same time.+ character development system is free and interesting, and it's not as complicated as Path of Exile's.+ the atmosphere and artstyle is perfect and very immersive. Cons:- it's still in early access (though nearly completed!)- no randomized mapThe game definitely worths $24.99. If you are interested in it, buy it now to support their 8-member indie studio.			"

												I've been playing this for months now in early release.  The developers have always been spot on honest throughout the process.  If they didn't feel the next chapter was ready, they didn't push it out period.  Such a refreshing change.  They didn't rush the development and didn't produce a turd (*cough* Unity and Arkahm Knight *cough*)  The class system is a ton of fun to just tinker with and, as many others have already said, doesn't leave you feeling crippled for choices you make.  Loot drops are satisfying on a whole, gear sets are out there to grind for, bosses to beat repeatedly, and new random ""elites"" pop up more and more in the regular world as you progress and ""earn"" faction hate from undead and others.  So many options and so much flexibility leave this such a pile of good time to play.			"

Grim Dawn is an excellent addition to the Diablo genre. In fact, I definately prefer this to the Diablo and Torchlight series. The whole thing is very polished and creates an overall really great playing experience. The universe that Grim Dawn is set in is really cool and definately has me and my wife hooked. For those that are not familiar, games in this genre basically boil down to grinding for XP and better loot. It's very fun. You crush a dungeon and then upgrade your stuff. The underlying premise is that simple.Pros:+Great universe with metric tons of lore and personality+Everything is very high quality - from the music to the artwork to the game balance (which can make-or-break games like these)+The controller support is awesome+I love being able to multiclass; it breathes so much more replayability into it+I love all the graphics settings - I can play it on my gaming rig in all of its splendor, or on my laptop and still get smooth play+The new DLC is fantastic and even adds more replayability+The user interface is well done; there is a bit of a learning curve for any game like this, but that curve is definately reduced with the intuitive interface+Multiplayer is super easy to set up and a lot of fun+Super cheap for the quality and valueCons:-Some of the voice acting is 'meh', but honestly, just the fact that they have voice acting at all is bonus to me-Yeah it is grindy; all games in this game areIf you are fan of Diablo-esque games, this is a no-brainer.

Graphics looks great although a bit rough on the edges but that's ok; sometimes you don't want a diablo 3 polished game. Good pace, great classes\characters to build and lots of loot :)One thing however: i can't find that cave that makes the game crash ;-) "

												This is not Diablo 3 and it is its best point ever.D3 where everything is streamlined, you are garantee to have loots for your class and chances for dropping lengedaries are fairly reccurent. Grim Dawn doesn't do that.It's back to the roots of Diablo2 where you WILL collect tons of crap but suddenly get super excited that you droped a specific loot. You will hoard tons of stuff for your other characters ""just in case"".Also, a point I love above all, I don't freaking have to be connected to Internet to play. It helps for Steam Cloud save, but it's by far not mandatory. You won't have game server crash on you because it's unstable, you won't have your instance suddenly go poof while playing because the lag spike.This is a game for the ppl who liked D2 and disliked what D3 had become.Plus, multiclassing is quite fun, there are 5 classes and you can mix and match 2 of them. Wanna play a summoner tanker ? Go ahead ! A master of the arcane shamanist ? Sure ! Is all build optimal ? Nope but still you can go and have good 'ol fun with them.			"

As a arpg fan you MUST buy Grim Dawn !And even if you're not ! :)I play GD for quite a while now and I must say I'm enjoying it since the fisrt day, even if at that time the max level was 15 !I always felt the great potential of the game and Crate, an eight guys team with some Iron Lore Entertainment veterans (Titan Quest dev), never dissapointed my hopes and beliefs. Those guys know their works and they always interacting with the community since the begining of the development. Results ? Even in Early Acces, GD is more polished than lot of released games (unfortunately) : Mature, dark and beautiful, the world of Cairn is a wonderful place to hoard your lootsFive very nice classes with great synergies allowed by the dual class system (check the  skilltree [grimcalc.com])a little rpg aspect with some consequences to your choicesa very insterresting Faction system that will start to shine in the next buil (b25)a crafting system that's getting deeper and deeper since the begining with a recipes based crafting for equipment and consumablesa great lore with a variety of monsters and numerous hero monstersthe modding tools coming at release will increase the game longevity... maybe a new ""Lilith"" will come !the game is FUN ! :)and it will be even more fun at release !The only cons for me is the limited stash tabs (4). For hoarder like me it might be frustrating... but mods will save our loots !Grim Dawn took the best of Titan Quest and Diablo serie and add a lot of great additions that make it mandatory in your games collection ! So don't hesitate and help the Crate team because they deserve it. Really.""You are one such individual. Blessed, or perhaps cursed, by the touch of Aetherial influence, you have powers and strength beyond that of normal men. It is now up to you to take this fearsome potential and use it against the enemies of humanity. Will you be the one to save Cairn from its grim fate? Or is humanity doomed to extinction ?ps: sorry for my english !			"

								Short review: Three thumbs up!Long review: Polished and approachable even in Early Access. All the possible combinations of skills and gear make this a highly replayable action RPG even with its linear storyline. The way the monster levels are handled you can easily go back to previously visited areas to level up your character (I hesitate to use ""grind"" as it doesn't feel like that) without getting bored  because you're too overpowered, and they have thrown in a few optional elite areas which you can visit to really test your mettle (and build).Feedback from fans and players has resulted in tweaks here and there, especially when it comes to balancing the skills. There is some work needed in that department still, but nothing game-breaking, especially not if you're a pretty average ARPG player like me.The classes are interesting and have varied skill sets. You can combine two or stay true to one for as long as you like. Thanks to the stash system you can easily transfer gear from one character to another, and you can augment your equipment so you have more control over how they function. Players of Titan Quest will of course be familiar with this (improved) system.You will get more than expected for the Early Access price (and with 50% off it's a steal) and they are constantly improving and adding more content. An experienced development team I was more than happy to support on Kickstarter; a gamble which paid off in abundance and the game's not even released yet.			"

								A truly excellent ARPG, which you can tell is made by true fans of the genre. These folks were part of the Titan Quest team, and I have to say this game eclipses that one. Titan Quest has a great setting, but even if you are a fan of classical Greece this game is better in every other way!Every gripe I've had with almost every ARPG since Diablo 2 has been addressed, along with lots of wonderful and original innovations.It still feels and plays just like most other ARPGs - you choose a class (or two), level up, loot, hack'n'slash (or cast) your way through several acts... yes, it all feels familiar, but in a pleasant way! Even the music is heavily reminiscent of the classic Diablo 2 score, which is some of my favourite game music of all time, but with its own weird west flavour. The world and its lore is lovingly crafted, with some wonderful twists on typical conventions. I'm having a real blast with my main character so far; she is basically a post apocalyptic sheriff with a brace of six shooters dealing out fiery death and lobbing canister bombs at the bad guys!Considering this game is still technically early access (though content complete at time of review), I'd say it already hands down beats Diablo 3, Path Of Exile and every other ARPG I've tried in the past decade or two. Every time there's been an update, things just get better and better.If you're a fan of the genre, this is truly a must-own!			"

			#GrimDawn http://store.steampowered.com/app/219990/ ♦Add me on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/desolater_iv/ ♦Twitter: https://twitter.com/DESOLATER_IV		

+ The gameplay is a ton of fun, espeically if you are a fan of ARPGs like Diablo, Path of Exile, etc. TONS of enemies to slaughter, challenging bosses to face, dungeons to explore, loot to find, and an epic journey to complete.+ A very dark and gruesome atmosphere that really helps to emerse you into the world. Lots of demonic / satanic themes.+ While having co-op features, Grim Dawn is primarily a single player focused game which to me is a good thing. Everything seems to scale around your level as you progress, and every battle seems to be scaled well in difficulty.+ An OVERLOAD of content. You can easily invest 50 hours+ and still crave more! Feels fresh from start to finish.+ The game is very challenging, especially if you choose to play on Veteran difficulty early on. This makes your enitre playthrough feel very rewarding from start to finish.+ Lots of hidden areas and secret dungeons / bosses + At no point did it ever feel like a ""Grind"" even while playing on Veteran difficulty. + There is weight to every attack, and enemies will literally go flying back, dismembered, with loads of gore.+ Large enemy variety which keeps the game interesting. Seems like every area / cave has something new waiting for you to slay.- The story...unfortunetely falls short. It's almost not even worth paying attention to once you get a few hours in. (probably due to a lack of cutscenes / story moments)- You can not reset master points. You can easily screw up your build if you invest too many points in mastery over your skills.- Just a small note, but instead of gold the currency in the game is ""iron""... personally...this just did not feel as rewarding - For the most part, you only use one or two combat skills throughout the game as it's typically a waste of points to invest in others until late game especially considering you must level them up far enough to be worth while.

								Just... easily the best ARPG since Diablo 2. I loved D2 played thousands of hours, this game ive already got 50+ in a couple weeks and im not even 17 anymore.Combat is soooo smooth and fast, charge - shout - blade arc boom, 2 seconds, then in the next instant shadow strike to the next pack of mobs and crush them. You can zoom way out and fight huge armies of monsters at once, unlike PoE w/that super close up awful view.Game isn't super easy, have to pay attention,The feel/look of this game is just so perfect for me, 10/10 easily. This is easily my favorite ARPG and the best game ive played this year.			"

												What Grim Dawn does is make us focus on how ARPGs once were. It is not the fast-paced click-fest leaning towards accessibility that Diablo 3 is and neither is it the complex behemoth that Path of Exile has evolved into. It is a reminder. It is a worthy successor of Titan Quest and a game that, despite using tried-and-tested methods, will scratch the itch of those who cried in disappointment when Diablo 3 came out and not only them. It is capable of appealing to any ARPG fan, because there are plenty of items and sets to discover, there are enough classes to find one suiting your playstyle as there is a world plunged into chaos and darkness that needs saving. For a price of 25 euros, you’ll get an ARPG in the old-school sense of the word that has the potential to keep you clicking for at least 40 to 50 hours and you can definitely do much worse than that.

												I've tried Diablo 3, Torchlight 2 and some others and all of them don't keep me interested unlike Grim Dawn. Usually I play them for a few hours then get bored however I've played Grim Dawn for 44 hours and have owned it for about a week.It has good graphics with a grim art-style with most dungeons being really dark.The controls are good with bindable keys. You can also change your skills on the hotbar (mouse, 1 to 8 and then 9 & 0).The character progression in the game in terms of points is skill points (your points for active skills or passives for your class (also this game lets you choose 2 classes for 1 character) and you gain 3 of these points every time you level up.There are attribute points that you get from leveling up and you get 1 per time to go into either of the 3 primary stats; Physique, cunning or spirit.The last is devotion points which you get from finding shrines in the world. To get the point you either need a certain item, activate it's trap (basically kill a few enemies and maybe a hero) or just get it anyway. These points go into the devotion tab that grants mostly small passives with some bigger ones and active skills.In the world you find rift-gates which allow you to teleport there at any time, which are usually found in / near the cities or in some dungeons.You've got the loot system that has an armour stat, and with how common they are (common, magic, legendary, epic, ect) which give extra and greater stats.The game allows you to do the quests in basically any order you want and you're not required to do them at all, you could just find loot and kill things if you wanted to.This game features multiplayer too. It's mostly a single player game but the multiplayer works really well and I play online most of the time I'm on.Overall I rate Grim Dawn 9/10.There is also mod support coming out soon and there is at least 1 DLC expansion promised to be added.

Early Access Review
								TLDR; More complex than D3, less of a ball-ache than PoE!This is pretty much my take on Grim Dawn at this stage 'b19'. Don’t get me wrong I’m a huge fan of PoE and D3 but I feel GD has managed to plonk itself nicely in the middle.It does still need quite a bit of work though, comparing a beta to two games released for several years is really unfair... so.. stick it on your wish list for now ;)further..There are far more damage types and intricate bonuses than D3, which makes the itemisation really interesting, unlike d3 which is flat and over simplified. But its not over the top complex like PoE.. which after a while just becomes a real ball ache.This translates into an overall more enjoyable experience for me, I really REALLY like the new introduction of more 'stats tabs' revealing more in-depth information, this allows a great overview of what exactly is going on with my build, offering the opportunity to have a good chew at the stats when I want to theory craft or min max, but is simple enough that I don’t have to think too hard about it when I just want to have fun.The ability to modify EVERY ITEM with a whole range of things really is a breath of fresh air compared to D3's socketing system. The 'gems' in GrimDawn's case offer far more variance and innovation resulting in your character feeling like your own build and your own character and not just a copy/pasta of kripps currently build.Unlike gems in D3, the 'gem' can roll a wide range of random stats, meaning you still want to pick them up and collect them for future builds and they are also used as materials in crafting. In GD they aren’t really gems, they are more like bits and pieces of materials you find reflecting well the gritty 'salvaging' wasteland kind of feeling the game gives. Gems to me belong in a puzzle game not an aRPG.The crafting is more complex than d3, but in an 'easier' way than poe, for lack of a better way of putting it. You don’t feel as if its absolutely necessary in order to enjoy the game but there is enough meat n two veg to satisfy anyone who needs breadth as well as depth.Graphically, I LOVE d3, while I do like a gritty envoiroment PoE was just.. I cant put my finger on it, but I really didn not enjoy its style it was trying to hard to be d2. I know PoE players will hate me for saying it, but I really didnt like it! sorry. GD is even more gritty but curiously more appealing to me. The envoirment is highly detailed compensating for the not so detailed player character models. which is fine considering the vast array of gear available. It doesnt have 'random' maps like d3 or poe, but I feel that it is better in the end, since random maps in d3 and poe.. well, they dont seem 'THAT' random and making them random is at the expense of an intricate, detailed envoiroment that a mapped out envoiroment can provide.it IS of course still beta so there are quite a few issues with polish, for me personally the graphics engine needs a lot of work in the optimisation department, which I'm sure will come. If I were to guess I'd say the game is about 60% done. It needs at least two more acts, another 30 or so levels, multi player functionality and.. I PREY it will have some on-line functionality. Titan Quest, which the game is based from, was easy to mod, hack n crack and couldn’t be used for ladders, race's or leagues. I suspect ladders and the like will never be seen in GD, which has its up sides and down sides I suppose. I would dearly love that feature, but in the absence of that second on my wish list would be an in-game version of the TQCollector mod. The amount of items in TQ was Vaaasstt! and I loved doing the collector thing. Much like I love collecting achievements (hint hint)Hope this isn’t too long, I’ve been quite negative about GD in the past and I'm genuinely impressed with the progress so far.Defiantly one to keep your eye on!

								Over 200hrs and counting! This is just as good as Titan Quest and possibly, Diablo II. If you like a true spiritual successor to the genre, this game is for you.Pros:- Classic ARPG style; Choose a build you wanted to play and farm epic loot- Character progression freedom. You take control on how you want to build your character from attributes to skills- Wide variety of itemization keeps you hunting for more gear- Unique faction system offering rewards and access to faction-based gear depending on who you side on- Unique devotion system (skills/passives unlocked via constellations) adds flavor to existing builds- Smooth combat- Good graphics, dark and has real world-like art style- Great soundtrack matching each and every location's mood- Awesome story. the idea that you are not the sole savior of the world is refreshing- DRM free!!!Cons:- Lack of skill animations due to outdated game engine (no jumping, no spinning, etc..)- Crafting system can be improved- Vendors seldom sell good items and often costs too much- No vanity/item enhancement system currently in place (transmog/enchantment)			"

												One of 2016's standouts of the year.  The spiritual successor to Titan Quest and what the Diablo series were modeled after, this game delivers. With 6 classes to choose from and then the ability to dual class after hitting the 10th level, the options seem limitless.  The skills themselves with each class are well thought out and it hardly seems that one is better than the other.  At this point I don't think there is any 1 direction you ""need"" to spec yourself out because every skill seems equally viable.  Heck I found myself holding skill points because I simply did not know which way to go and ended up leveling 5 times before spending any!The mood and atmosphere settings for each locations are wonderfully detailed.   The one complaint I may have is that in some areas it can become extremely dark even with lit torches around. There are things that happen within the game that will make a profound impact to your game.  Rescuing a survivor from the area he may be at may not be the best idea...Although the main world you will be exploring are all pre-rendered maps, there are extra dungeons in which are special challenges that are all very much roguelike and different that require a special key to enter.  Trying to find these places are what makes the game that much  more fun to explore and check every nook and cranny for something cool. I was pleasantly surprised to find sooo much meat on this game to indulge myself with and even after several playthroughs with different combinations of classes, I still found myself having loads of fun.  This game is a must have!

								Grim Dawn, the indie-format heir of Titan Quest, takes its hereditary dispositions and gifts us with a contemporary continuation of the oldschool dungeon crawler-colossus that TQ was. Those of you who are looking for that dungeon crawler that fulfills your biased needs for a nostalgic and yet modern and revised game, have come to the end of your journey. Grim Dawn will challenge your mind and your skills as it used to be and is supposed to be today. The possibility to combine different classes allows the player to craft his own individual synergies and master the game the way he likes it and is not constrained to go a predetermined path, like the developers of Diablo III have chosen for their game to be.The world is beautifully designed, the style and atmosphere of the content is captivating and solely confined by the small budget the games development team(wich is composed of seven individuals) disposes over.It is my opinion that Titan Quest outmatches of what has become of the sequel to Diablo II in many points, and TQ was published 2006, and(!) had the budget of a big company to cover it.Now imagine, if already TQ outmatches Diablo III, how wonderful could a Grim Dawn with a bigger budget become?This is only my opinion, I don't want to offend anyone with it.10/10 for Grim Dawn, please support it as much as it lies in your possibilities.

								It took me like 15 minutes to love this game. One of the best singleplayer experiences in a long time.I have hundreds of hours playing Diablo 2 and 3. And thousands of hours playing Path of Exile.Grim Dawn is so much better than Diablo 3 in every aspect. It looks awsome. The worldmap is huge and is so detailed and just looks hand-painted and very beautiful. I love the music. It has day and night cycles and a wheather-system. Effects are very beautiful and the artwork is dark and dirty and colors are so atmospheric. Grim Dawn lets Diablo 3 look like a game for 6years old.It has a rotatable camera, thats not just a gimmick but really enhances combat and the quest for hidden boxes and stuff. The skill system is pretty deep. Not nearly as complex as in Path of Exile of course, but still quite versatile. Combat mechanics are very complex too, so is crafting. It has a fractions-system, lots of game-changing decisions to make, very high replay-value.I play it on hardcore-mode with perma-death and item-loss and its just as intense as in Path of Exile. As far as multiplayer is concerned, Grim Dawn doesnt have such a brilliant and outstanding ingame-economy like Path of Exile. But as a single-player experience its really hard to top. This game is still in early access but runs really neat. Its rediculously cheap and you get a very nice balanced and polished AAA title for that little money. Its hard to believe this game was made by a seven-person indie team. Cant recommend this gem high enough.94/100			"

It was extremely good and there are so many different types of builds to choose from and it's fantastic!  There's a total of four ACT's to play through, 25 different builds to choose from and 4 different difficulty settings.  The first is Normal.  Then Normal Veteran.  Normal Veteran is Normal, but more monsters per group and more champion monsters show up too.  GREAT for getting those green and blue drops!  After beating the game on Normal, Elite opens up and upon beating Elite, Ultimate difficulty is available.It took me 30ish hours to beat the game (all quests) on Veteran with a Conjurer pet build.  The current build for this game at the time of this writing is 29 and with this build the game is now content complete!  Build 30 is supposed to be the official release and will have achievements enabled along with bug fixes, balancing tweaks and Mod support!  The game has a lot of loot for all possible specs ranging from guns, melee, spells and pets.  After you log out of the game and then log back in all monsters, including bosses, respawn.  You can do boss and elite monsters runs all night long to farm specific gear of your choice.  Speaking of loot, while you're out and about killing monster after monster your bags are gonna get quite full.  You do have your own personal portal to fast travel back to town and sell off or store the gear you don't need.There's also a lot of quests to do too!  Some quests allow you to gain stranded people out in the world to come back to the starter town and build it up with blacksmiths and more quests.  Blacksmiths can make you new gear for Iron (in game currency) and mats.  Mats (materials) are found from killing monsters and drop quite frequently.  Iron and mats can also be used to respec your character, but beware, respec is limited to skill & devotion points only and the price of Iron goes up with each respec.  You can not respec your mastery points (mastery is your class IE: soldier) or attribute points once distributed.  Every level you gain 3 points to put wherever you like until level 50 and after 50 you only gain 2 points.  With these points you can upgrade your class or start picking skills and/or upgrade them.  Once you put points into your Mastery you can not undo those, but if you pick skills for your mastery and decide later you would like to try different skills you can do so.  You also gain attribute points every level too.  These points are seperate from the 3 points you gain for your mastery or skills.  Attribute points are side points you can place onto your character in your character stats.  Once distributed you can not undo these.There are tons of builds online to help you plan a build ahead of time so if you do mess up a build you won't have to start over.  The below link can help you plan out a class build:http://grimcalc.com/Finally, there are devotion points.  Devotion is fairly new and are bonus stats you can place on your character.  These stats include more damage done, resisting a certain damage type like poison and even new skills!  Devotion points are found throughout the world from shrines.  These shrines can be activated from mats or from fighting montsters.  Once Devotion points are placed you can respec them, but with cost of Iron and mats.There are factions in the game too.  Factions will provide you with very good gear to choose from, but you'll need reputation from them for them to grant you said gear.  Rep can be farmed from killing monsters or doing bounties (quests) for them.  This gear is quite expensive and you will have to grind for Iron and rep for quite a while.  Factions also provide scrolls for the blacksmith too so he can learn more types of gear to make you.If you're looking for an ARPG similar to Diable 2, Path of Exile or Torchlight this is the game for you.  There is a story and it's all in text format with no voice acting, but it's something.   Despite the minor flaws this game has it still runs very good and has plenty of hours of enjoyment.  Especially just playing around with all the different builds.  Recommended!			"

Early Access Review
								Grim Dawn is an ARPG heavily inspired by the Diablo series pre-Diablo 3, as evident by the fact that it is nearly identical mechanics-wise to Diablo 2, though improved upon, and the itemization is also very largely identical to Diablo 2's in that low level items are absolutely viable and even sought-out for high level characters. I can safely say this is what Diablo 3 should have been. The grim, hopeless atmosphere is back, the ugly aesthetically displeasing monsters are back, the loot that feels meaningful from level 1 to max level is back, and the absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing awesome music is back somehow.Probably my favorite thing Grim Dawn expanded upon from Diablo 2 is the classes. Each of the 5 (Soon to be 6 upon the full release) classes have clear cut specialties, but the big twist here is that you can combine two of any class together to help shape a specific type of build you have in mind. While you may feel encouraged to play a hybrid double-class character, it's entirely viable and possible to play a pure single class character. It's just really ♥♥♥♥ing great.It's crazy, because the game isn't even finished at this point, and already it feels like it's had more thought and care put into it than the entirety of Diablo 3.			"

This one is the latter.With so many Diablo type games out, I did not expect alot from this one. I was wrong. It offers so many ways to customize your character. The story is good and the game play is excellent.			"

Bear in mind it's still in early access, but developers plan to release the full version later this year (Q4), so buy it then!

												First of all: I bought this game mainly for playing it in coop mode. In reminescence of the old days with Diablo 2 we chose this game and we certainly weren't disappointed. The whole atmosphere is really dark, somehow you cant really believe that everything is going to be okay someday. At some points I had to stop and wanted to enjoy a flower or something beautiful because this game only gives you darkness (the music supports that).The most outstanding feature in my opinion is the shere amount of possibilities to build your character. 6 classes from which you can choose two and freely combine the abilities. Plus the devotion system which you are simply overwhelmed by (might be seen as a contra). And you have no restrictions within the classes, there is no classical ranged combat class or a typical tank/berserker/whatever. Unfortunately you cant always see in detail the love that was put into the monster design. You are confronted with masses of enemies and dont have the time to really look at the bosses which is kind of sad when you check the FB-page of Grim Dawn and see all the neat monster art.  The aspect with the consequences of your choices isn't really dominant. We often talk to people with quests and after a while we notice that we maybe have spoken to them in an earlier stage. Probably made some decisions but we cant remember because the NPCs arent memorable. They are somewhat interchangable and dont stick to you. Overall:+ great game, awesome atmosphere, gigantic character build, satisfying perks and abilities, cool concept art- unremarkable NPCs, a little bit to few weapon designsRecommended.			"

												I bought this game just want to overcome my boredom on the weekend, and i was enjoyed previous action rpg games such as Torchlight 1 & 2, and especially Diablo 2 as my very first PC game when i was in primary school (even though i never finished it). I cant compare it to recent action rpg games like Diablo 3 or PoE cause i am never played it yet everyone compares it and they said Grim Dawn was slightly better. For me it was an good game to play for fun, its offers many combinations of class (20 classes) and devotions, huge world, dark-gruesome atmosphere, nice graphic, crafting and looting with so much prefixes, co-op multiplayers, lot of character customization, hardcore mode, choose factions, and small details that enchance my experience in this game. well all things that you wished for from this kind of genre, but dont expect this game delivers such as solid deep storyline (dont expect witcher 3 story, lol) or online competitive environment.So that if you like spending time to slay numerous monsters with fancy skills, you dont mind to spend hundred of hours for crafting, looting and playing with your friends, and you have been familiar in this genre, this game simply will worth your money. 8/10.

								I have played nearly all of the action rpgs available, past and present.  And by this I mean the very specific isometric camera, third person, loot grind heaven that is my holy grail of games.  As it is right now, Grim Dawn is very high up on the list of my favorites of the genre.Fighting feels wonderful, tactile and with the ""oomph"" you look for in a game like this.  It is also quick and fluid, unlike Path of Exiles (which was really my biggest gripe about that game).  The skills are all fun, and the leveling system and how you pick your skills is a great nod to customization, replayability and feeling like you have control over who your character is and how they play.  I don't play these games for story and couldn't tell you much about this one, other than the atmosphere is dark and, well, grim.  There's a prison, and a warden (a staple of these games now?), and a bunch of dudes that want you to go kill things.  Crafting is actually interesting, a sort of extra bonus to the loot dropping and helping you build your character with the bonuses and strengths (even some skills) you'd like.Wish there was more to it, can't wait for updates.

												Grim Dawn.Man, at first I was iffy on this game. I looked at it back when it first was coming out, and thought to myself. ""Myself, this looks an awful lot like Titan Quest. Remember that game? Yeah, of course you do,"" Then I just passed the game by, because well; Bad memories associated with Titan Quest. Add another fifty hours onto my PoE playtime and my buddy all of a sudden pops up on STEAM playing Grim Dawn. I'm just sittin here like, ""Are you for serious right meow?"" He was; Dead serious actually. Apparently he'd seen a streamer playing it, and decided to pick it up; I'm a sucker for H'n'S games and frankly dual class systems get me wet. So I buy the damn game.Right now I'm sitting four hours shy of four hundred hours played. Which isn't a lot in comparison to the 1.6k+ hours played of some people, holy crap Batman! I've played a grand total between two accounts 1.5k hours in PoE and in my near four hundred hours played of Grim Dawn, I can say that I've had more fun and a lot more success with Grim Dawn than I have ever had with PoE. Let me break down some pointers for you.Grim Dawn{PROS}Has a Single-Player experience, which presents a lag free environment.In Offline(Single-Player) mode there is even a pause button to take a break, or an emergency stop.Multiplayer is not based around a complete server with lots of people, so it's relatively lag free.Multiplayer servers are hosted by players, connection speed determines connection issues. This potentially eliminates rubber-banding or desync issues.Dual-Class system allows for lots of replayability and uniqueness to each individual character you build.A high enough level-cap to get a Godly feeling on a character that's well built.{CONS}A lack of current high end gear makes certain builds feel lacking and not as unique appearing as others. As of current there are only so many classes that a person can potentially create, 21 in total.Current game design has flaws when trying to create 'Movement' skills that don't require a target.While classes feel unique in comparison to like-classes in other games, their skills are rather lacking in when it comes to classes.(Most classes feel similar after a while.)[OVERALL]Great game. Very well done by the awesome people at Crate Entertainment. Can't wait to see what you have in store for us on the other side of that bridge. I also look forward to seeing what the team is going to throw at us as far as new Legendary and Rare gear. Personally speaking I would love to see something like Mythical gear, which would be Orange or Rainbow text. Some crazy epic items that just make your character over the top Godly.			"

												I'm very happy with the overall design of this game.  My favorite features are the large map and lush scenery.  Also, I like how you don't have to keep buying town portal scrolls (like in other games) - you just get to cast a portal for free as part of your basic controls.  The inventory design is a bit retro, with each item consuming a certain size and shape of your pack space.  This adds to the challenge of inventory management.  Another cool aspect is one of the reasons I bought Grim Dawn - the skill tree allows you to combine traits of several character classes instead of being locked into one set of abilities.  For example, I can have close combat abilities from my Nightblade PLUS the option to summon creatures with my Occultist.  The only thing I dislike at this point...is my personal portals disappear when I exit the game.  This means I have to make it a goal to reach one of the preset portals in an area before closing the game down.  Sometimes, it's just not possible - I have to re-clear an area's enemies the next time I boot up the game.  When I have to leave for work, I gotta go!  No time to make it to the nearest area's portal.  I bought this as a huge fan of Torchlight II a similar game which I've put at least 300 hours into) and I'm very satisfied with Grim Dawn so far.  I'll give it a 9/10 with a point off for the inconvenient thing about portals.  I highly recommend Grim Dawn, with highlights for replay value!			"

												By far one of the top games I have ever played. I can see myself logging hundreds of hours on this as I already have 25 within two weeks of owning it and I am not the slightest bit bored or dissapointed. The gameplay is fantastic and like many others have said forms the perfect blend between many well known ARPGs. I have started up 3 different characters so far each of a different class and I enjoy playing each of them equally, theyre simply all a blast to play. The difficulty the game has to offer is great, currently I only have Veteran unlocked but my Buddy and I are going through the game on it and it creates some intense moments. The loot is varied and has in my opinion the best drop system I have seen in a game in a long time. What I mean is the rare items drop at just the right intervals, you dont need to spend hours farming to find good loot but that doesnt mean it drops so often that it takes the fun and excitement away. While I have not yet seen any of the top tier legendary items (they drop at 50 and my highest level is 35) I can say that the variety of loot and the unique skills / attributes you can find really make the games replay value shoot through the roof. Im constantly finding items that completely change or even define the build im working on and thats great. Overall, I am enjoying everything about this game, the story, the atmosphere, the gameplay, the multiplayer, the singleplayer, I literally cannot think of one flaw. Shoutout to Lord Lulz for buying this game for me, best thing I've ever gotten for free			"

								This game is amazing, from the developers of Titan Quest (one of the best hack n slash games ever made) comes another unique addition. This game has very similar concepts with some new ones that again are refreshing and super fun. Most hack n slash games are rather linear on the grinding, but this feels different and fun, as with the combination of the graphics, mechanics and the skills, it literally makes killing shiz quite rewarding. Honestly I don't want to say much more to ruin it, but it's a fantastic addition to the hack and slash genre, it honestly rate it better than diablo 3. + With the recent release of multiplayer, holy moly it is progressing along nicely.

Now where the game unfortunately lacks is in combat, some skills being nothing more than basic attack modifiers some are still really really great feeling and there will be something to fit every playstyle. It also makes up for that with the best imo quest lines and stories coupled with glorious exploration which is what makes this game really really shine. i got 1k+ hours in d3, 5k+ in total on poe and i want grim dawn to be up there with d3 and poe in play hours cause it truly deserves it.

												Until I played this game I did not think that Immortal Throne could be beaten.You can very much feel this games Titan Quest heritage in its play and feel where the music gives it more than a little feel of diablo II about it. At higher levels some of the room clearing spells are just spectacular (Oleksa's flash freeze (Arcanist), Cannister Bomb (Pyro) and Eye of Dreeg (Occultist) are all good examples). Plus you can mix up the character classes harnessing the combined strengths of any two classes similar to the mechanics of Titan Quest.As for loot... I've now got so much stuff that is just too good to sell that I've basically got thirty sherpa's to support my characters.I am still discovering new things about the game (only recently deciding that I actually liked the Arcanist after discovering flash freeze), pretty sure that there are still many places in the huge world that I have not found yet. I see no end to this games replayability.Definitely a game that is destined to be regarded as a classic. "

								Play this game. It is in early access so there are a few bugs but overall very well done. I've played Path of Exile and the Diablo series and I think this is going to be my new addiction. So far only played one class the Occultist which is badass rot your face fun and looking forward to trying out the others.So Really Nothing bad to say about it at all if you like the Diablo type games you should not pass this one up.

												First of all, this made me quit Diablo 3. Secondly, this is one the best ARPG I have played. The core mechanics are praticly the same as Titan Quest but in a kind of medieval era. Grim Dawn also contains some elements of an MMO, like the reputation you gain (or lose) for a faction.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a great RPG game that is related to Diablo III, Path of Exile, and Titan Quest combined. There are so many things that I can say about this game.1. Devotion points are just great. - Adding points give you celestial powers which can even make your build more effective and powerful the way you want it to be. Devotion skill tree is huge and has a variety of stats you can add for your character.2. The components are just similar to how Titan Quest was. - This game is just like Titan Quest but very unique and awesome. You just can't imagine the similarities between Grim Dawn and Titan Quest on how the components were in that game.3. Relics remind me of Titan Quest. - Do you remember the day when you were playing Titan Quest and saw how runes gave off skills and stats well now that Grim Dawn has that content to this game it is so fun.4. Out of all, Grim Dawn is still a pre-released game that will be released in February but when it get released, I just can't wait for it to be released since the game is content complete but the game might still add more content and you may never know there might be exciting stuff in the game that might surprise you. Well good luck to you people who are new to this game and haven't played ARPG games like Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, Diablo III before and I really recommend this game since it's so fun and yet so exciting and interesting in some way. :)Continuing on with the good things I'd said about this game, I'd love to tell you about the Arcanist, Demolitionist, and Nightblade. 1. Arcanist - This class uses PURE Spirit for stats. Uses one - handed weapons such as wands, swords, daggers, or maces. Known as the ""manifestation of magic."" Uses Elemental Damage. Ues Fire, Physical, Cold, and Lightning Damage. Has an advantage of long - range attacks. Uses long range skills such as ""Fanetti's Replicating Missile, ""Trozan's Sky Shard"", ""Albrecht's Aether Ray"", and ""Devastation. The ""Fanetti's Replicating Missile"" is basically the default skill for the Arcanist that can split into fragments which will eventually increase as you level it up. Also it comes with modifiers that will enhance this skill. The ""Trozan's Sky Shard"" is basically a large meteorite that can kill groups of enemies. I would really recommend using this skill too since it has a modifier that can Freeze Targets and enable you to have the advantage of killing enemies long range. I'd also say this would work with bosses too but not all of them. The ""Albrecht's Aether Ray"" is basically an aether laser or beam that you can contiually hold to instantly kill enemies over time. The only thing the Arcanist would suffer from is the Energy per Second that this skill uses. So I'd recommend using an component called Ectoplasm which gives you more Energy, and Energy per Second that will reduce the amount of Energy you use for your skills. Lastly, the ""Devastation"" is one of the ultimate skills of the Arcanist that will cost a tremendous amount of Energy to use. So use it wisely. This skill is basically raining embers of ""raw pure energy"" that will rain down on multiple enemies making them take Aether Damage. I'd really recommend going for Aether Damage, Elemental Damage, and Elemental Resistance for this class since this class is really focused on all the elements. The only thing that the Arcanist suffers from is HP. So I'd also recommend picking another class to get the passives and auras from to support the Arcanist and make your life so much easier when it comes to HP and losing HP causing the Arcanist to die so quickly. So far this is what I know about Arcanist and what it uses for advantage, and the types of skills it uses.2. Demolitionist - Hell yeah, this class is my favorite. This class uses Physique and Cunning. There are items and runes that has a passive that grants the ability to duel wield one - handed guns at the same time. Now, this is what I call a freaking Gunslinger. Phew, phew, phew! Lul. The default skill of this class is the Fire Strike and it does Fire Damage, and Burn Damage Over Time to a single enemy. The awesome thing about this skill is that it has 4 modifiers. 4 Freaking Modifers! Yeah, thats right. Well as you can see the 4 modifers are ""Explosive Strike"", ""Searing Strike"", ""Static Strike"", and ""Brimstone."" I know the first three sound all similar but they pretty much fairly give different bonuses. The first modifer ""Explosive Strike"" gives bonuses to Fire Damage, a Meter Radius so it can damage multiple enemies, and especially more Burn Damage over Time. So pretty much Hellfire on all the enemies that are suffering and your like ""Burn baby burn, yeah yeah yeah!"" Well yeah, once I see multiple enemies getting burned that's what it reminds of. Lol. Alright the second modifier ""Searing Strike"" only works on a melee or two - handed ranged weapon. This modifier grants tremendous bonus to Total Damage, Crit Damage, and Skill Cost. At level 1, ""Searing Strike"" grants +15% Total Damage, +25% Crit Damage, and -33% Skill Cost. I just find this so overpowered that you can literally level up this modifier even more to see the true power of it. Good luck to people who use two - handed ranged weapons or melee weapons who are looking forward to using this modifier. The third modifier ""Static Strike"" says it all. This modifier has a Chance of Knockdown Target, Additional Lightning Damage, and Chance of Dealing Lightning Damage. This is pretty much pyrotechnic. You see what I did there huh. Wink, wink. Alright, the fourth most overpowered modifier of Fire Strike is Brimstone. This is pretty much an occult power. Man, Demolitionist you didn't have to steal the occult's power didn't you? This modifier grants Fire Strike the ability to split into 3 Fragments, Additional Fire Damage, and also Chaos Damage. Wow, look at all those bonuses you can receive if you literally add these modifiers to Fire Strike. This is why I use Fire Strike and this is why I'm in love with Demolitionist. So far this is what I pretty much know about Demolitinist and I just wish there would be more skills to be added for this class so people can eventually create unique builds that will inspire them and show how enjoyable this game can be.3. Nightblade - The freaking assassin. This class has a skill called Dual Blades that grants you the ability to dual wield one - handed melee weapons at the same time. The awesome thing about this skill is that it has 5 modifiers. Wow, 5 modifiers! I didn't really expect that much! So these 5 modifiers are called ""Belgothian's Shears"", ""Nidalla's Hidden Hand"", ""Amarasta's Quick Cut"", ""Whirling Death"", and ""Execution. The first modifier ""Belgothian's Shears basically has a chance to be activated while using your default weapon attack. Just remember to use the default weapon attack with the one that has the sword to see this in action. This skill basically does a 165 Degree Arc which basically spins, Hits Up to 3 Targets, Additionial Pierce Damage, Stun a Target, Additional Poison Damage, and Weapon Damage. It's so much bonuses that I find it so overpowered for a default attack to activate this while killing enemies. The second modifier ""Nidalla's Hidden Hand"" is very different to the first modifier. It basically doesn't proc or have a chance to be activated but it modifies these three modifiers ""Belgothian's Shears"", ""Amarasta's Quick Cut"", and ""Whirling Death."" What the heck? A modifier within a modifier? Where did that come from. Well as you can see this is what the modifier does. Sooo, well that's my point. So this modifier grants Acid Damage, Poison Damage over time, and a chance of Slowing Target. Wow, how Deadly can this be. I guess that was very punny of me to say deadly when it relates to toxic, poison, or any deadly green substance. Well now that I've reached the writing limit, this is what I love and know about the game Grim Dawn so far. Awesome job on the game though and keep up the great work! :}			"

												The devs at crate really went for it and made it the best it could be.  Been playing since beta and replay value is there. The differents combos of builds are extensive. Play pure builds or hybrids. HAck slash, level and loot to your hearts content. Rouge-like dungeons provide extra challenges to test your mettle. Hardcore mode, multiplayer, veteran, and higher difficulties when you complete the game.  Amazing weapons, skills, pets, armor, item sets, the whole shebang.  If your a fan of action rpgs, this is it.			"

												**Note : This is going to a very detailed and lenghty review , so I will put a TLDR at the end of this review. Grim Dawn is an isometric ARPG made by Crate. I first bought this game on my other account back in 2015 while it was still in closed beta. From all the ARPGs I have played, mainly D2 & 3, Van Hellsing, TL2, Grim Dawn stood out as one of the best ARPGs I have played in my entire life. Grim Dawn offers a dark atmospheric world where iron bits are worth more than gold, which is why that is the main currency here. The graphics are amazing. Dead bodies hanging from trees? Checked. Blood and gore? Check. Amazing spells? Checked.Here are the pros and cons I feel about this game.Pros : - Items have skills that can be utilised all the way to late game.          - Awesome soundtrack. Really fits the dark and grimy atmosphere.          - Amazing art and graphics.          - Build optimization. You can build your character revolving around your skills, certain items or your devotion             system. ( A special system where you unlock by slowly restoring shrines in the world. )          - Devotion system actually have interesting concepts. Much like the skill tree of Path of Exile, but instead of              adding stats, there are skills and passive skills you can unlock.          - Dedicated developers. They delivered as promised during their kickstarter journey and made every cent              worthwhile.          - Incredible storyline. Amazing nuff said. Scattered around the world are mysterious journal and notes where you             can collect and gain insight and deepen the lore and plot of the game.          - Did I mention dual class systems?          -♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of secret areas. Omg.Alright, before ya'll get your pickforks and start calling me out for giving only positive reviews, here are some cons I felt the game had.Cons : - Confusing for new players. There are many aspects in the game that require attention to. Physical damage,                         pierce damage etc. There are too many elements and might be confusing for starter players.           - Voice acting. There are only few voice dialogues in the game. Actually understandable because the Crate team               isn't huge and implementing voice dialogues might be a little too taxing and delay updates.           - New content. They recently released a new content which is great, however new content can be a little slow as                                    mentioned, they lack manpower.           -Character customization. You can't customers your characters face etc.All in all, this game is amazing. I bought one during early access and bought another one for my girlfriend to play. This game does not provide DLCs so the only way I feel I could contribute back to the developers is to get more copies. In all seriousness, this game is amazing. Get it if you haven't already. TLDR; get the game. It will make you understand the spirit of ARPG. "

												I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys or is familiar with the ARPG genre.I've been an avid ARPG fan since Diablo II, including Path of Exile, Diablo III and a few others not worth mentioning.This is my favorite one of all.  It's still new, and not finished yet, there seems to still be a need for a little bit of balancing, but I still highly recommend this to everyone.What makes this game unique in my opinion is the Skill tree (or whatever you wanna call it) for example, my first character was a Shaman/Occult summoner.  He summons monsters to fight.  His talent trees support minions. Pretty simple.My next few characters died, and finally I decided to play Standard instead of Hardcore difficulty, because I die alot.  My newest and favorite character so far is a Pyro/Arcanist.  At level 38, so far I only have Arcanist to support my massive mana needs.  He's basically a sniper, who wields fire magic as passive along with his sniping/blowing everything up ability.  For the skill tree, I made it so he generates whirlpools of death (25-30%) chance to proc just by attacking things.  Check that with the abovementioned blowing everything up ability, it's pretty damn fun.He still dies sometimes.  I wouldn't suggest anyone to play hardcore difficulty at this time unless you have an extraordinary amount of patience, far more than me to occasionally charge in and die.  Cause you die really easy sometimes.  And sometimes there's no escape from a losing fight.Diablo II I loved it, but it's dated.  Right.  Diablo III I loved it too, but it was pretty simple and basic.  Path of Exile just kindof infuriates me, because it's not really a hard game, so I play hardcore difficulty on it, its fairly easy, until some random obsurdly hard creature kills you out of nowhere.  So I just can't get myself to play that anymore, the randomness is horrible.I have not yet played multiplayer on this game, but I want to.  The few times I've tried to with my hardcore characters I couldn't find any games.  Maybe standard difficulty will find some.Some of the things I said may seem like downers, but don't get me wrong:  I love this game.  I've only been playing it for a few weeks now and there's been big updates since I started, so they're coming in regularly and that's great.  There's voice acting for a lot of it now, even a cinematic sequence when you start the game.It's worth the full $25.  Great game.			"

Early Access Review
								The game even in early access almost feels like a complete game (besides of course some lacking content and story) it just feels very solid and stable. The gameplay is very fun and addicting which of course is what matters the most. The game keeps on getting better and better with every new update that comes along every other month. I understand there will not be character wipes when the game is released so there's nothing really to lose by playing now. I would recommend buying it and start playing right away (this also helps the developers getting some cashflow - as it's a VERY small team).I can definitely recommend it as is.			"

Early Access Review
								Made from a small group of people from the dev team for Titan Quest, Diablo II, and some other organizations, Grim Dawn is the next chapter in the way we play Action RPGs. The way the game has you roll your character is uniqe in the way that you don't choose your class when you make your character. Once you reach level 1, you are asked to choose one of five different classes to play, but thats not all. Upon hitting level 10 you are prompted yet again to pick a second class the merge with, but you do not have to pick this time if you dont want to. This leaves the game with 15 possible ways to play.The current level cap on a character is 50 but that will most likely take you more than one sit down of the game to level. There is a slight lack of end game content however, at the moment there are only 2 end game dungeons which are quite dificult but can get somewhat repetative. these two dungeons are rouge-like however, which adds an aspect of caution as there isn't a real disadvantage to dying yet. (Rouge-like meaning once you die you have to start at the beginning) Over all, I recommend checking this game out and playing with friends always enhance your experiance. There is easily 100+ hours here for you, if you are in to these kinds of games.			"

Unlike in d3 your not fully eqipped in two days here just to feel bored then.- Excellent longvity and replayability.- Very appealing ingame atmosphere, graphics and detailrichness.- Great communication of devs to the userbase.- CRATE !! Its sheer unbelievable what a great game they designed here out of a nowhere kickstarter project.End of song: If you ever liked d2 you will LOVE this game - worth every cent asked for it.5 ***** purchase recommendation. :)			"

Early Access Review
								tl;dr Buy this game right now, full price if you have to, it is worth every penny and then some.You know when you look at a game and you go, oh yeah I can dig that. Then you buy it, and then look at the clock and you just spent the last 14 hour straight playing? This is one of those games. That should sell you enough without even reading on.So heres the obligatory pros and cons listPros:1. Graphics are very nice and detailed. Much detail went into a lot of the textures, and environmental effects to enhance the feeling of the zone you are in. Also the granularity and amount of settings to tweek would make any enthusiast gamer smile.2. Skills are almost ripped right out of titan quest. Mix and match up to two different skill trees to form your own classes!3. The current story is rather intriguing, and for a game genre not typically inundated with dialogue, it offers nice story depth, and ""bioware-esque"" branching diologue.4. The sounds and music are very well created to the atmospheres you travel around to.5. Closest thing I've ever come across to an open world ARPG. It gives a general direction to head in, and several winding paths and side dungeons to explore, making the map feel massive in scale.6. Fledgling ( Currently ) crafting system which uses upgrades as a currency for crafting multitudes of items. Very exciting to see where they take it from here.7. Offline and Online multiplayer, currently up to 4 players.8. Heres a unique one, The game doesnt treat you like a child, and hold your hand. It gives you the option for pop up tutorials if thats your thing, but after that, it doesnt spoonfeed you easy enemies and a straight path. It tends to let you wander and choose many different ways to get to your goal. Some more painful than others.9. The combat feels punchy and rewarding if you can get the hang of how the A.I. functions and your mastery of the controls.10. THE ABILITY TO MOVE YOUR CAMERA, and to zoom out. These simple buttons make all the world personally. You can view everything in any angle you choose!Cons:1. The graphics / engine. The game is, albeit, an alpha, however it suffers from extreme frame dips, chops, stutters, and minor freezes. It is generally playable, yet sometimes it randomly dips to near unplayable frame rates for no apparent reason, causing many a player to drop their settings.2. The current amount of skill trees feel rather limited to the basics, and it feels rather cramped in comparison to Titan Quest.3. The multiplayer is glitchy, and crahses for reasons unknown more often then appreciated.4. Information on some quests and most items and crafting is very scarce due to the new-ness of the game, which sometimes causes confusion.5. No voice overs on the main bulk of dialogue causes a small feeling of disconnect from the story.In summary, the game will steal many an hour from your spare time if you let it, and they are very well deserved and spent hours, based on the amount of money they are currently asking. The game is in no way finished yet, and there are extremely exciting features coming soon, such as Factions, and hopefully more crafting.			"

												Yes indeed, the linage of all time classics like Diablo 2 and Titan's Quest can be seen through the cracks, Grimm Dawn is indeed deserving of being called the spiritual succesor to both.

												This is the best new offline, single player ARPG (Diablo style) on the market IMO.  They took what Titan Quest was, and improved on its gameplay, and variety.  Crate is a great developer to deal with, because they actually listen to the players, and a lot of the changes and fixes they've made have been based on player feedback.  They're pretty smart about ""Balancing changes"", and I can't recall an instance where anything was ever ""completely gutted"" with nerfs.  If you're like me and absolutely detest developers who are overzealous with ""nerfs"", then you'll find it refreshing to know that doesn't really happen in Grim Dawn.  I haven't played the game recently, but I got near 200 hours, and plan to come back to play when the Necromancer class and new content is added.  I just got too many other games to play atm.  200 hours might not be a lot of time to put into one game for some people, but that's a lot for me.  I typically get bored with games and move on after about 40-80hrs.  Almost no game ever gets 200 hours of my time.			"

								If you loved Titan Quest, Diablo 2 and like Path of Exile, then this is your cup of tea. If killing hordes of monsters is a stress releaver for you, look no further. Grim Dawn has a dark story and rich lore, but lets be honest, you love loot. You will grind away (albeit a fun grind) and get all kinds of loot. The game has several classes that allow you create an aray of characters. I currently have a pure Nightblade, a pure Soldier and a Clint Eastwood type Gunslinger. They all feel different and they all kick butt. The game feels very polished for an early access game and the developers are good at keeping us updated. The skill tree is not overly complicated like (POE) and you can go to YouTube and follow guides if you can't decide. I highly recommend Grim Dawn to anyone that likes this genre.			"

												I'll admit that this title may not be for everyone. It's isometric, which give some people a rash. It has good loot drops, which some stoics abhor. It's mouse-friendly and has steam controller support, which some WASD Luddites might detest. Lastly, it's an ARPG title, which again, isn't for everyone.For the rest of you: it's an isometric ARPG with good loot, steam controller support, easy keymapping, 3 colorblind profiles and is all-in-all a rather fun title from a small development company. If you enjoyed TQ:IT, then this title should already be in your library.It's not D2, it's not POE, nor is it Torchlight. It is itself, Grim Dawn.			"

I love the ability to mold a character's skills to my gaming style (or any style, for that matter).  The Devotion Shrines are a great addition and once a particular constellation is complete, having that ability linked (and level with the hero) adds a nice touch.  This game is SO addictive, be prepaired for hours of mayhem!			"

								Grim Dawn is the spiritual successor to the classic hack & slasher: Titan Quest. It uses a revamped version of the engine, the same dual class system and talent trees, and there is a lot of randomly generated loot for you to pry out of the cold dead hands of the (un)dead. The zombie apocalypse has broken out, and for some mysterious reason you did not turn into a zombie when you were supposed to. That makes you special, and thus the hero of the story :-)The world is pretty grim, with a bit of a Victorian / Western feel to it. There's magic, there are guns, there's guys with hats, there are zombies, there are goblin-like monsters and lots of angry mutated wildlife. And then there is this cult of Ch'Thon mucking things up. Killing monsters feels satifying, and with a lot of different skills to choose from, you have plenty of viable character builds to try out. With the addition of the Devotion system in beta 29, you have even more options to customize your character as you progress through the game.The faction system starts to develop once you have finished the first major story arc, and it is nice. Each character and monster in the game belongs to a faction. Factions have relationships with each other. If you kill enough Aetherials, they are going to dislike you more and more, to the point where they might start setting up ambushes and sending champion monsters after you. The reverse also works: if you manage to get a good reputation with a faction, you get access to more special items from their vendors, as well as a Bounty Quest table.Another addition to the game over Titan Quest is crafting. You can create magical items appropriate for your level, as well as build some pretty cool Epic items, if you find the plans and obtain the neccessary crafting materials.I started playing in Beta 27, which added the Shaman class. It combines very nicely with the Occultist, because they both offer summonable pets. In previous betas I have tried other class combinations, which had a completely different playstyle. All of them were a lot of fun.Beta 28 and 29 added Act 4 to the game, so the storyline is now complete. Judging on my progress so far, the storyline is going to take about 30 hours to complete on a first playthrough.If you want to see some gameplay, I have a let's play series going with my Conjurer (Shaman/Occultist) that started in beta 27, and played all through beta 28 and 29:

												Bought the pre release about a year ago as I was a fan of Titan Quest (amongst other ARPGs)I can safely say this is better than Titan Quest, and is one of the best ARPGs i've played. Crate have developed this game carefully, taking in feedback from the commmunity along the way, while adding excellent content, and great features. Great fun to play, huge replay value, loads of end game too. Highly HIGHLY recommended.			"

								This is truly truly an amazing game:- So many builds you can do. And each build truly feels unique- Crafting is actually FUN. Not like the frustrating bs you have to deal with in PoE.- Leveling is FUN. I play through the same content 3 times with increasing difficulty (normal, elite, and ultimate) but do not feel like chore at all since enemies are alot stronger in each progression, so gameplay feels refreshing. And lemme tell you, i dont care what kind of ARPG veteran you are, ultimate is HARD.- Grinding is rewarding. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DROPS IN THIS GAME, NOT THE TRADING SIMULATION BS LIKE PATH OF EXILE.I mean, what else could you want from an ARPG besides fun and rewarding gameplay with endless build possibilities? (Endless because the dev will push out mod tool once the game is fully released in a few month... think about the possibilities!)			"

								Well if u like diablo 2, torchlight  and diablo 3, then u should like this. It has similar gameplay but things like the names of the character stats are different, and it is possible to multi class which is nice. i cant remember what i paid for it but i know it was cheap cos  im a tight♥♥♥♥♥♥so if u can get it under 15 its a steal. multiplayer is working rather well i have not had 1 CTD and the scaling for extra players joining is great also pretty stable frames with sli gtx670's and i5 3570k oc'd sometimes as low as 40-50fps most of the time around 70+ though at 1080p with all details MAX!

								A very good aRPG. If you liked Titan Quest then you should stop reading this right now and buy. I prefer this to Diablo 3 and would say I put it about even with poe, although I usually end up playing this one wen I want to play an aRPG simply because it requires no internet connection. The class system and upgrade system are great. It's also not finished yet (though pretty close) so it hasn't even sown its full potential. The dev team are solid and have put in consisten work so you can feel confident even tough its early access. The one thing I would criticize most is that even tough I love the design style and the setting, the in-game graphics feel really muddled to me at times, but it doesnt take away from the enjoyability of the mechanics.

								If you played and liked Diablo II and Titan's Quest then I highly recommend this game to you. If you did not play either of them dont fret, this game is a great one to get started into aRPGs. It's not finished but what is currently playable is very polished and fun.  At first the game is fairly easy and then progressively gets more difficult.  The boss fights are simliar to Titan's Quest and are replayable so you can revisit them time and time again for loot drops.			"

								What can anyone say about this game, nothing bad I hope! Deciding to write a gist of a review for this game I now look back from the humble beginnings through till today to only have a few things in response for the readers; Well done Crate Entertainment, well done; You should pat one another's backs and relish in your creativity and fanaticism for this diamond in the ruff. The game is not even finished and I am still chipping away for hours to my much loved and enjoyed time for there is so much to do in this vast yet beautiful world you your selves have brought to light.PROs : - Everything from the camps, towns and to my delight a city yet to traverse with lots of amazing characters and environments to the over all game play itself. I would highly require more to pick up this book and join the thrills and chills. Always finding new things around the corner as I travel the vast changing lands and the characters, all unique individuals leaves me always looking for more only to be more aspired to continue my journey across the realm of Cairn with much hopes of furthering my own story with the established world for exploration. So go ahead, pick it up and delve in; You won't regret a thing, enjoy.CONs : - For the only down side is that, well, it is not finished, so the story ends as Crate Entertainment release parts for new hopes towards all the bright eyed adventurers out there. Patience is required that is well worth all the grueling waiting and self distractions.Overall one of the best ARPGs I've played to date, Try it today and please support the ingeniously awesome group behind this ravishing tale of heroism you all have, currently playing or Only heard wisps of it's name, Grim Dawn.Author William L.

												UPDATED REVIEW:So, Grim Dawn has been finally Released and I beated the game, I am very happy with this game, TQ Devs did a great job in TQ and GD.Grim Dawn in the Release had, and maybe still has, some issues with AMD gpus but also my NVIDIA card burned to death in a area that I don't wan't to spoil but be ware of Mid Act 2 Side Area.It has a controller support, i haven't really tested but my Wireless Xbox 360 Controller was automatically dected.Now let's talk about my impressions about loot and Gameplay,The Loot might be better than Diablo 3 for you but for me, who played Diablo 3 Trial to level 15, It was way better.The Game has 4 difficulities which 2 are given by default and 2 are given when you complete the game on that Difficulity for Example:Normal,Veteran->Elite->Ultimate(yes those are the 4 difficulities).If you play on Normal you will play like a normal ARPG but in Veteran you will get much better loot than Normal, also the monsters are a bit difficult for Casters, for me a tank self healer, it was easy to defeat every boss.The World is very big and it might get bigger(I saw some fields on the map very far from the towns and in Beta there was a Area that got cutted).Gameplay wise, it's a ARPG which you control your character with your mouse and has 1-0(10) Skill hotkeys and LMB,RMB, also it has an additional quickbar by pressing Y,also like i said you will love loot in the final difficulities, though it might get borring finding the legendaries you want.Conclusion:The game has a lot of quest to offer; 1 endless dungeon for loot; 4 difficulities,which in 2 of those you have to start over its like NG+ don't worry you won't be naked but you might be if you didn't prepare for Ultimate or Elite, hehe, Anyway I think this game is worth the money and if you want to play their old games, buy TQ(you might notice it's not made by Crate Entertaiment. Crate Ent. is the newest TQ company that has old members of TQ company)ORIGINAL REVIEW:This ARPG has a nice atmosphere, in the begining you are at a dark world but in Act 2 you are at a semi-bright world, I honestly think this game will be the most popular ARPG,why? beacuse its gonna have mod support,it(might) wont have problems in the launch.The game itself has a really wierd story and its grindy but for those who like grinding games they wont get bored easily.The Lengedary loot as i read is gonna be 1 per character but it might change beacuse the game is designed for level 200 so it might have like a low or medium chance to get lengedaries in level 60,75(Release level).This game features a dungeon where(im pretty sure) you wont get bored,that dungeon is challanging and has a good loot and as you go to many floors it gets harder, if you die you have to go to those floors all over again.The game has even a hardcore mode if you really wanna loose all your stuff you can do that,I havent gone into hardcore mode but im 100% sure it wont give you any bonuses it will be just a challange.What I forgot to say is,the game is based on a apocalyptic dark world where there is only some surviours but some are enemies,and you can do some side quests with the enemies side also the max level for now is 35.

								Oh so addicting. This game does everything right to pull you in from the start and make sure that the only time you want to stop playing is to create a new a character to try a different build using the +poison damage gear you've found. At the same time the game doesn't restrict you from changing your current build. For example, 8 hours in I respecced from building around two active abilities and fire and burn damage damage into two different active abilities and cold and lighting damage. I was having some trouble with certain situations and was finding my damage output lacking against bosses so I looked at what gear I had and what I could change around with my skill points and after a few iterations came with a mostly different build which performed better. The change felt organic. The game strikes a very good balance between giving players the freedom to change their current build and making them feel like the choices they made are meaningful.Everything about the game feels like it takes the better elements from its predecessors and organically combines them into something that has its own identity. The atmopsphere is gritty and dark like the Diablo series but with a futuristic twist as early forms of firearms and explosives are available. The dual mastery system from Titan Quest is back but the skill trees have more synergy within themselves and each other as the damage and damage bonuses in most abilities are split between two different types. But more importantly the game isn't afraid to add something new. The crafting system and the faction system along with quests that offer some meaningful choices are the big things that come to mind at this stage.The game world feels much more alive and interesting than most other games. The dialogue is organic and appropriate to the situations. For example, at one point you may encounter a pair trying to scam some money off you and you can decide whether to respond with violence or allow them to join the community you're building up. If you choose the latter and talk to them later on they will express their gratitude for not killing them and how they probably had no chance in combat against you. They also share how they struggled to survive prior to the current encounter. Encounters like these make the player feel invested in the gameworld and builds up the atmosphere, soemthing a lot of modern games fail to do and instead rely on a few cinematics and a diary entry around every corner. While this game has the diary entries, they are well spaced out and actually anwser some of the burning questions the player might have about the gameworld so unlike many other games, I actually read most of them.Another thing that adds to the atmosphere and to the experience as a whole is the dynamic weather system. It also acts as an important offset to the lack of randomly generated levels. I have no complaints about the level design itself but running through the same exact level tends to get old after a while and the dynamic weather spices things up a bit.All in all this game is shaping up to be one of the best ARPG out there and thats bound to improve as development progresses.

												Updated.Grim Dawn is a very playable Early Access action RPG game that  shows great potential  and promisses well crafted game when  released.Very neat skill tree and great maps giving you a lot of fun and running around .Dungeons are at nearly every  corner so you won't get bored .In GD you will find  loads of quests ,bosses ,great loot ,which can be upgraded by using essences ,secret receipies ,and most of all great ,exciting adventure.Your  character can be build by using 2 classes out of 4 available at the moment.Demolitionist and Occultist are classes I've choosen for my hero .Those are giving me a lot of funkilling monsters by using variety of weapon such as mace ,sword ,gun ,crossbow or (my favourite) visual breathtaking casting spells! :)I can also have up to 2 pets Raven and Hellhound which skills can also be increased.Crafting available !!!!At the moment there is only human hero  available (I wish for more variety here!)for both male and female fans. No customisation  either for characters  but I believe that option will be introduced soon.I would recommed this game to all fans of it's type ,and as a proof I can tell you thatso far I've spent over 30 h playing Grim Dawn and I am still discovering first act .!!!:)I'm having more fun with Grim Dawn than Diablo 3 which cost me 60 e and  it was completed within 22 h.There has been  major update since my last review : The Multiplayer option is now available  ,and also two handed weapon were introduced .A few skills have been added ,and a lot of bugs fixed.The game is even more amazing than before :)I've bougth this game 2 years ago when it was in very early stage of development and I was amazed at that time because game was playable and I enjoyed it.Today I just like to add that I do not regret early acces buy .It was well worth it to wait 2 years and see the full capacity of Grim Dawn .I've played already 90h and I just can't get enough of it.It leaves behid well know titles of similar genre .Fair play to Crate studio ,they have managed to craft beautifull piece of art.

Early Access Review
								Pros: + Fantastic atmosphere+ Very good graphics overall, if a wee bit dated+ Combining classes and trying out new builds can be quite fun, even if they don't really work well. + Ease of respec (not masteries though) encourages experimentation+ Great dev team+ Steady updates+ Rotatable camera+ Very good loot+ Endless mode (essentially)+ Good crafting systemCons:- Sometimes TOO dark and depressing- Combat is okay, but still comes off rather clunky at times- Many skills feel distinctly underwhelming- Typical post apocalyptic color palette of grays and browns- Story is incredibly basic (so far)- Enemy balance feels a bit off- Some graphical issues here and there, most likely due to relatively little optimization, which is understandable for a Early Access game- Open multiplayer servers means playing with random people is risky due to hackers and cheatersI love Diablo (the best of the trilogy) Diablo 2, and Diablo 3. This game borrows heavily from the second installment, as well as their previous game Titan Quest, to make an unpolished but fun ARPG which, in my opinion, is the third best isometric ARPG on the market today. It belongs right up there with Marvel Heroes and Diablo 3, though technically MH is more of a MMOARPG. A must buy for ARPG fans, doubly so for those who enjoy stories with Lovecraftian elements. Will update the review as I get further into the game.			"

								So far, the game is pretty neat. The gameplay is quick, fun and entertaining. The controls are quite responsive. The graphics are very decent. The music is fitting. The art style is nice and the game is up it's own butt with atmosphere. It's been a long time I had a game like Diablo or Dungeon Siege to keep me occupied, and now it's here.The UI and the way the game is presented could be improved, however. Often times it seems the screen is cluttered with text, or my HUD is getting in the way. Other than that, this game is a real gem. Truly underrated as far as it being Early Access.I haven't tried the Multiplayer feature yet, so I won't say anything in that regard.This is one of those games I wish more people would get involved in. I recommend it to all you dungeon crawler-loving gamers. Be prepared for fast-paced action and hordes of zombies, demons, beasts and bugs. Not to mention all the 4HAT L3WT you'll find along the way.			"

								Short and sweet version. This game is fun. Better and more realistic than that other triple A title. The environments and models don't look like they are made out of plastic like that one free to play title. And it is super easy to just jump in and play with a progressive learning curve and if you totally screw up your spec just go talk to a guy and reset your points and try something different.I've played the demolitionist and the nightblade and both feel powerful and dynamic with lots of impact on damage and plenty of blood and gore.

9/10 Overall Rating for aRPG fansGreat game, and not a boringly easy one, if you play Vanilla, no Mods, no use of Guides to follow a ""perfect"" build made by someone else, no use if GrimCalc to do your build ""on paper"" before using s Skill, Mastery and Devotion points in game. Devs are fairly active on Steam forums, much more active on thei Official online forums, but the do respond to bug repots, complaints and suggestions. Regular bugfixes, balance tweaks and other updates. That said, there are some good Mods (availble from players on the online Grin Dawn forums), GrimCalc to test ride builds, and Guides here n Steam to show you how to build the ""perfect"" toon (barring really bad luc with gear drops for every Class other than your own, lol!). So, there are lots of resources at your disposal, if you don;t feel like figuring it all out as you go.I prefer to play Vanillla, and prefer to play solo, figuring the game out as I go. The game is very similar to Titan Quest, which makes sense, It uses the same game engine pretty much, and many of the Devs are ex-TQ devs. It's a hack & slash quest driven aRPG. The similarities really ended there for me.Grim Dawn has amazing graphics. The dark, post-apocalyptic feeling is so well conveyed through the dark and gloomy lighting, settings, horrifc monsters, flashy light shows during certain attacks, the music is perfectly suited... it all adds to the immersion for me. The targeting system is perfect for the game. You know exactly which monster(s), monster Hero(es) or Boos(es) your attacks are hitting. Really huge map, with great replayability, which is good, since it is an aRPGm and you have to farm for gear and components. A bit annoying how rarely gear suitable for your build(s) drop, but... more killing! Aways a good thing. It is a heavy-ish grind game, so keep that in mind.The Difficulty settings are good. Normal, for new players, to learn the game. Normal (veteran) for more experinced aRPG players, moving into Epic, Legendary and Ultimate. Difficulty, opponent stegnth and loot scales with your character level nicely. Softcore mode allows you to die and respawn, losing Exp points, that can be partially recovered if you return to your Player Grave and click it. And finish off whatever killed you there, lol! Hardcore is perma-death. You die, start over from scratch. Inventory space feel slightly cramped, but you do have a transfer stash to store items in and dole them out to other characters. And, I tend to be a hoarder, reluctant to sell items I think I might want to switch around. I need t learn to let go. There is a GDVault out there somewhere, like TQVault, a third party program for storing and tranferring large amounts of gear and goodies. I haven't used either one, for either game, so I can't really say how well they a wrok, but from forums postings on Steam and online, they seem very popular with die-hard fans f of both games.Runs really well, even on a toaster, with good settings options to customize for best performance.  (My current specs- Windows 7 SP 1 64 bit, AMD FX-4130 @3.8 Ghz, NVIDIA 740GT (2Gb MSI), 16 Gb DDR3 RAM), old HDD, and a budget Gigabyte mobo)... and I can run on Medium + some High settings (all custom adjusted for my rig) at 60 fps, no issues. Some occasional minor fps drops, barely noticed, usually during REALLY populated battles, none of the rubberbanding TQ:AE is famous for. I am honestly impressed with how well it runs on my old, mouldy toaster. Can't say how it runs on a non-budget-build rig or beast rig, since I haven't got one, lol! I'll get back to you when I have all the component for a full rebuild and major upgrade.All in all, if you like aRPG's like TQ, PoE, and Torchlght, you will probably enjoy this game as much as I do.But, you won;t know unless you play it, eh? Worth full price, even better if you get it on sale here or from Humble Bundle or another legit Steam Key discount site.			"

												Grim Dawn may be a little harder to get into than most hack n' slashes, but it's crafted with an old-school gaming approach coupled with newer solutions found in the latest games.Rich, dark atmosphere has a surprising amount of depth and choices that impact gameplay. While the storyline isn't that involving (saving the world from invading monster factions and learning why), seeing how the people in-game are affected definitely is. Under all this there's plenty of cleverly hidden lore and hard-to-find secret areas.Pros:+Good twist on typical skill tress, where you select two classes and find synergy between them, and decide how deeply you invest into a class+Devotion is a system of common abilities that can back up the weakness of your character. For example, if you lack survivability, you can go for a number of defensive procs. The shrines for these devotion points are found throughout the world, which encourages exploration+Very cool bosses, tough dungeons, good enemy variety+An interesting faction system to make the grind matter a little more+Powerful legendary items that are rarer than in most ARPGs, making them more prestigious+After 200 hours, there's still so much to doCons- Netplay experience may vary- Often doesn't feel rewarding enough. You'll have a very hard time finding legendaries for your build, may have to trade- Feels grindy. It takes a lot of time to slog through all the difficulties to get to Ultimate, and farming infamy for the enemy factions can be very tediousWith hundreds of build combinations, an expansive world, and the ability to play with friends, Grim Dawn breathes new life into the old-school hack n' slash games. It may feel too grindy at times, but the combat is crisp and satisfying at all times.			"

												This game has gone from a very good early access title to a full blown Action RPG magnum opus. So many quests with a fully fleshed out back story, more loot than you could ever imagine and a class system as deep as any in gaming. This game is just stellar in nearly every way. If it only had the same music composer as Diablo and it would be ""perfect"". If you have had this in your library a while but not played since launch, give it a go again trust me.			"

								Despite being in beta (early access) the game is very well fleshed out up to level 40. I've only encountered a couple bugs. Gameplay wise I find it just as fun - if not more-so - than Path of Exile (PoE). Both Grim Dawn and PoE borrow heavily from other games in terms of character progression. Grim Dawn from Titan Quest, and PoE from Final Fantasy 7 and 10.Grim Dawn isn't an always-online game like PoE however can be played multi-player online or locally. It also allows you to circle the camera around to get a full look at the environment, which Path doesn't. My main gripes with this game is its continued use of Diablo-style isometric gameplay (instead of straight 3D 3rd person action RPG), lack of multi-character control and unoriginality in terms of character progression. That said isometric ""Diablo-style"" Action RPGs are still one of my favorite genres and it's way worth the buy, even in beta.			"

								Probably one of the few early access games that is well worth the full price. Even though it has the early access tag it's polished, plays well, and the development crew is in touch with its user base. I've bought one too many games in early access that have steady development for 6 months then it drops off a cliff or is abandoned entirely... this is definitely not one of those cases.For any fans of Diablo or any of hack n slash, this is a must buy. Lots of replayability and variance between classes. I've only put 20ish hours in but each time they update I get sucked in once more. I can see myself playing this well past final release and will definitely support the devs with any other project and/or expansion.			"

								Oh my god this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing good. Grim Dawn is a game like if Wasteland had sex with Diablo and gave birth. It is very atmospheric game with a dark and post apocalyptic atmosphere. This is already one of my favorite games of the new generation and a bonus is that this game can run on toasters. You can basically be more than 1 class and there are so many skill sets you can use. The combos for character customization is very overwhealming and gives it lots of replay value if you want to experiment on your characters.

												This one line pretty much sums it up:The Diablo 3 we never had.Runs incredibly well on max settings with a rocksolid 60 FPS on my GTX970 and intel i5 3.4GHz.It's indeed a bit graphically dated, as most reviews have mentioned, but it honestly doesn't bother me in the slightest, where it lacks in raw beauty (textures and stuff), it makes up in effects.Another huge deal maker for me personally (as one of those weird ""controller on pc"" gamers): it has controller support and integrated it very well (movement and combat feel as natural as while playing by mouse).My only gripe:When altering graphical settings mid-game, it completely locks up the game, to the point of requiring to hard-reboot my computer, is this a known issue and being worked on?Please keep up the great work!

								I was looking for a great action RPG. Grim dawn has stopped me from searching. I have had this game since very early access as the theme of the game caught my attention. I've gotten about 5 friends to purchase this game and multiplayer is very fun ( although a little buggy at times still much fun ). The developers usually keep you updated every couple of weeks so you know that more content will be coming as it goes and they have been very on the ball with this.As far as gameplay goes it feels very fluid based on the class you create. Spells and abilities are well tuned and all work well together ( I mean if you multiclass you feel you can mix and match yourself well ). They introduced a faction system which means you can be liked and hated by NPC parties in the game which can cause boss enemies to spawn or harder monsters. On the good side it allows you to purchase nice items from NPC vendors in towns based on the faction.The story is also very well done and ive heard mixed reviews on the fact no NPC reads their text to you - but personally I kind of like that. As you play through youll find notes and scripts about the lore of the game which I also like it is almost like you add a journal of story as you play the game which in itself is a reward.All in all I highly recommend grim dawn - theres at least 20 hours of gameplay and with all the muilticlassing you can do theres plenty more. Hidden areas and bosses are also out there.. happy hunting. "

VerdictBuy now!Buy on saleSave your moneySummary:Grim Dawn is a great ARPG for fans of the genre and new players alike. It blends the best parts of Diablo and Titan Quest and exceeds both of them, without doing anything amazing of its own right. It just delivers a fun experience and gives you an insight into what Diablo III could have been had it been done right (let’s not even talk about the DII Auction House at launch…).This game has been a long time in the making and it shows. The worlds are large and open and yet you never feel lost. There is a ton of content to get through and yet you never feel forced to do it. Nice touches like the bounty system to increase faction rep and the portal system enhance and ease gameplay. The character development is interesting, with the ability to dual class from level 10 (if you so desire) and choose a variety of options from each class. Along with a devotion system, which further opens up interesting class choices – this game just does it right.Throw in a very reasonable price tag and you should add this game to your collection today.The Good:Character developmentHuge amount of contentValue for moneyThe Bad:UI interface could look a little nicerAs with all ARPGs can feel like more of the same after a whileThe Ugly:N/AOverall Score:8/10			"

I've enjoyed other ARPGs like PoE, D3, Torchlight 2 and Titan Quest, but this is my favourite by a long shot.			"

								WOW! Im blown away. Iv been looking for a new Diablo/Sacred/Titan Quest style game and this is it. Im shocked at how great this game is. This game has my vote.Amazing graphicsAmazing classes and skills(has a great skill tree) as well as weapons and armor/itemsAmazing animationsDark atmosphereLove the looting and leveling upAmazingly fun game playGreat musicIt even has guns! And if you dont like using guns, then grab a sword, crossbow, shield, or whenever you like. It has it all !!!Love the classes and skills. I find all the skills for each class awesome. You know in like diablo 3 where most of the skills are lame and look lame with lame animations? Not this game. The classes are awesome with all good skill trees. Makes me wanna make every character. And if thats not enough then not only can you pick a class, you can choose 2 classes and be a hybrid(hybrid is optional). Ever seen a crazy armored demolisionist throwing bombs will shooting up everything around him + tanking all enemies? Its awesome. Again, you can choose to be hybrid or just stay one class, choice is up to you. And if you go one class and then later decide you want to be hybrid you can at anytime.This game adds so much more to hack and slash style games. This game sets a record in my book. And just to think that the game is still in development makes it even better. This game accomplished what the others could not and it isnt even finished yet. Cant wait to see more content/updates.Theres ONLY ONE thing that I found to been an issue and thats optimization. The game runs a bit choppy. Running max setting at 60fps+ but its still choppin and skippin somtimes at 60fps. Its not that bad tho. I cant wait to see whats in the future. This game is worth every penny.Grim dawn is way better then Diablo 3. I loved Diablo 1, 2, and 3 as well as Titan Quest and Sacred Series. Heck I was still playing Diablo 2 with mods till I bought this. But Grim Dawn takes it to a whole new level. It takes all my favorite hack and slash Diablo/Sacred/Titan Quest style games and throws them into one creating the best H&S RPG I have ever played. You can't go wrong with Grim Dawn. If you have the money to buy it. Then buy it.10/10			"

												The spiritual sucessor to Titan Quest.It's a very grungey and dark ARPG and has an apocalyptic/steampunk feel to it. The environments are lush and make you feel involved with the world, the music is also quite nice.For a game still in development, it plays very well. The combat is great but sometimes feels sluggish, such as moving your character during combat and switching target. The class system is great and I love the different skills and abilities than come with each. I can't wait to get to max level (at this time) and start up another character to level. If development proceeds and updates are continuous, I could see this overtaking Diablo, a game I have also invested a lot of time into.I give it, 8/10 Prunes----------------------------------------Because the game has been released now, the only thing I will revise is that it has got better due to all of the content being in the game and the constant work the devs are putting into it, providing more updates and fixes. The only issue is the amount of players, we need more!!I now give it, 8.5/10 Prunes			"

Early Access Review
								This is a review as of Build 24If you're looking for a nostalgic ARPG experience good for at least one 15-20 hr playthough, this game will likely satisfy you.If you're looking to repeat the experience, you have to be willing to accept that there are some things that are not up to current standards. Some or all of these things may bother you, I know that not all of them bother me.The map is 95% the same every single game. The overall structure is exactly the same but they will put obstructions on random sections of path so that you can't always run the exact same path every single game. Along with this, I'm *pretty* certain that monster spawns are the same every game, with maybe hero/champion/unique spawns occurring in a semi-random fashion.Monster spawns are sometimes triggered by your walking over a, well, trigger point. These are usually only configured assuming you are coming from one direction. This means rather than spawning when you get close to a point, monsters will frequently end up spawning behind you if you like to explore 100% of a region. This feels really sloppy and gets tedious as it forces you to double back if you want to kill everything.Monsters scale to your level (with certain seeming minimum and maximum levels) and monsters that spawn as a result of certain actions (either map triggers or summons by other monsters) will spawn at different levels than the already present monsters. This can result in a monster multiple levels higher than you (I've seen ones up to ~10 levels higher than me) spawning things your level, or things way lower level than you (up to ~20 levels lower) spawning things at your level. While most of the skill points you spend can be unspent for an extremely reasonable amount, there are a relatively large number that can't be retrieved. You can get ~120 skill points currently, of which you may end up sinking 50-75 into places that you can't get them back from. When the level cap increases, I expect this to become less of an issue but currently it can lead to lots of regret.At each level up you obtain 1 ""stat point"" to be spent on one of three stats. This might lead you (me) into believing this game was set up like Dungeon Siege to a certain point with full armor sets based on one or two of these stats. This would be a lie. Almost all armor ends up requiring a certain amount of physique (read: strength) and no other stats. Almost all rings/amulets end up needing a certain amount of spirit (read: int/wis) and I've never seen one rely on anything else. Some weapons require cunning (read: dex) or spirit, but most rely on physique. These stat points cannot be reallocated. Sadface.This game is kind of oldschool in that the concept of utility skills/powers does not really exist. If you need healing, you will be expected to rely mainly on potions or out of combat things. If you want to move faster or drain health, that will mostly be due to your gear. From my observation, only the two melee trees (soldier/nightblade aka fighter/rogue) have things like this. As a result, almost all of the builds I see on here use one or both of these trees or try to avoid any situation in which they would take damage.I haven't tried it but don't feel like there is currently a viable ""pet"" class. The Occultist tree gives 2 pets, but you can only summon 1 copy of each (from what I've seen) which is pretty thin for a pet class.I think I've complained a lot and you're probably wondering why I've still given a positive review (if you're still reading). That would mostly be due to the potential for future development. Most/all of the things I've mentioned could be fixed with post-release player created workshop mods or by the dev team in a future Build.As it stands, I believe the EA game is worth $10-15 to me, and that's what I paid at some point this was on sale. If you're hard up for a new Torchlight/Diablo/TQ/etc fix, this might be worth more to you. Asked right now, I don't think I'd pay $25.If I really needed a fix though, I'd probably pay the $25.			"

								Did you play Titan Quest? Do you like action RPGs? Do you wish that Diablo 3 hadn't been a giant flaming pile of dog s%$# on release?This is your game.Path of Exile is okay. It's not great. This one is great. Not only is it made by some of the same people who made Titan Quest (in the same engine), but it has atmosphere. Great music, environments, gear, and it's hard.It doesn't hold your hand and let you change your build. You can build your character wrong. I think you can respec, but that's for losers who can't live with their decisions. You can pick two classes, just like Titan Quest, and combine skills from them. This is the real flavor of the game, aside from the hack and slashing and looting. The class system in Titan Quest was quite good, and it works well in this game.Once this one is done, I recommend it to everyone who likes a good loot and scoot. It's in a good state now, but the third act isn't in the game yet. I'd say get it if it's on sale, but wait until it's released to get it otherwise.			"

								I did play Titan Quest games first (that's how I found out about this game, as it is made by the same guys) before buying this one. The most important thing I want to say to all who are still considering buying or haven't yet decided - THIS GAME IS WORTH OF ITS MONEY:- It's fun- it looks very good (better than on videos here, actually. the devs should upload new ones  ) - it is constantly updated, the devs team listents to ppl, you can see that they are devoted to their work- the atmosphere of the game is pretty cool. It's darkish and not cartoonish like let's say Torchlight. - there are no bugs as of the moment of me writing the reviewOne of the best features is that all classes in game feel unique. And what's even better is that you can combine 2 diff classes as u progress through the game. Thus you would probably spend more time in this game trying all the classes than in other rpg's.			"

								Many of the other reviews here are comparing this game to something between Path of Exile and Diablo 2/3. Grim Dawn takes on a whole new refreshing take on the ARPG genre. Early Access has been fanastic, the items, the bosses, the dungeons, the graphics, and the story - and more to come! I came to this game from d3 where I would auto salvage all yellow items, it was almost nostalgic to have to compare the random stats on yellow items. For an Alpha release all I can say is WOW - expect amazing things to come for Grim Dawn!			"

								Even in it's early access and 'incomplete' state, this game already feels like a complete game. If you liked games like Diablo, you will more than likely enjoy this game as well. There's the -very- occasional bug, but they are so few and far between that most of the time it's forgivable.This game is easily better than D3, and is up there with games like D2 and Torchlight. In fact, I put it higher than Torchlight.			"

												I initially went into Grim Dawn with low expectations. Maybe it would be a dark fantasy Titan Quest at best. To say Grim Dawn surpassed my expectations would be selling the game short.Core gameplay is standard genre fare; grind enemies into a fine paste and collect items off of their dead bodies. The combat itself has a nice weight to it, my Blademaster felt like a whirlwind tearing through groups. Progression uses the dual skill tree system from Titan Quest. A first tree is picked at level 1, and then the second is picked at level 10. There is no restrictions on mixing trees, so a variety of different builds are available. Skills in the tree aren’t just selected, a player is given three points on level ups to use.  A player can either choose to level up masteries, which has skills at 5 point intervals, or one of the aforementioned skills. This system forces a player to choose between immediate returns of available skills or investing in mastery points to unlock stronger skills. In practice the system mostly works, but can cause some pacing issues towards the end of a skill tree. Around Act 3 there was a huge difficulty jump, and the skill to finish my build felt like it required too much investment in masteries to unlock. Itemization is average for this type of game. Most of the items are just straight stat boosts, but the character is given plenty of choices for damage. There are ten resistances available to the player and enemy. All of the resistances see use without one over shining the rest. It is important to note that Legendaries are treated as end game build defining items. They start dropping at level 50, or around the end of the first difficulty. Where Grim Dawn really sets itself apart from the genre is the story and atmosphere. The game starts out with a cutscene to give some exposition about aetherials invading the world. Then the player is dropped into a post-apocalyptic world. From here the player isn’t given much in the way of outright story. Instead hints are dropped about how exactly civilization collapsed, the history of the world, humanities place in the three way war that is being waged, and much more. The main plot is more or less the player trying to survive, eventually becoming a ‘hero’ because frankly the developers need a reason to explain why my Blademaster has killed 24,500 enemies. The atmosphere is what brings everything together. From the get-go it is established that this is a terrible world. Other games have tried the dark fantasy thing, but often feel sterile despite there being blood and corpses everywhere. A set of notes that drop in an area tell a story. A family of four is fleeing the aetherial invasion and food is scarce, but there are rumors that the cultists who have risen up to fight the aetherial invasion will provide shelter to anyone willing to join. The family is forced to join the cult. In time the mother starts to buy into the ideology while the father just grits his teeth to make sure the children have food. The story ends with the women realizing that the family she joined the cult to protect would be safer as sacrifices to the blood god.As mentioned before, the cult has risen up to fight the aetherials. Make no mistake, these cultists are no friends of anyone sane. The aetherials sole goal is to claim the world for themselves, enslaving humanity in the process. The remnants of an empire are caught in the middle trying to fend off both sides while reclaiming civilization.This three-way war is illustrated in gameplay through encountering cultists and aetherials fighting each other. When the player engages one side, they will keep on fighting. At times they will side with each other to fight the player, but there has been times where they simply ignore the player and continue their assault, as if accepting the help.The game is loaded with small scenarios that provide opportunities for choice and consequence. There was a man lying in the road bleeding out, and according to this man was betrayed by his partner. Either way he was dead and there was nothing I could do to help him. Except to honor his last request to track down his killer.I do so and the person begs me to let them explain what happened. He explains that the man lying in the road was indeed his partner, but he acted in self-defense to stop the ex-partner from♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥his daughter. There is no other NPC in sight. What do I do? Is the daughter hiding or am I be being played a fool? The attention to detail in all of these things give the world an authenticity that the genre hasn’t had in a long time. Since Diablo 2 in fact. Yes, it’s that good. This isn’t the game for someone wanting a fun 1,000 hour min/max item grind; that is Diablo 3. This isn’t the game for someone wanting to replay the game 50 times trying out off the wall builds; that is Path of Exile. This is the game for someone who wants the fun gameplay of the genre with a well realized dark fantasy world. Crate Entertainment is a studio to watch. I know that I’ll be watching for the first Grim Dawn expansion.			"

								I don't often review games but wanted others to know about this great gem.  It has all the things that make a great hack and slash, and all of them done well.   The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is compelling.  The rewards are difficult but attainable and the replay factor is HUGE.  Although only two acts are completed, I've created dozens of various characters trying to get a feel for where to spend my time (LOL - Thats already done !)  A fine game at $60.00 a steal and so worthwhile at anything less.  Please give this game a chance - if you like the genre then you will love this game and be supportorting an up and coming powerhouse of a game company.  These guys have some great talent and if we can keep them in business then we might get a post apocalyptic zombie killer hack and slash from them in the future :) (HINT HINT)			"

								Hi, I'm Kurjuutus and I'm an aRPG addict.Had around 5 hours in-game before 13.12.2015. Bought this year (or something) ago and tried for a while and threw away. If you're like me and have done the same, now is a good time to start Grim Dawn again. Now clocking 23.4 hours and counting!My history with aRPG's are mostly on Diablo series. Starting from first. I loved Diablo3. Fast paced action with lots of balls in it, even though they made game more ""dumb"". Now Diablo 3 is pretty much dead, been craving for a good aRPG. Path of Exile for some reason doesn't fit my gameslist. Maybe cause it feels so slow and balless? Yes yes I know you can make many fancy builds etc etc.Anyway, I really recommend Grim Dawn to any aRPG fans around here. It's fast paced, it has very good leveling and even better gear system. I've only just scratched surface for now, my first character at level 36. Oh, and I'm playing solo..Perhaps more thoughts about this game incoming once I've completed storyline and tried endgame, if there is any.			"

								If you didnt play TitansQuest - one of the most defining Action-RPG's of all time - then get GrimDawn and experience what these developers have known for years and perfected: the art of gameplay.GrimDawn is developed by the old TQ team. Its all about gameplay here.Pros:* Unique and custom class system which lets you build your own custom classes and builds. Hundreds if not thousands of unique ways to play this game.* Controls are fluid and give you full reaction over your character. No clunky coding, interfaces, menus, or mouse/KB action here.* Quest line is immersive but doesnt ask of you to spend hours reading text and having to follow every step: if you want to? Great its enjoyable, well written, immersive storytelling. If you just want to hack-n-slash?  Great, dont worry about missing key elements, as it fits into the playflow anyway.* Graphics are dark, beautiful, and well themed.* Engine is optimized, and this game will run well on older machines. Take it with you on your laptop for travel gaming.* Large, ever expanding world (its only early access now, and feels like a complete game already yet less than half the map is developed so far!).* Challenging and unique monster abilities. This game can get difficult.* Best multiplayer support.Cons:- You dont like action RPGs			"

												Grim Dawn is without a doubt one of my favourite games. The classes are varied and you can make some truely unique builds with them. For example using the same two classes (Occultist and Shaman) I made one character who specialises in life steal and another character who specialises with pets. The main story could have been better and more interesting. However, when exploring read the bits of lore you find because they often have interesting (and dark) stories to share about life after the Grim Dawn. The look and environment of the game is great and many of the locations are beautiful and match the game's atmosphere. However, I dislike the music and find it repetitive. The armour also looks great and I love how the low level gear is scraps of metal and rotten wood while the late game gear looks totaly amazing and as if it should be worn by a classical hero. Overall i would recommend this game to anyone especially if they like ARPGs.			"

								This is the best ARPG I've seen in a looong-looong time. I purchased this gem over a year ago, and I still enjoying it. It's not a grindfest like D3, the skill system is pretty rewarding. There is so much option, so many different classes you could make. Of course there is some elements and levels which can be pretty annoying, but overall the game design and mechanic worth it in every aspect. The new additions rewarding as well, well-tested, and rich. Every patch and update makes this game even more enjoyable, and that's a really rare thing nowadays. The sound and level design is also fantastic! I like the little bit twisted, dark, and fully unique environment as well. Grim Dawn is an instant-get title.			"

								I initially bought this game without knowing it was from the makers of Titan Quest, and once in game, I immediately saw the resemblance.This game is a perfect followup to that, with interesting class diversity. Grim dawn doesnt have your typical Fight Mage Rogue Healer class types, and even has secondary classes. This almost forces you to explore more of the game, and that is a good thing! After splitting my time between two characters for a few hours each, I can say that each playthrough was slightly different. There is also a Normal < Veteran < Hard < Elite style difficulty, similar to Diablo and Titan Quest, so the replayability and longevity of the game seems fairly high.Ultimately, this is a great Hack 'n Slash RPG with nice class and skill diversity. Itemization appears satisfactory, with different weapon grades and magic items with a color coding system and stat rolls. Not to mention a co-op feature which I have yet to try.This bad boy is early access, but feels quite polished so far.8.7/10			"

								Plays really well so far. Being from some of the makers of Titan Quest, in some ways it plays really similar to it. The classes work the same, and the stats more or less work the same. It feels like a more polished version of Titan Quest with much cooler classes, a better setting, and better animations. Plenty of good loot to sift through, but only a few epic drops so far, so it seems pretty balanced on that front. Can't wait to keep playing as they continue developing the game. Thanks devs for making this game, I now have another choice beyond Path of Exile, Torchlight 2, and Diablo 3 when I need that fix for this style of game. Currently this one has all of my attention.

								Before starting, ask yourself 3 questions first:- Are you a fan of ARPG?- Are you a fan of TQ?- Are you a fan of grinding your♥♥♥♥♥off?If just one of those answer is yes, then Grim Dawn should be on your list this holiday.The game is fun. I am not as much of a big fan of ARPG as before because I don't have much time in my hand as I used to, but this game already took from me more than 100 hours. It's not plenty, but it's enough for me to fall in love with this game, considering the fact that I played Titanquest for years. The core of TQ remained, and got polished to a better level. Dual-class, ridiculous physic (well, looking at those monsters flying always brings me joy), detailed, sophisticated, also confusing crafting system. You will spend hours after hours slaying monster, getting loot, and min maxing with your gears to get a superman out of it, except there's no superman until much later. If Diablo focuses much on End-game, this game is all about progression. Every point of skill should be spent carefully, every point of attribute should be used wisely to make your character better. And your gear. There are some other features that are worth-mentioning such as: Reputation for factions (also this is very tendious, as in Wow, in a smaller scale), veteran for those who feel Normal is too easy and the upper difficulty is too hard, (kind of) intersting side areas and side quests. etc. The graphic is ok-ish, not too fancy but enough to keep you entertained for quite a long time, though the color tone seems a bit off (it's called Grim Dawn for a reason). In short, buy this, this is one of the most rewarding early-access I've ever purchased. Pros:- Loot- Dual class- Character customization- Crafting system- Classic!Cons:- Crafting system somtimes feels too confusing- Grind, grind, grind- Not up-to-date graphics- Multiplayer is still as bad as TQ			"

												Rating: 10/10I love ARPG's, I spent more time with my Diablo 2 Amazon and Assassin than with any other real life girl (well, before the wedding).Gathering all the experience I have in this genre, Grim Dawn is IMO definitely the best ARPG hack'n'slash game you can get right now.Pros:• Great graphics, visuals, controls, performance..• You can choose two classes and combine VARIETY of spells and passives from huge skill trees, finding the best synergies between them• Really deep ""Devotion"" passive skill tree to utilize your character even more• Clever inventory system, many trade options (like fraction shop, where you can buy items as your reputation grows)• UI is very good, many fights can be really tough (including bosses, legendary creatures..)• Tons of different drops, including legendaries, set items etc...• Huge enchanting system, with MANY runes/trinkets and potions/powders• Storyline is nice with non-repetitive main and side quests (besides bounties)• Difficulty level from Normal to Ultimate (experience penalty for death in higher dif.) including hardcore mode, • Atmospheric soundtrack which really fits into the game• Big replay value, due to unlocking more skills and quest as your reputation growsCons:• You might think it's gay, but I really don't find anyDevs made (and are still making!) an excellent piece of art which I can recommend to everyone!

Dark atmosphere with fitting music, plenty of loot for a little gear hoarder to collect and messing around with the double class builds make sure the upcoming weekends are going to be booked.

								Dungeon Crawlers are my preferred genre, and Grim Dawn promises to be one of the legendary games. People will remember it like they recall Diablo 2. And this impression is from the pre-release version. I bought it yesterday afternoon and have 18.6 hours play as of writing this.TLDR: Grim Dawn is the most fun I've had collecting scrap metal while fighting monsters bent on my destruction.The Devs: The refugees from Iron Lore and the designers of Titan Quest: Immortal Throne. They are very active and responsive to the gamers supporting them. They are proactive on things, but, because they are an 8 person team and not 40 like ""other devs"" they might seem a little slow.The Game: Playable now!Pros:> No DRM> No Internet required> Scalable UI> settings for color blindness> Super Fast Loading Game> Atmosphere is absorbing - fits well with the apocalyptic aliens scenario> Dual Class - basically gives 16 class combinations for most of a character's life. Because the starting class tends to stay ahead of the second class there is a difference between an Arcanist-Soldier and a Soldier-Arcanist. The first is more magic based with some combat, and the second is more combat based with some magic. It can make a difference.> Two Hot Bars - assign spells, potions, etc to the 1 thru 0 keys... then do another set. > Combat is solid - Yes, some people fall in to spamming just two attacks, but it is their fault and not the game's. You can spam as many actions as you can keep track of.> Crate - Cannot say enough about Crate and their commitment to their players.> Zombies - Who doesn't like zombies?Cons:I think it is very unfair to tear into the downside of a game that is pre-release. But there are some things that are not just bugs that I feel need a change.> Zombies - kind of over played right now thanks to The Walking Dead. I personally could pass on this part of the lore. And while it is nice to see nods to this or that... but actually refereing to some of them as Walkers? To soon? Yes. How about just having them be ""Puppets"" or something. Puppets could be a nod to Heinlein.> Fog - Some regions are covered in a solid fog, dropping contrast to eye straining lows.> Character Avatars - Only one male and one female - both white. While I am tired of the cliche ""warriors have to be huge, wizards have to look like Harry Trotter"" I do think that even a couple choices would be nice. I'd like a spell caster that makes Shwartzenegger look small.> Multiplayer - No clue why every game dev from Blizzard to Firaxis is having trouble getting multi to work. But I never play multi so I really don't see this as a con.Other:> Assorted bugs, balance issues and incompletes that you'd expect from an alpha-beta game in pre-release. They will be fixed.> A very small development team. So things will be fixed, hopefully before the sun burns out.TLDR 2: Player after player says, ""I bought this game 3 hours ago and have played it for over 4 hours now. It's very good.""			"

								Melds the best elements from Titan Quest, (primarily class system/augmentation/itemization) while going for more of a Diablo II-ish setting, which could best be described as gothic steampunk.If you were a fan of the Diablo series, primarily Diablo II, definitely pick this up.If you thought Titan Quest had great mechanics, but didn't care for the Greek lore and setting, this is really the game for you.The multiplayer truly is great, you are given the option of enabling Instanced Loot as well, so there's no fighting over who gets what.You can also inspect other players at will, to view what gear they're using, as well as their other attributes.I was a bit skeptical at first, but after putting a good handful of hours into this, I can safely say this is one of, if not my most favorite ARPGs since the release of Diablo II: LoD.While I purchased this at half off, I can safely say this game IS worth the FULL price.A+, highly recommended.

Early Access Review
								So, I am a little confused by people who have posted negative reviews due to the multiplayer aspect of the game. It is first and foremost a single player game that happens to have multiplayer bolted-on! For those who say it runs poorly, perhaps your hardware isn't up to the task? There have been some issues (after all the game is in early access) but for me personally the game runs well. Worst of all are those who whine that the dev's 'nerfed my favourite skill and now I can't play the game anymore because it's not fun' or words to that effect. There's no pleasing some people! I have got over 380 hours in game and I am still having fun. I've played multiple builds using multiple different skills and long let this continue!I would certainly recommend this game.			"

												What can I say, this game is great.ARPGs have always had a soft spot in my heart. This game delivers on that. Loot galore, muliple classes and dual classing, detailed environements, coop and 4 player MP is all included.Quests, loot, exploration, theory crafting, loot, bosses, more loot, factions, reputation system, crafiting and more. Its been compared to D3, D2 and POE. I rate this game above those.For a look at the masteries, look here for some theory crafting   grimcalc.com "

Early Access Review
								I don't play that often and when I do I simply want to enjoy. Enjoy the world, the challenge, the story and all the other stuff. This game, even in its early access form, gives me exactly what  I want. The world seems interesting, the item embuing thing seems fun and the 2-way character build is something new. It is a bit of a Diablo, but in a good way. What I especially love is the difficulty level of battles already from the beginning. Unlike in many other games where you can simply run into any foe and click your way through, especially early game, Grim Dawn gives just enough for you to think when to rush in and when to actually kite around for a while. The game is by no means hard, but the difficulty level is just enough for me to feel engaged in battles. Especially against enemy heroes. This means I can actualyl enjoy the game casually all the way from the beginning - I don't have to rush and push my way through to end-game to have all the fun. I can have casual fun when getting to the end-game.Of course the game is not perfect. It is sometimes hard to target in battles due to environment and sometimes your surroundings might block your ranged attacks even when you don't see an obstacle between you and your target. But I am sure these are more of early access ""features"" rather than real problems.Either way I strongly recommend the game for ARPG guys around. Even for the more casual ones.			"

												This game is freaking great. Don't let the EA ( early access) disclaimer fool you the game is in late beta and will be fully finished this year. Grim Dawn is useing a modified Titan Quest engine and it shows the improvments. Grim Dawn is the only ARPG game that i don't mind spending hours trying to farm loot. The multiplayer is pretty good, although you may experiance moments of intense lag in large fights. Grim Dawns art style hits its them very well. with the music complementing the atomosphe.  When i play at night with my headphones I can get creeped out with the ambiance.  Combat  In Grim Dawn is great and you feel your characters power as you grow. This game is challenging and you will need to carefull early on, Grim Dawn does do a decent job of keeping comabt challangeing up untill the end. Grim Dawn does a good job at keeping up with it post apocalyptic theme, from merchents who overcharge their wares and having the currncy be peices of iron, to the scavenging of food to restore your constituion and the run down towns and farms. if any of this intrest you or you are a fan of this genre it is totally worth the price.  ps please excuse my typosAFTER RELEASE UPDATEGrim Dawn is still a great game and most of what I said still holds up but their are some problems that have surfaced.Combat: The comabt is still challanging but because of the nature of ARPG it is easy to become extreamly powerful now on the surface this seams to a problem, but it isn't and here's why usally they trade  survivalability for damage, most mobs on normal and veteran settings are not going to poseany threat, but once they get into higher settings it will balance out.Now there is the opposite to this spectrum with trading dps for surivalbility (I like the idea of being unkillable), again this isn't a problem but I will point it out since I am here. Like the ""glass cannons"" the ""Battle turtle"" will have to change in the later game mods just to beable to kill bosses. In normal it takes forever to kill things but you will never have to worry about dying.voice acting & cinematic: It is okay for the most part, I wasn't one of the plebs asking for it, but it is sufficient for being tact on. The opening cinematic is something to be desired it isn't really good and is to full of cheese for my tast and I love the army of darkness.Multiplayer: Oh boy this is a big problem with me the game constently suffers from lag spikes and with players getting freaquent diconnects (I never join servers I host them so I think it is only happening to people that joins servers) it is frustrating, but not unplayable unless you are doing SoT or CB or playing HC(also can we stop using the word hardcore to define permadeath it's stupid masochist mod is more accurate).immersion: Grim Dawns theme is a post apocalypse with a HP lovecraft twist and it delivers. They way some of the npcs you find are just disheartening from a crazed loon living in a infested city to a father considering doing something horrific. There are many good people in Grim Dawn brought to apsolute despair and are jsut trying to survive. The way Grim Dawn handles its world building is very hands off. You find many nots in the world through breakign verious bookshelves and finding stands with tomes on them. These where the games lore, you can read them at your leisure in your journal. The wrting in these notes are top notich and the few that I have took the time to read are like reading pages from a novel. one of my favorites are the origins of sillth definitly chilling. I am left wanting to learn more about this games mythos, from the old gods you fight against to the other deities, you even get to meet one in game.Over all this game still holds up and is a steal at 26$ BUY IT NOW, DO IT, DO IT NOW!!!!!!!

												My opinon on this game...Well what else can I say other than BEST GAME EVER!!!! Wow like really wow this game is what I would call prefection. I brought this game 10 hours ago and I have 8.6hours of gameplay. I dont belive I have ever been so nerdy about a game in my life. Pros++The game looks great+Combat is not reptitive and with skills changing your combat style+ Leveling system is very well made and there is alot of diffrent upgrades+Open world to a certin extenet+ Can even play with friends (Unless you dont have friends like me hahaha ha haaa.....)+Diversity in terrain and mobs+ Very few bugs/glitches (havent ran into any yet)+The looting system is amazing i have never enjoyed looting this much on a game since Skyrim +The amount of content (quests and main story)+Weapons large amount of diveristy in them to cross bows to rifles.   one handed swords to giant battle axes+Movement and teleportation system 10/10Cons-- Turtorial there is little to nothing teaching how to play you really need to learn through trial and error and past knowlege in other video games.(At the same time this also can make the game more intresting/difficult)- Not enough cons to write in a reviewoverall rating 10/10 Remeber this is Review is MY opinon.

Early Access Review
								One of VERY few early access games that has consistently impressed and pleased me.On Gamplay: It's an ARPG, so you can expect gameplay in the same vein as Diablo, Path of Exile, or Titan Quest. If you're coming from Titan Quest, you'll likely feel right at home; the game incorporates the Mastery system from that game, and interface is a (much improved) derivation of that interface. One thing to note is that, where characters felt a little... stiff in TQ, characters feel considerably less so in Grim Dawn.Also, wonderful gore and particle effects serve only to enhance to hilarious Titan Quest ragdolls that you know and love.I can't recommend it enough.

								[24 hours on record, 3 classes played]I'll get right down to it and add my voice to those heralding vast amounts of praise to Grim Dawn. Anyone who enjoyed Diablo II, Torchlight I/II and Path of Exile will definitely enjoy this title.Even in its Early Access state, Grim Dawn has much to offer: Interesting classes, a gorgeous world shown via a great high-fidelity engine, quests aplenty, and a storyline that shines with promise as you slash your way through towns and villages, grasslands, swamps, caves, and highlands - with many more zones on the way judging by the in-game map.Oh, and we mustn't forget the Shineys! Loot. Tons of loot. Seriously, bring a truck.			"

								I cannot rate this game enough, so far im barely even into the 1st act and have never felt so satisfied with a buy, honestly this game is worth every penny.This reminds me of Diablo 2 which i loved, just alot more in depth. Every little detail i miss about other Arpg's this features it and has been done to such perfection IMO. I personally like to rotate the camera and zoom in and out at certain points, you can do all this with your middle mouse button! The immersion you get from the world in which you are playing is brilliant and every detail has been added to really please the player. Even the World map is brilliantly detailed. This is more of a counter review against another i read with regards to the immersion and graphics. Sorry but NO. The immersion is awesome and the graphics are fine (i5 4690k, gtx 770 4gb) this game delivers in almost every aspect IMO. My only con with it so far is that the dialog spoken by NPC's is that of text with NO audio which id think would be awesome but that is it. Honestly dont take the negative reviews of this game too seriously as im sure most of them are just your typical Blizzard fanboys which pick fault in every tiny aspect.This is honestly a must buy for the people who just love the Arpg genre. This is one of the purchases you honestly are happy with the money you spent! :) This gets my thumbs up for sureI strongly recommend this game to anyone who loved Diablo 2. Honestly money well spent.			"

Early Access Review
								edit - le sigh, farewell to Wyn, my lvl 27 Battlemage. Loving the Hardcore mode :)This game is great, hands down. It works in the 'Diablo style' without feeling like a clone or a knock off. Let's face it, there are really two names right now when it comes to the Diablo-esque ARPGs - Path of Exile and Diablo 3 (all right, so Diablo 2 is still going, I know, but we're talking modern). I like this one because it manages to not feel like either of those titles. -The pacing is decent - I keep moving forward and it never really feels like I'm slowing down. -The loot system feels tight, I get upgrades at a fairly regular pace but you never seem to know when that awesome piece will be around the corner. The item upgrades that you find are also interesting and useful right off the bat. I never feel like I should hoard them because I'm always finding something new. I'm sure down the road there will be big bad endgame style pieces but for now it's managing to stay fun.-The class system. That's where this game really shines. I've been making new characters and playing them to level ten to experiment with the mix-n-match the game provides and so far it's been a positive experience. Things I wouldn't mind seeing in the future - a little more information regarding how certain classes synergize with eachother, what skills play well with others, etc. It's early on right now so I'm not as worried about it (and let's face it, theorycrafting is half the reason fansites exist) and I'm having fun with the experimentation.-No persistent online connection. I cannot stress how awesome this is. Will it lead to some cheating? Probably. Do I care about that when I just want to play by myself or with a few buddies? Not in the slightest. Considering that the place I live has terrible internet having a proper Single Player Mode is absolutely crucial, my ping time can get over 1000ms and I don't need to explain how quickly that will get you killed in D3 or PoE. With this game I don't have to worry about it, just fire it up and away I go.So far so good guys. It's amazing to see what's been done (especially considering the age of the engine running underneath the hood) so far and I'm really looking forward to what the future holds. Well worth the price tag.			"

												Quite why everybody in the reviews compares this game to Diablo 2 is beyond me. Did none of these people play Titan Quest? This is much closer to Titan Quest... and better too in pretty much everyway (and I like Titan Quest).  A different, slightly more  complex, experience than Diablo 3, it's effects are not quite as good (but then, what ARPG can boast better?) but the gameplay is great and the hours soon fly by. Also ... local coop! Great to see this still being supported in a modern game. Highly recommended.			"

												This is a Neutral review, but due to Steam's 'Love It Or Hate It' voting system, I'm selecting against it due to how the end game works.The game itself has four acts, with each act consisting of a major plot arc as the main character (you) explores the land to unite with survivors and repel an otherworldly invasion. I mostly enjoyed exploring every nook and cranny during the first act. Then that feeling died quick as the game placed valuable upgrades throughout the area, making the exploring portion mandatory to stand a chance at later difficulties. I spent 40 hours with my latest Hardcore character (not dead as of this review), and clocked 27 hours of those 40 exploring the map for shiny shrines and attributes gained through side quests. It was a struggle to beat the game the first time by act 3 and took several breaks to get the urge to finish the rest of the game. Overall, the 'Normal' difficulty version of the game is worth checking out.My main gripe with the game is it relies on difficulty being resistance based. In the game, there are 8 major resistances and 3 other important damage types not covered by the major 8. If a player is able to get a resistance stat above 50%, the game allows for a struggle in the fight, where that player can take a hit while delivering damage and not instantly run at the sight of taking damage. Coupled that by having only 1 healing potion to use at a time, a person playing Hardcore has to grind previous difficulties to get their resistances up or they will die, no exceptions. It made it very boring because I couldn't progress the story for the later difficulties at all, at least safely.The game further chooses to disrespect the player's time by not providing a reliable means to improve the most common 4 types of damage: Vitality, Aetherial, Chton, and Poison. Elemental Resistance is plenty in the game, so much so, it almost shouldn't exist where I got a shoulder plate to drop that gave +30% to all elements on top of the 40% element resist from Shrines. For those four I mentioned, there are almost no significant ways to improve them through Components (items you socket into items) and Augments (items you earn through factions that apply on top of the components), meaning you need to get lucky and hope an item drops with what you need.Damage bonuses are flat multipliers, so damage quickly becomes fixed if one doesn't use multipliers through curses or items that decrease resistances or defenses. The game doesn't support glass cannons properly because of that and teaches over time to just focus on defense because your damage will be good enough for almost all the fights. Only when my resistances weren't high against the damage type I was facing was I concerned about needing to do damage in a quick manner.I could probably write about 3 pages worth of complaints in design decisions with information to prove those points, but to save your time I recommend playing the game through Normal difficulty and stopping there, even though the game gimps most characters through their Shrine system having the rest of the Devotion points be available in later difficulties. It'll be a massive time sink gearing up a character to handle the later difficulties with no progression in completing those higher challenges.			"

Bought a new house, new car, really made something of myself in a short amount of time.Fast forward 9 months and the kid arrives.   The reason i changed my whole life and in a way the reason i never played this game.   Well the baby was Black.  Neither of us are black.  She cheated on me.  I was crushed .  I left them ,  my life fell apart and now i live with my parents a former husk of the man i became.One evening after i had cried my last tear for the night i decided to start up my steam account and play Grim Dawn.I could care less that my ex wife cheated on me now .  I hate that ♥♥♥♥♥ cause she delayed the joy i now feel having found this game.I am complete now. Thank you "

Did you love the character freedom, of being able to combine a melee class with a caster class? or Just about any other combanation did you enjoy a world rich in lore and story then your going to really love this game it takes all the awsome qualities of Titans Quest and combines it with even more indepth character custamization now not only can you combine classes and mix and match what ever your in the mood for you can go even further with the devotion system its like christmas day everyday! the devotion system allows you to further develop your character quite uniquely by adding even more skills to choose from and more effects from said skills, so If you liked games Like Titans Quest and Diablo 2 then be sure to check this one out its a real Gem you dont want to pass by.

								Having a blast. Very polished for early access. Bugs for me at least have been very small and not noteworthy. Game is balanced and fair so no real complaints there. I'm not really into the lore for this one but it is there for those that want it. How good it is I can't say to be honest. I mean this kinda game is loot n go right? If you liked Torchlight 2 and such buy in and support. I don't think U will be disappointed.			"

												An amazing game all around.Pros:- diablo 2 atmosphere (pretty ""grim"", as its name states) and bloody- lootfest (gotta get all those epics / legendary items)- good difficulty balancing (you'll always feel like your character could die if you don't pay attention)- amazing Devotion and dual-class system, super varied, allowing many different playstyles- respec-ing is basically free, the game encourages you to try many different ways to play the same character- killing enemies feels rewarding (nice effects etc., and loot, lots of loot!)- 4 difficulties (2 for the first playthrough, then 2 others for additional playthrough like in Diablo 2)- you literally need 2 min to start the game and get to the monster smashing action, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (esp. nice when you want to play for a short time)Cons:- sometimes it's a bit ""too"" dark (you may want to adjust your screen lighting)			"

												An awesome game, if you love any of the Diablo or the torchlight series, im pretty sure you will love this one as well. at first i thought it was just a basic game but man, the story, mechanics, the design of the game itself is pretty good. Lots and lots of mobs to destroy and skill tree is very wide and flexible. it's pretty Gory too, expect some blood when u read the lores and fight off the monsters. 10/10 would keep playing this if i have all the time. haha			"

Product received for free
												If you loved DIablo and Diablo 2, this game is the♥♥♥♥♥♥  Pros- Extremely expansive and detailed character build system.  110.5 hrs in and I could keep making characters for years!  The synergies between the skill trees, constellations, augmentations, components, etc. is very deep.- Great graphics and scenery.  The world is beautiful, monsters and gear look great.- Great crafting system- Grimdark setting that is actually grim and dark.  Like the journals I found of a family that resorted to prostituting their 11 year old out to survive, eventually turning to murdering the johns and canabalizing them as they succumbed to the blood god.  Savage.Cons- Too much loot.  Set your filter to yellow as a minimum, green is better.  The amount of trash loot is simply obscene.  That and ""rare"" items just rain form the sky to the point that you will find yourself swapping out Epic/Legendary items with a copy that is .001% better on a somewhat regular basis.- Difficulty is disappointing.  Too easy most of the time, then occassionally you get an enemy that is over the top.  Wish it was consistently more difficult without the giant spikes.  Won't be an issue for many, but if you are good with numbers, this game will feel like easy mode a lot of the time.- The map system is lacking.  The world is expansive and fantastic, but finding your way around can be annoying until you get familiar with the world of Cairn.- The default camera I feel is to claustrophobic and does not do the game justice at all.  Get Grim Cam and spend some time getting it set up to your liking.  It is a VAST improvement that really makes the world come to life.It has some flaws, but still worth it and the only recent Diablo-like worth playing right now imo. "

												Summer-Rain awakens to the sight of you danglingfrom a hangman's noose. Gasping, the residentleader-of-the-resistance shoots the rope twice andfrees you. The newly-updated intro cutscene shiftsaway to the main game, and the familiar, isometric2D camera welcomes you into the hellish world ofCairn, where Fallout meets a frontiersman-like Christian dark age.GRIM DAWN.""What's going on now, Starboy?"" Summer-Rain asks,unsure of the foreboding atmosphere of overturned, burning carts, ruined towns and mutilated corpses and livestock. The living dead stalk the streets and countryside, and strange, otherworldly crystals havesprouted along the landscape, corrupting everything.""I have to make my way to Homestead, help the folkholed up in prison with resupplying their food source.""Summer-Rain smiles, before asking if Achilles can helpyou with your quest at the Homestead. ""Ha-ha, Summer, very funny...!"" You manage a wrysmile, before you cross a Reanimator's path, a giant,hulking undead monstrosity with aetherium crystalssprouting from its back, summoning lesser undead tofight you. ""What's the story behind those crystals?""Summer-Rain asks, putting a tub of vanilla ice creamin between her crossed legs as she watches you fightthe reanimator. Clicking furiously in this Diablo-likegame that makes Diablo III look apalling, you wonderhow a team of less than ten people did so well a jobcompared to a game where dozens of people workedon and took years to complete in the case of Diablo.You glance at her before doing a double-take, withSummer-Rain oblivious to the suggestive pose she isin, with vanilla ice cream, no less. You explain whilefighting throughout the countryside that the greencrystals; Aetherium, were artificially made and is thereason why the Grim Dawn event happened. Before the world of Cairn changed, it was similar to being a mix of the American Colonies and semi-industrial England. But after the Grim Dawn, with magic commonplace, two otherworldly powers came and fought among themselves over the world- the Aetherials, who possessed physical vessels and saw Humans as both fuel and food, and the Chthonians, enemies of the Aetherials who required pain and blood sacrifices to bind themselves to mortals to grant them aid or power.Summer-Rain tilts her head with the spoon in hermouth, a weird look on her face before she removesthe spoon for another scoop of vanilla. ""Doesn't seem like a good deal for any of us humans. TheAetherials wanna eat us and the Chthonians want touse us, even though they hate the Aetherials."" Bythis time, you have fought your way to Homesteadand helped their Quartermaster with an insectinfestation, and now the human remnants of anEmpire want to enlist an external faction to combatthe otherworldly menace. You walk towards the Homestead's central area amidBlack Legion guards, garrisoned in Homestead forprotection of both the farmers and for the Legion'sown, the last bastion of sanity in a world gone mad,miles from the Prison-Fortress you called your newhome since beginning the game.""Who are these two?!"" Summer-Rain exclaims, twocharacters now flanking you, one in dark robes andcloth mask, arcane runes upon his garb, while theother is clothed in white with gold armor, orangeand red accents decorating his patterns of fire andthe sun. ""I have to choose now, the faction whichwill assist me in my quest to free Cairn from thesemonsters.""Summer-Rain is excited now. ""Burn them! Burn theundead influence from Cairn!"" She yells, but youalready wanted to play with the Order of Death'sVigil, the necromancers who have a noble outlookon undeath, but are reviled by the rival factionKymon's Chosen, a group dedicated to a Sun Godwhom the Necromancers view as a false messiah.""HOW COULD YOU?!?!"" Summer-Rain exclaims,incredulous after picking your faction to progressthe story. ""They're religious fanatics, Summer!""You try to argue your case, but Summer-Rain isnot hearing any of it. ""You're using necromancy!The very powers you're trying to destroy! You'rea hypocrite, Starboy Coldheart!"" She sticks her tongue out at you while moving towards the door.""Where are you going?!"" You ask, not knowingwhat to do now, what with receiving orders togo to the super-secret hideout of the Order ofDeath's Vigil and Summer-Rain about to walk outof your room. She looks down at you in a strange,half-pout.""I'm going to get my laptop and play Grim Dawnon my own. I'm going to join Kymon's Chosen andburn the corruption of the undead, the Aetherials,the Chthonians- and you- from Cairn."" Your jawdrops as Summer-Rain opens your door andflashes you her signature smile.""I Love you... Starboy Coldheart!""A week later, the warrior priestess of Kymon's Chosen, Summer-Rain; faces off against an occultist of the Order of Death's Vigil in the most strangely unbalanced multiplayer host game in an isometric ARPG.All because she wanted to burn undead for theglory of a false Sun God rather than use them to combat other undead alongside her boyfriend.GRIM DAWN.

												Though still in development this game proves to be challenging and the rotating camera angles are a nice touch while playing so nothing gets missed especially new discoverable routes.The Above review is something I quickly compiled shortly after Grim Dawn launched on Steam Early Access. My glowing review still stands, this ARPG is solid and is by far one of the best games I have enjoyed in a long time. As you take a look at other reviews little to no players say many negative things about the game. Those who do point out performance type issues have points, but Crate has been serious about creating fixes to permanently squash glitches and errors. Grim Dawn is now at the point where more and mroe DLC is being released. 2 Content patches (both free so far) have been released with one adequately priced arena based DLC (on the steam store). Another 2017 early DLC is announced for a new class with an 8th to arrive after that. Crate openly supports modding of GZrim Dawn and the community has been tediously at work making some quality extentions. Do I support this game in the finished state after it's highly successful EA launch? I sure do! It would be a steal and my recommendation to get it on sale but even buying it at full price is worth it in my opinion. At full price you are supporting a highly active and interactive developer studio, encouraging them to continue their fantastic support, and giving them incentive to keep DLCs coming in the future. Buy and play the game, you wont be disappointed!			"

								After some hours and finishing act 1, I have to admit that this game has the chance to be the real Daiblo II sequel (in terms of gameplay). Though, the developers have to take their chance and there is still a lot of work to do.Pros:- Skilltree, finally a game that allows tinkering with skills and spells.- Two ""classes"" in one, or second spec.- Typical Diablo like Hack'n'Slay- You are responsible for stats assignment- Has this ""I want to see more and gather items"" feeling or at least unleashes it- Futurue support or partly supported already: CraftingCons:- The Titan Quest engine, yes, someone may say it is doing a great job but there are many things this engine is not capable of (e.g., missing shadows, performance issues, etc.)- The gameplay is not that smooth yet.- Only 2 acts until now (CONSIDER: Early Access!)- Crafting is currently not really balanced- Level capThe game has a lot of potential but the devs need to unleash its potential. There are still some things that are not yet finished and will need a lot of polishing.Finally, I recommend this game to everyone who is searching for a old fashioned Hack'n'Slay.			"

								Grim Dawn is great fun! There is so much to explore, tons of sweet loot and interesting quests. While it is based on the old TQ engine a lot of work has been done to bring it up to date and the visuals are great with each area having a distinct look and feel, this combined with the excellent audio makes for a very immersive environment.While I love this game I’m not a big fan of the constitution bar. When constitution runs out and I can’t find anything to restore it, I’m back to spamming health potions. I did prefer the earlier versions of the game where health just restored outside of battle and health potions had a longer recharge. I believe this forced a more strategic level of combat and gameplay.GD has a great community with a committed and experienced dev team. The devs post frequent game updates on the forums (http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/) and are always ready to receive constructive feedback.Can’t wait to see how the rest of this game develops. :) "

												Greetings.For start i would like to say that i am big fan of Diablo 2 and sadly no ARPG that came out after Diablo 2 couldnt manage to bring the same feeling and fun Diablo series had ( Diablo 3 is garbage).And now we have it Grim Dawn!  The developers of the game made Titan quest which was a masterpiece ( didnt play it yeah shame on me :)  ) starting from team of 2 people and eventually grew to team of 10 people and managed to create this GEM.Since the ARPG market isnt that big we have 2 games that are currently the best on ARPG genre which are Diablo 3 ( ugghh) and its Free version which is Path of Exile.On the other hand none of those games reached the pinnacle of gameplay which diablo 2 had. DIablo 3 is just overpriced MMO these days and Path of Exile is a big market for trading gems-skills to make a cookie-cutter builds.Now lets see what exactly makes Grim Dawn a great game and why you should invest your time into it:Dual class system: you get a choice out of 6 classes( masteries) as you start on level 2 and another choice of class at level 10. Although its not forced and you can play 1 class just as any ARPG.Gear gives skills: there are lots of gear and components which can give you different skills as well be it passive or active.Devotion System: There are shrines located in the world of cairn as you adventure , some of them require  to be fixed(different componets required)  or kill a wave of monsters.After you restore a shrine you get devotion point which can be spent according to your like.Total of 50 shrines can be obtainable.Factions: you kill monsters for a faction to get respected with them which unlocks gear and augments to boost your character even further.    I  can go on and on about game features but the game is awesome and worth every penny you give for it.3 Difficulties; Normal, Elite, Ultimate. 4 Huge acts to complete. 2 roguelike dungeons for more challenge. The game is content complete and fully playable which awaits some polishing and launch at February. Lets congratulate the developers on making such a badass game with little budget.  Cheers			"

Early Access Review
The ShortPros: Awesome combatIntense settingReplay abilityDepth, so much depthCons:Depth, so much depthOccasional damage spikes (possibly because of locational armour ratings)Difficult to create effective class combinations without planningThe Long:The first thing with an ARPG is whether or not the Action is fun. When you can knock back an enemy, watch it fly and proc an 8 way fireball that hits them as they're flying back, then use a charge skill to hit them again there is a sense of perverse satisfaction. Damn fun.The main issue with Grim Dawn is that there are a lot of skills, and even more items. Which is both brilliant and horrible. It's brilliant when you can find the skill and item interaction that allows you to achieve that crazy combo, and the depth that this game has is astounding, but that's where things get difficult. Unless you've been playing traditional ARPG's since they came out, or can do complicated mathematics on the fly, there is an overload of information finding these combinations may take a while. Grim Dawn partially addresses this with separated character sheets and detailed information, while summarising it for newer players but with so many interactions it can be difficult for new players to understand what is useful and what is not.I always feel the need to plan out the character with a skill calculator, trying to figure out the optimal way to get the most damage out of it. If you're into that kind of thing awesome, if not, beware.Conclusion:If you like the genre, you'll more than likely enjoy the game. If this is your first time playing an ARPG you may need some, or alot of help. "

								How is this game? Marvellous really..And If you are the type of individual who has been waiting for an rpg that brings back that gritty Diablo 2 feel but on a much deeper level, then look no further. Crate Entertainment is really creating something special here in a game that's bound to be very, very special once more people get their hands on it at release. From the build diversity, to the great itemization and open explorable world, this game is just a masterpiece in the making. Put in this way, as an arpg enthusiast and fanatic really, only Grim Dawn and PoE have come closest to quenching that D2 thirst I once had. So kudo's to Crate Entertainment, a small indie company for out performing the mega millionaire/billionaire companies and delivering a hell of a game in the making!			"

								Do not let yourself get scared away by the Early Access, this game is better then most completed games. This is the answer to fans of Diablo 2 that were disappointed by Diablo 3. I put a lot of hours in Diablo 2 and I will surely do the same here. My first big complaint was the multiplayer aspect not being in game, and now that they added that in the most recent patch, I have no problems with this game. Multiplayer matches do sometimes disconnect, but with everything just getting started, there will be bugs to work out. Devs are excellent, and this game is one the best, if not the best, dungeon crawlers out there. 10/10			"

												Titan Quest 2: Steampunk edition. No, this isn't a criticism, I loved TQ, and Grim Dawn lovingly thieves TQ's corpse of a lot of key gameplay elements (no surprise, as most of Crate Entertainment is made up of TQ's devs, if memory serves correctly) Equipment: Grim Dawn's gear consists of a typical loot-fests' prefixed and affixed ""Ascended Warrior's [item] of Everlasting Pain and Death of the Fox""-type loot generation, with a fair smattering of weapon archetypes to choose from at the moment (swords, daggers, two-handers, rifles, pistols, crossbows, etc.) You can buy these super-overpriced from friendly merchants in town, or just kill special bosses or minibosses and get drops from them. Armor is spread about, consisting of a familiar spread -- helmet, torso, legs, feet, shoulders, gloves, and then slots for amulets, two rings, medals (like, military rewards, yeah), and relics. These last few are more specialized and, like most other H&Ss, are usually more utilitarian, offering not specific DPS or defense boosts, but general stat buffs. Upgrades: Gear can be 'gemmed' (Diablo 2 callback) in a sense. As you kill enemies, you'll collect fragments of upgrade items. Combine them (just smash them together in-inventory, no need for special NPCs or items) and you get the ""completed"" item. You can upgrade gear with this stuff at any point, complete or not, with completion usually maxing out the stat/effect bonus the item uses, in addition to adding an additional ability. Certain things will only fit into certain gear (upgrades increasing weapon damage can only fit into, well, weapons). And no, there's no slot-tracking to keep in mind, for better or for worse -- a completed upgrade piece is a big investment into a piece of gear you know you'll keep for a while (or maybe it's just an upgrade that you don't even really like).  Crafting: This'll feel quite familiar to Diablo 3 players. You get a Blacksmith NPC after some time out in the field who will craft stuff for you. This can be randomly-rolled items, or it can be super-upgrades, combining several of the previously-mentioned upgrades into a single, more powerful item with different effects altogether. Most crafting costs one or several of a few unique crafting-only materials you find afield (Scrap, Aether Crystals, and Tainted Brain Matter, to name a few gooey examples). Crafting is also the only way to make Relics, which is an item for one of your fairly-numerous inventory slots. Skilltrees/Masteries: This is what I am very grateful that the TQ devs put into Grim Dawn. What set TQ, and by inheritance, Grim Dawn, apart was the way it handled skills. See, you don't say ""I'm a Wizard!"" when you start the game, and only ever learn magic spells. What happens is, the first time you level up, you choose your skilltree. Right now, there's:-- Soldiers (lots of general self-buffs and damaging abilities, not flashy but strong)-- Occultists (Summoner-type character, can have a variety of pets or a single strong one, depending how you build it, and with debuffs to cast on enemies and a handful of offensive spells)-- Demolitionists (the ranged class, intended to use guns as there's skills that specifically focus on their use. Has a bunch of 'gadgets' that can supplement DPS, like grenades, traps, etc.)-- Nightblade (the rogue class, lots of movement/positioning skills, with focus on critical hits and powerful damage buffs)-- Arcanist (the caster, has a range of offensive and defensive spells from single-target to AoEs).-- Shaman (sort of like a spellsword, if that spellsword used a two-handed weapon. Skills are much along the path of the Diablo 2 Necromancer's totems.)The coolest part is that, at level 10, you choose a SECOND Mastery, if you so choose. Or, you can refrain from doing so, and simply keep pouring points into your first Mastery. This is a good idea sometimes, as GD also has a very strong focus on synergizing skills -- rather than just give you a billion abilities, you only get a handful per Mastery. But as you level up the Mastery, you unlock new skills that branch off of each ability's ""tree"", adding additional effects. You can pour points into this new effect for better stats on that effect... OR you can put points into the initial skill.Say you have a magic missile ability, for example. You put a single point into it to unlock it. If you put more points into it, it increases damage of type A. But, if you put points into a skill down the tree, you might unlock an explosion effect that deals damage over time of type B! So you could feasibly just unlock a skill for use, then never touch the initial skill again, if later branches in the tree have effects you prefer. Instant warp-to-town: Hardly bears mentioning, as it is more or less standard for H&Ss nowadays, but yeah. Free travel back to town at any time without needing to carry around town portal scrolls. NOT from TQ, but instead new to GD: you can unlock new areas by collecting enough Scrap (one of those crafting mats, you may recall) and iron bits (the ""gold"" of this world) and building a bridge. In some cases, this can speed up forward progression... or you can go in a completely different direction from where the game seems to be railroading you. A very nifty way to make you feel a bit less like you're just moving in a straight line through the game.One thing I do find kind of lackluster is building your character outside of skill choices. Character stat-building is more or less dependent on Mastery Selection, as points into the Mastery (which counts as a skill point use, so keep track) will not only unlock new skills, but give you general stat increases relevant to the Mastery (big ""Physique"" stat increase for Soldier, ""Cunning"" for Demolitionist, ""Spirit"" for Arcanist, etc., and a smaller amount of a mixture of the other stats). These are the three stats you can really directly affect, actually. Each is a catch-all for a variety of engine numbers (Physique is Health, Defense value, etc.; Cunning affects chance-to-hit and chance-to-be-hit; Spirit affects your Mana/Energy, damage of spells, etc.) Beyond Mastery skill points, you get precisely ONE (1) choice of stat to increase, from those three, per level. It's a moderate increase, to be sure (like 5 or 6 points), and yes, it's meant to supplement the Mastery's auto-assignment (which is 9 times out of 10 an accurate representation of the stats you usually need for that Mastery to shine), but for some it might feel like it's railroading players a bit too strongly.If you liked TQ, this game is a no-brainer -- It's TQ2, or might as well be. If you're a general H&S RPG fan (liked Torchlight 1 and/or 2, Diablo 1, 2, or 3, Path of Exile, Dungeon Siege 1 or 2, Sacred 1 or 2, etc. etc.), you might want to look through the gameplay videos and see if you might be interested. Otherwise... well, you kind of HAVE to be used to the genre to really 'get' the appeal of this game. If clicking on loot pinatas until they die and mashing Alt to see what they dropped isn't appealing to you, you're probably better off skipping over this one.			"

Early Access Review
								Speaking from only playing singleplayer thus far  - Grim Dawn shows amazing promise. I'm not particularly ""into"" buying Early Access games, but I showed this one an exception after closely watching it's progress on Kickstarter. I've sunk a good 3 days of playtime into Grim Dawn and it was worth it.I've played Diablo 2 more than any other game. I've been waiting for it's successor and this may very well be it. Even Diablo 3 doesn't hold a candle to this game. Grim Dawn is the remains of Titan Quest's engine - repurchased it's own creators and greatly tweaked and improved upon. Whatever grainy feeling I got from it has it's own charm.Grim Dawn is a game where you're rewarded for exploring and completion. Finding and killing elite or 'named' mobs give bonus XP. Leveling up dramatically improves your combat finesse with new abilities, passive and active. The skill/class system, which was the best part of Titan Quest is still fully imbedded in Grim Dawn. Doing side quests often gives stat or skill points. I like to call myself a 'Completionist."" Clearing the map, talking to everyone, doing every side quest. It's nice being rewarded for it and you will be rewarded in this game. You also get to choose where you go and in what order you do a lot of quests. There are currectly 2 wings (acts?) from the main city and you COULD go to the Act 2 area quite a bit earlier then you need to. Crate has added options so you can make decisions instead of making a completely linear game.The loot grind is there. Set items. Uniques. Decent rares. You'll be searching and you'll be loving it. Some gear improves specific abilities and other gear can be used by multiple classes, depending on your spec. A shared stash makes the loot grind less painful when that unique sword drops for your caster. :bI've spent the majority of my time playing non-hardcore characters, however I normally do play hardcore in these types of games. The one character I did play in hardcore I felt like the game was well balanced for it. I think I ended up dying but it was due to my poor decision, opposed to a flaw or unfair part of the game. I do suggest if you play hardcore that you play through whatever content is currently out before jumping into it. Mistakes will be made.Note: This is not an EASY game. You can run directly into enemies or a boss 5-10 levels higher than you and get obliterated. That feeling you have when you die is something that no other games like this give - Freedom. And it's great.Grim Dawn? More like GRINDAWN.... in a good way.			"

I'll tell you why; It's unique, I absolutely love it! It reminds of Titan Quest and the summers spent clickfesting away smashing enemies! I debated for a while whether to get it or not. Upon getting it I do not regret paying for it. It may be early access, but its very playable at the moment. The most interesting feature I think, is being able to rescue people and rebuild your town, its a rather unique feature and one I enjoy immensely! I hope this game goes big, like really big, and Crate can continue making more in this series for years to come!			"

								I was pleasantly surprised with Grim Dawn. I danced around the idea of getting it since its release, but ignored the urge until the Holiday sale. I'm happy I saved money on the product, but if I could go back in time I would have bought it day one.Pros The developer support seems very good as patches are released reguarly The developer listens to the community - New features are constantly added based on feedback The game has interesting classes and builds The gear works well with the skills and set/crafted pieces seem fun to put together in regards to builds You feel powerful as a player The future - Can't wait to see what's nextCons The AI seems repetitive, but perhaps it's because I haven't gotten too deep into the game You get a bunch of quests without a lot of direction on where to go and why; however, the area forces you in the direction due to environment design (Lame, but effective)As an avid isometric RPG player, I would recommend this game.

								I've only been keeping up with this game since about Christmas eve, and have been playing/streaming it nonstop since then. The setting. The sound design. The fluid combat. While there's a limited number of skills, unfortunately, there's still quite a variety of ways to build your characters. Worked on by at least one of the Titan Quest devs, with a Diablo 2 feel, more fluid combat than Path of Exile and more variety in items and builds than Diablo 3. I have a few complaints, but none substantial enough for me to even think about turning away from the game. I grabbed it through the winter holiday sale and have said multiple times that it's been worth every penny, to me. If it's ever on sale and you're looking for a new ARPG, you'd definitely be missing out if you don't pick it up.			"

								Not even completed this awesome ARPG is better than D3, TL2 and PoE. You can customize your character to your playstyle and not have the game force you to play a certain way. All the attributes are meaningful. Dual classing opens many doors and it is fun blending the skills. The loot drop rate feels just right, not too low and not too high. While it is very simular to Titan Quest, it is very different and personally I like this game more than TQ.Totally worth full price, $25 is a steal for a game like this.			"

												I will gladly accept any and all quests from an NPC named Captain Bourbon. Especially pouring myself a glass of bourbon while getting a quest from Bourbon so I can reward myself with more bourbon. I'm on a mission...from and for Bourbon.If you enjoy Titan Quest, D2 and Torchlight you will enjoy this one. Very playable for still being in Early Access, the devs have put a lot into this and are active with the updates (see build notes in news). The mobs provide a solid challenge, the skill trees have a lot of customization and the ability to dual-class gives you unique choices for character builds.Update 2.26.2016 - Full Release - 82 hours loggedNo SpoilersSo, I rolled a fresh character after the announcement that it was content complete, as of this review I finished my first playthrough of the entire story (normal diff). I can't say enough positive things about this game, so here's a short list of my impressions:1) The overall story has an excellent pace, it doesn't feel rushed and there's plenty of side content. 2) The Devotion system is a fantastic mechanism that adds a lot of flavor to your build and play style.3) There's a great balance of challenge acheived with combat. At level 50 I felt like I could walk over certain packs of mobs only to find some creature around the corner that would gladly treat me like a pinata. I'll also add that I've started a new game with the same character on Elite, and so far in Act 1 it has continued to present a satisfying challenge. 4) Skills to pay the...Blacksmith? A couple things I'd like to note. The refinement of the skills, and dual class system, has only gotten better since Early Access. Compared to other games in the genre I am really pleased with the fact that the success of your progression feels more deeply routed in skill choice and not primarily driven by gear choice. Your gear is important, but it feels more like an augment to your class and not how your class gets defined. In the same hand, this impacts crafting and in a great way. There's a lot of incentive to craft different items as you learn new patterns, but it's not going to make or break your build. I appreciate that because there's a certain level satisfaction that keeps coming back every time you get a new piece of gear that's an upgrade, and it may not even be that big of an upgrade. 5) Grim Dawn reminds me of what originally drew me into this genre, and refines it to make it fresh and enjoyable. I'll clocking a lot more hours with different classes and I'm definitely looking forward to future content.Lastly: With voice overs, I'm even more convinced, if the opportunity presented itself, I would follow Captain Bourbon into the depths of the void to rescue his brother Scotch (future content idea?)Thank you to everyone at Crate for a great game!

Early Access Review
								Grim Dawn is a spectacular addition to the isometric ARPG family. Created by some of the team that brought you the timeless classic Titan Quest, strap up and delve into Cairn - a world in a 'victorian-esque' era that is experiencing the eradication of the human race.At this time, this game is still a work in progress but it shows a ton of promise. Grim Dawn lives up to its name and paints a canvas of a harsh world where good help is hard to find, suvival isn't always guarenteed and death lurks around every corner. Accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, I found this game sucked me into its world and I sunk tons of hours hacking and slashing my way to the finish of the current beta (Build 24).If I had to compare it to other games of the genre, I'd say it has the grit and gore of Diablo 2/Path of Exile, mixed with the leveling system of Titan Quest and the fast combat of Torchlight 2. Grim Dawn introduces a variety of its own elements, such as the 'Constitution' health regeneration system, designed to reduce the number of trips to town and potions used so you spend more time in combat. The game also features a choice/consequence system where saving 'character A' means the death of 'character B' and a loss of trust from the faction character B is associated with. There is a ton of loot to reward you for your victories and a variety of options for crafting so customization is certainly an option for your gear.Outside of expected and respected bug fixes, I would like to see: more voice acting for NPCs, more animations for skills and enemies, and hopefully another class (currently there are 5).I highly recommend this game and I look forward to the completed product. Keep up the great work Crate Entertainment!			"

								Titan Quest lives again in this spiritual successor that expands upon ideas of loose quest progression and meaningfully-destructible environments which leads to a very open-world feel. Secrets feel secret (reminiscent of old Gauntlet games) and items have fun and unique stats, often times granting cool new abilities. For those left wanting with the somewhat shallow story of Path of Exile, they'll inhale this game's intriguing quest dialogs, flavor text, noteable NPCs, and lore drops throughout the game.			"

								pro's+epic adventure compared to path of exile imo grim dawn is alot more rewarding for time invested. +fun in depth crafting system.+ real feeling of progression as you lvl up with rewarding drops for the tough battles, No more countless hrs of grinding in the hopes of getting one half way decent item for your build. +faction system is neat with perks. +Secret areas to find hidden loot. +good presentation with very few graphical glitches like some skill animations not disappearing on the AI after they attack not a big deal game is still in development and this happens rarely. +some mobs scale to your lvl for the most part which is a smart way to go with AI. + Skill tree's that are stright forward and easy to understand not to mention easy to fix/undo unwanted skills  to refocus your build without costing you an arm and a leg. +recently saw they snagged a new game design assest who used to work on diablo 2 so i imagine this game will get bigger over time. the map is huge with plenty of room to add at least another 50+hrs of content on top of the already big chunk they already have, i finished my first run through in about 40hrs so much to explore and do i took my time with it i havent even touched the steps of torment yet im gearing up for that as i imagine it will be tough.Con's - This is a random issue that can occur after long periods of playing but the game will stop responding and lock up might be a memory leak or build up of game assests not bing flushed from memory this is just a guess im sure their aware of this but it hasnt been a big enough issue to be to bothersome were talking like 4+hrs of grim dawn app running, only happened once during a boss fight. i havent seen any game breaking issues aside from the random lockups after long play sessions i also cant comment on the networking aspect of multiplayer with grim dawn as of yet so i couldnt tell you weather it suffers from dsync issues like path of exile does - no tooltip dmg numbers yet to account for all your gear passives buffing up certain skills. this is nit picking as its obvious when using a new item if its better or not. - as i was a player coming from path of exile i thought hardcore deaths would send you back to standard as their is no warning label on the difficulty setting when you start a new game i died at lvl 20 and was like oh no want my *&^% toon back lmao. now you know. re-rolled in standard and still died alot in some parts which was fun/ learning exp.

Early Access Review
								First time writing a review, it's not really my thing, but I felt I owed it to this game.If you're like me, you read the Bad Reviews to see why you SHOULDN'T buy the game.  There honestly aren't that many bad reviews, which should be a good sign in the first place, but I will save you some time by summarizing what I found out looking through bad reviews, and debunking them, leaving you with no reason NOT to buy this game.First, people complain it's buggy or crashing -- Keep in mind It's early access.  That being said, it's the most stable early access game I've ever played.  I'd have to guess that the people complaining about crashes don't understand early access, or maybe played much earlier on.  I have had 1 or 2 issues in my 25 hours of playtime.Second, people complain it's  not as good as Titan Quest, the story isn't up to snuff, etc... -- This isn't in -any- way a sequel or expansion to Titan Quest. Don't expect it to be something it isn't. Yes it has some of the same staff members who worked on Titan Quest working on this game, but that knowledge is used to understand that they know what they're doing with this type of game.  And if you read the news and updates, you'll see they're always expanding their team, getting veteran game designers/developers/artists to help with the lore, story, and artwork.  Again, it's still early access, and they're working on it.Third, people say ""[insert dungeon crawling ARPG here] is better -- Bah, Fan boys!  I love this style of game, and played Diablo 2 so much my middle school AND high school grades suffered.  Diablo, Titan Quest, Torchlight, Path of Exile, the van helsing games... I've played them all and couldn't tell you why anyone would say any of them are better than this game (D2 excluded, cause, ya know... you can't beat that...).  And yes I've played D3 since it came out, since the expansion, and through seasons 1 and 3.  This game is more Diablo than Diablo 3. I'll admit, I bought it half off during the summer sale, but I loved it so much I bought a 2nd copy for a friend and he can't put it down either.  If I have any qualms about this game it's that it's only 4 player max, and the character customization (not to be confused with Class customization) is lacking. And by lacking, I mean non-existent beyond Male or Female.  But that's all bells and whistles, and it's not what makes this type of game fun.  Where the game earns respect is in the innovation and unique ideas they have come up with that make the game fun and interesting, while not impacting the traditional principles that make this type of game addicting and enjoyable.TL;DRHaters gonna hate.  This game's fun as hell!			"

								This game is a titan quest cloneish game. So if you like Titan quest or even hack and slash game you will love this game. after 200+hr spent on the game i still see new stuff and love the game :D Crate Entertainment are doing a great job on the game with every patch they throw out. The patch come from 500mb to 1gb and there is alot of extra stuff to do with them. level cap atm is 50But ofc with every good game there is a downside. The optimization on the game is bad, and you will prob get some frame drop in combat. but it's Early access game and Create will fix the optimization on release so dw to much about it :)Pros and consPros- Gameplay is allot like Titan quest, Same talent tree system with dual class- So much loot you will click your finger off looting it all- the game is long. 15-20hrs from start to finish- You can rotate camera ""first arp i know of where you can do this""- Every zone feel like they belong there- Dual wield 1hand pistols :DCons- Early access can give some bugs ofc. Looking at you frame drop- Movement can feel wierd at times10/10 would grim again			"

								This is the best Diablolike game ever made and it is not even finished. I have had a great time building and leveling five characters to the current max level and always found fun ways to make the different builds fun to play.Dual class system is awesome and there is just loads to do in this game already.Gameplay is nicely balanced so it does not get boringly easy or tediously complex almost ever.Even if you are against buying Early Access games this one I definitely recommend trying.

								This is the first  I have been bothered to review for steam.  For an early access game, it is incredibly polished.I have had a couple of moments when the frame rate has slowed, but no crashes and no obvious game breaking moments.I am liking this game at least as much as Diablo 3, which is amazing given the fact it is an inde game.  The way the creators of the game have released the game in stages and have handled the early access phase generally is awesome.I like the setting which is gritty, with lots of zombies.  There is plenty of depth to character creation.  Unlike Diablo 3, there seems to be multiple build options for each ""class"".Overall the game is a great little ARPG, with some basic MMO elements (such as factions) which give the game a little extra depth.I understand there is going to be mod support when the final version is released.

								Well, I was looking for a new game to play. I like ARPGs and this one looked nice and had good reviews.I knew it would get me some hours of fun so I bought it on discount.I created a character, there was no character customization, I was annoyed a bit.then, I started the campaign.This game... Has SO MUCH POTENTIAL and it is already amazing.The action in this game is more than just running around spamming skills at hordes of enemies or dull bosses like in Torchlight II, here the enemies are varies and have special abilities, you have to know your enemies, and you have to kite them (or build yourself a tanky character which is also possible, but still will require kiting and moving around in combat).The bosses are really well done, the maps are very nice and not repetitive (there's always new stuff to find, eney camps to raid and underground cave-systems and cellars to explore).This game also features an ability to create a portal wherever you are (in dungeon, before boss fights, just when exploring and inventory got full...) and use it to teleport to one of the portals scattered across the entire map.I am a lazy person and this has been satisfying me since the beginning. Inventory gets full in the middle of a dungeon? or after a boss fight? No worries! Teleport to town, sell stuff, bank stuff, teleport back to your custom portal.There are two things that bother me about this game:1. When your weapon has elemental damage on it (like fire or lightning) it is not visible on the weapon itself, only on attacks. I like wielding weapons with effects like they're burning or have lightning around them, just something I personnaly like and think is missing.2. Some enemies feel unbalanced, for example: the ""Fury"" enemy is a tanky zombie with powerful attacks that has a chance of draining life on hit and shows up rather early in the game. With the help of HP potions they are not a big deal but at a certain point in the game they show up more often and in bunches which I find pretty hard to deal with. So that's challenging but I think maybe a bit too much.Generally, I think this game is definitely worth the full price and maybe even more than that.I like comparing it to Torchlight II because the mechanics and gameplay are alot alike, so I'd like to say that this game is slightly better than Torchlight II as it is now, and it hasn't been released yet, so it has a huge potential.If you like ARPGs and just fun adventure RPGs in general, I highly recommend this game :D "

The loot is always rewarding and so awesome that every time you find a new epic or legendary, there is new ideas for builds popping into your head. Oh yea, builds. There is so many of them and really almost all of them are viable. You want to be a dual wielding gunslinger? Sure. A guy that fires a freakin laserbeam? No problem.

								The only other hack and slash ARPG that I consider in the same league as this game is Path of Exile. Just like PoE, this game makes Diablo III look like a game made for simple-minded children. This game has everything Diablo III lacked: Better story,  with a grim setting and atmosphere  that successfully convey a sense of danger and despair. Unchained character development with many options for how to develop your character. Nuance in NPC interactions where making the wrong decision can result in you killing someone who you could have saved. As this game nears completion, I consider it a perfect arpg with no real flaws. Every aspect of the game is well-developed and it is truly fun to play. The depth of character development is impressive, as you can improve your character's stats, pick two classes to specialize in, enhance your abilities by restoring corrupted shrines and investing devotion points in a Constellation system, craft/find a wide array of weapon enhancements and even find relics that give you special abilities like dual-wielding ranged weapons. If you like arpgs with dark stories that don't treat you like an imbecile, this is as good as it gets.			"

I hate it when i enter a room thats a grim dawn server and i get kicked which has 2 more slots where there are only 2 people playing. So I got to another server and come back after like 1 hour or so and that server is still up with the same 2 players in a 4 slot room. Its like they kick people for kicks lol get it...bad joke.OK OK OK I run this game on a gtx 760 4gb and it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ it really does. I dont know why but im hoping it will run better in the future. I can run Bioshock Infinite in full setting but this game get reaaaallllllyyyy slooowwwww sometimes. I even turned the graphics down and resolution and it still hangs in some parts of the game ALLOT.			"

												I invested in this game because I remembered Titan Quest and it's expansion.  I could always see there was something there but unfortunately as game studios come and go....so went the talented programmers that developed these wonderful creations.  I perused Kickstarter and found that Grim Dawn was being created and noticed that not only the same potential was there but something more or just as special.  I invested quickly and not once have I thought it to be hasty.  This game is beautiful and the many hours and months of work have paid off.  Their tone is set well as it has been stated but within it all, there is hope.  I would think that more people will look towards investing in this game because this is really  what an action RPG should be. Crate's small team has done very well with its limited resources and I hope that they will be doing more work.  So please invest in this game.  It's been a wild ride for the limited time I have spent and I look forward for many more hours of playing.			"

								Every once in awhile you run across a game that your on the fence about but decide to take a chance with. I took a chance with Grim Dawn not really expecting much from it, but let me just sat that i am vary surprised at not only the detail that the game has but the sheer enjoyment that I'm having playing it. I did take a chance with this game and I am glad I did. It's a fun little gem that I intend to sink many hours into exploring all the different types of classes and skills as well as exploring the captivating world the game takes place in. If you on the fence and are looking for a great game that the developers have taken a lot of pride in making, both in story and attention to gaming detail, then I strongly suggest you look no further. Get this game and start playing it right now!			"

												I play allot of Action RPG games this one outclasses them all. I grew up playing PS2 hack and slash game's like Champion's of norath, when I saw the screen shots for this game I just knew I would love it. What I didn't know was that I would play this game as much as I have. I play by myself, however there is a healthy online community of players who always have servers up for you to join. The gear in this game is creative and beautiful. There are many item set's that link together and give you additional stats or ability's. Most bosses have healthy drop rates. (This was a problem I ran into with titan quest) When you play on harder difficulty's the game drops gear more frequently, When you get to higher levels like 50+ the game will start dropping legendary gear & Empowered lower level gear to match your current level. Empowered gear is gear you get at say level 15 or 30, with triple its original stats so you can use it at level 58 or 65. The game also features a meal system that gives you a translucent health bar that refill's your current health bar when combat end's its rather useful and it is a nice feature on the harder difficulties. As far as the class system goes its just like titans quest, you choose the Soldier tree and say the Nightblade tree and your class becomes a Blademaster. You can mix all the classes like this and make many different characters. There is so much more to talk about, I would recommend this game to any Action RPG gamer. Thank you crate for this amazing game, whenever I felt like something needed to be changed or added into the game it's like you read my mind and changed or added that feature. Crate you have made a masterpiece with this game and I cannot wait to see what y'all do next.			"

Games in wich I spend ALOT of time was FF series, Diablo 1,2, PoE, Dark Souls series, Fallout 1,2, Baldur's Gate's (IWD), Ultima, Warcraft untill WTLK etc. In this game Iv spend 265 hrs in last 3 weeks and I plan on spending more. If you want to PLAY wellmade game  and by accident you like games that iv mentioned higher, dont think and just buy it...you wont regret.			"

												Computer froze and corrupted my saved games BUT it gets even better! Steam ♥♥♥♥ed itself and decided to upload them. I have no problem with playing my 25 hours all over again.. Why? Grim Dawn has awesome gameplay surpassing diablo 3. It provides so much freedom in terms of character customisation with the dual classes and amount of skills available. I am pleased that dev's decided to improve the story telling with the voiced NPC's for the main quests. Job well done Crate Entertainment!			"

Great ARPG, supurb visuals, excelent design and a great take on the ARPG that absolutely spanks Diablo III right and proper.  I recommend this to any ARPG fan around.  6 out of 5 stars!I backed this game right from the beginning and watched it grow and flourish from a short 700Mb demo to a near 5Gb masterpeice.  Rarely do I purchase Early Access, unless I can see a great future for a game. This game is the true personification of Early Access done right.   I just wish I had more time to play this true gem in the rough.  Full-time studies and part-time employment have cramped my gaming lifestyle severely. (But no one said studying to be a Clinical Psychologist was going to be easy!)I can't wait to see what Crate has in store for us in the future.Visuals: Stunning visuals of a world shattered by the Apocalypse of Monsters and the Undead.Story: Immersive Storyline. (About time for an Original Storyline in my honest opinion).Character Customization: Go for hack and slash or use a rifle for run and gun.  The choice is yours.Playability: I could play and replay this game forever.Overall: This game is Immersive, challenging and all-in-all, a unique take on the classic ARPG.But why listen to me droning on?  Try the game out yourself, you won't be disappointed!			"

								As a kickstarter backer and person who liked (but didnt love) Titan Quest, I was not expecting something completely revolutionary, and I am happy to say this game... Wow FAR outpaced my expectations.Honestly I got the same feeling as I did when I played Diablo 2 for the first time... this game really  gets it's hooks into you... from what ive seen thus far MUCH better than Diablo 3, Torchlight and other ARPGs and I am stunned just how balanced, playable and fun everything is. (really I'm very particular on game mechanics, and I have to say, everything here is positive, balanced, engaging (I can't even nitpick on little stuff) there's always something in front of you worth doing (quests, upgrades, etc.) I've played more of this game than most big name AAA games this year, (and it's early access, and I havent even scratched the surface of the content here) I've only played a single character (Fighter/Demo) and I am eager to continue with the quest, do some respecing, then start with other characters.Do yourself a favor and buy it today, full price or on sale (for you penny pinchers) it's all good, this game deserves a spot in your library and (to be honest) at this stage as a GOTY contender for 2015.

Early Access Review
								Great game unfortunately the multiplayer lacks a closed realm. In other words they lack servers that diablo 2 had in order to host events like ladders etc... A great thing I loved about arpgs was collecting rare loot and trading it for other currency (for instance runes diablo etc.) (path of exile orbs)  or other gear during competitive ladders. I think at one point they discussed the potenial to have their own servers but the cost would be too high as of now. They would need to see how well the game goes over when it's actually released before they can jump the gun on that. Basically finding rare loot isn't as rewarding since people can alter their save files and get whatever gear they desire. If you don't care about online that's great or closed servers that's also fine. I really enjoyed most of the classes but occultist was extremely bland for me. This game has good things about it and bad things. The bad consists of horrible particles, animations and spell effects for abilities. You don't feel powerful with some of the abilities just due to how it looks visually. Some of the builds disappoint me there isn't much of a variety and some skills feel out of place. I was also full of extreme sads when I learned there was no dedicated healer with utility like in Titan quest. I expect the game to get better with time especially when it's released and when expansions come around. It's worth the price where it stands now as they are adding other acts soon. 8/10 for me.			"

								Do you like arpg games? If you said yes buy this immediately. I have 60 hours in as of this review and that is having only made a single character. I took my first character to the current level cap of 40 and am currently at act 3 chapter 1 the end of the content so far. I have already gotten my moneys worth at this point as far as I am concerned. I can hardly imagine what the entire game will be like let alone any future dlc or sequels. By the time I finish my first charcter to the end of the full content I will have no less than 80 to 100 hours I bet. And there are so many other cool characters to try out after that plus multi-player.			"

												Damn good arpg.Less streamlined than diablo 3, but also considerably less byzantine than path of exile.Areas are not randomly generated. Like Titan Quest, it is statically made, or seemingly so. Quite a bit of build variety, but like with Titan Quest, I have a bit of a hard time deciding what should get the points. Many options. Less than in  Titan Quest though.  I do not quite like the ""invest points"" into every single element, honestly I would probably like it more if it was like the POE passive tree where each node only requires a single point (but eh, whatever,  I just do not quite like that way of building up the skills). Damn fun. I should get the crucible dlc, and if they ever make an expansion I will probably get it since the game is very good.Basically, Titan Quest, refined, and instead of bronze age, using a grimdark 19th century setting (not steampunk though, if  you want that, go and try the Van Helsing titles, which are definitely using a steampunk aesthetic, and like this, handmade maps. This plays better).I should try it with a pad. Somehow I do not think it will play as smoothly with a dual analog pad as Diablo 3 does on the ps4 (which is likely the  BEST way to play it, and also overall my current favorite arpg), but it should be good to try it that way.

								Sunk a few more hours in the game and here's what I've found:Pros: Satisfying combat (ragdolls!)  Graphics feel fresh and unique Map layout and design is fantastic Fairly engaging story Great music Great dual-class system with a lot of options and freedom (so many class options!) Itemization and loot system feels fair Only pre-releaseCons FIXED: 90% of the time when you change graphical settings the whole game crashes FIXED: The game does not have gamebreaking graphics but I have to put most settings to the lowest to keep a good FPS Combat and pathing is sometimes glitchy Ranged units AI makes them try to attack you through walls? Slow development time due to Crate being a small game company (but it will finally be released soon!)TLDR this is a great game if you're a fan of D2 and/or PoE (loyal fans of both!) After the most recent updates, I'm starting to enjoy this much more than PoE.			"

								Лучшая из hack-and-slash игр за всё время существования жанра. Никакие Диабло, Торчлайты и ВанХельсинги рядом не стоят. Сделано в традициях Titan Quest, так что многое узнаваемо по части интерфейса и прокачки, но сильно отличается от оригинала по концепции, атмосфере и контенту.Хоть игра и находится в раннем достуе на момент написания отзыва (завершен только 3 акт), уже есть чем заняться при достижении максимального уровня — охотой на монстров и заработком репутации. Отзывчивые разработчики, большое разнообразие предметов, навыков и всяих реликвий, много лора для изучения сюжета и мира... Это просто идеальная игра. Вот только бегать с кем-то в кооперативе оказалось менее весело, чем в одиночку, но я не уверен, что это минус.Можно играть без подключения к долбаному интернету, что сильно мешает в случае с Диабло 3....Обновлено. Теперь вышла релизная версия и контента стало в разы больше. Да, это несомненно великолепный продукт с кучей возможностей, с огромной реиграбельностью и превосходным будущим. Каждый аспект Grim Dawn на голову превосходит подобные в других играх, в ней собрано всё самое лучшее. Теперь нужно приложить просто титанические усилия, чтобы найти хоть какие-то недостатки. Наверное, это лучшее вложение средств в ранний доступ, которое я когда-либо делал.			"

												I've played about an hour at this point. But that's the beauty of Grim Dawn - it's just a Diablo 2 clone. It's easy to pick up and play for a bit.There's nothing more to say. NOTHING. It's got some neat customization stuff - you like, build your own class? It's weird. But very very awesome. Similar to PoE, but not even close to the same thing. It's great.The music is fantastic for those who are fans of Diablo 1 and 2's moody, grim soundtracks. No other hack-n-slash has ever come close to that. So this is just fantastic. In general, enemy design seems much closer to Diablo, also. Zombies, weird leaping critters, slithering serpent dudes - they all fit in. Character design, I don't know. Not perfect, but good enough. But unlike the Torchlight series, design isn't all over the place. It's not a very cartoony looking game. And this is a big plus in my opinion.Game's about $5 over what I'd pay for this, if I'm honest. The game feels really quite polished, which is surprising for 2016, sadly. I don't really think the screenshots do the game many favours. In general, I like the graphics (blood textures need some work). If things are low-poly, they're doing a good job of disguising this with relatively high quality textures across the board. This is a game that was made for PC, and feels like it.Game's worth a buy, if you're looking for yet another hack-n-slash. This one does it well, which is surprising considering how many I've turned down. Loki, Torchlight, Diablo III I've still played for a whole bunch of hours, got several heroes geared, and most max level, and I am still not really sure if it was really all that good...Grim dawn feels good. It's fun to kill stuff. Good, crunchy sound effects make beating enemies to a pulp extremely satisfying. Which is fantastic.I don't really know how to end this review, but basically, game's great. Get it some time.			"

												Excellent ARPG with a lot of polish and so many possible builds and variations to try it's almost mind-boggling. The fact the devs were fearless and allow the player to create totally unworkable, useless builds provides half the joy of learning and discovery. It's very possible your first couple of chars will be completely underpowered, so you go back and make use of the generous re-spec options to shuffle some skill points around and try again. By the time you've gotten a couple chars under your belt you'll begin to learn what works, what synergizes where, and you're off to the races.The mobs are mostly typical hack and slash fare, nicely animated, and the loot drops in massive piles like it should. Which brings me to the only minor complaint I'd level right now. NEED MOAR STORAGE! You can eventually buy what looks like four large bank tabs shareable among your various chars, but there are SO MANY crafting materials and tempting drops that they fill up very rapidlyOverall, great game, more than worth full price. A LOT of work went into it and it shows. Please show your support to how early access games should all turn out.			"

								I have a few early games in my catalog but none have the content and stability as Grim Dawn. Even at this alpha stage, it blows away any recent ARPG. It doesnt do anything new, but what it tries to do, it does it right. I am so glad that the game includes Titan Quest dual class system as it gives the player more freedom with builds. The sound and music are amazing and the graphics are very well done, i love how spell attacks are reflected on the water. The game doesnt have random generated dungeons/layouts but thats how good their level design is in Grim Dawn. It has multiple ways to get to an objective and it makes you wanna go explore just to kill everything and get all the loot. I can easily recommend it to any ARPG fans, you will fall in love with this game easily and it will make you forget about others ARPGS "

I also enjoying playing in multiplayer mode with a friend in Germany who also purchased the game on my recommendation! Great job Crate!  Incredible crafting system and loot gathering.  Challenging and yet extremely rewarding playthrough of all ""rogue type"" dungeons! I played Titan Quest since it came out and beat it on every level except Legendary. This games continues and builds on that legacy; looking forward to seeing what is in store for the future! If you are thinking about getting this game and have play TQ, Diablo, or any ARPG in the past; do it! So much fun!			"

												So my buddy and I were chatting, casually discussing new games we had tried or thought were interesting. No big deal.Then he just drops it ""hey man, you should check out Grim Dawn, I think you might like it. Seems cool,""I look it up.... whats this? A post apocolyptic, lovecraftian game that looks like diablo 2's wet dream?Sure, Tully, it ""Seems Cool, and its only 25 dollars."" Click Click. Downloaded fast. Oh hey look at that, the skill trees are all fun.Oh hey you can mix classes?Oh what? Crafting? Wow, this dungeon is a lot bigger than I thought, and there are rare monsters dropping loot everywhere, I must be getting to the end of the act. Oh...uh..no, that was just a cave.Holy hell the map just keeps....going.YOU CAN ROTATE THE WHOLE SCREEN HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS SOONER?!Wait...Wait...why is the sun coming up? Ugh why do my eyes hurt, what the hell man where are my shoes? WHAT YEAR IS IT?!Next time my ""Buddy"" tells me a game looks cool, im just gonna ask him to cut the BS and offer me something less addicting, like meth. "

								Wonderful mechanics and beautiful gameplay, with many explorables and trinkets to customize your character to your own liking. Several classes to choose from an allowed to mix classes to change playstyle. It is unique and exciting have recently just purchased this and so far no regrets as I am a fan already. I  enjoy the being able to use guns rather than always swords and shields gameplay that feature seems to me a new way of introducing newer fans of aarpg to this awesome game. However at this moment there is no voice overs for quest' I am not a fan of reading though find myself trapt enjoying the phrases of quest added to a number of listful things that are added very quickly to do's. ( The developers have done a wonderful job on this game and to not be fully completed i was a skeptic, an concerned sbout my purchase though now that i am a proud owner of this unique masterpiece my mind is at ease that i did the right thing by purchasing this title....I look forward to completion and any newer content as already hooked at this an cannot set it down....Give this game a run and you will be thankful as you spent your money wisely....................Like i said, I was skeptical as not to knowing of what layed beneath the title and cool scenery though so dag on excited that i made the plunge into the unkown and found this master piece.  10 of 10			"

								The gameplay scratches my old Diablo 2 itch. It is fun and addicting. It brings back the same feelings that Diablo 2 did.  It is definitely worth more than what you'll pay for it, even in its current state. It is a solid game despite some bugs here and there, but hey...its early access. Thats a good excuse as long as they continue with the updates. I never played Titan Quest so I don't know how this compares. If I had to compare it to a game that is similiar, it would be Diablo 2 obviously.Gameplay: Fun and addictingAtmosphere: Grim, little boring in colors, but it still looks awesome compared to other ARPGs like PoE.Story: Not really engaging. Doesn't come off as an epic journeyLoot: So far so good!FYI, you get to pick your skills and stat attributes yay for choices with consequence!As fun as it is, I worry that it will suffer long term due to not having dedicated multiplayer servers. Sure there may still be a small modding community that will keep the game alive, but I don't expect it to get anywhere near as big as D2 once was. It is more or less like Torchlight in that sense.Anyways a very cool game even for just the singleplayer experience and occasionally multiplayer with a buddy. Perhaps they'll release the network code for those who want to create server emulations like the old private D2 servers of the past.			"

								As someone that has recently purchased quite a few Indie and Early development games, I am seriously impressed with this game. The graphics looks great, sound is good and the overall game play I am enjoying. If this is still early release, I cannot wait to see the finished product. Great work guys worth my money spent			"

												Grim Dawn has plenty of content for those that decide to stick with it all the way through and decide to go even further with additional difficulties or try other classes and class combinations. One thorough playthrough on Veteran (Enhanced Normal) took me around 39 hours with a mix of single player and co-op. The hours per dollars spent ratio is fairly high; however, the experience isn’t problem free. The game performs well on everything maxed and only dropped frames when too many effects were going off. So turn down some of those settings if you’re using a weaker rig and planning to have some co-op fun.Story/Atmosphere Unsurprisingly, the world in Grim Dawn is grim. Humanity is struggling to survive amidst the warring factions all vying for control of the world. The quests aren’t revolutionary, but what kept me interested was the world building aspect. Journal entries waiting to be discovered are scattered all across the land. Some of them are very well written and have tones that range from sad to gross to horrifying. Other entries will give you some history or act as a bit of flavor. The game uses darker shades of color and litters the world with rotting dead bodies, ancient dungeons, mines, and many enemies to slaughter. The game is separated into four acts that all have a distinct visual style and map layouts. Some layouts were better than others and didn’t make you walk around too many blocked paths. I felt much more invested in the world than Diablo 3’s (I disliked most of D3’s story) and grew to dislike one of the factions in GD because of how gross they were with human lives. Let’s not forget that this game is an ARPG and the story isn’t the main focus. So let’s move on to the gameplay.Gameplay This game has a slow beginning pace in regard to acquiring skills. This pacing can become even slower if you decide to take on two classes because for the first 50 levels, you’ll be making hard decisions on what skills you want to give your 3 skill points. You can stick to one class and be a purist which lets you specialize and access the later skills much faster, but I prefer mixing things up. To access later skills you have to put points into a mastery bar to unlock them. This means dual classing can put you at a disadvantage if you don’t have a good plan in mind because specializing with your damage abilities far outweighs having a bunch of weak ones. Many abilities can have passives that enhance it even more, which makes specializing very potent. To err with skill point allocation is human, but the game is very forgiving with skill point refunds except for masteries. It starts out fairly cheap and slowly increases in price the more you use it, but I’ve used it for over 120+ skill points without destroying my wallet.Grim Dawn also has a Devotion system which reminds me of Path of Exile’s giant passive tree, but smaller. The Devotion system is made of many constellations which mostly provide passive bonuses and some on-chance abilities which can result in meteor showers, whirlpools, a shield, and more. You must find and cleanse shrines out in the world to earn Devotion points and most of them are out of the way or hidden. Every completed constellation provides affinity for unlocking more powerful constellations which makes things complicated. Planning will be required here since refunding skill points is more difficult. You’ll need Aether Crystals (a material) and iron bits (the currency) for each point.For my main character, I went with a Druid (Shaman + Arcanist) that heavily used the refund system to create a fun character that could handle the challenges of the game set to Veteran. My character underwent some drastic changes as she went from a melee focused lightning Shaman with a pet and some Arcanist abilities to a cold/lightning Arcanist that later added two aether/fire skills found deep within the tree. I mainly used Olexra’s Flash Freeze, a damaging AoE freeze attack; a Lightning Nova from an Amber gem; and Trozan’s Sky Shard, basically 3 ice meteors. I greatly enjoyed freezing all the enemies on the screen and then following up with the other two spells. Eventually, I picked up Aether Ray for that single target beam of death feeling and Devastation to complete my AoE build. The spells and skills are satisfying and impactful once you have your arsenal together. Some of them send the enemies flying. You should definitely use the refund system to maximize your character’s potential.The game has crafting and it’s the kind of crafting where you make one item that’s then needed for another, more powerful item. Example, 3-4 pieces make 1 complete ingredient. Item A, B, and C each require four different complete ingredients. Item Q requires A, B, and C. This kind of progression is tied to crafting materials and Relics. It also lets you try and roll rare gear if you have the Scrap, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re trying to replace very low level gear. You can farm materials off of specific monsters, including bosses. To repopulate a world, you’ll need to exit to the main menu and then start the game again which goes by quickly for my system, but still isn’t fun to do. The crafting system requires enough farming to the point of multiple restarts or playthroughs in order to make the more interesting items. In my case, I couldn’t make a Relic I strongly desired because I didn’t find the right blueprint drop for one of the ingredients over my 70+ hours on that single character which made me sigh repeatedly. Still does. I had all the other pieces that went through the process.Finally, there’s a reputation system in play. Enemy factions will grow stronger as you kill more of them which results in better drops. Allied factions will offer more items from their faction merchants. They carry good equipment and make sure you stay appropriately geared if the drops were not in your favor. You can do bounties for a faction to increase your reputation with them, complete relevant quest, or kill the monster types they dislike. Bounties are vaguely described kill quests and not very interesting.Coop Experience Grim Dawn has functional p2p online co-op which works out pretty well for the most part. You’ll never have to worry about servers shutting down or server maintenance, but at the same time, you better make sure all players involved have some decent connections since one of you will be the host. The only disruptive things I’ve noticed were some rare desync issues where you can lose track of the other player’s true position (summons will follow the real deal) and some dead monsters/enemies that stayed behind in odd positions, their bodies normally decay to nothingness. Some player abilities will synergize well together. In my case, I used my max level Olexra’s Flash Freeze to reduce the enemies’ fire resistance by 106% which greatly benefited my co-op partner who dealt 80-90% fire damage. -Grim Dawn is a fairly good ARPG that should keep you entertained for many hours. For me, it has a low replay value. It’s a game that I might check on every now and then. I do have an interest in seeing what future mods might be able to accomplish once the tools are ready since the other ARPGs I play are online only. You can also use a trainer with GD with no issues online or offline. Should you decide to give this game a chance, I’ll point out two useful resources for beginning players: http://www.grimdawn.com/game.php which is a game guide and http://grimcalc.com/ for skill tree planning.

												First I like to say this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome way better then what I was expecting.Now thats out of the way this game to me is a great mixture of titan quest and diablo which is why I now know why people say its the diablo 3 we never got,I love how they took the best parts of both games and brought them into this one with the skill system of titan quest and the dark theme of diablo, the loot/drop system in this game is the best I've seen in any arpg's Ive ever played,Out of the four hours Ive played so far the game runs really smooth I havent had any problems with the game as other reviewers have mentioned.Now in my personal opinion I wish the mobs were bigger and there were more mob bosses maybe just cause im still  at the beginning of the game I havent seen much yet but I hope you guys can make it like diablo in that sense with future content and the other thing is i wish there was justs bows and crossbows cause i hate guns in this style of games but again this is just my personal opinion.Overall this game is fantastic and well worth the money I paid to play it,Great job guys I hope theres more content you'll be adding to the game in the near future till then I think Im going to be playing this for awhile.9.5/10			"

								As a big player of Diablo 3 (+2000h), I was looking for something new to wait Reaper of Souls.First impression :- The artwork of the game is very nice, it's a dark environnement and it's very well done.- The gameplay is enjoyable, it's dynamic even during the first levels.- The skill tree / point attribution systems are interresting, you have to think how your character will evolve before spending them (you can undo your choices with a npc but it will cost you some money)- The difficulty is alright, it's not that hard but still, don't forget to upgrade your gear / skills.About the complexity of the game mechanics, it's developed but easy to understand. My native language is French and I have learned the basics very quickly so don't worry about that.I haven't found something wrong with this game yet, It's just perfect. I can't wait for the other updates.			"

												Did Diablo 3 took your lunch money and stomped on your childhood memories? Look no further. This ARPG is the best I had played since old school Diablo 2. No Hello Kitty Island Adventures graphics (Diablo 3/Torchlight) but with a darker and serious yet unique gore art direction. I can't deal with cartoonish graphic that Blizzard seems to go for.Moreover you can customise your character build as much as you want and not limited to Blizzards skill system that a 1year can design. The dual class as well as old school of skill and stat points are found in Grim Dawn. They further expand the customisation with Devotion points which you have to unlock and you can level the devotion skills and assign them to your minions or skill too!Did I just mention minions? The minions in Grim Dawn are actually useful unlike Diablo 3's minion which seems to serve aesthetic purposes only since they just tear like paper.Crafting system is quite simple yet purposeful (you can use your materials for crafting or imbued it into your gear) and I love that they gave you a lot of inventory space to hoard your loots. Character progression never seem to miss the mark. Even if you finish 'Normal' difficulty, there are other devotion skill points to be unlock on other difficulty modes. The amount of tender loving effects put into the game is amazing, I might have epilepsy with all the things going on sometime during a big fight.Most ARPG seems to have the bread but missing the nutella topping, Grim Dawn delivers both. Definitely a well made game and you should give it a try.			"

Even so, the maps are huge, feels like an open world, to complete them, it cost me at least 8 hours per act.The sound fx is very nice, some mobs have some creepy nasty insect sounds.The fun comes from testing builds, Occultist feels a bit like Witch Doctor from Diablo 3. My main character is Warlock (Occultist + Arcanist) and I feel like playing a WD + Wiz hybrid!I've been playing in veteran difficulty and I've felt farming is somewhat optional, you can only keep scavenging green/blue items but ""silver"" won't drop much.A small color equivalence of items rarity for Diablo3 players  item in diablo3 color in diablo3 color in grim dawn   normal white white   rare yellow yellow   magic blue -none-   legendary orange green   set green blue ** thanks lakylog for noticing the rare/magic colors mistake			"

Early Access Review
								I have been a fan of ARPG's since their conception with the original Diablo game, and as time has moved on there have been more and more games come out. Having played Titan Quest I loved the engine and how it all work. So when the latest round of ARPG's were announced I was excited, a new Diablo, Path of Exile etc It seemed great but having played the most that were on offer, I found that nothing queld my thirst for blood and loot like Grim Dawn. I come back to this game time and time again, every new build I play through at least twice, trying different classes and builds and find more stuff, and everytime I am wanting more, to the point like I said I play through it yet again. Never have I experienced an ARPG as addictive as this one. What makes it addictive? I believe it is a combination of good game play, customisation of a character taht makes it truely yours and just great game mechanics; Items are upgraded easily, unique items can be upgraded, and the effects (visually) of some items just look great e.g. my flaming boots and green smoking helmet. Visually this game is great, hands down more Grim Dark than most other ARPGs. I kickstarted this game and it has been one of the best investments I have made, a solid game that leaves you wanting more. If you are willing to loose hours to a game, then let me recommend this one.			"

												It's Titan Quest, but it's now set in a semi-Victorian-era territory, with the overall feel being somewhere between Salem and Innsmouth. A good old-fashioned hack-n-slash/shoot-n-loot. A realm of chaotic energy forced its way into the material world and did an apocalypse, and a hell-cult took advantage of the mayhem to gain a ton of power for itself and is now summoning demons to harvest more blood to summon more demons. Fun times for a recently-possessed rando like yourself to find themselves in, 'specially with a noose around their neck.If you have an extra $25 to spend and have a fondness for isometric♥♥♥♥♥♥wrecking, jump on it. If you have less than that, go hit up a friend for some extra dosh or something, I dunno.[EDIT]Removed the bit about Early Access because IT CAME OUTIT CAME OUT, MANFEATURE COMPLETE, 100% FINISHEDIT CAN HAPPENIT CAN HAPPEN, MANEARLY ACCESS GAMES CAN FINISH			"

												Grim Dawn is made by the same people who did the Titan Quest series, so if you liked those you'll enjoy this for sure.  As someone who has thousands of hours under my belt playing ARPGs going all the way back to the original Diablo, I feel like this game strikes a nice balance in terms of complexity between Diablo 3 (modest) and Path of Exile (very high).  Between the 6 classes, the possibility to Dual Class, unique gear, and Devotion system there is a lot of depth and build diversity here to keep you busy for 100+ hours.  If there are any useless skills in this game, I haven't found them yet.  Everything is viable.  My current favorite is a Druid build where I run around with a rifle that shoots lightning everywhere, I call it the Boomstick build in tribute to Ash from Evil Dead.			"

												tl;dr Bla, bla, bla, etc. etc.  This is a solid ARPG that is fun to play.  ForwardAs a Diablo-alike Grim Dawn (Grim Dark) plays like you might expect.  GD has a bit more polish and content than many games from independent developers.   This game is definetly worth it at full price, and it is a steal when on sale.PROS(+)Lots of cool skills, items, zones, critters, and (+) Theory crafting.(+)  More pros than cons.  CONS(-) Many zones are linear and can be hard to find your way in(-)  There are too few fast travel points, which can lead to having to retracing your steps (especially if you die).  Not that I ever die because I am uber  /wink(-)  There is a respec option, but it is only a partial respecFair warning, I haven't had a chance to try to coop yet.  Hopefully I will get a few of my friends to buy it to try it with me soon.   Friends?  I think I saw a TV show about this a few years ago "

												Every time I play this game, I left amazed by its sheer vastness.  It is just SO big.  Most of the areas are huge, winding labrynths filled with stuff to kill.  The loot is great, the combat is great, the skills are great.  It is everything you want in an ARPG.  This ranks up with Path of Exile as the two best ARPGS of recent times.  It took everything that was great about Titan Quest and made it better, darker, and larger.  The dual classing is just as amazing as TQ, and the game is more fun and robust.There are a couple things I don't like.  The UI is dated.  It looks exactly like the UI from Titan Quest, which is something like a decade old.  It's time for an update, even if it's just cosmetic.  That being said, everything is functional and works.  The Auto Sort and Auto Combine features are a huge lifesaver.    The other thing I don't like is the game occasionally crashes, for me it is mostly on startup or shut down, but sometimes when Alt+Tabbing as well.  Fix those things and this game would be nigh on perfect.			"

												This game is a great example of what Diablo 3 should of been, Grim Dawn is Top-down Isometric ARPG set in a dark apocalyptic world filled with deadly monsters. Although, repetive enviroments does set back the Atmosphere by a lot. The world might be large, but you may see smiliar enviroments throughout the first playthrough of the game.It has a dual class system which let's you have dozens of combinations fitting your play style, hundreds of items that are unique in their own way, and great CO-OP where loot isn't shared. *Something that every ARPG needs*+Pros Great Class SystemMany unique itemsLove the setting of the gameVoice ActingHundreds of Quests18-30 hours of play timeFrequently updatedGreat Developers- ConsRepetive EnviromentsSlow start to the game (Can get boring for people who are new to ARPGS)Story isn't enforced, and you quickly lose track of what's going onNot many difficulty optionsAside from that the game is fantasic, and should be played by everyone.

								One of the better ARPG's out there at the moment. Great class building loads of item to support about just any build. Quests that are actually part of the game world not you standard unimaginary kill moar boar types of quests. They matter and allow you to set the pace of the game. Older engine which is no problem and still has very good graphics. They really set the atmosphere for the game. And it runs very smooth on my rig. I had the occasional crash but nothing serious and almost all software does so now and again. It still has to be released from what i gathered they are polishing the game for release which is great :) The only bad thing i lost my shared stash once. I believe this is more due to steam cloud than the game so it might be smart to turn that off as i heard more people with the same issue. So if you like ARPG's why is this not in your library yet?

								Ever wanted to play a character who specialises in molotov cocktails as their primary weapon? I bet you do now! :)This is a fantastic Diablo-style action-rpg by some of the same people who made Titan Quest. The game is a LOT like Titan Quest and that is a good thing since TQ was awesome. I think this game is probably better then TQ, as well as more recent games like Torchlight II and Van Helsing.What do I like about the game? Well, the game is neither too generous or too stingy with it's loot. The skill system nicely mixes active skills, with various passive skills that modify how they work. The game isn't too generous with skill points, and you'll always feel keen for that next level up. The game rewards you for exploring and you'll find hidden quests, random encounters, loot chests and boss fights. The action finds a perfect mix between fast paced and not being so fast that you have no time to strategize. Combat requires you to be aware of how you position yourself and keep an eye on what is going on. They seem to have found the right balances to make the game fun across the board.Also don't be too scared by the Early Access label. The game is stable, mostly bug-free and feels ""complete"" with no noticable missing features except that it cuts short where the last act will eventually start. (One bug I did notice is that when I changed the resolution, mouse clicks on the ui don't always detect the right places until you restart the game.) Even with the game truncated, you'll still get quite a few hours of gameplay. After reaching the end, I immediately started a new character. There is also a ""Veteran"" option.Highly recommended!

								If Divinity: Original Sin is the successor to the previous installments, then this is the successor to Titan Quest. Pretty much what you would expect: better graphics, intense combat, more loots. Though I found the first chapter to be somewhat short, overall it's pretty decent. When they are finally done with the development, hopefully it will become a somewhat long game to enjoy.If you are a fan of RPG genre and/or Titan Quest in general, give it a look.			"

If you like Diablo, Diablo 2, and Titan Quest, then you want Grim Dawn. It's the classic ARPG formula expanded on and upgraded. Visually the game looks ten years old. So far that's just fine because it's mechanically pristine. Play it. Give these developers your money.			"

								This game is in beta and still better than most arpg's out there.  I would say that it is better than most games that are out there, period.  It sits up there with D2 and PoE as being one of the best in the genre.  The dungeons are big.  The loot drops are exciting (although I wish they stuck to the more conventional colour coding...white,green, blue, yellow, purple, gold). The whole yellow being the ""magic"" tier throws me off.  Plenty of named mobs and mini boss types.  Oh yes and right from act 1 you get ""side"" dungeons to go grab loot from, They require special keys and whatnot.  I am overly excited to see this game as a final product but will continue to play through beta.  p.s.  Add me if you care to play some mutli-player loot grinds.			"

								This is both a fun and interesting game.  It's what a really good RPG wants to be when it grows up.  You're not stuck in a rut.  You can develop your charachter pretty much any way you want.  Grim Dawn is both fresh and comfortable at the same time; highly intuitive, easy to play, easier to have fun, just as satisfying for solo or group play.  The new group interface was a snap to set up.  While the game has a natural progression, it never feels scripted.  Don't like your character build?  You can re-do it without starting over.  Easy-peasy.  The whole game is full of thoughtful versatility.  I keep coming back and playing it again and again as new content and features are added.  :)			"

Furthermore, you get the incredibly flexible skill tree and leveling system from Titan Quest, which make the game even deeper, with, even at its early access stage, huge replayability. In addition to that, there's also an interesting crafting system.The grim atmosphere is well rendered with realistic graphics, which recalls of Diablo II style.

								Grim Dawn is still in Early Access, but there are hundresd of hours of gameplay to be had and I strongly recommend those who enjoy ARPGs give it a try. Buy it from the developer's website - they'll get a larger cut and still provide a Steam key.I repeat - buy it. Stop reading reviews. Buy it. If you have ever enjoyed an ARPG you will enjoy this.I've only clocked up about 30 hours, doing what I always do in an ARPG - hard mode, hardcore - so these are initial impressions.Grim Dawn takes a little from the very best ARPGs, and while it isn't quite the perfect mix, it is pretty close. We have the 'grimdark' feel of Path of Exile; the expansive levels of Torchlight; the diverse class system of Titan Quest; and the satisfying crunch of combat from Diablo. The only thing missing is the pet system from Torchlight. I miss my war-badger.At present there are five main classes, though a sixth has been teased. At level 10 you can keep your class or dual-class, meaning there are many combinations. Fancy building a six-shooter-toting gal in massive armour with a pet hell-hound? You can. Want a wizard in skimpy armour with a massive deathray? You can do that as well. How about a guy who looks like Witchfinder General who can freeze enemies then chuck a bag full of bombs at them? Yup. Pump points into whatever stats you want, develop your character as you see fit. This sort of diversity means no playthrough is the same - though I think I would have liked some procedurally generated maps.+Character customisation+Vibe+Combat+Quests+Replayability+Enemies stay at your level or above, meaning you can never grind and sleepwalk+Loot - lots of it and you can create your own +The attack-delay that dogged Titan Quest is gone+This game is HARD :)-It can feel like a slog sometimes between portals. Everytime you exit it saves your XP and equipment and any portals you've found, but boots you back to base-camp. If you've slogged through reams of enemies but not found a portal you can't leave without having to do it again.-Some repetition between enemy types - not in the same league as D3 or POE, but I miss the enemy diversity of Torchlight and Torchlight 2.-The music is a little forgettable - though suitably atmospheric.Frankly Runic and Grinding Gears set the promise for what Diablo 3 COULD have been. Grim Dawn fulfils it.This is the game you've been waiting for ;)			"

								I procrastinated for a long time buying this game since I hadn't bought an Early Access game before. Also, I was worried that I couldn't adapt to the visual and combat style of Grim Dawn as I had been exclusively playing Diablo 3. Still, I succumbed to temptations of wanting to play an alternative ARPG. Boy, I'm so glad I did because this game is worth every single penny I paid. It takes some time to get used to the dual class system and crafting system, but once you get a hang of things, these two aspects of the game will keep you playing and playing for hours. There are plenty of welcome twists to the usual ARPG mechanics but still stay true to tradition. The game is not yet complete but I've already clocked 20+ hours on 2 characters, and hoping to create another few more before I become burned out on games (lol). It feels awesome to be part of the developmental process for such a promising game. Buy it now! Don't procrastinate like I did!			"

								Now, keep in mind that this little piece of art is still under heavy development and that Early Access Review title is quite important when it comes to judge such projects based on user reviews. Currently, there are some optimization issues that might or might not bug you out and they're obviously are going to be solved over time. But, regardless, they won't keep you having fun with this game.Grim Dawn is an attempt to create an old school RPG in an interesting, industrial world where you wake up to your funeral and thrown into these series of apocalyptic events. - and it does what it claims perfectly with its lovely storytelling, well-designed scenery and lots of details that you'll find yourself paying attention, unintentionally.It features Dual Class System which is a decent way to theorycraft but not as detailed as Path of Exile. Combat System might seem a bit dull at first, but its a Progressive Game and you'll unlock the capabilities of your characters over time. So if you're giving this a try, you should give it a hell of a try to have fun with it. - Very detailed Character and Item Models; Breathtaking, well-produced Soundtrack; Quite variety of foes; Awesome Storytelling and well-placed Lore elements; Carefully designed world that will provide a lot for those who are observant enough.This game is going to be strong title and it has a huge potential of being a cult. - Its Development should take the time they need to finish what they've started. So, don't be impatient about it. Action RPG is a hard category to progress on. - and so far, Crate Entertainment is doing a very good job.			"

								Awesome game thus far.  It's been a while since I've played a game that was both challenging and fun.  No more hand-holding for you little tykes, this is an ARPG for people that want to explore giant maps, slaughter hordes of baddies, and build characters from the ground up.  5pick2 character classes means lots of different classes to play as, and with dozens of skills just begging to be synergized across each.  Definitely worth supporting.			"

								I, too, was a HUGE fan of Titan Quest/Immortal Throne.  The one difference between Grim Dawn and Titan Quest that I'm not happy with is level of zoom in Grim Dawn.  If I remember correctly, you could zoom in a lot closer in Titan Quest.  On the plus side, I love the ability to rotate the camera.  While no game is ever perfect, I'm very happy with this game, and I'm looking forward to more content when the game is finished, as well as future expansions.			"

								Kind of like a perfect blend of Diablo 2 (skill trees) and POE (items grant skills).  But with a great, mature atmosphere and art style.  Also great music.  The real kicker is that you get to mix and match the skill trees from two classes which leads to endless customization.  Anyone who enjoyed Titan Quest should buy this instantly.			"

It' still a work in progress at the time of this review, but if what I've seen so far is any indication then the final product should be enjoyable and well worth the time and money you invest in it.  The ability to mulitclass is a welcome imporovement over other games of this genre and it bring a lot more depth to character development as you level up.If you like Diablo or Torchilight, you will like Grim Dawn.

								The last game like this I actually put more than a day or two into (not a full 24-hour day mind you, but like... 2-3 hours per day) was Diablo II (I get bored easily with alot of free-to-play games with microtransactions, & whatnot) and this is THE CLOSEST I've come to the magic of that game and it's amazing predecessor (Diablo.) I have played a few other games that were fun... but nothing that grabbed my attention like this. I'm having an absolute blast!I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who, like me, has been looking for a Diablo/Diablo II-esque experience, without having to deal with all that ""fancy schmancy free to playz, marketplace, epic lewt, neato costumes for just $#.##, blah blah"" crap. You just buy it, play it, LOVE it, done dealy!			"

								Grim dawn is still in early access, but it's already better than many games are at full release. If you enjoy the ARPG/hack&slash genre, then you'll have a lot of fun with this game. Also while I have not played Titanquest, This game was developed by many of the same people who made titanquest, and is considered in a way to be the spiritual successor to it. I have not played titanquest yet, but I've been having so much fun with this game that I'll definitely want to buy TQ while I wait for development to be finished.A good amount of people seem to like a pro/con list, so I'll make onePros:Combat is funGood skill treesI can tell they put a lot of work in to the sounds, and the sounds are timed just right that it gives a satisfying thud to hit an enemy with melee.As close as you can get to open world with an ARPGHigh difficulty settings and hardcore mode availableExcellent graphics for an indie gameOptional modding features will be available in the final gameOne roguelike dungeon already available as endgame contentConsNot yet completed, so you may run out of story quickly			"

												EDIT: Just wanted to say that playing this game during early-access and then post-release felt like getting a bunch of free DLC. The game felt solid enough during early-access, and now that it's finally been released it is just keeps getting better. It's great to run back through earlier segments of the game with new characters only to find they've changed up the map layout or added in some very nice detail. Also hidden areas. Hidden areas everywhere. LOVE IT. Simply put, this game is brilliant. Nabbed it on sale, but I'd readily pay full price. Still in development and already surpassing other slash-n-loot type games (ie Diablo 3). I The details are rich, and the loot seems endless. And the classes are pretty fun (even better when you get to mix n match skills). Plus the overall aesthetics are really great. Armor, weapons, creatures, it all looks fantastic. As for gameplay, the hits feel solid, and the spells are pretty sweet. The screen-shaking criticals are a nice touch too. I've only ever had the game actually bug out and crash on me twice, otherwise it's pretty much flawless. Can't wait to see what further improvements are made.			"

								The spiritual successor of Titan Quest, for me that meant a lot. Given the game 2 hours of gameplay I can say a few things.Pros: 1) They have the duel class system, and each class has another that would make a lot of sense to combine with another, although I haven't tried any of the vague ones ie Demolitionist + Occultist2) That game feels a lot more open than Titan Quest did, although you are still on a semi liniar map with definite chokepoints that you have to hit, but you are a lot more free to rush on through or take your time and explore the apocalyptic setting to your hearts content3) They added a hardcore mode. I've lost a good man and woman to it so far, very intense when you don't have money for potions4) Added a veteran mode, I have no clue what it does, but yay! options5) Leveling up is way faster than in Titan Quest, and skill trees go WAAAAAY furtherCons: 1) I don't find the quest line very interesting2) Not a lot of enemy variety edit: I'm stupid, there's quite a bit http://grimcalc.com/monsters (thank you Dr Mcninja)3) Gold is scarce, could also be a pro if you like a brutal experience on hardcoreConclusion:This game is a solid 8/10 I will definetly be beating it in the near future!P.S.

								 This game is actually quite fun, I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Even though this is an early access review, I can say this game already has it together.It has an amazing skill tree/multiclass system that I absolutely adore! It's ""Hardcore"" enough as to not put off those kinds of players (i.e min/maxers,etc.) but it can also be played quite casually. If you have played other dungeon crawlers/hack and slash rpgs you will feel right at home here. While the game is terrific, it's not without it's short comings, such as sometimes your fps will drop, I have had a couple crashes (literally only 2), pushing your skill buttons on the keyboard can sometimes feel a tad unresponsive, just minor polish and optimization stuff. Overall the game is quite nice and with the recent addition of multiplayer the game just got that much better. This is definitely one to keep your eye on!

It's a fun Diablo style hack-and-slash action RPG with a pretty deep class system and lots of interesting loot to discover, a lot of fun enemies to overcome, and a detailed world to explore. Pretty polished for an Early Access game, and worth checking out if you enjoy games like ""Diablo,"" ""Torchlight,"" or ""Titan Quest.""			"

												So far the most entertaining and engaging of the diablo-clones, could use a couple pointers from path of exiles combat system but otherwise really very nice.Classes are well crafted, lots of customisation, multiple skill trees, for your class, for your horoscopes of all things, for your specs, its nuts. You can boost yourself up quickly if you are lazy and join multiplayer groups, everyone has surplus gear of classes they dont use, i've gotten heaps of gear from such people, your single player characters can be multiplayer if you want, its easy to switch back and forth.I like how they have a simple respec system, content is great, i can micromanage stats and skills to my hearts desire and i can feel the difference, its the ARPG to buy folks, my favourite out of TL2, D3 and PoE!My only small issue is with online people bugging out the game when they join or just the occasional crash, but its no big deal, it's possibly related to my meager internet connection.Definetly worth a buy, especially considering this is the devs first game and the more successful it is the better they can make sequels and the like, Crate is a very promising dev team, and a surprisingly small team too!And even more amazingly, they are STILL making more content for the game, in my book they beat all other contenders a long time ago, and they are still making more for us! sure its mostly paid, but at this point i dont care, all their content is varied and worth playing.

								Grim Dawn has to be one of the most interesting Early Access games I have played.  I'm not a big ARPG fan but I still manage to find this game really enjoyable. The game runs smooth and looks amazing on GTX 960.  The character customization allows you to create a build the best suits your playing style.  The only problem I've got  with Grim Dawn, is that it is a loot game. There is tons of loot to collect  and save for other characters but your limited on the storage space. There is a Storage bank in the main town but I found that I have fill most the the slots or don't have enough money to buy more slots just before I finish chapter 2.  Saving to much gear that would be great for other characters on my next play through.Grim Dawn is a very solid early access game. If it wasn't for the early access tag, I wouldn't have known the difference.  I strongly recommend for anyone to buy.			"

								This is both a fun and interesting game.  It's what a really good RPG wants to be when it grows up.  You're not stuck in a rut.  You can develop your charachter pretty much any way you want.  Grim Dawn is both fresh and comfortable at the same time; highly intuitive, easy to play, easier to have fun, just as satisfying for solo or group play.  The new group interface was a snap to set up.  While the game has a natural progression, it never feels scripted.  Don't like your character build?  You can re-do it without starting over.  Easy-peasy.  The whole game is full of thoughtful versatility.  I keep coming back and playing it again and again as new content and features are added.  :)			"

Furthermore, you get the incredibly flexible skill tree and leveling system from Titan Quest, which make the game even deeper, with, even at its early access stage, huge replayability. In addition to that, there's also an interesting crafting system.The grim atmosphere is well rendered with realistic graphics, which recalls of Diablo II style. This is much more than a promising game, this is already, in my opinion, a great game. Get it now, when it's cheap :D			"

								This review is for GD's ALPHA. Nevertheless, the game is in a perfectly playable state and is very fun too.Grim Dawn is an unusual spiritual successor to Titan Quest, to whom a few of the people working on it had a hand in making. Stylistically, the games are quite different- between the vibrant fantasy Greece of TQ and GD's own grim take on Victorian fashions and weaponry. Mechanically though, it's the perfect successor to TQ, taking the good aspects of TQ's 2-mastery system and deepening it with a greater variety of skills available per mastery. Item drops are far improved over where TQ was, with a far better rate of blue itemsThe amount of actual content the game has to offer can't rival that of many other ARPG's, past or present, but Grim Dawn's lengthy amount of time spent refining what is there isn't an accident- it's a lean game with a focus on replayability through quality and a small amount of variation in your journey through some minor randomization. It's a small thing, but entrances to underground areas changing to be located somewhere else drastically changes the pace of going through zones you already accomplished with another character before.And, as a final selling point for Grim Dawn, as with other popular ARPG's these days, support for the game won't end upon final release. It's a bit far from now, but future expansion including new areas and masteries, just as meticulously crafted as those in the original, are something to look forward to- and with GD's current record, unlikely to suddenly go awol as the developer decides to work on other projects.

At long last i found the game i've been looking for!No wonder that the game still need some improvements, adjustments to items and devotion trees perhaps, more end game content, some bugs fix before the final release that so close.But in the front line THIS GAME IS SO GOOD, unique of it's genre, fun to play. Very suggested +1.Keep going Crate, make this game better and better!			"

												Grim Dawn is great!  130 hours in, and I still haven't seen everything, done everything, played everything yet!  I have a shaman/solider @ lvl 37, a warlock/arcanist @ lvl 44 and a solider/nightblade @ level 43.  All my hours have been in Veteren difficulty, which is really difficult.  This is a nice change from playing games like Diablo 3, Torchlight 2 and Van Helsing series, where the difficulties seem unbalanced to me.I highly recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of the Diablo series, Torchlight or Van Helsing games.The combat is smooth, the skills are great, the devotion mechanic is fun and the difficulty is a nice challenge!So far the only con I can think of is the massive maps.  Not enough riftgates (home base portals) in the world.  As a father and husband, I have limited time to play, and so consently having to re-clear areas to reach the next riftgate that is at the other end of the map can be very fustrating and repeditive each time I log in.As for multiplayer, I can't say.  I'm a solo player by nature, so I have yet to try out this side of the game.  Supposely sometime in the future, Crate said they would be adding a Survival mode to this game, which I think would be a fun feature.Also, as a bonus, you definatly get alot of game for your buck!  Huge maps, alot of monster models, cool spell effects, side quests and dungeons, hell it even has side maps to its side maps!			"

								Extremely detailed game mechanics that surpass that of any other game grinder out there. Lots of fun and very engaging. Highly recommended. Best money I have spent on a game since Torchlight 2. Expect a challange as well, this game is probably not for casual play, build planning is required so expect to create a few new characters after your first.			"

Early Access Review
								First I will start off with a disclaimer. I am a huge fan of the isometric dungeon crawler genre, but I know it is not everyone's cup of tea. Also this is my first review ever.With that being said this game in my opinion is hands down the best ARPG released since D2 LOD. If you are a fan of titan quest you will feel at home with how the core game feels as the same engine is used. The story is dark and gritty with an alternate world that has recently expierenced an apocalpyse of sorts. Needless to say there are plently of monsters that need slaying. Pros:+Excelent skill trees with meaningful passives. ( I miss passives that actually change your build, and I am happy to see the return to form, very similar to D2)+Items are meaningful, uniques and legendaries feel just that unique and legendary. This is one of the most important factors in the genre, and I feel comfortable in saying this game has the best item attributes around.The items in the game can dramatically change your build. Like D2 One of the great features of this is granted skills from items (another feature missing in many of todays arpgs) +Plenty to do after and during the story. While many arpgs simply have you killing monsters in the hopes of getting loot, this game adds a couple of new layers to the loot grind. The first is a reputation system, that allows you to buy specialty items and recipees. Which brings up another neat feature which is crafting. Crafting in this game is actually very useful and can help create unique builds, especially through relics (items that you can equip in a relic slot granting specific bonuses and a new skill). There is also a roguelike dungeon in the game that if beaten grants a reward of treasure chests galore. There is plenty more I have not mentioned like the Nemisis system, and devotion shrines. +Both offline and onlineCons:-Graphically speaking it does not push the boundaries, but that is to be expected in the genre. -Combat while not bad, is typical of arpg's. Nothing boundary pushing here. Basically the combat is near identical to titan quest which is no surprise. Still the combat is on par with any other arpg out, and the build possiblites pretty much gurantee a style for you. I only put this in the cons because some people may not be a fan of the basic combat style of arpgs.-Some people may be turned off by the large number of passives in the skill trees (I myself love passives)- There is no serverside online. Meaning the characters are saved to your computer allowing others online to modify/cheat their character. (This can be mitigated by playing with friends, but it would be nice to have anti cheating measures)Overall:This game is a must for arpg fans especially those that enjoyed titan quest and d2 lod. While the combat may not be as smooth as d3 or the trade community as active as PoE, I beleive that it more than makes up for it in the sheer number of awesome items (once again one of the most important parts of an arpg) and the many builds you can make. With devotion shrines to be found or reputation to be gained, there is plenty to do, and you will not have to worry about only grinding the same area over and over. If you are a fan of the genre this game is for you, if not then you will most likely not enjoy the game. This is a game that caters very much to people like me, that is to say the developers bring back the feel from the late 90's early 2000's that I loved so much.  "

								This game is based on the classic Titan Quest, so I expected the game to be very similar.In a way, it is, you have the same leveling system where you have to invest points in classes before picking up skills, you can loot small enhancements to fuse before binding it to items etc.The story is nice, and you end up involved, no ""you are the chosen one"", you're a bit lucky and try to surviveGood monster theme, consistent with the world and location.But this game has always small surprises for you, with the name and the act 1, I expected the whole game to be dark and sad, there's a lot of environements, side quests, choices, smart mechanisms like the life regen when you're out of the fight.This game ended up being a really nice surprise, Crate devs seem to cherish their baby, it will come out of Early Access soon, there's almost no bugs, the story is complete, no empty promises ""it's a beta, we'll fix it later"", because everything is up and running.so to make it short:- Consistent hand crafted world, with day/night cycle and dynamic weather to make it alive- Good number of avaliable builds, the possibility to reclaim skill points (you won't be locked out of your ""perfect character"" by accident)- Interesting story with developpement of side characters- Fun gameplay mechanics to make it simple, yet don't insult the player with an obvious quest marker			"

												Absolutely brilliant. I was, and remain, a huge fan of Titan Quest - but this is the first time I've resonated and connected so strongly with an ARPG since Diablo II. It's an immediate love connection, and when I'm not playing it I can't stop thinking about it. The story and world feel rich and interesting, and I actually find myself listening to and reading the quest and lore texts (an unusual feat for an ARPG, and something I felt was lacking in TQ). The gameplay is fast, addictive, intense, and deeply rewarding. The power curve is fast and satisfying. The classes are diverse and exciting, and so far I haven't invested in a skill that felt disappointing or boring.This game is obviously crafted with love and skill, and if you (like me) wondered what could have been if the team behind Titan Quest had gotten another shot to build on what they had learned and created before, this game will be a very fulfilling and nostalgic and wonderful experience, and well worth the modest asking price.Note for veterans of the genre: the default difficulty option is a bit on the easy side, but turning it up to ""veteran"" offers a good challenge, and the screen being constantly filled with enemies and explosions and sparks and blood and loot will do plenty to scratch the itch you've been feeling since you finally ran out of loot to grind in Diablo II.

Early Access Review
								I scrapped my original review in favor of this one, instead.Grim Dawn is the best ARPG I have played in years and I've played almost all of them; the entire Diablo franchise; Torchlight franchise; Path of Exile; Van Helsing franchise; Titan Quest [albeit after its prime]; and many more lesser known titles.  I adore isometric ""hack n slash"" games.  Grim Dawn has a lot of shining qualities and some blemishes, but the number one reason this game has stolen my soul lies in its deceptively complex nature.  Yes, you can load up a tank character, stacked with health and defensive ability, but with lukewarm damage, and spam 1-2 buttons through the available content quite easily.  For some, including myself, that was a little off-putting at first.  However, to truly min/max and tap into the untamed potential of a god, you need a deep understanding of how classes and abilities interact with each other; where diminishing returns of skills are; and so much more.  The dual class system [also featured in Titan Quest] is riddled with potential builds and each build ACTUALLY plays significantly differently [something I greatly appreciate].  Man, I love it.The game also has tons of components.  Components are similar to features in other games; they can be attached to armor/weapons/jewelry to buff resistances, damage types, health, constitution, and seemingly any other stat.  Many of them can be upgraded to a second rank or combined with another to create an entirely new component.  There are a LOT of different components.  So many so that they eventually pack your inventory full of random bits and pieces [this is one major annoyance for me.  I'd like to see a separate inventory area with nearly unlimited space for ""crafting components""; this would function similar to Warhammer Online's separate bag for quest items].  They are a nice complement to skills that you might be trying to build around in the actual mastery trees.  Some people complain about Grim Dawn's graphics, I've never understood why.  The graphics are raw and gritty and complement the games atmosphere excellently.  I cannot think of another game in the genre that has truly ""better"" graphics.  The other day I logged onto Diablo 3 to see what their Ladder system was like and the graphics felt way too cartoony for me.  Sure, they are polished, but they left a lot to be desired.  Grim Dawn's graphics feel right for what the game is: a gritty tale of survival.  Sure, some item models are a little bit less desirable than others, but nothing is ever going to top the disgust I have for Path of Exile's Templar class.  ""Where're my pants, brah!?""The main problems in Grim Dawn are pretty well-documented.  Not necessarily on the steam forums, but certainly on Grim Dawn's official site [a site in which the development team is quite active and responsive; when I wrote about their ""constitution"" mechanic, we got into quite a heated debate which I really enjoyed and appreciated].  I'll touch on a few of my qualms here:            1) There are a lot of damage types and none of them feel that ""distinct"".  What I mean by this is, outside of frost [which has the chance to freeze, and a chill effect], the damage type(s) you're building around are pretty much just for the role-playing side of things.  That isn't to say that certain mobs aren't more resistant to certain types of damage, because they are - i'm looking at you skeletons and ghosts! - it's just to say damage types don't have the type of cool status effects found in Path of Exile.  Some of the skills and skill modifiers, themselves, add these features, but I think it'd be nice to have some baseline effects as well.  The second reason this sucks is it can feel, at times, very difficult to find synergy between some of the mastery types.  This will certainly be less of an issue when the game officially releases with a high level cap and availability of all mastery types, but right now it is tough.            2) Melee OWNS Casters right now.  All weapons have baseline physical damage, which means if they roll multiple affixes/suffixes that buff physical damage they will fundamentally be more powerful than casting builds.  Casters only benefit from %fire damage or % burn damage affixes not generic fire damage [ex. 5-10 fire dmg, 5-10 burn damage] as spells do not count as ""attacks"" and therefore don't utilize, for the most part, the weapon's base weapon damage when modifying a skill [ex. a spell will deal 70 vitality damage; an attack might deal 125% weapon damage + a flat 25 physical damage].  Right now all of the most powerful builds rely on physical/piercing damage for these exact reasons.  Similarly, spells cannot lifesteal.  Couple that with the way stat points are functioning right now [another feature I love, couldn't believe they eliminated it in Diablo 3] and it leaves casting classes at a huge disadvantage.  That said, the devs have acknowledged the problem exists, made their position felt, and are working with the community to come to a reasonable solution.My hands are literally getting tired of typing, so I think I will begin to wrap this up.  Grim Dawn is phenomenal, i've already sunk well over 150 hours into it and the full game isn't even released.  The storyline is better done than most other ARPGs [not known for their strong story-telling - this type; i'm not talking about the Baldur's Gates of the world...semantics people], with a lot of pieces of parchment that have bits and pieces of additional story/atmosphere-building littered throughout the world. If the game is to last long-term in the world of insatiable gaming desire, I think it will need to consider developing some type of end-game [they've sort of given a preview of how they plan to develop things with Steps of Torment 4-5]. Right now most of my lasting enjoyment has come from farming bosses for unique items, carving through the hardest dungeons, and experimenting with different builds [mostly the latter].  I don't think it needs to create an endgame as bonafide as Path of Exile's [which has really set the standard for what an ARPG can accomplish], but I do hope to see more Rogue-like dungeons implemented.That's all for now, pick this game up.

												I played Diablo 3 a lot, leveling up quite a few characters and then I found myself at the end game with RoS. As much as I love Diablo 3, I find myself turning to it like cocaine. As much as I love cocaine, once I start, it ruins my life and I keep doing it until I burn out. As I weened myself off of Diablo 3, I tried other games. Torchlight was a bit too cartoony fo me and Path of Exile didn't quite give me that fix that Diablo 3 did. Then I found Grim Dawn on here and it seems like a great mix of Diablo 2, Diablo 3, Path of Exile and the old-ish Titan Quest. While the game is in early access, it proves to be a competent ARPG so far. I can't wait to see what they do with the game and hopefully they create an intriguing end-game that keeps me interested like RoS did. I got the game on a sale and it is worth every penny so far! The game is now finished and it is excellent. Now time to spend some serious time with it.			"

								I've played this game a lot so far, up until the very latest updates, and I'm very, very happy with it:- The maps are a balanced size - not too big, like in path of exile- The story and main questline is engaging and driven- It looks and plays beautifully- The character system is classic and great (Titan Quest style)- No bugs, only rare crashesThe only downside is that even with a lot to do, it definitely doesn't quench my thirst for playing the game! I've played through it three times and can't wait for new updates to continue my adventure. I love this type of action RPG, and this might steal the throne from Titan Quest. Definitely worth your money and time, even at this stage.			"

[ and fail :D ]TL:DRif you like diablo 2, titan quest or path of exile this is a must have game. its like take every good side of theese games.if you like ARPG and Hack' Slash you should check this game out.

								Grim Dawn is refreshing and unique while still maintaining familiar user interface and combat skills/mechanics from Titan Quest. I enjoy the dark and gothic atmosphere and would even describe much of the game's overall presence as ""Lovecraftian"". I am definately hooked and looking forward to playing this.			"

												This game is great! I'm a fan of Titan Quest and this game captures the gameplay of it really well, ragdolls are amazing and theres also dismemberment which really adds to the fun. You can choose your 2nd class after level 10 which gives the game more replayability because of all the combos you can make.Theres Hardcore mode for anyone who wants to be hardcore and play the game with 1 life (toon permenantly deleted if you die) and theres veteran mode which makes the game more challenging but it also gives chance to get better loot .A great Arpg I'd reccomend it to anyone who likes ARPG games.

												10/10 - Would Diablo 2 and Nox again anyday.I bought this game on March 10th, 2014 while it was in early access, I saw it, I loved it, and I bought it based on what I saw. I only played it once for about 30 minutes after I bought it until just last night I decided to pick it back up since I saw it had just recently came out of early access as an actual full release game (celebration for an early access game that made it!) and decided to play for a little bit. Well what do you know, a little bit turned into nine hours straight, and I've got to say this game is damn good. The content is amazing, the quests, the skills, skilltrees, classes, combat, items, graphics, everything is just awesome, and the game is massive. The price-point here is excellent, only $25, that's a steal.Love this game so far.			"

												Even when it was still in early releasem, this game was amazing, and you could see the vast potential it had. As time has passed, that potential has only grown, and the game has become progressively better and better with each update. Now that the game is ""content complete"" and officially out of early release, I'm almost sad in way that there will be no further work done on it. However, I've been following the developer closely, so I know I can look forward to mod support, and most likely a sequel down the road. Both prospects make me as giddy as a virgin schoolgirl on prom night.			"

								I bought this game just hoping for a decent hack and slash, been a huge fan of the genre but haven't really found any game lately that made me stick with it. I'm still playing Diablo III every now and again, jumping in to do a few rifts but it gets old quite quick.So anyway, this game had a rather slow start for me but once I got in to it a bit I'm just in love with it. Still haven't played MP at all since I only have one friend that owns the game but the Single Player so far is amazing. I haven't hit max level but I've finished what is in the game atmo (up to Act 3).I'd say that if you like ARPG's/Hack'n'Slash games this is almost a must =)			"

								I'm having such a blast with Grim Dawn, even on my fairly old laptop I can run it nicely with only slight drops on the quality of shadows, textures etc. To be honest, I'm not a heavy duty graphics drooler and far prefer fun over intense lighting effects and the like, but still, this game looks incredible. The controls feels comfortable, plenty of loot, a nice dark world to navigate and satisfying combat. The dual spec is a nice touch and allows for plenty of customization.Overall, I am super pleased with my early access purchase and can't wait for the new content (which is downloading as i type, can not wait !)

								Absolutely Fantastic.....Im not going to say this is better then all the other ARPGs....It is. If you were about D2s immersion and overall atmosphere you do yourself a huge diservice by not paying 20 bucks for this masterpiece. Right now it is 16 bucks buy this help these guys out I promise you. This game is not even complete you would never know it. Huge world intersting characters.I have around 20 years exp with this genre and I'm a huge CRATE fan. I love Diablo 3 but its all about show and cookie cutter lots of multiplayer love. It has vastly improved 10 fold...But this feels more like the spiritual child of D2. It is a whole lot like TQ as well. Man o man if i didnt get one thing for Xmas but this id walk away very happy.Just some detailed info I had to dig around for....character models look nice not quite as good as D3 but you're armor changes appearance you can be a male or female. UI is very nice and minimalist. Act 3 is getting close to completion.You can check GDs web site they have 3 packages for purchase. 20 bucks gets you a hell of alot. Im excited for the future and potential this game has give it a shot you wont regret it. Yes its far better then PoE sorry guys. It just flows better looks better skill tree isnt this over inflated wheel of hp and mp increases (lol). BEST feature yet...IT works offline....OMGodders!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Graphics 9Sound     10loot         9skills        8quests     9addiction level 10Overall quality  10 (game is not even finished)Great job guys keep up the hard work !!!!!UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Over a year later Grim Dawn is content complete. I will say once again If you want the best ARPG ever made purchase Grim Dawn .Better than Diablo 3 Yes it is. Keep in mind it is a bit different than Diablo 3. Better than Path of exile  !00 times better....I don't even know why POE is considered 2nd best its not even close to Grim Dawn. POE is generic plain and simple and it is a typical F2p game but I won't taint this awesome game with talks of junk. You will probally be pressed to find enough time to give this Gem its due.The world is meticulously crafted everything placed has a reason...There are intersting quest there are factions for rewards and in depth crafting system a huge seamless map. The loot is awesome and the new cap is lvl 85. Theres also Devotion system and a whole lot of ways to customize your class. Graphically the game is gorgeous there is a huge amount of polish already and even though GD is content complete they still have a build 30 coming to add more balance and fix bugs which in the 70 hours ive never seen. So final release of game drops in February. THE game is on sale for 15 bucks...is it worth it LOL. Its worth full price and then some I would of payed 100 bucks for it if thats what they asked...It is that good and CRATE entertainment is purely awesome.Combat is Visceral and every hit is spot on. Where Diablo 3 is very good with combat Grim Dawn is not as flashy with skills but make no mistake the combat and effect suit this game style perfectly.Its kind of nice seeing your enemies rather then them being lost in a hail of multishot and meteors HAHAHA. Dont think take debit card remove from wallet or purse buy this game it is one of the best games ever made period			"

								I'm sure a lot of folks like me binged hours into Diablo II and have awaited the next action RPG to yield an equally addictive and entertaining experience.  This is totally that game, more than any other since.  I didn't care for Diablo III and didn't spend much time there.  Torchlight II was fun, but lacked the darker aesthetic. I've just purchased Grim Dawn today and couldn't be happier.  I love the Titan Quest style, especially the dual classing which really makes character building more interesting and worthwhile.  Seriously, if you've been searching for the hack and slash that has D2's addiction factor but with more freedom and character depth, don't hesitate.			"

								The release date has been pushed so far away from the original estimate that it is almost unbelievable, but the end result is turning up to be very nice indeed. This is one of those games that keeps getting care until it is actually a finished product unlike most games these days.This is also one of the very few games that have great atmospheric music. You don't always even realize it's there and it never manages to annoy you. And when you actually happen to pay attention to it you find it obvious that the music is an integral part of the atmosphere.The game has some Diablo 2 feel to it but at least for me it does not invoke quite the same kind of gaming madness as Diablo 2 did all those years ago. But then again I may have changed a bit myself over time too. Upgrading items is too loyal Titan Quest for my liking. It's not a bad system but IMO it does not compete well with D2 gems and runes. And for me every game in this genre competes with Diablo 2 with Lord of Destruction expansion installed. Also so far I haven't noticed that interesting itemization in Grim Dawn but IMO the items are more interesting than in Diablo 3 for example. Then again most more interesting items in D2 came to play at a reasonably high level.			"

Early Access Review
								'm not sure how to feel about Grim Dawn. It's still in Alpha/Beta/whateva but I've put 20 something hours of 99% non buggy gameplay in. It's not complete, but from what I've read there will only be 3 acts. and I've finished up to act 3 chapter 1 very quickly. Unfortunately, there is so little story delvelopment and change to atmosphere/landscape setting for the first two acts that I did not even know I'd finished them. So for 20 something hours I've felt like I did nothing and went nowhere except advance a character from 1-35. Maybe that is intentional. It is the apocalypse after all and there's nothing to save except a few stragglers of humanity. Maybe I just don't care about the characters AT ALL. There are factions in the game but no clear way to use them. Honestly, I would LOVE to do a play through where you don't help prison town, but they seem to be the gatekeepers of the storyline.STORY 1/5Speaking of the setting. I do love it. It's a wonderful post apocalyptic nowhere WITH magic and demons. Really can't go wrong there. I could do without the high contrast everything trying to impose a sense of grime and rather have it implemented well, but it is still interesting visually. I think it's just a sign of the times with all these false HD mods using super sharp textures with higher contrast and calling it HD instead of actually making it at 2 or 4x at high resolutions. It's a personal preference for art direction so I would never stop playing for that.SETTING: greatClasses are interesting and fun to experiment with. Titan Quest is my all time favorite ARPG with the dual class system and 9 masteries the replayablility was endless. Grim Dawn is not it's equal, but in this instance it's not disappointing either. This time around we only get 5 thus far, but you can also dual class. Although I'm not sure how useful it will be considering you spend so many points just trying to go down one tree you barely have enough left to secondary. (at lvl 40) When and if lvl cap increases this may add more replayability. BE WARNED there is no buy back on mastery points, only skill points. Don't lock yourself into mastery points you don't intend to use to buy skills at this stage of development.I was constantly hitting spots where monsters were 5-8lvls higher then me, so some tweaking should be done there. Some of the monsters are so f'ing overpowered towards the end, even as your character is the same level they are 1 hit kills. Playing a war of who can run to their grave, hit the monster a couple of time while running away, accidentally hitting the wrong thing then insta dying is not fun, and it's just not acceptable on normal mode where resistance gear is hard to come by. Monsters should be a challenge, but making their str 999999 is not the way to do it.Gameplay (assuming balancing will be done before release:) THUMBS UPAll around I'd wait till release unless you want to support CRATE which is why I got it. I'm sure it will be worth the price eventually.			"

								Like a grimy cousin to Diablo 2. Smaller in scope, but nevertheless a worthy addition to any ARPG fan's library. It's not very pretty; if you're a graphics fanboy, there's a lot to nitpick about the scenery. A love of dark atmosphere is a must, as 90% of Dawn's look is centered around an amalgamation of Dark Ages/Post Apocalyptic themes. No sunshine or secret rainbow levels here! Also, what's not to love about taking a shotgun to a zombie's face in the middle of a rainstorm, and then tossing a molotov into a group of walkers immediately after?  You level at a reasonable pace, as well. Aye, it's a ""one more level and then I'll get off!"" sort of game.Also of note: no quest guidelines or help. When you're given a quest (find my necklace!) you have to actually READ the quest info and pick out clues as to where it might be (which are almost always obvious anyway...""Oh! She said in the second paragraph she left it in her house in TOWN so it must be there, right...? Only, which house is hers? Guess I gotta check them all!"") Nothing brain-boggling, but it's nice that it pays to READ stuff rather than look at your map to find a highlighted location (as in most games). Might be a turn off for the impatient, though. Still, there are always plenty of monsters to shoot/stab/immolate/bash. And for under $20, this game is a no brainer. Will definitely suck at a few hours out of your life.			"

												BEATEN!# Level 41 / MAX IS 85 I think- Pure Warrior (melee)#32 hoursVery fun action RPG. Lots of customization, fun solo, great gear, and a variety of enemies.Pros:- Right balance of loot to sell/use/save- Difficult enough on normal without being impossible (solo)- Varied enemies and environments- Open world that is blocked off in such a way that you can ""construct"" paths to previously off-limits areas with loot.- Lots of sub-systems to explore (crafting, etc)Cons:- Story (typical in an ARPG) is interesting enough, but you probably wont care.- The map. I wish there was a transparent overlay map.Neutral:- Class system is designed in such a way that is meant to combine two classes, giving you more varied skills. If you go just one class, then you will have more powerful skills, but not a lot of variety. (Not necessarily bad)- There are a lot of passive skills. This is fine, but it doesnt add to variety or give you any visual queue other than stuff being more effective.			"

												Surprisingly brilliant ARPG. It's probably been said already but it's the diablo 2 sequel that never was. Takes some of the best features of most ARPG's and incorporates them into itself. Notably, diablo and torchlight, Again, suprisingly the lore isnt just thrown together, it's actually an interesting world with well thought out lore. The skill/talent system puts diabloIII to shame. I like D3 but this is something that's been sorely lacking in D3 since it's launch.If i'm comparing it to D3 too much, it's because Blizzard could learn a lot by looking back. Honestly, for the pricetag, if you enjoy ARPG's you'll get hundreds of meaty hours out of this game.  9/10 "

Early Access Review
								I'm playing on a computer with Intel HD 2500 Graphics on an i5-3400 (aka 3.4 GHz Intel Rating) CPU at a resolution of 1024x768, most settings on low, shadows off, post processing off. And guess what?  It runs more than adequately.  It runs almost as well as Titan Quest, so far.  Like Titan Quest it slows a tad when you near flames and a little bit more when you view through multiple levels of transparencies (such as looking thru tree limbs, walls, and other objects to see behind them), that's about it.  The atmosphere is great, sort of a mix of Diablo 1 and 2 meets Path of Exile.  All of the great features of the Titan Quest Series' features are there, such as innumerable stats so you always know what is going on under the hood, to good art direction, and the ability to choose 2 classes if you want a hybrid character.   All I can tell you is that if it runs on my rig, chances are it will run on your rig, laptop or not, provided you choose the right options.  The main purpose for this review is to get out the word that it does run ok on such a set-up.If you enjoyed Titan Quest and Immortal Throne, or you really long for a quality, good looking update to Diablo 1 and 2, with new lore to explore, but that same feeling of slightly claustrophobic dread, this looks like a winner.  So far, I enjoy the beginning more than Titan Quest/Immortal Throne.  The way the factions and various magic systems are divided, also seems to allow for better balancing while meshing perfectly with the new lore of this game, which is new to my experience.  It makes it enjoyable to explore and simply to experience the game.   There are numerous new features beyond TQ/IT as well.I'll play more to see if I run into any issues.  I turned the shadows off mainly to avoid slight polygon effects showing up under shadow calculation (after a while some shadows looked like flashing black triangles), and to pick up a couple frames a second.  Turning off post processing didn't hurt the look at all, but picked up a several frames a second also.    At the settings I described above, with Details at Medium, and the rest not just mentioned at low, it looks just like the quality of Titan Quest at high.That's a good sign.  It is 1-16-2016.  I got the game on sale for about $15.  This is SO FAR exactly what I wanted.  I'll update the review when I have put a good 40 + hours in.EDIT IN DETAILING BEST GRAPHIC OPTIONS:For playing Grim Dawn on the Intel HD 2500 I also recommend keeping:-- Anti-Aliasing Off (not needed at these resolutions and can slow fps down),-- Anisotropic Filtering Off (tends to cause slight lag at least on Titan Quest/Immortal Throne in certain situations, and on isometric games tends to just increase the detail clarity of textures very near to you unless you put it very high, and tends to act on lighting and shadows causing more lag, but try AF at 2x or 4x and see if it is ok for you).-- I'll try 1360x768, and some other resolutions next, but the reason I used 1024x768 is because I knew from previous experience that this gave the best responsiveness on TQ/IT with some good lighting and mild shadows, rest on high).  You may be able to do about as well at 1280x720 or 1360x768, worth trying.  For me my custom colors and set-up work only at 1024x768 and 1360x768, so those are the key options I try first, works on most games for Intel HD 2500 GPU (with very rare exceptions).-- Although Triple Buffering did smooth out the movement a touch entering in and out of transparencies, movement of the character became a bit unwieldy with lots of enemies and transparency effects while in buildings so ... my guess is that it overwhelmed the GPU at that point past the ability to smooth, as it tried to keep up with the 3 frames ahead stored in the buffer.  It never helped much with a slow GPU in TQ/IT either.  If you have a fast GPU, that may be another story.)EDIT IN #2 :-- I tried a bit 1360x786.  As with Titan Quest, it can be done, but it is a bit laggy on the Intel HD 2500, so for me it is not quite worth it.  The 1280x resolutions usually will run a bit bigger, but on my system they will not be full screen within a window, that is with black bars, which I prefer for a higher concentration of pixels per inch at a resolution.  Also my colors don't look as good as the custom settings don't really stick to it.  They are worth a try if you like and use often those resolutions.  On many games 1280x720 will run about the same as 1024x768, it might be close also in this game, but no guarantees.I continue to enjoy the game immensely for its atmosphere. One thing some of you may find interesting -- at the moment there are some furniture which do not highlight and are destructible.  Occasionally these are shelves or slightly different looking cabinets.  Although they do not highlight under the mouse cursor, on rare occasions they can provide look and rarely some very good loot.  It is not a bad idea to try destroying any furniture around you.  It will all refresh anyway on the next restart of the game, as the map seems to reset in that way, along with the usual restock of enemies when you restart/reload a game from the main menu.			"

								When I first started playing this game I did detect similarities with this and Titan Quest. That isn't a bad thing. I love the Titan Quest series, and I don't honestly know what happened to the team who created Titan Quest, or who specifically is a part of the creation of Grim Dawn, but those who are working on Grim Dawn are doing a fantastic job. A new environment, new classes, new skills, and a pretty cool gem system are all enjoyable. I think the best thing to note here, is that it's a hard game. It's not forgiving. I wouldn't suggest going hardcore at first. Mobs are constantly scaling to your level, but only within reason. The battles are very intense and I feel like this game in the 20 hours I played of it, is definitely a great co-op adventure. I didn't play this single player, but I loved playing with my friend in co-op and didn't experience any technical issues, just one random disconnect. I like this game a lot, I guess the only problem I have right now is I don't know when to expect completion, or how many chapters are to be in this game. In my 20 hours my friend and I completed a lot, we explored, we killed maneater, we found out that there is an actual order of which things should be taken, but we ended up killing like, the final boss, then the other bosses scaled to our level, and we fought them at random times or when we actually progressed through the story at those given times. There are a lot of options in this game, and really the only requirement is to want to explore and enjoy yourself. If you don't want to kill a boss, you really don't have to. I am sure there is a requirement for some instances to get into a next chapter (which we are limited to just the 1 right now) then maybe a huge final boss encounter must occur, but really it was a lot of fun to be able to not have to do anything, but still doing things.TL;DR1. Dungeon crawler.2. Quests are pretty optional, but also seem to finish naturally.3. Challenging, mobs scale to your level.4. Class/subclass specifications make multiple play throughs a must.5. Exploration with very few deadends.6. I like Blizzard games, I am not biased. I didn't like Diablo 3, I feel this game beats it. Hard.7. $25 "

												Best ARPG on the market hands down. Incredibly deep yet simple. Really feels like it was made by a hardcore fan of the genre. Buy it, love it.Full Release has really blown me away. The price point is insane with the amount of content and polish you get. This really turned out to be a labor of love and I couldn't be happier. The ARPG genre is lacking and this fills the void with promises of more content to come.			"

												This game is really awesome, it took my expectations and went beyond. Even though it is my first introduction to these types of games, I never really felt too overwhelmed at any point. I'm currently 41 hours into it and still nowhere near beating it, am just exploring new locations and finding lots of great loot. The amount of content and exploration developed along with story makes this more than worth its price point. Wonderful job on creating this fun experience.Pros:-lots of content for a small price. -Massive locations to explore and loot. -Very quick loading screens that only last for 1 to 2 seconds max.Cons: -Sometimes the game will slow down with all of the effects on screen due to the game only using 1 cpu core.

								Seeing as Grim Dawn goes to full release today, Feb. 25, 2016, I thought it prudent to write my review today. I have to say that Grim Dawn is the best ARPG I have played since that old classic Titan Quest Immortal Throne. It takes on the two class system that TQ had plus it adds another way to spec out your character with a Star Constellation map and as you find desecrated shrines and restore them you gain points you can use to fill out the various constellation adding further character customization.Grim Dawn to me is the ultimate single player ARPG that also has multiplayer co-op and PvP built in, in fact it reminds me of the good old days of that classic Diablo 2 which I had a TON of fun playing multiplayer back in the day. The developer has been very active in the Steam Forum for their game during Early Access and they have delivered 100% in all promises made to the contributors in the Kickstarter that began this project and through out Early Access. I consider Crate Entertainment to be one of my favorite developers in the game development business and I can't wait to see where Grim Dawn goes when they release the toolset so the modding community can begin to take this game in very interesting directions in the future.

												Frustratingly unforgiving, incredibly rewarding, GD plays like an ARPG and requires the patience of an MMORPG. There are very few 'invisible walls' when it comes to gameplay; it gives you far more rope than needed to hang yourself.It's a large undertaking to explore and become familar with all of the game's content. There is a high learning curve, with a complex combination of mechanics involving character abilities, NPC politics, crafting system, itemization and gear augmentation. This world ain't for the feignt of heart. Grim Dawn will kick your butt. Repeatedly.With over 100 hours into the game so far, the experience has been very similar to the launch of World of Warcraft. Be prepared to get lost in awe, and feel overwhelmed by the vast world to uncover.			"

								Was waiting for some of my friends to play this game, and see what they would think, and buy depending on their opinion. Then it was in the wintersale, bought it.. no regrets. Gameplay is awesome, questing actually is very different then other games, not too obvious (not the standard follow marker, kill 10 boars, talk to this person, done). You complete quests while exploring, wich is something i really had to get used to, but really enjoy. The build diversity is insane. at lvl 10 you get to pick a second class and the devotion system allows you to alter your skills and build even further. This game really is ''play how you want''. Lookig forward to trying out many more classes. Best ARPG i have played in years. I'm lvl 33 now and just cleared act 1, Barely done anything in act 2. Bottom line, if you like hack and slash, experimenting with an insane amount of skills and about 30 class combos, this game is the game for you.			"

												Grim Dawn is a strong action ARPG in the vein of Titan Quest. Overall the graphics and sound are solid, with strong charcter flexibility. In Grim Dawn you have the ability to speciailize in two of six different masteries with a multitude of skills to invest in across each mastery. There's also a fair amount of items, as you would expect and hunting for rare trinkets and crafting can often prove rewarding. Overall Grim Dawn ofers much stronger character building compenents than other more well-known titles in this genre (i.e. Diabl 3), with solid presentation and gameplay. I would definitely recommend fans of the action RPG genere check this title out, especially for the more than reasonable list price of $25.			"

								This game is in the late stages of early access with most of the content being out and the 6th class (shaman) having been released.  I bought this game prior to build 27 being released and I've loved it ever since.  If you're an ARPG fan, forget D3, and other games that are super mainstream.  This game is a nice slide to the right and definitely keeps you entertained.  It's challenging and fun, multiplayer scales well and makes things more interesting, and they're still not done adding stuff.  Can't wait for the full release at the end of the year.  $25 well spent in mind.Also, I love the nightblade's ability to shadow strike (or what I like to call shadow stepping) enemies.  Popping enemies has never been more fun! :D			"

								I'm a fan of Diablolike hack'n'slash games. Like, a huge fan. And from the creators of excellent Titan Quest, this game is damn awesome effort. It's a pre-release so far, but already so good. It's not fair to compare this to Diablo 3, there's a huge difference in budgets. Nevertheless, this game is nearly as fun to play, and the atmosphere is much better. Where D3 failed, this game succeeds. The Diablolike games are a group I find hard  to put in any order of preference. Still, I'd say this game is in a good place with D1, D2, D3, Titan Quest, Sacred(s), Nox, Throne of Darkness, Path of Exile and  a very few others. Certainly vastly better than the miserable attempts Torchlights were.			"

								I searched for days on Steam for a new game to play.  I have really enjoyed the couple hours I've play thus far and would tell anyone I know that likes this style of game to buy it.  Well worth the money, even while it's in early access.  Can't wait to see what else is in store for me and as this game developes more.			"

								WIth the latest build and patches, this is really shaping up to be a contender for my top games list. The build diversity seems really solid, and the loot variety supports that diversity. Still only normal dififculty act 1 and 2 available, but this is easily one of the most polished early access games on steam, and the developer Crate is very responsive to the community. I highly reccomend this game.			"

								As a long time fan of Isometric role playing games, this was one title I simply could not miss.I played Titan Quest from the boys at Iron ward and i was certain the old devs could deliver another hack and slash masterwork, and lo and behold it came forth as GRIM DAWN. Go ahed and buy this game, its AWESOME!			"

Early Access Review
								I'm a fan of Diablolike hack'n'slash games. Like, a huge fan. And from the creators of excellent Titan Quest, this game is damn awesome effort. It's a pre-release so far, but already so good. It's not fair to compare this to Diablo 3, there's a huge difference in budgets. Nevertheless, this game is nearly as fun to play, and the atmosphere is much better. Where D3 failed, this game succeeds. The Diablolike games are a group I find hard  to put in any order of preference. Still, I'd say this game is in a good place with D1, D2, D3, Titan Quest, Sacred(s), Nox, Throne of Darkness, Path of Exile and  a very few others. Certainly vastly better than the miserable attempts Torchlights were.			"

								Great hack and slash. Like Torchlight, the game plays like Diablo. However, unlike torchlight, the story is actually somewhat interesting and the western/Baroque setting is very unique and unlike any other canon I've seen. Another plus is the fact that even though this is technically an ""Early Access"" game like many others on steam, it has all the aspects of a full release. Especially now that multiplayer has been added, the game really only has to add the Arcanist class before its essencially all there. Mechanically, the game is well made. Not too HD but just enough clarity to help the game keep its gritty look. While it's technically designed and designated an Isometric, the camera can still be turned with "","" and ""."" allowing for a much less restricted feel like many other over the head games. The class system is also very intuitive allowing for any of the 5 classes to be combined with another class, allowing for a variety of different combinations. The classes are also very accomadating to different desires and styles. The Soldier is essencially basic tank n' slash. The occultist is for people who like edge and magic, the demolitionist for gun people, the nightblade for burst/stealth people, and the arcanist for people who like not edgey magic. Overall, I believe this game is worth about $40, not $25.			"

Early Access Review
								Do you remember after Diablo 3 came out and you were really dissapointed in blizzard and it left you wanting? This game is everything that Diablo 3 wasn't and more, and it's made by the same people who made Titan Quest. It's in alpha and it already has loads of content and devs who are constantly updating the game, fixing bugs, and adding more content weekly. I just got done playing for several hours with 3 other friends in a party and it ran smoothly and we all had a blast. It brought back memories of staying up all night in high school with my friends lan'ing Diablo 2 and Titan Quest. This game is definitely going to be the new titan quest and more. You can play two different classes which leads to a lot of different combinations and playstyles, and the devs are adding in new classes off and on as well which is really nice. I'm currently playing a warder which is a shaman and a soldier/warrior. It's a blast; this game is a work of art and definitely deserves to be given a chance. There are a few minor bugs i've noticed but they are visual and aren't pertinent to gameplay and progression. If you're thinking about trying out Grim Dawn because you're trying to fill that empty hole that Diablo 3 left you with, do it. I doubt you'll be dissapointed.			"

Very grungy storyline, graphics are very tstefully done! Even as an Early Access game, this game shines brightly with hidden potential (think about how much time you spent playing similiar style games, and how much fun you had...) Definitely worth the price! get it while it's a steal, not that full release price would'nt be worth it either!Edit: This game is still an amazing go to game, a must buy for any fan of the genre			"

								I'm not normally one to write reviews seeing as how Im very lazy, but I wanted to give grim dawn a big huzzah, as most reviews have said this game plays like a finished game and it seems like the devs are really giving it their full effort to make a fame to stand the test of overly critical gamers. I have had this game for a couple days now and I cannot set it down. There are rarely bugs, the challenge is adequate, it is already deep with a great and I feel original story that is only going to progress as the game is finished, and the music while repetitive is like having sex while camping (♥♥♥♥ing intense, get it haha anyways). I give this game a solid 9.5 out of 10 and plan on playing it and following the development very closely. Keep up the great work Crate games.			"

The concept of combining classes is also a cherry on top of the list of pro's you cannot fathom until playing the game yourself.

								Grim Dawn is a really amazing ARPG (Action Roleplaying Game, a.k.a. Diablo-style game). AtmosphereThe world takes place in an apocalyptic world with old-timey shotguns, zombies, and magic. Lots of magic. The world is gritty and interesting, flowing with atmosphere that reeks of Dark Souls inspiration. This is a good smell to have.CombatThe combat is very fun. Each hit on an enemy feels heavy - like there's some weight to it. There's standard health/energy(mana) potions, yet I've never had to use them until I started fighting more hero enemies. The constitution (health regen) system works really well to keep downtime to a minimum. When your health goes down, after combat is done, you regenerate health from your smaller constitution bar, which then goes down. You refill constitution by finding food in the world, which is pretty frequent if you explore the map. It seems complicated, but it's not. Kill enemies, eat food.Class/Skill SystemThe skill/class system is refreshing. Basically, you invest points into your class to unlock new skill nodes, and skills can be leveled/extended with passive abilities, which alter or extend their capabilities. Once you hit level 10, you can invest points in a second class, which then results in a new class name altogether (Demolitionist + Occultist becomes Pyromancer).LootLoot drops (important in ARPGs) feel pretty damn good in this game. There's no magic find stat (which is counter-intuitive anyway), so they've balanced things in such a way that you feel like you get just enough awesome loot to keep wanting to look for more. Chests/bosses pretty much have a guarantee of something good dropping, and merchants occasionally carry green-rarity equipment (yellow -> green -> blue is the progression here). Each merchant's stock refreshes every time you teleport somewhere. Green equipment cost a lot of currency, so being able to refresh their inventories feels like a fair trade for having an easier time finding a rare item. Smart DesignThere's no waypoint scrolls (Thank you, Crate!). You can open a rift (portal) whenever you want, so the game feels very mobile. Yet, you'll usually want to explore every inch of every area, thanks to secret areas hidden behind breakable walls, quests you can find, hero minibosses, and so on. In ConclusionThe game is still in Early Access, yet the foundation is strong and there's plenty of content to sink hours upon hours into. I recommend getting it when you can, and enjoying the game as it continues to evolve. The future's looking bright.			"

												I have been a fan of Diablo for all of my gaming life.  Diablo was the first game I bought and I loved it.  That being said, Grim Dawn has taken what I liked about the first two Diablos and improved on the mechanics to make it one of a kind but still with that dark feel that the Diablo games had (before #3).  This is a must have for Diablo fans and all hack & slash fans alike.			"

												First Impressions w/ Pros & (somewhat) Cons. -	Nostalgia of Diablo 2 crossed with Path of Exile -	Classic ‘old school’ look with updated graphics-	Male and female character option-	6 main classes. Combine 2 to create one of 15 unique classes-	Immersive day and night cycles-	Easily accessible multiplayer mode-	Ability to use existing characters in new or existing single player or multiplayer games (no need to start over)-	Combat/difficulties don’t seem overly challenging but are still enjoyable.-	Ability to move camera angle is a great feature (Ability to turn this off in options as well for a more typical arpg camera)-	Optional instanced loot (No need to share!)-	No initial character customisation-	Currently no caster staves or wands-	No quest helper – Must read quests and follow directions to find objectives. (I personally prefer this but some people may not)-	Haven’t encountered proper crafting (unsure if it exists) but inserting gems to gear is very simple.I’ve been looking for something to play since Diablo 3, and I think this is what I’ve been looking for. Though the game looks very similar to older ARPGs, it is still very graphically pleasing. Story seems a little slow to start, but still piqued my interest. For those who have played typical top down ARPGs before, the controls and interface should be familiar to you, but to those who aren’t used to this style of game, may find it difficult to get used to the interface as there isn’t much of a tutorial – So make sure to familiarise yourself first before running out into the wild. Going out into the world, the day and night cycles really make a difference. Night time is quite eerie and foreboding, whereas during the day, surroundings are more visible and sun rays shine through trees.  First thing I noticed with quests is no quest tracker. The only indication of quest objectives is when you’re basically on top of them. I found this a little difficult and time consuming at first as I’m not used to this kind of questing (thanks modern games :P) But quickly got the hang of reading quests and following the directions. Classes so far, are amazing. Can pick 1 class at level 2 and the next at level 10 to create a unique sub class. Each class has a large number of abilities, and the ‘Devotion’ trees give extra defensive and offensive passives which are quite extensive. I haven’t played the game for very long but have played in single and multiplayer settings and find them both easily accessible and fun. I’m a bit picky when it comes to this game style, but Grim Dawn definitely has my vote!			"

												Grim Dawn really brings back memories from its predecessor Titan Quest and fixes a lot of weakness of their previous title as well as improving and adding a lot of features !- Personnalisation is here, with two class to pick from 6 options, tons of loot, relics, devotion...- A nice atmosphere. Graphically, the game is impressive, and the level design is interesting.- The game feels dynamic from the beginning and yet pick up the pace as you rise in level. The difficulty seems well balanced where beginners and more experimented players will find their fill.- The story line is decent but not revolutionary, but it is exciting to discover the lore of Cairn and to discover the world.Overall, the game is as addictive as Titan Quest ever was, and in my opinion better. I fully recommend this game !			"

												Before I give my review I figured I'd give everyone a back story of my experience with ARPG's. For a good portion of my youth (until around the age of 18) I was a console gamer, specifically Nintendo. So my exposure to the genre was very minimal. It wasn't until I ran across a copy of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance on the gamecube that I got my real taste, and once I didn't I couldn't get enough. My brother and I played the hell out of that game. We probably spent around 200hrs on it (which was pretty insane at the time). Moving on I graduated highschool and finally decided to venture into PC Gaming. One of the first games I played was WoW. I started around the end of Burning Crusade and grew tired of money grubbing Blizzard by Cataclysm.  Afterwards I spent some time playing Path of Exile. I eventually grew fed up with it due to how imbalanced the game felt, the numerous bugs (this was during early beta, so I'd hope the bugs have been fixed by now) and it's convoluted, passive (boring) skill tree. So after one frustrating night realizing that my build was not exploitive enough to work, I gave up on it. For a couple years here, I didn't play any Diablo-like games. Until on a whim I purchased Torchlight 2, and for a while I was entertained. I guess the only real reason I quit playing it was do it's cartoonish graphic style (I know shallow, right). But I blame WoW for that one.  Torchlight 2 is still a very fun game, I'm sure I'll eventually return to it someday, maybe dabble in some mods.  Around this time Diablo III came out and I was still too butthurt with Blizzard to give it a try. I didn't want to have anything to do with it's corrupt auction house or it's WoW like graphic style. I have since learned that it's in a pretty solid state now (the auction house has been removed and numerous gameplay changes have occured) but I don't trust Blizzard as far as I can throw them. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. But I digress. Grim Dawn is a fanastic game. The visual's and atmosphere of the game are very eerie. The amount of customization is incredible. The sheer number of builds is awe-inspiring.  The story is compelling enough to keep you going. The gameplay is top notch. There is controller support. And so on and so forth. This is the best ARPG I've ever played. If my experience with this genre is reminiscent of your own, do yourself a favor and buy this game. If you are looking for an excellent ARPG, buy this game. Seriously, I can't recommend it enough. Support these developers and buy this game already!			"

								I love this game.I was super skeptical because my husband was a fiend -- pardon -- for Diablo for what seemed like an eternity, so when he moved to this game, I was wary. I'm not a Diablo fan; too twitchy and too repetitive, with what seemed like a very clear One Good Build per class. Not my thing.However, I love this game! Do yourself a favor and start on Veteran, not Normal. It can be twitchy, depending on how you build your character. I'm about to do Elite, and I just finished the story, so at least this far I haven't been bothered by repetition; I understand there is some, but nothing like ""ok just repeat the whole game again forever liTERALLY FOREVER."" But I'm really SUPER pleased with the class system. A general familiarity with RPGs enabled me to pick a path through the multitude of skills and options without referencing the internet, and extreme flexibility with the points has enabled me to tune that nicely as the content got harder. I love that I haven't needed to bind a million abilities, and have had the opportunity to make lots of interesting, difficult decisions. y'all this game is good, it's so good that I went past ignoring the steampunk-western-Lovecraft-zombies setting and I actually LIKE it now.

												This game is great.Solid ARPG mechanics very cool dual class progression systemlots of little quality of life things like a built in loot filterI've been playing the veteran difficulty and it is usually easy enough if I'm paying attention, but there are significant spikes in difficulty at times, and I think that's how it should be.Crafting, bounties, and apparently the game is open to modding so that should be sweet when the community starts pumping out content.Oh...and custom servers like d2 or torchlight style.I'd like to see slightly larger status icons on the HUD or have them somewhere my eyes are more prone to be. I usually don't even know when i've been poisoned or something since the icons are small and at the bottom right of the screen.Not sure how the end-game will hold up but so far this is a very good alternative to diablo 3 for just $25If this style of game is your thing, then it is totally worth trying.

								Been playing this game for 10 hours or so at the time I'm writing this review.I can recommend it. If you like the Titan Quest gameplay, you'll love this game. The talent and combat system is very similar. The setting is something you will love or hate. It contains a lot of undead and a lot of insect creatures(atleast Act 1). Here and there you'll encounter some greenish goblin like creatures which are a good alternation from the undead hordes.The early access is really stable(atleast the SP) and there are just a few bugs you will encounter, besides that it feels and plays like a finished product. The price of this game is not too high and if you got the patience to wait for a sale, you just can't skip on this game.Go get it if you're an ARPG fan, you'll have fun.			"

								Ok so I have played over 70 hours and I have several characters at the current level cap. This is an extremely good game, and there are plenty of reviews going into how it brings back feelings of great old ARPG titles and that is exactly correct. I will go a little different direction. I have about 600 hours in Diablo 3 and I would say that Grim Dawn has none of Diablo 3's failings. The game feels gritty, atmospheric, interesting story line, and so on. However, it is weak where D3 is strong: game responsiveness. In Grim Dawn you will often feel a slight barrier between what you want to make your character do (and the buttons you are pushing to make that happen) and what your character actually does. But remember, this is ALPHA, so I fully expect all of that to be smoothed out. This game is more than worth the money. Feels like STALKER mixed with Diablo 2. Great fun.			"

								If you like ARPG...give this a game a go. With work still to be done Crate Entertainment has got a gem here, worth a close look. Along with the usual suspects...loot, quests, class development, and breaking items, comes some new twists and Ideas. The ability to multi-class a second class with your original, and an interesting combine system to upgrade your gear are just a couple of the nice additions.Work still needs to be done, but what is here is stable, fun, and nicely developed. You won't get that , ""well it looks nice but...."" feeling. Graphics are GRIM but detailed, nice spell effects, sound and music seem to fit perfectly, and the game is performing well. Comparisons with other established ARPG's will be in abundance, though with Grim Dawn you won't feel like your playing a cookie-cut game to feed the populace, for this game has an identity for sure and I see great things only.

I ended up caving and buying the game, hoping it would be both challenging and enjoyable. Boy was I right! This game has an excellent community, a nice multiplayer system (that is still very new) and a interesting storyline. HOWEVER; the game is as of yet NOT COMPLETE. So if you don't want to contribute to a project that, in my opinion, is a very worthwhile one. This does not however mean that the game is unplayable. It is quite the opposite in fact, I have logged quite a few hours and plan to log many more. Often updates keep new content coming, patience is a virtue!All in all, my EARLY ACCESS GAME rating is a 8/10I look forward to seeing you lads ingame soon!			"

								I bought Grim Dawn after watching a Twitch stream. Having not heard of this game before I spent some time researching as I have been burned by early access games before. After reading and watching and rinsing and repeating I finally broke down and bought Grim Dawn. I have not been disappointed so far. The game is visually stunning and controls very well. It does not hold your hand and requires exploration and actual reading of the quests. The world is also an open one with load screens only when entering caves or dungeons. Transportation is alieviated by a nice portal system though, which makes getting around to those areas already discovered a breeze. The skill system seems very robust allowing for a mashup of two specs (unlocked at level 10) and making or breaking your build interesting and rewarding. It seems like the developers are quite active in rolling out updates. Like any early access game though, I am sure there are problems which I havn't encountered or noticed yet. So as I do recommend this game, remember do your own homework. Grim Dawn is a nice breath of fresh air in the stale ARPG realm. 3.8/5 Bitz			"

I especially enjoy skills that can take on groups allowing me to charge into a pack of soon-to-be loot pinatas. It reminds me quite a bit of Path of Exile, but without the randomized areas. If I had to compare it to something it would be a mix of Path of Exile and Divine Divinity. Definitely worth a try in its current state and the price they are asking.			"

The game is from the creators of Titan Quest, which you can see quite early with the skill trees and second mastery which combines to one class name. The five possible masteries you can choose from differ in playstyle and even after choosing one, you can play how you like it. For example playing a melee demolitionist or a melee arcanist with soldier as second mastery. You're free to do what you like.I'm close to finish the first act and I can't wait to see the following acts, their setup and bosses. Nice game!			"

Loot that inspires character development, violence and epic battles that will leave your heart hammering and yammering for MOAR, immersive story and setting including choice-and-consequences and faction/reputation based questing and acheivements, farming and crafting, character customization options that, with the addition of Devotion, includes plenty of theory-crafting. All of this will easily keep any fan of the genre glued to the game for weeks, months and even years.

								Excellent ARPG. Plenty of stuff to do, enemies to kill, loot to hoard. The dual-class system allows for an amazing amount of customization. There are 5 classes to choose from (Soldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade, and Arcanist). Once you reach level 10 you can choose a second class to compliment your first, or just stick with one. Each class' skill tree has enough abilities that you can't even come close to maxing out everything. Your choice of skills actually matters and will affect how you play.Even just with the same two-class combination ( I have 3 different soldier + occultist = witchblade) there is quite a variety as to how one can choose to play: ranged w/ guns, ranged w/ 2-hand melee weapon (Really? Yep.), dual-wield melee, 1-hand and shield, 2-hand melee.The game can be non-linear - if you want, you can skip most of act 1 and go to act 2 earlier for a challenge. There are lots of hidden areas to find, some with challenging enemies, others with chests containing guaranteed epic loot.All this and more from an Early Access title. One of the best Early Access experiences I've had with any Steam game and it gets better with each new patch.Absolutely worth full price, $25 is half the cost of a certain other 'AAA' ARPG that didnt come close to what fans were hoping for (and it's a steal at the current 50% off sale price!!).  This game will not disappoint.			"

								Been on Steam for many years, this is the first game that compelled me to give a review. Been a somewhat on-off fan of ARPG since Diablo, Diablo 2 was the perfect game for me as a teen, sunk many hours into it back then. Torchlight 2 was good... but it just felt too cartoony.  Bought D3 when it came out, huge disapppointment with the skill system and it was boring and bright, unlike D2 which was darker. Grim Dawn reminded me of D2, and brought with it the wonder of the dual class system to me (I never tried Titan Quest, somehow it slipped off my game radar)GD seems to be what I expect from a modern ARPG, it is moderately hard if your build is incorrect, and you can respec your characters' skill points to see if u can improve on your build. If you are a glutton for punishment, you can play hardcore veteran difficulty. All in all, i would recommend GD to all people who were disappointed by D3			"

The way the game has developed since I first played has been mind blowing, and to think they've done it with a team of 8, incredible!This game deserves far more credit and recognition, it is a highly polished product despite the 'early access' tag. So if you're looking for something new to play, or generally an ARPG fan get amongst it and try it out, there is so much content to enjoy.			"

								I really love it! As a fan of Diablo and to some degree Titan Quest - this feels like something in-between. Visually I suppose it looks more like TQ (If I'm not mistaken, some people behind GD were also involved in the making of TQ). I made a character and dinged it to 40 (current level cap, as the game is in early access), and after that I just HAD to create another character and try something different... and then a third - And this is all singleplayer! I haven't even begun to touch the multiplayer aspect of it. Of course there will be tweaks and changes to come but as is - it's already a very enjoyable experience! Don't expect an Oscar winning script, though.. It's a hack'n-slasher! (But a good one at that!)			"

								I don't buy Early Access games, but this one surprised me. Looking for a Diablo like clone, I found this gem. Develops are constantly working and updating the game, and they actually listen to feedback. The game mechanics are fresh, and allow for far more open customization of play styles than Diablo 3 does. I loved my Demon Hunter in D3 but here I get to play with a ranged character with other classes mixed in, and I can revert and change at any time. The game is a fresh entry and one that needs support. I said it before, early access is always a risk, do your own research, dig for yourself, and invest as you feel you can or should, and never take everything at its word, even me. Take a look at Grim Dawn, you may enjoy this great surprise of a game.			"

								Grim Dawn seems to be one of the best ARPG titles that came out. If you played Titan Quest ( or TQIT) you will note that the developers are still the same. The games is yet ( 2 of 3 acts are out ) like a heavily improved version TQ setted in the industrial time. The loot system is unique and offers a great endgame grinding system that seems to be endless and i am having a lot of fun even though i reached the level cap with some of my characters. ----I see a bright future for this game. This is how Diablo 3 had to be as it was released. Grim Dawn is by far the best Indie game i ever played and i hope the developers keep this excellent quality throughout act 3.			"

Its as if someone took The walking dead,mad max married them for good measure and then tossed in some lovecraft and you would have this amazing title. Its a stark brutal world that feels alive. It looks stark.  also for those who like the idea of pvp in your action rpg it does support it as well. Well worth the early access coin. Amazing game.			"

Early Access Review
								Written with 80+ hours played and Build 26 Hotfix 3 of the Early Access.The Game is at the moment on Early Access so it's NOT finished but it has lots of content even on normal difficulty.At first you WON'T choose a class, its until level 2 when you choose your first class, and when reached lvl 10 you will be able to choose a second one.The game counts actually with 5 playable classes so simply do the math: 25 possible and DOABLE combinations (Many ARPG/RPG games don't have all classes doable, so if you became a class for farming / AoE you'll be unable to do certain bosses)PD: The devs confirmed they're working on a sixth class before the game is done. I'll leave the lore untill the game is complete but if you're interested on it, simply google it. So, you're on Devil's Crossing, an old prison transformed into a Zombie Apocalypse-like Camp. Lvl 1 and nearly naked. Let's talk about game mechanics. You'll find things called ""Components"" you can complete these components with same components to complete them and unlock some benefits with their completion. You can also rotate the view to find secret areas (There's some secret areas and breakable objects)The game includes a system which replenishes your HP if you're well fed (Very useful to save some potions).There's also FACTIONS you can level to get good rewards, but you can also ""level"" the enemy factions to get more enemy spawns, more hero enemy spawns or even Nemesis bosses to spawn.There's some other mechanics and things you'll discover by yourself. If you liked Diablo, Diablo 2 or even Titan Quest (The game its from the same creators) you should buy it. What are you waiting for?			"

												Insta-classic. Everything you want in a good-ole action RPG. Loot that inspires character development, violence and epic battles that will leave your heart hammering and yammering for MOAR, immersive story and setting including choice-and-consequences and faction/reputation based questing and acheivements, farming and crafting, character customization options that, with the addition of Devotion, includes plenty of theory-crafting. All of this will easily keep any fan of the genre glued to the game for weeks, months and even years.  If that aint enough, the soon-to-be-released Grim Dawn Toolkit to make your own modifications and/or adventures virtually ensures that the furious, frenzied fun, endless tales and deeds, and legendary status of the Grim Dawn Saga will continue for a very, very long time. ~			"

								By far one of the best action RPGs I've played in recent years, and one of the best early access products on steam. Nothing about this game is really revolutionary, it just does exactly what you want it to do and does it well. The setting is interesting, as this game seems to take place in some kind of steampunk world after it has been invaded by lovecraftian old gods, and humans struggle to survive against the tide of horrors. All the swords, guns and spells in this game feel extremely satisfying and impactful to use. That may not seem like its very important, but this kind of game just feels so much better when every hit comes with a nice big crunch.			"

												A very good ARPG in general and excellent successor to Titan Quest.It partially fixes my main gripe with Titan Quest - no random maps. I'm absolutely loathe Greece after replaying it so many times and I usually become bored before I reach Egypt. While maps in Grim Dawn also not random they have random roadblocks so it doesn't feel as repetitive.While I didn't complete it yet, I have about 75 hours of playtime (I levelled few characters till various ""ends"" when game was in Early Access) and I'm still enjoying it.And don't forget what it got proper mod tools about month ago, so it probably will have lengthy post release life.

												Grim Dawn is set in the war torn world of Cairn and is easily one of the best arpgs I have seen in years having been developed by Crate Entertainment an indie company formed with some of the talented devs of Titan Quest. Crate was able to gain rights to the Titan Quest engine and began developing Grim Dawn which in my opinion is a worthy successor. While Grim Dawn does take inspiration from fan favorites such as the diablo series Torchlight series and Path of exile it introduces it's own unique ideas to these systems as well. Some of the things enjoy are.The Dual Class System: Having been developed by some of the people that worked on Titan Quest one of the core features that i really enjoyed about Titan Quest makes a welcome return here in the dual class system. Upon entering the game you can create a Male or Female classless hero at level 2 you will have the ability to pick one of 6 class trees.SolderDemolitionistshamanarchanistnightbladeoccultistyou can further flesh out your class at level 10 by combining a second of these trees. This combined with all the items that grant skills and augments to skills makes for some deep customization options which is one of the things i enjoy about rpgs in general. The devotion system: while it is apparent that this system takes inspiration from Path of exile's massive skill tree the devotion system in Grim Dawn is quite unique in that you have to go exploring throughout the would to find shrines which need to be cleansed. once cleansed you will gain devotion points which can be spent in a constellation map to augment your skills.Open world: Cairn  is a huge open world providing hours of fun content to delve into quests some with consequences /lore/Factions/Bounties/Dungeons there is allot to do in Grim Dawn and Crate have already confirmed they will be adding more content updates and full expansionsComponent system: The component system works similar to the gem socket system present in other games in the genre. The difference here is that instead of having  gems and socketable items Grim Dawn has different components that can be added to any tier of item. Some of these components can really improve your build by having skills tied to them. For example I have a character that has a lodestone socketed into my offhand this item grants a lightning nova skill and to take that even further I have tied the lightning nova skill from the lodestone to the scorpion sting ability in the devotion system which adds an aoe poison to the lightning nova.There are tons of components for every gear type and you can combine these components to make more powerful ones. While I do enjoy this system it is not without it's flaws the biggest one being that if i want to modify or remove an item from a piece of gear I can do that  by way of the Inventor's apprentice however you can only keep one or the other the component item or the piece of gear. This can make the decision to salvage quite difficult if both items provide significant additions to a build.  The Loot: Loot in Grim Dawn like other titles comes in different tier types Common/Magic/Rare/Epic and Legendary. What makes the loot different from other arpgs is the fact that like the component system some items can augment existing skills even after you have maxed them out on the skill tree or like the lodestone mentioned in the component section some loot can have specific skills tied to the item. This really makes for a unique customization experience.The Inventory system: While the inventory system is in many ways no different any other arpg out there there are a few things that are worth mentioning about the system in Grim Dawn such as quests that give bag upgrades for rewards a button that automatically combines components and my personal favorite and something that everyone has been asking for in several games of the genre. an AUTO SORT BUTTON!!! for those of us who hate playing inventory tetris. The stash system is also really well done as it has a character specific tab and an item transfer tab. The item transfer area can be upgraded to have more tabs within it as well so there really is no shortage of space.Questing and Lore: Quests in Grim Dawn come in many forms. Some quests unlock vendors and crafting abilities some have choices and consequences. For example maybe there are 2 warring factions in the game if you choose to help one you will become enemies with the other. These kinds of choices make for a rich questing experience. while exploring the world you will find tons of pages and notes on the areas that you are exploring I have always been a fan of finding lore in these types of games and there is no shortage of that here.Crafting: Crafting in Grim Dawn borrows some of the ideas from Diablo 3's artisan system they have blueprints that you can find through out the world to increase the list of items available to craft. You can craft components and potions to give you extra damage or resistance fore specific monster type as well but the thing that stands out to me is the ability to craft relics these relics like other loot in the game can ultimately change your play style for example you might have a character such as the demolitionist that uses pistols but can't dual wield them no problem you can craft the gunslingers talisman equip it and you have your ability to dual wield pistols.Factions: While exploring the world of Cairn you will encounter different factions and settlements that will have their own set of bounties and quests for you to do. These factions have quartermasters which are merchants that sell items specific to that faction depending on how high your friendly reputation is with them. As stated before in the quest section some factions are at war with each other so helping one faction may and in come cases will in definitely either damage or completely ruin your reputation with certain factions. If your reputation gets significantly low with a faction they will spawn more elites and nemesis monsters to hunt you down. This in my opinion makes for a very engaging exploration experience.Single/Multiplayer modes with server browser: Grim Dawn features the ability to play your characters in both single and multiplayer modes. the multi player is easy to use the host options are quite good due to the fact that you can host a game for up to 4 players and because the game features a server browser rather than an account based system the player hosting the game  can easily customize the number of players allowed in the server weather there is instanced loot and even put a password on servers so that only friends can join this is somthing i wish all games like this had.The Cons: While I really Enjoy Grim Dawn I do have one minor complaint. I wold love for there to be more voice acting especially since there is literally tons of lore notes in the game and being a person that has some visual difficulties reading a whole bunch of text does tend to put allot of strain on my eyes so having audio to listen to is a big help but I also understand that they are an indie team and are only able to work with that they have and this grype aside they have made a fantastic rpg.Final Verdict: If your looking for a new action rpg title to dig into Than Grim Dawn will not disappoint. It has something for new comers and old veterans of the genre alike. It is a great value and well worth the asking price and i highly recommend this so i am going to give Grim Dawn a 9 out of 10.

												I have to run, but want to make a quick review. Grim Dawn was constantly updated and now its complete.It can be played solo and online with up to 4 people. Simple to host and join the game, no need to portforward or be a wizard to get it to work, if you got a new rooter/pc etc.It even got LAN. (so it's a bonus for quality LAN or Tunngle/Hamachi people)Solid options menu.Dark atmosphere, addicting combat, impactfull feel of it, big world map filled with adventure, quests, bounties, secret areas and chests, high-end-game areas, enemy heroes and a couple of factions to join and reap rewards. Challenging dungeons that need a key crafted and close once you pass inside.Crafting and Recipe system.The Good1. Multi class. Combine two classes to get the maximum pleasure.2. Gear can have skills and even if not, you can insert gems that add skills. Wide build possibility.3. Find shrines on the map that grant you acess to Constelations - In short: augment yourself even more, you can add different constelation skills on top of the ones you have. It's glorious.4. MinMaxers dream/horror, Mastery skills and Atributes can't be respec'd, but the Skills learned can. Use grimcalc (search it up) - for an ease to plan your build beforehand.5. Factions with Bounty/Rep system , giving quests, faction specific augments for gear and gear itself. The more the enemy faction despises you, the heavier guys you will encounter.6. Some quests, do have some minor (and hilarious, in a dark way) consequences.7. Explore large locations, void, basements, dungeons and secrets to discover. Hand crafted, but the route can differ as roads/ways can be obstructed. Gives that bit of variety.8. Things like camera pan, display loot by rarity, body count (if your pc can handle it) etc. small things are there to tweek. ... and more, but I want to keep it short.The BadNo glitches found myself. Got a medium-high end PC and a fresh Rooter. No magic needed to play for me or find servers, players.The UglyThe highly detailed world, day and night cycle (light radius, feeling of ambush), weather, the desperation and death all around you.All the enemy factions. This abominations are realy asking for it. Tombs of our ancestors desecrated,Blood and guts, limbs fly, acid spills and chaotic/aetherial fire burns what's left of once proud human civilization.It is truly a Grim Dawn.			"

								I've been playing since the early Alpha came out, and I absolutely love this game. It's grown up, matured, gotten more polished and balanced and added loads of glorious loot and side quests. It's got the addictive qualities of Titan Quest with its own unique setting and feel, the combat is super satisfying, and it slowly escalates in difficulty now quite perfectly. The story is fairly forgettable and generic, but that isn't why I would play it anyway.People who enjoyed Titan Quest or even Diablo-style ARPGs in general will find a lot to like here -- give it a try!

								Absolutely amazing game to play with friends. I've been a huge fan of ARPGs since I was an 8 year old playing Diablo I/II, and this game is by far my favorite of the genre. If you, like many other people, thought Diablo II was superior to Diablo III in every way, this is the game for you. Grim dawn feels more like a spiritual successor to Diablo II, and this is due to the continuation of mature themes, dark environments, engaging co-op experience, unique character builds, fun pvp, non-linear difficulty scaling, and EPIC LOOT that made Diablo II great. By comparison, Diablo III feels like it was made for bed wetters by Disney. It also goes without saying that if you were a fan of Titan Quest, this will be your favorite ARPG ever made. Worth mentioning, there is another promising ARPG called ""Lost Ark,"" which looks like it could give Grim Dawn a run for its money, but it's being developed by Koreans and its Western release date is still TBA. I will endeavor to update my review upon the release of Lost Ark, and perhaps upon the release of Grim Dawn's future expansion.			"

Do yourself a long waited favour and buy Grim Dawn, it deserves every cent and second of your money and time you'll spend on it.First review on steam for me, I just felt compelled to do it this time, because the devs deserve all the praise they can get.Great support and interaction with the community through 6 long years of development have brought fort an amazing arpg that makes you wonder which is the AAA title and which the indie when compared to other °more well known° rivals.It's been in an extremely polished and enjoyable state since the very beginning of its early access, and you could see the ambition to make it the best game it could be when more and more people were added to the development team, along with more features, more content and more polish to both new and old areas as they released them.This game has all you could have ever wanted from a true sequel of diablo 2 and more.- Huge, I mean huge, and beautiful hand made world, where every single little thing has been maniacally placed to make it feel as real and atmosphearic as it can be. You will feel overwhelmed by the complexity of some passages, the different possible routes, the many secrets and facultative content to be found. And good luck finding some of them, because they are well hidden.All of that without completely giving up on randomization, taking advantage of a system that changes which routes are blocked and which are not with every playthrough, keeping the game fresh, letting you enjoy even more the level design, something I feel that can make or destroy a game, and in most other games nowadays, is extremely linear.- No more shallow items that give a couple flat bonuses only. The game is full of items that grant the user interesting abilities that you can even build your character around some, but the good news is that you start finding those way earlier than other games that make you wait for the °end game°. In grim dawn it feels like °end game° all the time.There's also a nice crafting system, allowing you to collect recipes for items, consumables, and augments for existing items (those can also grant skills!)- Extremely interesting character system that allows for a lot of customization between dual classing, stats, class skills, devotion system (think of it as an additional tier of talents with prerequisites that force you to plan ahead on how to unlock them, and the amazing thing is: you get the devotion points by cleansing shrines, and sometimes you can find those shrines in secret ares, which further encourage exploration and attention to details) and much more.- The quests and faction system is a nice change of pace from being forced to do things the same way all the time. Now you can make your choices in some of those, and experience the difference yourself (for istance, having or not a new vendor in town if you saved/spared him). Obviously don't expect to find hundreds of those, it's still an arpg/dungeon crawler, not a pure rpg.- The combat is fun and visceral. The impact of the skills and the controls are just right, and all of the things I listed above, including the complexity of the levels and characters gives it a very nice feel and pace. This is not a RACE to destroy everything in the shortest amount of time like Diablo 3. You can try, but you will never feel the NEED for it in order to progress, and it overall juist feel better.Along with the classic three difficulty level, there is also a °veteran° option to start the game a bit harder and unforgiving than the traditional normal.Also during the game you can find some Roguelike dungeons that can definitely put to the test your character and your abilities.The devs are committed to give it a long support, with a survival mode and expansion pack already announced, as well as being very fast at fixing bugs and applying balance passes.The only thing you might not like are some animations of the character, which look a little stiff, but seriously, it's a great huge game made by a team of about ten people, most of whom joined only when the project was already half done.This is a game that can give you hundreds and hundreds of hours of great fun, for the price of less than half of many AAA titles that sometimes offer about 10 hours of shallow gameplay.Still reading this? Just buy it already, you can always thank me later.			"

Frequent updates.. smooth gameplay, steady fps.. good atmosphere... good build costumization...All it lacks atm.. is a better multiplayer format with an overall improved and implemented General, Trade chat etc.. and then the game would be 11/10... for now it'll have to be 10/10.

												Only have a little time invested in it so far but I can tell this is gonna be my new RPG. it plays like D2 and feels like a Buldar's Gate adventure. Huge maps, an insane amount of items, skills, and spells are going to be what brings people back. This is a wonderfully crafted ARPG and I couldnt recommend it more. Yes, it has a few things to work out still (the multiplayer is buggy and the server list doesnt even work, to the best of my knowledge.) but it's deffinately worth your time and money.Gotta play more / 10EDIT #1: lobby finder is up and running. +1EDIT #2: OK. so now I've put a few more hours in and its absolutly amazing. i feel like there could be more to it, but that's what EXPANSIONS are for. Between the constant little tweaks and  how active Crate is in the community, this game has a bright future on Steam, and hopefully your Games Library.9.9/10 still hoping for a Random Dungeon Generator / Boss Rush / Endless mode. The game doesn't NEED them, but it would certianly help with the life of the gameEDIT #3: They added Endless mode. 10/10 Fingerguns			"

												It is difficult to describe a good game in this genre, as usually Arpgs are defined for the ""feeling"" or the ""experience"" you get while playing. Most will say the graphics are good or bad according to their rigs, some will mention the music, some the ambience, some others will even mention the dialogues, and most will talk about the loot.I will say the whole experience feels organic; it is perhaps more dark than Path of Exile, but it doesn't feel with a weird pace. It is as smooth as Torchlight II, but far from the cartoonish feeling. It does not feel as large as Titan Quest, and yet I have not able to advance very deep into it. If you had a chance to play the undisputed best of this genre, Diablo II, and crave for a close experience, this is as close you can get, so far. If you have no clue of these games I am mentioning, or you are new to the genre, go ahead and buy it. It is solid overall.			"

												Grim Dawn is quite an enjoyable game, if you like ARPGs in general you will most likely find this game loads of fun, being a spiritual successor to Titan Quest. The game performs well on low end computers, and is quite beautiful in more detailed graphical settings. Plenty of lore to delve into, and loads of items to find, ways to build your character, and with difficulty settings that can be truly challenging.Definitely recommended.			"

												Really enjoying this game overall.  I would definitely recommend it to any A-RPG or HnS lover.  Pros: CoOp is AMAZING.  Very easy to use via steam, and satisfying to tear it up with friends Gameplay is a lot of fun, different take on stats/skills is refreshing A lot of diversity with character development Great story Rocket Ships*Cons: If you don't like to fully explore the map as you go, you will fall behind on level.  Not a con for me, but some may not like this I bought it a few days before ""release"" and the price dropped Not all my friends have computers*Just kidding... no rocket ships "

								I've been playing since the early Alpha came out, and I absolutely love this game. It's grown up, matured, gotten more polished and balanced and added loads of glorious loot and side quests. It's got the addictive qualities of Titan Quest with its own unique setting and feel, the combat is super satisfying, and it slowly escalates in difficulty now quite perfectly. The story is fairly forgettable and generic, but that isn't why I would play it anyway.People who enjoyed Titan Quest or even Diablo-style ARPGs in general will find a lot to like here -- give it a try!

								Absolutely amazing game to play with friends. I've been a huge fan of ARPGs since I was an 8 year old playing Diablo I/II, and this game is by far my favorite of the genre. If you, like many other people, thought Diablo II was superior to Diablo III in every way, this is the game for you. Grim dawn feels more like a spiritual successor to Diablo II, and this is due to the continuation of mature themes, dark environments, engaging co-op experience, unique character builds, fun pvp, non-linear difficulty scaling, and EPIC LOOT that made Diablo II great. By comparison, Diablo III feels like it was made for bed wetters by Disney. It also goes without saying that if you were a fan of Titan Quest, this will be your favorite ARPG ever made. Worth mentioning, there is another promising ARPG called ""Lost Ark,"" which looks like it could give Grim Dawn a run for its money, but it's being developed by Koreans and its Western release date is still TBA. I will endeavor to update my review upon the release of Lost Ark, and perhaps upon the release of Grim Dawn's future expansion.			"

												Pros:+ Game rewards you for exploring and customising character instead of punishing+ Well done GUI, random generation, recipes, and tools for smooth leveling or looting+ Good variety of monsters and enemy tactics (No endless recolored enemies)+ Just the right amount of plot, atmosphere, and expositionCons:- Graphics may not always be appealing and some mild frame stutter- Heavy randomness mean that your character WILL die and WILL miss its attacksIf you want a solid action RPG that just flows without being too superficial, this is probably the best I've played in five years.  A bit deeper than Torchlight but much better gameplay than other RPGs with a large variety of build options, you should be able to enjoy multiple playthroughs.			"

												If you like Diablo 2 LOD  madly  and if you  don`t like Diablo 3 so much that you haven`t even bought and the Path of Exile seems very difficult for you in this case  the Grim Dawn is a good  option.In addition to good graphics and amazing gameplay you can feel  the  growing developer skill in comparison to the previous games of this company.At high difficult levels  this game is sometimes very hardcore and doesn't forgive mistakes.In my opinion  Grim Dawn is not bad arpg hack&slash  from the new games with isometric .In spite of  Grim Dawn does not overshadow  Diablo 2,  it can compete with  Diablo 3. ^^			"

Grim Dawn is probably the 1st game since patching became bigger than The Beatles to not have the gaming community up in arms about balence issues while still managing to have depth beyond the character sheet math.(This team deserves a lot of credit, I've had more fun shooting & torching zeds in Grim Dawn than any FPS to date!)- Updated after 60hrs -			"

It's expansion, Immortal Throne (2007) shored up many of the game's weak points and cemented it's place near the top of the heap in the action-RPG genre.Say what you will about other games since, there are positives and negatives with all of them, but almost a decade after the original TQ launch we FINALLY have a worthy contender.Created by former members of the Titan Quest team, running on the (modified) Titan Quest engine, this game feels like what many WANTED from Diablo 3.  (To be fair, while D3 launched as a mess and has since been turned into a quite enjoyable experience, it is still very far from perfect.)So, let's take a look at Grim Dawn:Fun and enjoyable combat?  Check.Grim (had to) setting?  CheckOnline co-op?  CheckOffline Singleplayer?  CheckOfficially supported modding?  CheckController support?  CheckIntricate skill system with stat points to allocate?  Tons of shiny loot?  Well-crafted world?  Great art direction?  Impressive music and ambient sounds?  GREAT GAME??  CHECK!!! "

												Really enjoying this game overall.  I would definitely recommend it to any A-RPG or HnS lover.  Pros: CoOp is AMAZING.  Very easy to use via steam, and satisfying to tear it up with friends Gameplay is a lot of fun, different take on stats/skills is refreshing A lot of diversity with character development Great story Rocket Ships*Cons: If you don't like to fully explore the map as you go, you will fall behind on level.  Not a con for me, but some may not like this I bought it a few days before ""release"" and the price dropped Not all my friends have computers*Just kidding... no rocket ships "

								I've been playing since the early Alpha came out, and I absolutely love this game. It's grown up, matured, gotten more polished and balanced and added loads of glorious loot and side quests. It's got the addictive qualities of Titan Quest with its own unique setting and feel, the combat is super satisfying, and it slowly escalates in difficulty now quite perfectly. The story is fairly forgettable and generic, but that isn't why I would play it anyway.People who enjoyed Titan Quest or even Diablo-style ARPGs in general will find a lot to like here -- give it a try!

								Absolutely amazing game to play with friends. I've been a huge fan of ARPGs since I was an 8 year old playing Diablo I/II, and this game is by far my favorite of the genre. If you, like many other people, thought Diablo II was superior to Diablo III in every way, this is the game for you. Grim dawn feels more like a spiritual successor to Diablo II, and this is due to the continuation of mature themes, dark environments, engaging co-op experience, unique character builds, fun pvp, non-linear difficulty scaling, and EPIC LOOT that made Diablo II great. By comparison, Diablo III feels like it was made for bed wetters by Disney. It also goes without saying that if you were a fan of Titan Quest, this will be your favorite ARPG ever made. Worth mentioning, there is another promising ARPG called ""Lost Ark,"" which looks like it could give Grim Dawn a run for its money, but it's being developed by Koreans and its Western release date is still TBA. I will endeavor to update my review upon the release of Lost Ark, and perhaps upon the release of Grim Dawn's future expansion.			"

												TL;DR: Liked Diablo2? Disappointed by sequels and clones that followed? Do yourself a long waited favour and buy Grim Dawn, it deserves every cent and second of your money and time you'll spend on it.First review on steam for me, I just felt compelled to do it this time, because the devs deserve all the praise they can get.Great support and interaction with the community through 6 long years of development have brought fort an amazing arpg that makes you wonder which is the AAA title and which the indie when compared to other °more well known° rivals.It's been in an extremely polished and enjoyable state since the very beginning of its early access, and you could see the ambition to make it the best game it could be when more and more people were added to the development team, along with more features, more content and more polish to both new and old areas as they released them.This game has all you could have ever wanted from a true sequel of diablo 2 and more.- Huge, I mean huge, and beautiful hand made world, where every single little thing has been maniacally placed to make it feel as real and atmosphearic as it can be. You will feel overwhelmed by the complexity of some passages, the different possible routes, the many secrets and facultative content to be found. And good luck finding some of them, because they are well hidden.All of that without completely giving up on randomization, taking advantage of a system that changes which routes are blocked and which are not with every playthrough, keeping the game fresh, letting you enjoy even more the level design, something I feel that can make or destroy a game, and in most other games nowadays, is extremely linear.- No more shallow items that give a couple flat bonuses only. The game is full of items that grant the user interesting abilities that you can even build your character around some, but the good news is that you start finding those way earlier than other games that make you wait for the °end game°. In grim dawn it feels like °end game° all the time.There's also a nice crafting system, allowing you to collect recipes for items, consumables, and augments for existing items (those can also grant skills!)- Extremely interesting character system that allows for a lot of customization between dual classing, stats, class skills, devotion system (think of it as an additional tier of talents with prerequisites that force you to plan ahead on how to unlock them, and the amazing thing is: you get the devotion points by cleansing shrines, and sometimes you can find those shrines in secret ares, which further encourage exploration and attention to details) and much more.- The quests and faction system is a nice change of pace from being forced to do things the same way all the time. Now you can make your choices in some of those, and experience the difference yourself (for istance, having or not a new vendor in town if you saved/spared him). Obviously don't expect to find hundreds of those, it's still an arpg/dungeon crawler, not a pure rpg.- The combat is fun and visceral. The impact of the skills and the controls are just right, and all of the things I listed above, including the complexity of the levels and characters gives it a very nice feel and pace. This is not a RACE to destroy everything in the shortest amount of time like Diablo 3. You can try, but you will never feel the NEED for it in order to progress, and it overall juist feel better.Along with the classic three difficulty level, there is also a °veteran° option to start the game a bit harder and unforgiving than the traditional normal.Also during the game you can find some Roguelike dungeons that can definitely put to the test your character and your abilities.The devs are committed to give it a long support, with a survival mode and expansion pack already announced, as well as being very fast at fixing bugs and applying balance passes.The only thing you might not like are some animations of the character, which look a little stiff, but seriously, it's a great huge game made by a team of about ten people, most of whom joined only when the project was already half done.This is a game that can give you hundreds and hundreds of hours of great fun, for the price of less than half of many AAA titles that sometimes offer about 10 hours of shallow gameplay.Still reading this? Just buy it already, you can always thank me later.			"

												Only have a little time invested in it so far but I can tell this is gonna be my new RPG. it plays like D2 and feels like a Buldar's Gate adventure. Huge maps, an insane amount of items, skills, and spells are going to be what brings people back. This is a wonderfully crafted ARPG and I couldnt recommend it more. Yes, it has a few things to work out still (the multiplayer is buggy and the server list doesnt even work, to the best of my knowledge.) but it's deffinately worth your time and money.Gotta play more / 10EDIT #1: lobby finder is up and running. +1EDIT #2: OK. so now I've put a few more hours in and its absolutly amazing. i feel like there could be more to it, but that's what EXPANSIONS are for. Between the constant little tweaks and  how active Crate is in the community, this game has a bright future on Steam, and hopefully your Games Library.9.9/10 still hoping for a Random Dungeon Generator / Boss Rush / Endless mode. The game doesn't NEED them, but it would certianly help with the life of the gameEDIT #3: They added Endless mode. 10/10 Fingerguns			"

												It is difficult to describe a good game in this genre, as usually Arpgs are defined for the ""feeling"" or the ""experience"" you get while playing. Most will say the graphics are good or bad according to their rigs, some will mention the music, some the ambience, some others will even mention the dialogues, and most will talk about the loot.I will say the whole experience feels organic; it is perhaps more dark than Path of Exile, but it doesn't feel with a weird pace. It is as smooth as Torchlight II, but far from the cartoonish feeling. It does not feel as large as Titan Quest, and yet I have not able to advance very deep into it. If you had a chance to play the undisputed best of this genre, Diablo II, and crave for a close experience, this is as close you can get, so far. If you have no clue of these games I am mentioning, or you are new to the genre, go ahead and buy it. It is solid overall.			"

												If you like Diablo 2 LOD  madly  and if you  don`t like Diablo 3 so much that you haven`t even bought and the Path of Exile seems very difficult for you in this case  the Grim Dawn is a good  option.In addition to good graphics and amazing gameplay you can feel  the  growing developer skill in comparison to the previous games of this company.At high difficult levels  this game is sometimes very hardcore and doesn't forgive mistakes.In my opinion  Grim Dawn is not bad arpg hack&slash  from the new games with isometric .In spite of  Grim Dawn does not overshadow  Diablo 2,  it can compete with  Diablo 3. ^^			"

								**Early Access, bear this in mind!**Okay with that nonsense out of the way, Grim Dawn is the post apocalyptic stepchild of the fantastic Titan Quest/Immortal Throne. A lot of the same gameplay mechanics are in place and the small developer team are constantly adding new content and making adjustments based on feedback. If you like ARPGs and especially if you enjoyed TQIT I'd definitely recommend Grim Dawn. Not going to go into too much detail about it as I honeslty haven't had the time to spend with that I'd like over the last few months, just know that as with any early access titles there will be build that might break some aspect of the game and features are added and dropped as they work on polishing it. I paid $30 for this not long after release and for the discounted price I can't recommend it enough. Enjoy.			"

								In the grim, dark, grim darkness of Grim Dawn, you will slaughter enemies in their hundreds and thousands with chainaxes and semi-automatic muskets until you get eaten by a boss monster. If that sounds negative, it isn't. The folks behind Grim Dawn also produced Titan Quest almost a decade ago- anybody who plays both of them will see obvious parallels, right down to individual powers and skills- and know exactly what they want to offer. This is a straightforward hack'n'slash: you see something moving that isn't you, you click on it and hit hotkeys (and occasionally run away until you can drink another health potion) until the critter dies in a spray of bloody gibs, then you rinse and repeat. The formula's as old as the original Diablo, but Grim Dawn provides enough character-building options that it feels fresh. Monsters are fairly straightforward- you've got slow melee, fast melee, shooters, shooters with some area effect, some immobilization, boss versions of each type, etc. They're mixed together enough to provide some interesting tactical challenges. What else? As mentioned above, the setting employs copious amounts of Grimdark(TM): 19th Century weaponry made out of junkyard materials, armour alternatively borrowed from The Road Warrior and a Victorian costume shop, abandoned and burnt-out buildings, spiky axes made for a steampunk serial killer, you get the idea. Goes well with the gameplay. Buy it and kill stuff, or don't buy it and don't kill stuff (unless you're playing another game that also entails killing stuff.)			"

								************ EDITED REVIEW *************Alright so since I last reviewed this game I spoke about the similarities between this game and its counter part. Titan Quest. These two games are very similar however Grim Dawn has taken what was a great concept in Titan Quest and made it even better. There are 6 Classes to play now. All can be combined with each other to give you a unique playing experience that fits your profile. Would it be nice if there were a few more masteries? Sure. But right now the game in my eyes is perfect.Grim Dawn has a great story so I wont include any spoilers. One of the few games that I really enjoy playing that gives you the ability to make decisions on who to save, or who to kill. These decisions can either help you if you help them or it can hurt you.Factions. Just like in many RPG games there are factions. Good ones, and bad ones. In Grim Dawn Reputation Factions are of major importance as they provide you with decent high level gear, and Augments that can enchant your gear with various additional damage types or resistances. Act Three was recently released a few months back and I have to say just like Act 1 and Act 2. Act 3 is really good, and it keeps me on the edge of my seat waiting for them to release Act 4 and hopefully the rest of the game. Ive owned Grim Dawn for a little over a year now and I have to tell you, Everyday I have played this game I get addicted more and more.Do I recommend this game? You bet your♥♥♥♥♥I do. If you want a damn good game where you can get lost for hours and even more with friends. Buy it. What are you waiting for Cupcake, hit that buy button and enjoy the epic experience that is Grim Dawn.			"

								Grim Dawn is effectively a grimmer, darker, dawn-ier version of Titan Quest by the same team. As action RPG's go, it feels slightly dated as a consequence; they're using the same engine, after all. It's still not finished, but it still adheres to the potion-munching style of its indirect predecessor, a type of hack'n'slash I don't really care for personally. It's pretty difficult. If that's your thing, either go for it if you can handle the unfinished story, or wait it out until the game's done. 3/5			"

								If you liked titan quest and also enjoy post apoc styled games this one is a must.  TL;DR Good buy for the price especially for dungeon crawl rpg lovers.Pros1: High amount of item slots on your character (even a rune stone slot and a badge slot!)2: Large skill point system, think titan quest for how skill progression is3: Music is nice, helps set a mood without being overly loud or blaring4: Combat is easy to get into, but at the same time bosses can be tough5: Decent graphics and able to play on high and medium end computers6:Not that expnsive or the content you're buying, and frequent updates and patching7:Skill retraining (for a in game currency fee) to help in case you need a mulligan on skills you've chosen.8:A lovely selection of attainable loot that you can equip into your items to give a boost, and unlike Titan Quest you can put them in epic tier loot!cons1:Dialog with npc's is unvoiced and easily forgetable2:Not much lore wise to help you understand the world, lands, factions, and history starting off.3:Combat may be easy to get into, but it can be a bit stale using the same few moves over and over (esp when focusing on leveling one ability and min/maxing others)4:The few times I have heard voices so far in game it has been very sub par.5:Not many ""secret"" areas to find, would be interesting to see this expanded.6:Patrolling the Mojave Desert almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter  (sorry had to say it xD )7:In game money can be a pain to amass, maybe either make items sell higher, or iron coins drop more.8:Not a very good selection of epic leveld loot or set items, hopefully much much more will be addedAll in all I find this a fun game, sometimes might get stale but a little break and I can get right back into it.  Fun for a dungeon crawl, nice monster variety, decent skill variety, plus you can redo your skill points (though not attribute points) if you have enough ingame currency.  Has a nice setting, the mood of the game is a nice balance between post apoc rough and tough rust, and colorful nature.  Lots of items with randomized traits.  Hopefuly while adding to thegame, the makers add much more item variety with epic level loot and crafting items.  But I enjoy this game so much as a dungeon crawler rpg (one of my fav styled games)  and hopefully for rpg lovers out there you will enjoy this game too!			"

Early Access Review
								This is what an Arpg should be like. Played most of them incl Torchlight 2, Diablo 3, Sacred, Path of Exile and of course Titan quest. but this is probably the one i'm going to keep playing the most for years to come.at this point it's still early acces, but has tons of content. I'm 41 hours in on my first char and haven't even finished the content yet. It's got meaty combat, interesting skill trees and a very satisfying loot and crafting system. And it doesn't even have the legendaries and other systems in yet. It has a few bugs here and there and it really needs some optimization, but they already said they will work on that when the full release is near.I honestly feel bad for buying this game during a steamsale. Because its pricetag now is already very cheap for what you get. This small indie team deserves more.*small update after the latest patch which made the game content-complete as per 24/12/15*What can i say? They nailed it. For me this game is the perfect mix between Diablo 2 and Titan Quest. GD might start off a little slow, but if you really love arpg's you will make a click once the game opens up and shows you all it has to offer. It's really really good and i know i'll be playing this for years.*even smaller update""It's been officially launched now and they definately got the performance optimized a lot.Even on my semi-crappy GT 635M card it runs pretty well on medium settings.I still stand by my first comment that this is the arpg i have been waiting for. I'll be playing this for years. Most addictive stuff ever! No it doesn't have the nice animations and polish of Diablo 3, but every other system in the game is better than Diablo 3. And trust me, after 500 hours of Diablo 3, i know. I see some negative reviews expecting a Diablo 3 clone, please people, watch some playthroughs or reviews on youtube. This is more like an oldschool Arpg, Which doesn't mean it feels dated in any way. It doesn't... at all.			"

												First off, one of the Devs helped me fix an issue with launching, for which I say thanks.  If you have widescreen 2560 x 1080 Win 10 and had a problem like I did where it would launch into a half black screen, run the repair file in the game folder.  The game itself so far is sweet if you like this style of game...diablo, van helsing, etc.  What else can I say?  Good music, nice graphics and options.  Multi-class is cool...I got a shaman fighter.  Still trying out this game but really liking it so far.			"

								Grim Dawn stays true to the sacred mechanics of hack and slash, but adds weight and substance with an underlying theme of progress and survival within a dying world which set this appart from any of other hack-and-slash games I've played, and I enjoyed it more than even the classics available outside of Steam.The Hack and slash genre is one that has stuck to the same cornerstones of design since the days of Diablo, which arguably launched the genre. The fundamentals work well, and every couple of years a new title will come out and improve the concept a little. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing and The Bard's Tale added some character or a new atmosphere, FATE and Torchlight added in little new mechanics that bring more depth to the world, Path of Exile titles like DeathSpank and Borderlands thrived on ARPG elements, but kept their own style too. Then along comes Grim Dawn, which stays true to the holy mechanics of dungeon crawling; randomly generated loot, tons of enemies and enemy types, and a dark downbeat atmosphere, but adds enough to change the tried-and-tested ARPG elements and bolster them to a new level.HighlightsWhile doing those things well would have been enough, Grim Dawn has added to the fundamentals with a grim brooding atmosphere and overlying story where the last humans are trying to survive in a punishing and dying world, and it made me feel as though I, as a common nobody dragged to the hallows to die then set loose to make my way, was really having an impact on the environment and the people around me as I gathered resources and helped establish footholds and improve things for the better for myself and those around me. It's packed with tons of intrigue, lore, story and personality and they make the overall game as exciting and interesting as the gameplay itself.* Play time and content is huge. It's pretty difficult to run out of things to complete, and difficulty scales Mistakes* I've noticed input lag on a number of occasions, and there are plenty of reports of small performance issues* The graphics engine uses the same components as Titans Quest, which many people simply didn't like then and will not like now. It works well with the dark and desperate feel of the game, but for many this will be a sticking pointRecommendationsCurrently available for £18.99/22.99€/$24.99, Grim Dawn is fairly priced, especially considering its closest competitor, Diablo 3, weighs in at $39.99 and another $39.99 for the expansion. At the time of review, it's already been discounted to -50% a few times, which is plain and simple great value for money. Game time clocks in at around 40 hours+, with a ton of replay value, and being in Early Access, there's a planned Third Act releasing some time within a year which will add plenty more content. "

								I played Diablo 2 regularly back in the day, but some time later I found this Titan Quest game on the store shelf. I needed it, to the extent that I got a new video card and RAM for my old desktop just to run it. Ah, the 2000s were a fun time. I tried Diablo 2 and even 3 later on, but I had been spoiled. Creating a class instead of picking from a group, crafting items and Artifacts, Iron Lore has made a true RPG in a lovingly-crafted world. And finally, they got the chance to do it again.I had followed Grim Dawn before the Kickstarter, and I was very excited at what could be done. Admittedly, that anticipation can leave one disappointed, or blinded into mindlessly loving the product. I'm pleased with what Crate has done, evoking the spirit of Diablo while modernizing in the style of Titan Quest. Combat feels smooth and detailed, everything is already polished to big-budget quality. The visuals are inspiring, and the world feels believable in the characters and quest choices. The loot is varied with minimal junk. I need to get around and play it some more, but I figured the sale would be a good time to put up a review to help make a decision. I'd recommend the game if you are interested in a modern take on the genre that isn't focused on console support and failed auction houses.			"

												Grim Dawn, I never knew about this game until my brother persistently convinced me to try it. Reluctently I purchased the game and had little expectations when trying it out. My mind was blown away the first hour I played. Because of this, Grim Dawn has become my most played Steam game ever.Pros:- The story is well written and interesting to follow- Character Customization, the world is yours to be whatever you want to be- Item skills and Devotions (Not only do you get your typical 'class' skills, you can obtain even more from game items, relics, and devotions!- The game gives you that Diablo 2 feel- The developers are involved with the community, speak to the community through their forums and facebook page- Free content updates (who wouldn't love this)- Beautiful world- The game can be modded and the community have already released so many great ideasCons:- Character animations aren't the best, at times feel stiff- Not a lot of variety when it comes to story related bosses. There are plenty of Enemy Heroes to kill though- I enjoy the soundtrack, but some areas could use different music- Melee heavy builds, I've tried multiple 'specs', but I feel limited with magic caster decisions- There isn't exactly an 'endgame'. The game does support the idea of having more than one alternate character, but when you do hit max level and finish the game on Ultimate, you're pretty much done and should start a new character.This game has a bright future ahead of it, and the creators at Crate continue to deliver a promising series. My cons are personally opionated and I recommend trying this game for yourself, especially if you loved Diablo 2. I cannot wait to see more of what the community releases for game changes.			"

												Holy cow, this is one of the most fun games I've played in 2016! I'm really glad this game didn't get stuck in ""Early Access Development Cycle Hell"" and I gave it a chance. (see bottom of review for quick verdict, which is a solid recommendation)So I'll start off and say this game is clearly inspired by Titan Quest. As someone who liked what TQ was going for but had an abysmal experience with the game (feel free to check out my review), I was a bit hesitant on investing into this game. However I did some research and read up on some of the new mechanics and character classes, and since it was featured on a humble bundle, I figured I'll throw down the money. Also, I may compare a few aspects of GD to TQ, so just a heads up. As I begin playing the first hour of the game, I notice how, again, a lot of models and such look like TQ. Needless to say, that's not a bad thing. The models looked great! I picked my first class, leveled up, and in less than two hours I was high enough of a level to select a secondary class. This is where the character development begins. There's 6 classes, and you pick two of them, leading into 15 different combinations. You can invest as many points into each class as you like; they don't hinder each other if you want to go with one core mastery, and I found investing into both my classes (I picked Soldier + Nightblade, so I was a Blademaster) that they complimented each other almost flawlessly.Speaking of dual classes, yeah there are less than in TQ, but the game moves a lot quicker as if to promote replayability. By the time I finished the game 100% on the first difficulty in GD, I was level 48 and it only took ~20 hours. When I finished TQ 100% first difficulty, I was barely level 40 and it took me almost 50 hours. Why so long? In H&S games, I like to explore everything. You can find some unique locations or some nice cameos and especially getting tons of nice loot. Grim Dawn felt nothing but rewarding by exploring everywhere. I wouldn't go more than 10 minutes without finding a cave to enter or a side location to explore chock full of loot.Another level of character development unique to GD is the Devotion system where by clensing shrines (which is another reward in the exploration factor), you can select stars from constellations to buff up your character and even give you more skills. At first it was a bit intimidating to take everything in, but that brushed away quickly and I spent a lot of time planning how I was going to develop my character. That in itself is rewarding to find.Towards the midpoint of the game I even found items that would grant me new skills. This is cool; it adds yet another layer of character development and it makes finding loot more rewarding. Some of the socketed gems you put into your items do the same, as well as relics you craft and equip. Most of these skills complimented my build very well, and the ones that didn't would still have some purpose, if at least on another character. The only issue that I personally had with this is I began to find quite a few duplicates of these items and it would feel a little less rewarding. Needless to say, it wasn't frequent.Pros:Several levels of character development (dual classes, devotion point system, finding skills on items, socketing items with gems to give you more stats and skills).Exploration is heavily rewarding, and it lessens the amount of boredom.Game moves at a fairly quick pace, but still oozes with content and things to do.Lots of replayability potential, including more to do on the higher difficulties (which I plan on playing)Every skill I've used is really useful and doesn't have an obscene cooldown, unlike TQ.Neutral:The setting's been done numerous times before if you look at hack & slash games of recent times. I personally didn't mind it too much, but some people might be disappointed.Finding epic and legendary items is plentiful and rewarding, but I do feel there aren't as many diverse ones since I found a few duplicates. Could just be my luck.Cons:Can't think of any.The impression I got after finishing the first difficulty was that I was hooked and already wanted to play the higher difficulties. Grim Dawn takes the good stuff from Titan Quest, expands on it, and adds its own elements for a fun, fresh experience. I don't think I've had this much fun trying to plan and develop my character since I played Torchlight, and I haven't felt bored at all. Easy recommendation.			"

								Grim Dawn is, in my opinion, the best ""Diablo style"" hack n slash ARPG since the Diablo series. There have been many imitators but few have risen to the top. If you are looking for that original Diablo 2 feel, then look no further. The graphics are gorgeous, even at medium settings. If your system can max it out then you will be in for a real treat! GD has been in early access for quite a while, but that has resulted in a high amount of depth and polish. In addition to the standard features of the genre, you also get factions, crafting and a recently implemented devotion system. If you liked Titan Quest or its expansion Immortal Throne, then you will immediately be at home with GD. As mentioned above, if you crave that old school Diablo experience but in a modern package, then I recommend you buy this game.			"

												As an avid fan of the ARPG genre, Grim Dawn gets a very glowing recommendation from me. What sets it apart from other games in the same genre is the amount of freedom and customization you have in regards to your character. The skill trees, like in Titan Quest, offer a lot of skills and ways to customize said skills. You put points into the tree and unlock different tiers of powers. Additionally, at level 10 you can pick a second skill tree which opens things up even more. If that wasn't enough, you find shrines throughout the game you can give offerings to in order to cleanse it. Once that's done, you can put a point into one of a TON of different constellations under what's called the ""devotion"" panel. They offer different bonuses to even further enhance your character. Other than that, it's an ARPG. There's not much more to be said. The thing is, Crate Entertainment got it absolutely right. It's a wonderfully fun, lengthy romp in a beautifully desecrated land. I love this game and hope others will feel the same way about it. An absolute blast!			"

 The Diablo competitor you whished for!Grim dawn is basically the sequel of the nice Titan Quest. Which wasn't so successful.They’re using the same engine as in Titan fall and the world is hand made. They add content every few months and add stuff like two hand weapons you missed for in Titan Quest.You can choose between four classes. Later you can add a second class, resulting in a new class. You can make a cool mix of skills. But if you want to keep it classy, you also can combine a warrior with a rogue, resulting in a heavy battleship, raging through the lines.The setting is really dark and doesn't change that much. It can be depressing over the time to run every time the same themed cave or village. The maps are big and not random generated. So you don't have different results in different runs.The combat system is classic hack & slay. You beat monsters, use skills and drink some pots to heal you. The classes are good balanced in my opinion and the story is okay. The graphics are a little bit outdated but fit the dark theme of the game.If you're looking for a classic hack & slay but get sick of Diablo 3, here you go.8/10 "

												This game is what I've been waiting years for.  This is the true successor to Diablo 2, from the creators of Titan Quest (which was THE game that everyone in the ARPG scene played after D2) that will bring the nostalgic feels right back like chills up your spine, and for new gamers will provide an excellent immersive and beautiful intro to the Action RPG genre.  This is hands down my game of 2016 - and deserves a community of likeminded fans to support it.  You WONT REGRET this purchase.  It is near perfection and I haven't seen it's equal in over a decade.

								This game seems really interesting. I have played about an hour so far and its pretty good. I dont know if I would say $30 good. More like $20 good. It has a dark asthetic and more of a difficult gameplay than say torchlight or D III. There have been some comparisions to D2. I dont know if I would say that yet, but its good. The text is very hard to read however.			"

												So far in its early stage it is the most promising of all the recent Diablo clones. Hard to believe this game is being created by such a small team. If you loved Titan Quest you will love this game. HIghly recommended. Great post launch support!!!			"

								While the game's content has yet to be fully fleshed out, the core gameplay is intact and visceral.  Grim Dawn comes into an ARPG market dominated mainly by Diablo 3 and Path of Exile, but offers an experience notable different from its competitors.For those that remember and love Titan Quest, the gameplay of Grim Dawn is both nostalgic and improved.  If you've never tried TQ (you should) GD offers a unique experience for an ARPG.  Character progression revolves around gear, which drops often, stats (simple but varied) and a set of talent trees based on classes.  You may choose two classes, and therefore gain access to two trees, each with varied but coherent abilities and passives to allow a diverse range of powerful characters.  If you enjoy trying out different builds just to see how they work, Grim Dawn can offer you a lot of replayability.GD has no private servers, and at this point doesn't even have multiplayer implemented.  The idea, though, is that Crate wants its players to mod the game as they please.  While this does allow for ""cheating,"" in a game with no ladder boards, no action house and no intent for an economy, it feels perfect.  Grim Dawn isn't about grinding out the best loot, being the first to kill X boss, or the fastest, or whatever. Grim Dawn is about killing monsters, exploration, character building and just all around fun.If that's what you're looking for, you should give Grim Dawn a try.			"

												If you liked Diablo II but not Diablo III that much you would love this. Enviornments are nicely varied as well as monsters. Loot is good and play mechanics seem solid. Story is just average. There seem to be lack of epic fights. The graphics is just ok. Just for Gameplay and half the price of AAA titles this is a great buy.			"

								Honestly, the best dungeon crawler / hack n slash I've played in a long, long time. Personally, I'd even place Grim Dawn above Diablo II and Torchlight II, though I would say that those three are the best in general. Extreme value, I've just started and am around 30 play hours already!			"

Early Access Review
								This review is for those enjoying the old school isometric hack and slash games such as Diablo 1, 2, Titan Quest as well as Dungeon Siege 2. In my opinion this game, called Grim Dawn, will be among those epic games should they keep up the way they're doing things right now.The reason I find this a gem comes from the confidence in Arthur Bruno as lead designer to lead his team in the right direction. It is clear he loved playing the Diablo 1 and 2 games and learned making these games at Iron Lore with TitanQuest. The way he talks about game design and the ideas he has only makes me hope that there will be enough resources available to make it all happen.The environments are really grim and atmospheric. In D3 there was a lot of gore and brutal depictions of corpses with their entrails hanging out, but due to the comic book color scheme it never really came across the way it should. And that is what Grim Dawn does really well. Fog moving across the marshes, ambient sounds in dark caverns, zombies clawing their way out of the dirt behind you for an ambush and cutting of escape routes. There is a lot of attention to detail as well to convey the correct feel of the world you move in.Some quests in Act 2 are relatively short and simple, but they still manage to invoke an emotional response. They fit in so well with the setting that it is believable for such situations to occur. After mentioning the D2 experience of act 1 where there is a lectern leading you to a ruined keep. At the bottom there is the vampire queen... One of the upcoming dungeons delivered that same feeling. This game really takes the best elements and adds its own interpretation of it.The mastery setup comes from Titan Quest. It isn't your typical skill tree and allows to combine skills from multiple classes to create your own play style. Of course some skills need to be adjusted or entirely replaced, but the basics are there. I'm glad the masteries aren't filled with passives like Torchlight 1 and 2 which greatly reduced the fun of playing due to lack of active involvement. I'm also happy that you need to unlock skills and be stuck with your decisions. Sure you can respec, but it isn't meant to re-build your entire character. A system like that from D3 is horrible and reduces the fun of replaying and building new builds.On top of that making decisions actually leads to set repercussions. You might not want to invite some NPC's you meet in the wild to move into Devil's Crossing. Something similar like Fallout might happen that you go back and the entire Vault and your family is dead due to that decision. Although its not that intense (yet) in Grim Dawn. There are other decisions with consequences like helping refugees or finding what happens to that little village. Or Direni that gives you the key to Depraved Sanctuary...or you kill him. Both with future consequences into Act 2. Which is quite refreshing to see these days. Especially since many games tend to cater to as large a group of people as possible. And they complain about wanting to make meaningful decisions, but not deal with consequences and being ""locked out"" of some content. Which means re-playability if you enjoy the rest of the game and want to try different decisions.The items in general are quite interesting as well. Green and Blue are not automatically better for your character then a Yellow item. Pieces have their own stats as well as possible additional skills like summoning a Hell Hound, Revenant or Harbinger and other things that can proc. You can adjust your items by adding components found on your journey. Components that can stack 3 or 4 times and give additional skills and bonus stats upon completion. That adds even more customizing to your gameplay, play style and character build. Soon we're going to get a crafting system which also has an element of gambling added into the mix. There you can use components found to create pieces of armor and tonics with specific effects according to crafting blueprints you can find.Enemies are quite diverse and challenging as well. Those skeleton Revenants, Deadbolt Archers and priests look amazing. Same for the zombies in act 1 which come in diverse forms with their own strengths and weaknesses. And what about human opponents using the same skills that you as a player have access to. Encountering them might even inspire some to try out a build incorporating the same skills as those opponents. The battles are balanced not around a single unit, but the entire group of opponents. Enemies move slightly faster then the player character which invokes a bit slower combat then most games in this genre. This may seem odd to most, but it actually creates more tactical and skill based battles. You can't just rush in and start whacking away all the time. If you're ""unlucky"" with the random monster spawns it might be the case of a small area being infested with 2 hero Reanimators, a corruption that summons zombies, and the rest of cold ones and mutants thrown in the mix. At those times tactical movement and picking your battles to clear the room is needed.Graphics wise people might complain it isn't cutting edge, but that isn't odd seeing the older engine from Ironlore that is being used. However that doesn't mean the game looks bad. Quite the opposite actually. In my opinion it looks perfect with quality models. Looks way better then D3 and also beats the bulky disfigured models of PoE. Animations are good as well and are only lacking in the rare places. Those places you don't really notice due to the fast pace of going from one battle to the next.There are so few bad things in this game that I don't even know which ones to mention. The only downsides people can note is the scale of UI, fact that the game can drop in FPS, occasional clipping here and there and the main title screen not having enough crips and detail. Can we really call these deal breakers during an alpha? A development stage where such elements are there for practical reasons, placeholders as you will. These will be dealt with once we get near the actual release and the game will be optimized and cleaned up. For now those elements are not high on the priority list which is understandable for an alpha.Crate listens to feed back. Heck they even re-build Act 2 due to the complaints from us playtesters. Even now they're working really hard to make it even better and better as we speak/type. With adjustments being made to previous areas while working on new content. Like many I've played a lot. 40-50hours with an illegal copy around Build 10-13. After that bought a copy at build 15 on Steam and am around 90hours. That is a total of 140 hours for just the alpha. Not many games can boast that amount.			"

												VERY EARLY INTO EARLY ACCESS============================It's pretty amazing how this small 7 person studio is capable of creating such a great looking and fun game, and it's not even done yet!Even for an early access game, I find it pretty polished and haven't seen any bugs as of yet, with 12hrs in or so.  If you like games like Diablo, Torchlight, Path of Exiles, and so on you'll have no problems loving this game.I'm still playing my initial playthrough as a warrior type, and find the combat to be pretty sraight forward, the different mobs including unique named monsters and bosses, drop the varied color coded quality loot you find in all games of this type,  with some good itemization and stats overall, especially for set collections.  I can't wait to see the full game at release, because right now it's already a very nice and fun game.MID-POINT INTO EARLY ACCESS...March 17th, 2015 Update============================So, it's 1 year later and...The game development is progressing very nicely I find, and the content keeps coming with more class options, quests, mobs, and loot that progresses the storylines along.  I'm still amazed at how well this small studio is able to put out a game that easily rivals bigger competitors in the same genre.  This holds up great to the games I mentioned earlier and is well worth getting just for the first 3 acts to date!  It's got loads of stuff to kill and loot already and could easily have been released as is.  Then bring out DLCs, season pass, and Grim Dawn II for the rest of the upcoming content.  Thank God they're not going that route!  Keep it up!!PS. I DESPISE Steam's Early Access now.  3 out 4 E.A. titles I bought into are now dead, defunc, or eternal 'we're working on it, be patient' mode.This is the only title that came through so far for me, and it alone might vindicate the Early Access program for me.RELEASE VERSION UDPATE...December 20th, 2016========================What can I say about the release version?I can say that Crate has more than surpassed my expectations for an Early Access title (the only one personally).  At no time throughout the development did I feel like the progress was slow or problematic, since they really kept up with content updates.As each Act was released, we were guided through another chapter of the storyline with new areas, friendly/unfriendly NPCs, quests, and of course new 'monsters' for us to dispose of to secure humanity's future in this grim, dark, apocalyptic world that is Cairn.With a fair number of character development choices, like leveling basic stats, adding class skills for pure or dual-class builds, faction choices with conseqences, and endless tiered possible gear choices from loot drops, buying from general and faction merchants, player trading, or crafting your own thanks to bluepring recipe drops and purchases.To reach the current level cap of 85, you'll need to playthrough from normal(veteran option),  elite, and ultimate difficulties.  You can also level up in The Crucible, which is a DLC addition which compares to other survival Arenas.  Can obtain some very nice gear early on (I go in at Lvl.2) and  throught to max level.  Big plus is the ability to obtain Devotion points after completing your first 10 waves of combatants.  Turn in your earned Crucible money to buy a devotion point at level 8, which is the level you'll be after just doing 10 waves.A really exciting and challenging feature associated to your infamy rating with certain factions, is the unlocking of more heroes, more swarms of monsters, and ultimately the faction's Nemesis boss, who will hunt you down for having maxed your infamy with them.There are so many other details that I would love to share about the game, but it's probably better to leave it to you.  Buy this game if you loved Titan Quest (same dev) and love Diablo-like games.  You'll discover all the things I mentioned and more about the game, and why it's such a great game to surely become a Classic of the genre.Huge thanks Crate!			"

								From the makers of Titanquest, Grim Dawn is the real Hack 'n Slash deal to get asap ! Bigger and better than TQ, with tons of new stuff and great graphics / effects. This is what Craplo 3 had to be since the beginning ( the funny thing is that Craplo copied Titanquest storyline - released in the 2006 / 2007 - even the final boss fight / arena + dialogs )Multiclass, epic fights, awesome blood & gore, customizable camera ( you can even rotate it ), super loot, factions and more stuff that will be added while the game is being developed !I reccomend you to play this game when it will be fully released, because of the epicness ( also if you don't want to spoil storyline and zones to explore ) !Would♥♥♥♥♥♥on Craplo again. 10 / 10			"

								Grim Dawn is an awesome ARPG (action role-playing game) developed by some of the makers of Titan Quest. If you enjoy other games from the genre, such as Diablo II, Torchlight (2) or Path of Exile, it is definitely worth checking out.Update: At the time of my first review, the game sometimes crashed when attempting to use portals to and from town, and failed to render the ground every now and then. These issues have been fixed! Although still ""Early Access"" the game is very polished feeling/looking, and the Devs listen to the players!Much like Titan Quest, your character's class is not chosen at creation, but instead determined by picking one, or two, skill mastery trees (at level 2 and 10 respectively). This creates a large amount of diversity and customization when it comes to ability combinations and character buiding. No matter what path I have chosen thus far, it has made for an interesting and rewarding experience.TLDR: This game stands to be everything I wanted from Diablo III and failed to receive.			"

								Grim Dawn is a good old Hack 'n' Slash game. If you liked Titans Quest and/or Diablo 2 this game will be to your like.So far the game is fun and the item farming is just like in Diablo 2 and/or Titans Quest, not like in Diablo 3. So if you need a good Hack 'n' Slash game buy this or put it on your wishlist.EDIT: When the mulityplayer come it will be even better and the uniq items you can forge has made it even better.EDIT 2.0: The game has now gone to a new hight and are truly worth the price. You can really kill some hours in this game just faming for some better gear.			"

												Simply put this game has, imo, the best single player experience of any modern Diablo style ARPG available. Is it better than classics such as D2 or Titan Quest? The improved graphics are nice. Looks great on Ultrawide monitors. Probably looks great to the 16:9 peasantry too. I think the skill/devotion system it has is a definite upgrade. The faction system is relatively basic but adds another positive element to the game. Replayability wise it lacks a bit compared to D2 but is better than Titan Quest. Note: I never messed with mods in Titan Quest so they may change the comparison somewhat.From a value perspective it is well priced for what you get. I pretty easily put in 100 hours. Just now am I finding it tiresome to go do loot runs. If this game has a negative it is the multiplayer. If multiplayer is your thing I would suggest looking to Diablo 3 or Path of Exile. No dedicated servers or anti-cheat makes playing multiplayer with randoms pointless. That said, the multiplayer should work fine for playing with people you know.			"

												At first I thought that this game was another ripoff of Diablo, the style and even progression but to my surprise, it really wasn't. The game starts off a bit shaky to be honest, character progression is rather slow and even till you get your bearings around the maps and how the game actually works, takes some time. Although if you put the effort to actually play through it, it gets exceedingly gratifying. The class combos are awesome, the weapons are cool and the map, is well huge. There is plenty to do within the game and even when you're done exploring a new combo of a class, you feel the urge to create a new one. Personally the only drawback for me was the lack of quest marking. I get that you need to explore to find the quest (it shows up on the map once you get close to it), but it is rather tedious, especially in the first few hours of the game. Other than that though, the game is absolutely awesome!! I would recommend to anyone!			"

Although I'm not big on the Victorian era setting, I love the dark and gritty art style. I also love that the devs included controller support! I have been waiting so long for a worthy succesor to Diablo 2, and now I finally have it! Crate really nailed the old school type of gameplay and what made Diablo 1/2, Titan Quest, etc... so much fun! If you like ARPGs, you'll love Grim Dawn! Buy now! I cannot recommend this game enough to fans of iso arpgs. I have played them all and I must say Grim Dawn is already becoming my favortite of the genre and overall one of my favorite games!			"

								If your using a 64 Bit OS and liked Titans Quest pick this up, its a classic. 32 Bit users may have to do some troubleshooting with regards to a crash that may occur after about 20 to 30 minutes of playing. I have gotten my game to a steady 1.5 plus hours with video settings on low for everything. It is still early access so your mileage may vary but with anything in early access you cant expect perfection. If or when its complete then we can begin to hold it to a higher standard sure.It plays like Titans quest, Diablo 3, Van Helsing and a little like Torchlight. Shift to shoot without moving, stuff like that. Its very good at what it does and offers up a lot of fun with dual classes. You can be a solider who also dabbles in the occult, maybe you want to be a puritan in which case you can just not choose a second class. The loot is varied with many stats, some I dont even know what they do yet, vitality damage? uhm ok sure, why not...heheIf you do jump in just remember its not complete yet, you may need to take a shoe and smack it a few times before it comes in clear.

TL;DRTitan Quest set in a grim steampunk world. While it may be rough around the edges, I highly recommend it to every ARPG fan!+ Multiclassing (up to two)+ Build variety and replayability+ Sweet loot+ Myriad of side quests+ Factions+ Devotion skill tree+ Interesting setting and lore+ Ambience+ Soundtrack- No Rogue class equivalent- Rather cheap and spongy bosses- Minor stability and optimisation issuesREVIEWGrim Dawn is an ARPG developed by Crate Entertainment, a studio founded by Iron Lore veterans. It is built on the Titan Quest engine so if you have played TQ before, you will immediately notice some striking similarities between the two titles.A few words about the setting: the world is on the brink of apocalypse – demons roam the land, resources are scarce*, and humanity is divided as ever. To make matters worse, cultists (mad as the proverbial hatter) are fighting for power. The game begins with the protagonist being possesed by an aetherial spirit. The survivors hang him/her but the spirit leaves the body just in time and the survivors decide to set the hero free. Should one be more interested in digging deeper into the story, there are many well-written documents to be found on the journey.The gameplay revolves around eviscerating thousands of monsters, collecting loot, and completing quests. The usual. The tools of destruction include swords, axes, maces, rifles, pistols, and crossbows (similar to Torchlight). However, there are a few elements which make the game stand out from the crowd. First of all, after reaching level 10, the player gets to choose a second mastery. There are six masteries: Arcanist, Demolitionist, Nightblade, Occultist, Shaman, and Soldier. What is interesting is that they are well thought-out and every class is viable, even if they lack synergy at the first glance. Moreover, every mastery supports a variety of playstyles and can be effective with both ranged and melee weapons. Secondly, there is a devotion skill tree which provide yet another layer of customisation. In order to get devotion points, one has to restore the shrines scattered around the world. My only complaint about classes is that there is no Rogue equivalent. Overall, the class system is very fluid and one can spent a lot of time tweaking their very own build.Another unique element is the introduction of friendly and enemy factions. Gaining reputation with friends give the player access to faction-exclusive gear and bounties (side quests that can be farmed indefinitely) while becoming more hated by the enemies results in tougher spawns and, eventually, a possibility to fight a Nemesis monster (in other words, a BAMF). While most factions are inherently either friendly or enemy, the player will get to choose their allies.While the graphics may not be the game's strongest suit, the surroundings seem to be well done. Grim Dawn also features a glorious Diablo-esque soundtrack which enhances the ambience. The voice acting is mediocre at best but, to be fair, this is not a deal breaker in a game like this. Speaking of shortcomings, the game has some minor performance and stability issues. Gameplay-wise, I find the design of some boss enemies cheap and annoying, rather than challenging but fair. They are kind of like high school jocks – tough in groups (and they always stick together), not much of a threat otherwise. Nevertheless, any enemy can be defeated with a proper application of skill, a decent equipment, and build.In conclusion, Grim Dawn is a marvellous title that can provide dozens of hours of great entertainment. While it is rough around the edges, the game lives up to the hype in my opinion. I highly recommend it to anyone that is not allergic to the ARPG genre.*The currency in Grim Dawn are iron bits.

Early Access Review
								I've played this game for a bit in my free time at work and I think I've summed up a good idea of how this game is now and where it is headed. This game ""is a passion project by a small team of experienced developers"" and it shows in many ways. There are a lot of fine details that you wouldn't expect and a lot of overall design that shows that they have their vision and are following it quite well.Some examples: The Art direction is fantastic. The character models are well designed, albeit very limited, in that all players look the same currently with only the armor and weapons distinguishing them. This shows they wanted to spend their important resources on great looking armor and weapons, but that they may not have the time to implament individual models which is a great trade off.The combat is mostly balanced with a lot of small changes expected before release. Some skills feel underpowered or clunky while others shine brilliantly. The skill I'm thinking most of is the skill where your soldier charges to an enemy. I love the concept, but the execution of it bugs out and sometimes I'll permenantly run into a wall twitching out. Although trying the demolitionist gave me a complete 180 and the skills feel great and mesh well together. Although some builds are more viable due to the lack of support gear designed to allow a greater range of builds. Most resistances on Armor are pretty useless as there aren't enough enemies with strong types of damage to worry about covering your resistances especially Chaos damage. Only damage type I've had annoyances with were Cold, Poison and Bleeding.Pets feel underpowered to me, although I haven't taken Pets up to max level range at this time and tried a full pet build. I can't imagine them clearing swaths of enemies like my Bullets can or my Passive arc attacks on Soldier. Will change/update if I get the opportunity to test them more thoroughly.The game runs fairly smooth, but at this time it feels like it drags. In time I expect optimization of the game to bring a smooth experience to a wider range of computers. I'm running a i7 4700 and GTX 765M and I have a hard time keeping a smooth frame rate in larger crowds. Although I get similar performance on my on die GPU so it shows that not only will the game potentially run fantastic on more modest computers, I expect with some time they will have a premium experience on nicer hardware.The town upgrading feels very underdeveloped currently. I'd love to see it flesh out considerably and would love to see the rift sitting in town work double to allow access to the Aetherial Realm and possibly a Chaos Realm giving it more purpose than a quick hub to dump stuff and grab a few quests. Monsters feel varied enough, although it feels kind of off. I wish some monsters would have more mechanics than ""RUN AND HIT"" or ""RUN AND SHOOT"". I like some of the goblin type monsters who can heal and the summoner type who raise mobs to swarm you. I'd love to see the beasts who shoot you from range unleash a thorns effect if you get close causing you damage for being close or to see the zombies get up a second time occasionally. Although I'm happy, that would be a fine touch that would definitely go a long way to making the world feel more fleshed out. The Lore is great, but I want more. The universe is fantastic. Overall I feel this game is a solid 7/10 right now for being early access. It's very fun, worth every penny they ask for and definitely a promising game with a bright (Grim) future. Looking forward to seeing some truly devious things come from these developers. "

												true addiction ...Just try it yourself and once you know a bit about the game there will be a lots of build idears you can come up with.It starts of quite simple with 6 classes of wich you can choose two, thats the so called dualclass system, then there is the devotion system wich adds even more build diversity and ofcause there are builds around specific items.The world of Grim Dawn is hand crafted wich is why you can find a lot of secrets whilest exploring the area.Grim Dawn has a lot of interesting mechanics wich work pretty well together, the start may be comlicated but the more you play the more fun the game is.But there are definitly some things that are not perfect, for example the perfomance in some situations.But all I can say is that I highly recommend the game for everyone that likes Hack and Slash games such as Titan Quest or Diablo.

												For an eairly access game this game has alot of content to keep you busy and I love that! It plays alot like the Diablo games but with better customization and if you ask me more intresting loot. The story is good and the atmosphere is dark and grim which give the feel how Diablo 1 and 2 would give before Diablo 3 went with the more colorfull art direction. It is tottaly worth the price they ask for but if you can catch it on sale I highly reccemond buying this game expecially if you like ARPG.[Update]I've been playing this game since it was in eairly access and im still playing it. I still find this game more satasifing to play than diabl3 which is still a good game but i find this game has more to offer and the replay is good with all of the different build you can creat and i love the diverse item that this game offers.

												At first I thought that this game was another ripoff of Diablo, the style and even progression but to my surprise, it really wasn't. The game starts off a bit shaky to be honest, character progression is rather slow and even till you get your bearings around the maps and how the game actually works, takes some time. Although if you put the effort to actually play through it, it gets exceedingly gratifying. The class combos are awesome, the weapons are cool and the map, is well huge. There is plenty to do within the game and even when you're done exploring a new combo of a class, you feel the urge to create a new one. Personally the only drawback for me was the lack of quest marking. I get that you need to explore to find the quest (it shows up on the map once you get close to it), but it is rather tedious, especially in the first few hours of the game. Other than that though, the game is absolutely awesome!! I would recommend to anyone!			"

I like this story much better, and the range of character development is vast...reminds me of the Elder Scrolls style, you can play this game anyway you want to - as long as you kill things that want to kill you first!Highly recommended!

TL;DRTitan Quest set in a grim steampunk world. While it may be rough around the edges, I highly recommend it to every ARPG fan!+ Multiclassing (up to two)+ Build variety and replayability+ Sweet loot+ Myriad of side quests+ Factions+ Devotion skill tree+ Interesting setting and lore+ Ambience+ Soundtrack- No Rogue class equivalent- Rather cheap and spongy bosses- Minor stability and optimisation issuesREVIEWGrim Dawn is an ARPG developed by Crate Entertainment, a studio founded by Iron Lore veterans. It is built on the Titan Quest engine so if you have played TQ before, you will immediately notice some striking similarities between the two titles.A few words about the setting: the world is on the brink of apocalypse – demons roam the land, resources are scarce*, and humanity is divided as ever. To make matters worse, cultists (mad as the proverbial hatter) are fighting for power. The game begins with the protagonist being possesed by an aetherial spirit. The survivors hang him/her but the spirit leaves the body just in time and the survivors decide to set the hero free. Should one be more interested in digging deeper into the story, there are many well-written documents to be found on the journey.The gameplay revolves around eviscerating thousands of monsters, collecting loot, and completing quests. The usual. The tools of destruction include swords, axes, maces, rifles, pistols, and crossbows (similar to Torchlight). However, there are a few elements which make the game stand out from the crowd. First of all, after reaching level 10, the player gets to choose a second mastery. There are six masteries: Arcanist, Demolitionist, Nightblade, Occultist, Shaman, and Soldier. What is interesting is that they are well thought-out and every class is viable, even if they lack synergy at the first glance. Moreover, every mastery supports a variety of playstyles and can be effective with both ranged and melee weapons. Secondly, there is a devotion skill tree which provide yet another layer of customisation. In order to get devotion points, one has to restore the shrines scattered around the world. My only complaint about classes is that there is no Rogue equivalent. Overall, the class system is very fluid and one can spent a lot of time tweaking their very own build.Another unique element is the introduction of friendly and enemy factions. Gaining reputation with friends give the player access to faction-exclusive gear and bounties (side quests that can be farmed indefinitely) while becoming more hated by the enemies results in tougher spawns and, eventually, a possibility to fight a Nemesis monster (in other words, a BAMF). While most factions are inherently either friendly or enemy, the player will get to choose their allies.While the graphics may not be the game's strongest suit, the surroundings seem to be well done. Grim Dawn also features a glorious Diablo-esque soundtrack which enhances the ambience. The voice acting is mediocre at best but, to be fair, this is not a deal breaker in a game like this. Speaking of shortcomings, the game has some minor performance and stability issues. Gameplay-wise, I find the design of some boss enemies cheap and annoying, rather than challenging but fair.

												Thought I would update my review now that I'm 300 hours in. Still my favorite game along with rocket league. The combat in this game is so crisp and good, hard to explain without trying it out yourself. Lots of customizability with build variation. Amazing. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this....for me, its on the same level as the legendary Diablo 2. They are a little different as D2 focuses more on multiplayer/trading, but those two are my favortie games all time.			"

								So far i'm loving it. I do have concerns about multiplayer though. I feel in this day in age games have to have a strong multiplayer (this is just my opinion) and so far from what i've seen crate doesnt plan on doing a whole lot with this. End game so far seems to be lacking aside from steps of torment runs. (Leaderboards, gearscores, something of that nature would do wonders) Can't wait for PvP, Mods, and survival mode though!!! Don't get it twisted, despite my concerns, if you're an ARPG/hack and slash/dungeon crawler fan you need to do yourself the justice of buying this game. Get it while it's in early access too so that you get all of the features as some will have to be purchased seperately @ release!			"

								Reinstalled last week.Was surprised how the game changed from a good Titan Quest clone to a completely different and solid ARPG.With the introduction of Devotion system , multiplayer support and the completion of the rest of the remaining Acts , Grim Dawn earned a place in my top Hack&Slash games (and trust me ,  i played msost of them).Crate did an outstanding job polishing the game , it's running very well on my old crappy pc without any sort of rubberbanding but the icing on the cake was with the introduction of voice acting and the intro cinematic that took me back to the old Diablo series.Good job Crate , you made me cry a little.

The story is there, but you'll have to mostly read it from dropped pages found while out exploring the environment. If you've already played Diablo, Torchlight, and Path of Exile, you know exactly what to expect from this game. A classic ARPG through and through.			"

Posted: March 25, 2016
												Yet another game that i would like to press ""Mixed"" instead of a yes or no recommendation. Grim Dawn still has a ways to go before i would consider it a must play. It has qualities that lead you to believe the creators kind of ran out of steam half of the way through the story and map creation process. Meaning they probably had a lot more idea's for what they wanted to do yet they didn't have time or resources to make it happen. The maps for one are big, and I mean big not really in a good way more like content filling. They snake around and are barred off at almost every juncture. Its actually quite frustrating to clear them honestly. Where they could have put a hole in a stone fence to save you from walking 100 yards they instead made the fence bigger, or put a stone barricade to force you to go around. Dungeons are few and far between and are usually comprised  snaking passagways or repetitive floors.  The story is basically non-existent. I've beaten this game 3 times now and really don't have a clue what was going on besides a demonic invasion. You get lore items to help but they are usually filled with extremely long paragraphs you probably wouldn't want to read. As far as character creation, gear, skills, its average really. After building a couple characters you will find yourself wishing they added more classes. And in the end regardless of what class you build or what stats you put in, the success of your character is still going to be dependant on the gear you got. Its just up to you if you want to farm and grind through oversized maps and repeditive dungeons to get it towards the end of harder modes.The game itself doesn't seem to be optimized very well. Crashes for me are not just game crashes but desktop freezes. Meaning my whole computer will lock if the game becomes unresponsive and i will be forced to manually restart. Getting disconnected from multiplayer servers randomly are not uncommon, and screen shuttering / low fps are also issues i've noticed.Still though I don't want to completely harp on this game. The creature creation, map atmosphere, and music are great don't get me wrong i could write 5 more paragraphs about the good, but it's a tough tough task nowadays to make a great one of these types of games to stand up to the classics of the past.My overall take of Grim Dawn is its a slight revive of Diablo 2 with a lot of Titan Quest sprinkled in, though lacking the big production value of both those games. Is it worth playing? Maybe, if you are seasoned with D2 and Titan Quest then yes do play this, its good just to see what a new take looks like. But if you've never played top down arpgs' or are kinda on the fence about them I would probably look somewhere else.			"

								A really nice surprise!Been playing this since EA and watched it mature into a really great game. It is quite addictive and makes you want to play just a little longer, just until the next level up, just until the next dungeon is completed, just one more quest...then I'll stop...honest. You can tell this game was made with a great feel and pedigree for the genre, which of course Crate has with Titan Quest.It has some very nice mechanics, especially the way you can dual class, it has lots of hidden little dungeons dotted around the sprawling landscape, that add a nice bit of variety to the overland questing area. The shrine reclamation, to add more points to help customise your character a little bit further and the loot!Seriously, the loot is great, even if you dont get something you want for one character, it makes you start planning for further alternative characters for replaybility, so you can put the item in a shared stash for your other characters.All in all, a great game, you get alot of gaming for this price, great value indeed.

								better than I expect. Like a D3 player, Grim Dawn mix diablo with Skyrim, I say that because the points of Devotion. Practically I don't know nothing about the game, just eight hours in game, but I think this game is very challenging, for Hardcore players like me.I want to play in multiplayer, to find anothers players and better enjoy the game.

								Grim dawn has easily earned the top spot as my favorite ARPG. It has great atmosphere, story, and lore. There's true character customization with an amazing number of class and skill combinations, and the devotion system adds a whole other facet of character tweaking on top of that. The depth of stats and unique skills gives itemization far more possibilities than several other ARPGs I could name in which itemization is nothing more than finding the best in slot for your cookie-cutter build. Gameplay is smooth, and with the variety in enemy types and abilities, it is often quite tactical. The constitution system is reminiscent of D3's health globes--keeping you in the fight and not standing around to recuperate--but manages to not break immersion to do so.The few quibbles I have are not really worth mentioning and are completely overshined by how well all the ARPG systems have been built and interact as a whole. The devs are also very receptive to player feedback and have made fantastic additions and tweaks throughout the development process. I can only expect more of the same as they continue to improve the base game and work on the expansion. If you like ARPGs at all, this is an absolute must buy.			"

												A classic ARPG - it reminds me of Dungeon Siege and Titan Quest, but with nicer visuals. Combat isn't complex, but it is difficult - you don't get to make too many mistakes before you are dead. The loot and the crafting system strike a really nice balance between too easy and too hard. Good drops are more frequent and crafting is easier than in Path of Exile, but it's still hard enough to find the really good stuff that it feels meaningful when you do. I enjoyed the way the developers added on side areas that were roguelike dungeons, so you could alternated between those and the main areas where death had fewer consequences, depending on what sytle of gameplay you were in the mood for.

								If Titan Quest and Diablo 2 had a baby, you would have this game. Great combination of both games with a few new ideas like hidden quests, hidden books, secret caves, a bit of choice and consequence, bounties, and a ton of other stuff that I probably haven't found yet. Maps are quite large, but they are not randomized yet. Character classes are pretty much the same like any other ARPG, but with a fresh twist. There's also a few new classes, like the Demolionist. Playing that class now, so much fun  obliterating monsters with a Canister Bomb and dual wielded pistols. Graphics are Titan Quest quality, maybe a little better. Runs very smooth on my old dinosaur of a computer completely maxed.  The soundtrack is superb, SFX is good but the gunshots can get annoying fast. Physics will make you laugh out loud. Nothing like seeing a skeleton fly 100 feet into the air, parts flying everywhere haha. There are a few bugs, but none that are too annoying so far. MP runs well, there is some lag occcasionally. Sometimes the server will drop, but it's still not as bad as Diablo 2 was with that.  If you have played Titan Quest before, it's easy to pick up as it uses that engine. I think a new person to this genre could get into it  easily though. Game is 100% playable in it's current state, which is great as it's still Early Access. This is my second Early Access purchase and I'm very pleased.I can't wait to see what this game is going to become. It's already awesome. "

												Beta:I put 20hrs into the game during beta testing, despite constant character wipes. Now that the game has released:I put another 50 hours into it just trying to beat normal difficulty. Now sure I could have just skipped straight to the end... but then you miss the story and all the side quests and what makes Grim Dawn so fantastic! This is a beautiful game, with a lot of quality content to deliver.~PROS!~One of the best parts about the game is that the replayabiltity is also there, which isn't something I get from a lot of games anymore unfortunately. (i.e. Diablo 3 was terrible to re-play until the Rifts came out and Season Leagues, etc.; I haven't hardly touched Skyrim since I beat it either...)The ability to design your character however you'd like is also an amazing feature. The mass amounts of weapons and armor that you pickup through your journeys only allow you to customize your character that much the more by deciding if you want to focus on melee or ranged/magic combat, raining destruction upon your enemies or making a miniature army of pets, or even focusing on being a complete retaliation warden and letting everything kill itself why trying to kill you! You are practically only limited by your imagination... as well as the level cap and skill points you can earn obiously!~CONS!~One of the biggest things I (and my buddy) disliked about the game, is the map structure. You don't have a clue where anything is, and there is no real way of tracking your quest (or other POI) through it unless you just so happen to stumble close enough on the mini-map to see the golden star (or the POI icons.) Another feature that I wasn't so keen on was that during gameplay, little books/journal entries would drop on the ground. (This in it of itself wasn't a bad idea as they told some of the Lore that went into the game. Please keep reading to see the issue!) I played my first official playthough (since the live build released) with my buddy, and he would occasionally receive these entry pages that would grant him Lore Experience - yet I wouldn't receive the experience. Every so often this would happen, and we could never figure out why. Normally you wouldn't gain the experience if you already had the journal entry, but I have never played solo this far into the game (meaning I shouldn't have it,) so we don't know the issue with this.~RESULTS!~Sure I could have nit-picked a lot of things about this game, but this game is very much so perfect in its design. It has so much replayability with it, and it is a complete game all the way around. I would love to see more content added, new places to explore, higher levels to obtain, and so on and so forth... but this game is a complete package the way it is. It is definitely worth the $24.99 price despite some minor flaws, and you will definitely get your money (and time's worth) out of this masterpiece.~TL:DR!~Such GameMuch BeautifulVery ContentBuy!!!

												I'm an experienced player of Diablo II. I can tell you securelly: This game is incredible. For me, it is the best hack'n'slash I have played. Everything, EVERITHYNG, is very well done. I bought in a few days, and I don't stop to play. Was a time a game like this locked me.- Maps are incredible large. The world can be 8 times greater than Diablo II.- Class customization is incredible and awesome. You can use two classes and a sistem of Devotion than makes your character unique.- Large content. They are making DLCs, I hope they never stop.- Lore and ambient incredible.- Engine awesome. Corpses fly away and explouds on dust. Nice!- Rift system for mobility. Very smart.- You can use fire guns.- Factions and quartermaster system.This is what I discovered by myself from now. I'm playing more and more... If you are curious and like the game style, just buy and try it. You will not be desapointed.Note: 10/10. I will dye playing this game. Devs, give me content for a life, please.			"

This game does feel like it draws some insiprations from POE, but fighting is much cleaner and much more well told story. I like POE's writing but not the storytelling honestly. Nice world so far, easy to be immersed. I believe i'm still in act 1 but I've logged a lot hours just making different builds. I hear the devs plan to raise the cap from 40 to 75 on release. Not one you want to miss if you felt like D3 was a dissapointment and enjoy POE but want something a little different + pants.			"

								This game will be amazing. The dark feel, and  ""steampunkish"" style really satisfies. Currently playing level 22 Pyromencer, Ive been playing PoE for the last couple years off and on always keeping an eye on GD. I finally bought the game about a week ago, and have played about 22hrs since. Its I recomend this game in the state thats in and only expect more incredible polish and content from these guys. Edit: After finishing the content at around level 35, completing all currently available quests. This game is definately worth the cost, Crafting system is pretty unique, although it fills your inventory pretty quick, gameplay is fun and items/enemies are unique. I was playing a ranged character and always felt pretty on par with the content, yet still challenging. Support this game, Id love to see how this plays out  =)			"

								In short,  this is highly recommended and fun ARPG.  The music, the graphics and art style are fantastic.  You can get into the lore or just hack & slash.  Don't be cheap and wait for a sale on this one.  This is being developed by a tiny group of people whose lead bought the Titan Quest ""engine"" as a platform to base this game on.  I have been taking my time with this one since all the acts aren't out so I don't want it to end.  That said, there are plenty of side quests that I haven't even completed.  That said, yes, this game isn't ""done"" yet.  Although, there is still some balancing going on and new content coming, it feels like a finished game and so far, the updates haven't broken saves.  Well, that's about it.  For me, I love the art style, gameplay, music and the dark mood of the game.  As always, I'll put out updates as needed!			"

												Grim Dawn is a very appropriate name for this game, especially if you are a fan of the Diablo franchise.  Diablo 1 may not have been the first ARPG, but it certainly put the genre of tearing monsters apart until they explode in a shower of blood and shinny items on the map.  The game that made birthday pinatas a bit lack luster from there onwards.  While Diablo 1 was the promising toddler, Diablo 2 was the 12 year old son who won the science competiton nation wide.  Everything seemed to be going well.Then diablo 3 launched and it was like walking in on your teenage son dying his hair black, cutting his wrist, wearing eye liner, and wearing bandages like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sonic the hedgehog game.  What the ♥♥♥♥ happened, I knew I souldnt have let your creepy black sheep uncle to take you to disney world.  Back to the point, Grim Dawn is both grim in the game setting and grim because playing it is a constant exercise in ""what if"" when thinking of Diablo 3.  Suffice to say if you found Diablo 3s bright art style of smeared water paintings with lighting effects as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as possible for lower end PCs to run it rather diapointing, as well as its borderline incoherant story and a disjointed world forgettable despite over 100 hours played than you will be in for a nice suprise.Visually Grim Dawn made me think this is diablo 2 but with better graphics.  The game plays on this and it does a very good job for the disenchanted ARPG player.  The marshes, caves, ruined settlements, and bleak landscape of Act 1 bring back fond memories of the Rogue Encampment.  It makes the whole art petition response look silly in retrospec, along with Reaper of Souls going back on it as well.While the story and universe is not a high point it is practically shakespeare compared to Diablo 3.  The documents you find are well paced and some are pretty disturbing and depressing.  On top of that there are moments in the game where your decisions can have ramifications although the steam page does exagerate a bit.  The game is made from a combination of the creators of TitanFall and I believe a few people who worked on the origional Diablo.  TitanFall was a baffling game as Im assuming the publisher didnt understand that 50% of what makes these games enjoyable is watching monsters turn into pools of blood.  Opting to go for the teen rating and showing a complete ignorance to the genre.  I do have a beef with these guys on the part that Titan Falls expansion seemed to never get fixed.....That said it would seem the ugly practice was left behind in the world of Greek Mythology and didnt carry over to Cairne.  For people like myself who found Blizzards odd skill system or lack there of a skill system bewildering (something that would carry over to World of Warcraft) you will be happy to know that Grim Dawn has more stats than the guy who sits with a spread sheet at a baseball game taking notes on everything for some bizaare reason.  Perhaps reliving his desire to be an assistant coach in the dugout.  You have stun resistence, stun duration reduction, lightning damage, electricicty damage, fire damage, burn damage, piercing damage, vitality damage, and you get the point.The wonderful Titan Quest duel class system returns allowing players to mix different classes that seem odd but turn out very interesting.  What is nice is that there does not seem to be 1 spec for each of the class combinations.  My main is a Warder which is a combination of the soldier and shaman.  I focus on 2 handed weapons and lightning damage but there are 2 other viable paths I have read about.  I imagine the same is true for other combos.  Certain gear and the fairly elaborate addon system can be a huge part of your build.  One item I added to my axe gave me a lightning nova ability which was great for clearing large groups.  Lousy on its own but with all my + lightning skills and gear stats very effective.  There is also a faction system.  Getting higher rep means you can buy items from said faction and the more hated you are by enemy factions the more rare bosses that spawn.  Speaking of loot you wont have to farm for hours only to get items that look like a troll put them in the game.  Unfortunately with a small team does come its problems.  The framerate is all over the place depending on where you are with the beginning act being the worse offender.  Many enemies simply explode into blood and there are not as many unique death animations as you would get with a larger team.  The enemy variety is also limited compared to other games.  All of this just makes you wish these guys had more resources at their disposal.  Nothing is really game breaking.In summary I have not enjoyed a game in this genre so much since diablo 2.  Torchlight never really did it for me and you all know my opinion of diablo 3 at this point.  If anything I say resonates with you then this game will be a nice gem to add to your steam library.   "

Create a tower that randomly generates itself every 7 days. Make the tower have good side going up / evil side going down. Make the it 100 floors up and 100 floors down. Gamers will choose which direction they will head each week per account, every 5th floor have a mini  boss and tenth floor a big boss. This way once we beat the campaign we can continue to do something new each week with our avatars. Just a suggestion. Great game, highly recommend, and can definitely say its worth the money.			"

												I have been following Grim Dawn since before the Kickstarter, which launched on the 17th of April 2012. The game has seen many changes since then. We got the features they said we would plus more. There is real depth in the character customization with plenty of build options for all different play styles. Combine two of the currently available six classes to craft the character you want to play. Combine skills to create many synergies between any of the six. The Devotion system which was not something originally planned adds a really cool aspect of customization. Finding shrines in the world and restoring them grants points to devote to constellations with a huge variety of features; not just passive bonuses. Huge variety of gear in the way you would expect. In the true fashion of an ARPG you will find lots of bad gear. You will, however, find some gear you never want to get rid of, even though you eventually will. Some Rare, some Epic, and most Legendary gear will grant you new abilities to use; components, which you insert into gear, will allow you to double down on something or even out your weaknesses and some will grant you new abilities. The world has expanded immensely from what was originally planned. With additional acts and factions there is plenty more to do in the world of Cairn. Zones expanded and dungeons were added and every time it was very exciting. As more people joined Crate we got more art assets and the world really came to life. I can't say it all here but Crate Entertainment has created a masterpiece. I think will endure the same way the previous great ARPGs have. From a cult following to a game with many fans Grim Dawn has come a long way. Get out there and save humanity!			"

												Known as a spiritual successor of Titan Quest, Grim Dawn takes you through a dark land where corruption spread, and evil walks free. Each act has a scenario that defines it - mountains, ruined city, farmlands -, each very detailed and full of monstersSomething I find curious is that the classes are strong and match well. Choose two you like and see how one complements the other. Not only that, but you have a devotion system where you can choose stars that fill gaps on your build or make you even stronger/tankierThe dev team is communicative, and modding has just been added to the gameFor some reason, optimization is a bit lacking. The game runs well, but when there are many effects going on, you can expect your fps to drop (which doesn't happen in Diablo 3 or Path of Exile, for example)If you have your eyes on it, you won't regret playing this game			"

												For an eairly access game this game has alot of content to keep you busy and I love that! It plays alot like the Diablo games but with better customization and if you ask me more intresting loot. The story is good and the atmosphere is dark and grim which give the feel how Diablo 1 and 2 would give before Diablo 3 went with the more colorfull art direction. It is tottaly worth the price they ask for but if you can catch it on sale I highly reccemond buying this game expecially if you like ARPG.[Update]I've been playing this game since it was in eairly access and im still playing it. I still find this game more satasifing to play than diabl3 which is still a good game but i find this game has more to offer and the replay is good with all of the different build you can creat and i love the diverse item that this game offers.

								If you are a fan of games such as Diablo 2 or Titan Quest then Grim Dawn is the game for you. It's nothing special but it everything it does, it does well. Keep in mind that it is still early access and there are a few obvious bugs that you may come across but Crate (devs) have been very good so far with updating the game.			"

								So far a very solid hack & Slash. Lots of class possibilities, good quests, difficulty is okay. Could use a little polish, but that's what early access is for, right ?If you're a fan of loot piles and exploding monsters, this is totally worth checking into.			"

								If you were or are a fan of the Titan's Quest games Crate has done a great job of taking that interaction and skill system and dropping it onto a new world.A number of small improvements I've noticed and liked are as follows.1) Auto relic merging. 2) Active skills now level when you add points to them, without having to deactivate them and start them again!Things I wish were a bit better.1) It can be a bit hard to figure out where certain features like cave entrances are when looking on the map. Would be nice if after you found an interesting cave or spot it could be highlighted in some way on the map.2) A longer range for seeing things like merchants and other features on the map would be nice as well.3) I would have liked a bit more openness to the overland maps.4) I would like to see a few more side quests, or maybe not quests but Easter eggs, little spots where something interesting happens. And have it not always be a cave. Hint: More Mosquito island like locations.5) I'm spoiled and would have loved to have some voice-over dialogue. But it's not critical to the success of this game.Bugs. Overall very few for an Early Access game so far! 1) Mobs will sometimes end up in places I can't get to. The only way to kill them is via ranged attacks. I have had this happen a number of times now, and once with a boss mob, which made it super easy to dodge its magic attacks and just shoot it till dead. Small bonus item pickup seems to have pretty good range as I was able to still get all the loot that was dropped. Yay. So far all the mobs this has happened to were kill-able. I've yet to have it blocked by terrain etc.2) Minor interface bugs. Radio buttons in the menu's that glitch and don't become unlit the one option when you select another. And once a button that wasn't highlighting in the skills dialogue.3) I have had a few stuttering lag moments, which do not seem to be related to things like the number of mobs on the screen. Almost like the system works overtime when I'm in a big group fight and then hiccups after it's done. Or when transitioning between zones (areas of the map) not sure, they seem rather random, and definitely disproportionate to the evens on screen.OverallI'm enjoying the game. The pace seems fairly good. I love the skill system, it was and is my favourite part of the Titan's Quest series. I do worry about multiplayer being a little boring as there are a lot of choke points and areas where a single individual can funnel mobs for easy cleanup, so a group of players might find that even easier, unless the mob count goes way up. That said character progression seems to happen in line with the difficulty of the area you are moving into, or the mobs are scaling well. They are always within a level or two of my level as I'm advancing with bosses being a couple levels higher. In summation. If you like ARPG games and or are a fan of the style of the Titan's Quest games. This is wrapping up to be a fun game.O.			"

								TLDR; Great ARPG in the style of Diablo 2 and Titan Quest with dreary atmosphere, great music and hordes of enemies to kill and loot. 10/10 would mercilessly annihilate hordes of enemies again.If you love ARPG's like Diablo 3 and Torchlight but miss the gritty and brutal atmosphere of Diablo 2 then this game is something that should be on your radar. Fantastic atmosphere with unique classes and an interesting dual class leveling system. Combat feels responsive and solid. The character animations leave a bit to be desired but it is very easy to overlook this gripe with the shear amount of fun you are gonna have clicking on things to make them explode. It's not a bad looker either with strangely vibrant colors for such a dreary world. The story is what you'd expect from an ARPG like this. The world is being threatened by some overwhelming force and you are special in some way and must fight to save humanity from annihilation. It's nothing to write home about but it does its job of setting up the world in which you will be slaughtering endless masses of enemy scum with an array of abilities and weapons. The music is also a standout as it does a good job of fitting the overall atmosphere that the game is going for.			"

								If your using a 64 Bit OS and liked Titans Quest pick this up, its a classic. 32 Bit users may have to do some troubleshooting with regards to a crash that may occur after about 20 to 30 minutes of playing. I have gotten my game to a steady 1.5 plus hours with video settings on low for everything. It is still early access so your mileage may vary but with anything in early access you cant expect perfection. If or when its complete then we can begin to hold it to a higher standard sure.It plays like Titans quest, Diablo 3, Van Helsing and a little like Torchlight. Shift to shoot without moving, stuff like that. Its very good at what it does and offers up a lot of fun with dual classes. You can be a solider who also dabbles in the occult, maybe you want to be a puritan in which case you can just not choose a second class. The loot is varied with many stats, some I dont even know what they do yet, vitality damage? uhm ok sure, why not...heheIf you do jump in just remember its not complete yet, you may need to take a shoe and smack it a few times before it comes in clear.

If you've already played Diablo, Torchlight, and Path of Exile, you know exactly what to expect from this game. A classic ARPG through and through.			"

								A really nice surprise!Been playing this since EA and watched it mature into a really great game. It is quite addictive and makes you want to play just a little longer, just until the next level up, just until the next dungeon is completed, just one more quest...then I'll stop...honest. You can tell this game was made with a great feel and pedigree for the genre, which of course Crate has with Titan Quest.It has some very nice mechanics, especially the way you can dual class, it has lots of hidden little dungeons dotted around the sprawling landscape, that add a nice bit of variety to the overland questing area. The shrine reclamation, to add more points to help customise your character a little bit further and the loot!Seriously, the loot is great, even if you dont get something you want for one character, it makes you start planning for further alternative characters for replaybility, so you can put the item in a shared stash for your other characters.All in all, a great game, you get alot of gaming for this price, great value indeed.

								My Highest character is level 24 of and so far the game is solid. Nothing too new but a lot of little nuances that do make it stand apart from the obvious comparisons of D3 and POE. This game does feel like it draws some insiprations from POE, but fighting is much cleaner and much more well told story. I like POE's writing but not the storytelling honestly. Nice world so far, easy to be immersed. I believe i'm still in act 1 but I've logged a lot hours just making different builds. I hear the devs plan to raise the cap from 40 to 75 on release. Not one you want to miss if you felt like D3 was a dissapointment and enjoy POE but want something a little different + pants.			"

PROS:- lot of classes to choose- lot of loot- crafting system- all the nice features from the Titan Quest have been moved here- haven't seen a single bug so far (reached Act III at the moment of this review)- maybe one of the best graphic engines for ARPG of this type- constant upgrades- the fights are dynamic and bloody- excellent maps- live breathing world- dark and rich story and lot of lore (if you're interested in reading it)- Titan Quest 2.0CONS:- actually nothing in particular.- the normal difficulty is too easy but the veteran one gives the exact level of challenge i am expecting :) Overall this game is the perfect example of how a perfect product can be develiped with little budget but LOT OF PASSION.ANY EXPANSIONS TO EXPECT I HOPE :) ?

								The game is still in Early Access phase and already is the second on the list of games I spent most time playing. That speaks for itself. The similarity to Titan Quest is obvious and developers took every thing that made Titan Quest great and made it even better. Interesting lore? Check. Unique skill system? Check. Dark climate felt from the very beginning? Check. Foes dropping items they are equipped with? Check. With all that I have easily reached 100 hours of gameplay. And then they started adding more and more features. New classes, reputation system, devotion system, new areas and finally legendary items together with additional difficulty levels. From what I've heard the studio is small and I'm shocked with the speed of updates. There are still thing to be done (for example: lags after picking items when cloud save is enabled that quite a few players experience) but I'm assured that the studio will keep the good work with completing their game and later on with expansions. Good job, Crate Entertainment, good job.			"

								Best dungeon crawler since Diablo 2.I'm usually skeptical of Early Access, but this game feels more like a late beta than an early alpha.  Extremely playable.Fun spells.  Dual class skill point system.  Sensible character stat system (only 3 attributes).  Exploration based talent system.I've only played for two hours and have been pleasantly surprised by the total lack of nonsense they've fixed from other dungeon crawlers.  Did you accidentally buy an item from the shop?  You you can sell it back at the purchase price!  See you passed a chest way and you have to run for 30 seconds to route back to it?  Just click the chest and it'll route your character for you!I'm a little shocked they're selling it for as little as they are.  It's a fantastic game for the price.  Absolutely zero buyer's remorse.			"

												Did you enjoy your time in Titan Quest? Do you often think of the glory days of time spent in Dungeon Siege online?Do you look back on Diablo 2 and consider it one of the greats?If any of these apply to you then you will not find yourself regretting your decision to purchase Grim Dawn. This game adeptly scratches that ARPG itch as well as proves that the genre itself has room for more than just one 10,000 lbs. gorilla.   Edit: Still love it.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a poster child for Early Access.  I donated to this game before Early Access was a thing, before Kickstarter was a thing, way back in 2010.  Every content update has been enjoyable all the way to the finish.  Now the game is complete.  I have seen it evolve to add features not dreamed of at the beginning.  I was a huge fan of Titan Quest, but it had its flaws, mostly to do with balance of the different classes.  Class balance is much better now, so much so that I keep making new characters all the time when an idea for a build strikes me.  The controls in Titan Quest were fine at the time of release, but games have evolved since then and Grim Dawn has kept pace.  The control is very smooth and natural.  Even with Titan Quest being a favorite of all time, I have trouble going back to play it, because of all the improvements made in the journey through Grim Dawn.Highly recommended game for anyone interested in deep quality APRG games.

												If you are looking for a decent oldschool game, Grom Dawn is the thing. You actually get the feeling you had, when you played Titan Quest / D2 / Sacred (the first one, not the rubbish s2/s3).So far the game runs smoothly, had just one crash after 3 hours of playing, but it is not a problem since your progress is safed automatically.To my conclusion... If you want a game that tells you exactly what to do, where to find♥♥♥♥♥♥and how to skill your caracter...go play something else. Grom Dawn does not have that much Tutorials, but after a while you get the hang of everything.9/10 since there is not much of actually innovative stuff, otherwise it would easily be a 10/10			"

								A well crafted game with excellent translations drom the awesome community (spanish translation is very good). I'm not a reviewer, so I just can say to you what this game looks to me and it looks very very good. The story isn't very original (apocalypse, another dimension bad guys, you're the chosen one between two worlds...) but it has it's own special magic which make you keep playing and looking for more lore in the field only to know what happened and what's going next. The gameplay is very fun, with power weapons and a lot of customization in your way to play the game (you can choose between 5 classes and mix two of them, add special abilities to the weapons similar to PoE, etc), also the gameplay it's between diablo 3 with it's fantastic view and PoE with a more complex way to defeat the enemies.Graphics are pretty good in ultra and the art design is ok. Maybe a little bit to dark or dusty to shine and be epic, but the whole world is coherent itself. Optimization...I would say it's a 7/10. It has some drops when there's 10+ enemies and some spells but in general is fine (windows 7 & 10, i5 2500k @3'3Ghz, gtx 570 & 8Gb RAM).TL;DR: if you like ARPG you should buy it, maybe still in eraly access but it has no major problems (also no minor problems as far I've seen), it's fun and it's cheap. Has lan multiplayer (very fun with friends & pizza), long story (20h and I'm not even completed the 3rd act) and great replay value. Also, sorry for my potatoe english.			"

								Wow! I've only spent 2 hours on it but I am in love with it. I can not believe this game is developed by only 8 people. It's incredible and they deserve a medal! So much better than Diablo 3 (I know, I know people say this a lot, but it's true)It's quite embarassing that a team of 8 can produce a better game than Blizzard so good on you, you deserve much praise.Don't get me wrong, Diablo 3 was ok but it wasn't addictive enough to keep me playing and the lack of customisation sucked. Or be it the minor customisation you could do was not good enough however compare that to this game and it just feels much better. It feels like your points spent are worth while and the skills you learn are great. At least from a Soldiers point of view, I have just taken Night Blade as my second mastery upon reaching level 10 and I think that might be a nice combination. Excited to try out others too, on another character maybe.I can see myself spending a lot of time on this game and a lot of replayability. For such a cheap price and such a small team working on it, this is a masterpiece. I seem to like this more than other games of similar style. Not sure why but this just nails it on the head. I completed Diablo 3, I've completedTorchlight 2 (and although fun, it feels different to this). I've also played Path of Exile but not near enough to say anything about it but the couple of hours I did play I did not get the same feelings as I do for this game. Something about this one really makes me want to keep playing! Games like this and Torch Light offer much more in terms of customisation and that's one thing that makes games like this so good, and I felt that was missing in Diablo 3.			"

								Grim Dawn is the juggernaut of ARPG's. You've got 6 pure classes which you can choose to play as a single class or once you reach level 10 you can choose to go dual class. So you've got 15 different dual class combinations along with the 6 base classes.Another feature that further differentiates your character is the devotion system which is a bit daunting looking at first, but it works really well. It basically adds stat modifiers and unlocks procs which the latter even levels up.The game also happens to have a lot of great mods that make the game even better in various manners. The game is so good basically you may very well never need another ARPG is the bottom line.			"

												When Ironlore dissolved, i died a little. I've spent hours and hours playing titan quest immortal throne. Every few months I'd google Titan Quest 2 to no avail.  Well folks it’s here, it’s better, its Grim Dawn. I've been supporting this game since inception and I cannot recommend it enough for ARPG fans. The course of development was smooth, full of features, balances, content and bug fixes (thanks crate). Pro's:Diversity of classes/class choices. (classic arpg style)Faction reputation and rewards.Good'ol hidden areas and goodies.Distinctive grim world with unique monsters in varying zones.Bosses, challenge areas, increased difficulty = increased rewards.Con's: (kinda)Utter time sink.You turn pixel greedy.Your turn into a min max fiend.RSI in index finger.In all honesty though, the random map generation begins and ends at random boulders. This ""feature"" is so minimal ide rather just have a fixed map.So get clicking! Seriously!			"

								This gave me the same feeling I had when I played Diablo 2 for the first time all those years ago. Although i've not played many hours yet, I see me sinking many many many hours, possibly days, into this. If you liked Diablo 2. Or want more of a challenge that Diablo 3 doesn't give you, then this may be worth looking at. Granted it has a few bugs and isn't finished yet but the dev team have been working on this for years and are always updating it.Graphically it looks rather nice. Has that dark dispear feeling that I used to love about Diablo 2. Enemies are challenging and you can get swamped very quickly if your not careful. Loot system seems to work well and you can start straight away building your characters gear. The writing is good and interesting with different options for your character to reply with which can sometimes change the outcome of the conversatin from positive to negative. Looking forward to the future of Grim Dawn.			"

								It's been a while since I've had this much fun playing an ARPG. Better than Diablo 3 in my opinion. The world has a well done, dark aesthetic that really makes it come alive. The combat favors skill over level or stats (though both are still extremely important). And exploring always turns up some little goodie that made wandering the backways worth it.A small thing that stood out for me was the way they did markers for quests. They don't hold your hand the whole way with a perpetualy marker on your minimap. Alternatively they didn't throw you to the wolves and expect you not to miss this chest you need to open. The quest will tell you to go to X location and do Y. When you get to X location and get close to the quest you will see a star on your minimap. So you won't know where the chest is when you're all the way across the map, but you won't miss it because you didn't go into that one room.			"

Early Access Review
								Grim Dawn is everything you could want from a ARPG, and more. Fun combat, loot, big skill trees, bosses, hordes of mobs, and more.. But what sets it apart from other ARPGs? Here is what I have found..So if you're a ARPG fan you have most likely played Torchlight, Diablo, and Path of Exile.. So what makes this game unique from them? First thing that comes to mind: Hybrid classes. You can pick any two classes and mix and match there skills and passives. That is pretty darn cool don't you think? So wanna be a tanky spell caster? Do it. Wanna be a tanky rogue? Do it. Wanna be a pet class that uses swords, and not range? Do it. Any two can mix, and the best part, THEY ARE ALL GOOD BUILDS TOGETHER.Second thing is the classes themselves: Solider, Demolitionist, Nightblade, Occultist, and Arcanist. Seem kinda generic? Not really.. Demolitionist is one of the more original classes I have seen in a game. It has deployables, physical and magical damage, AoE, DoTs, Range or melee or both.. And most importantly.. LOTS OF EXPLOSIONS AND FIRE!!! And to make it even better, you can mix it with any of the other classes. The only ones to me that seem kinda generic are the Solider (Barbarian/Warrior) and the Arcanist (Wizard/Mage.) But you can even make those original by mixing it with another class.Third thing: From what I can tell it has a GREAT dev team. For a early accsess it is surprisingly polished, playable, and fun. Plus it isn't even complete, which means more content (more classes please!) and acts to come. Even in its current state it has replay value, which will grow more and more over time.Pros:Awesome class systemGood combatDecent soundDecent graphicsRuns smoothlyGood crafting/tradingGood amount of contentCheaper than most of its rivalsOffline modeFuture mod supportCons:Not complete yet, which can be a negitive to some.No dedicated multiplayer, You have to host it yourself.Score for its current build out of 10:Graphics: 8Sound: 8Performance: 9Gameplay: 9Final: 8.5I love this game, and advise all ARPG fans to give it a go. And even if you're not normaly into ARPGS, maybe this one will pull you in.			"

								TLDR: if you're a fan of these diablo-esque games, than you'll love this one to bits. If you've loved Titan Quest Immortal Throne, then you'll love it even more. If you loved the latter game because of the ancient mythology, well that's too bad.Grim Dawn, like its predecessor TQ, gives you more freedom in creating toons than in most other ARPG's. 'Building a Character' seems a much more appropriate description for its skill system than normal. For instance, there are no class specific items and gear. All loot has requirements based on attribute points and level instead of class. You can quite literally build stupid characters; soldiers wielding crossbows that have mostly debuff skills etc. The enemies you encounter will let you know if it's a viable strategy (i.e. if you get r4ped or not).Some novel ideas that are being implemented are factions and (in relationship to TQ) an expanded crafting system. Factions allow for a more convincing interaction with the many npc's and enemies in the world of Cairn. And on top of building relics (powerful buffing gear that create a challenge to come by and craft) you can find blueprints for all kinds of cool gear. Furthermore you have too find these characters, like more merchants and a blacksmith in the world and transport them back to your starting town Devil's Crossing.The world itself is dark and gloomy (grim) and feature the usual zombie-like enemies one comes to expect from games these days. But over time in early access all kinds of neat villains and monsters have been added, like orcish hordes, insects, enemy humans and so on and so on... you get the picture: loads of fresh meat to slaughter :)And slaughtering comes in busloads of weapons and skills with cool shiny effects and lights :D YEEEEE!I strongly recommend playing veteran if you're experienced in other such games, as it might be too easy on normal, veteran mode for me seems to work quite well however.HFBB "

								What do you want from an ARPG? You want it to be fast, responsive, and to have as little hassle as possible managing your loot and generally, the fun follows. Grim Dawn definitely is that. It's the finest ARPG we've had in some time. It builds upon Titan Quest's strengths while surpassing its shortfalls, bringing back the fantastic multi-class system. It's definitely fun solo, but bring friends and it just gets better. Well worth the small price of entry. If you're a fan of the genre, rejoice, you've got a new favourite.			"

It has some drops when there's 10+ enemies and some spells but in general is fine (windows 7 & 10, i5 2500k @3'3Ghz, gtx 570 & 8Gb RAM).TL;DR: if you like ARPG you should buy it, maybe still in eraly access but it has no major problems (also no minor problems as far I've seen), it's fun and it's cheap. Has lan multiplayer (very fun with friends & pizza), long story (20h and I'm not even completed the 3rd act) and great replay value. Also, sorry for my potatoe english.			"

								I've been following Grim Dawn's development for over 2 years now. I couldn't wait for official release any longer. I'm so glad I pulled the trigger and bought the game! It's got everything a good ARPG should have:Great character progressionGreat combatImmersive settingLoot!Highly AddictiveThese are just a few things that make this an outstanding ARPG! If you're a fan of other great ARPGs such as Diablo, Titan Quest, and POE, then you owe it to yourself to check out Grim Dawn.			"

								This is a solid Diablo Style RPG. It is not of course on par with Diable in terms of overall quality and gaming experience, but it is a very good game in its own right, and I am sure it will only get better as the developers tweak it throughout the development process. The only gripe I have is that I wish the user could save games and begin again at the point they left off at rather than having to start back at Devil's Crossing every time you shut the game down for the night.

								Yes as you can see this game is D3 like game. Many of the most popular WOW/Diablo clone are just pale imitations compare to their  older brother, but this game is the exception the confirms the rule. Despite its ressemblance to D3, it bring new story, new environments and some features. At beginning this game may look confusing with new spell mechanics, new name, new gems crafting system that is quite different from Diablo. But if you read carefully and take  the chance to fight and learn your caracter , the mechanics become obvious. My only complain is the lack of content(its early access so its normal)All the rest of the game is smooth and graphicly enjoyable. I recommend this game, but if you want to play a full finished and polished game...give it some time as we are not even close to the final version, but the best is yet to come.I got this game  on sale for 13$ and it was well worth it..I strongly recommend for you to wait for this game to be on sale..well in its current state.

								Ok First Let me say that I am a huge Diablo III fan but the gear and item situation in the game lacks greatly. Once a new patch comes out the old gear is no longer viable. Along comes Grim Dawn and they have the item stats and drops right so far. I have been using a mixture of white and yellow and I got my first green a couple of days ago. As I progress thru the game the monsters scale and the items stay relavent. I have compared several items that have dropped and like the scale of the stats in the early access quite well. Gameplay is solid after you figure it out. Builds can be varied and provide ability groups for mixing and matching tooyour style of play, which I love, SOlid early access platform I would reccommend to anyone burned out on Diablo III competitive play. I have not ventured into multiplay yet, and have just completed the Warden quest which an WAS INSANE ending of a chapter. My only complaint is that I cant play it on my Surface III I7 as the mouse support is not there. Dev team please patch this QUICK so I am never far from the game!  I found the Fix in the Forums....This is an amazing game!			"

								I spent a lot of time playing Diablo 2 when I was younger, and spent even more time playing Diablo 3. I was a fan of the game, even before it got fixed with ROS. I ran every class in Torchlight and Torchlight 2. Point being; I ♥♥♥♥ing love my dungeon crawling, and I love my loot fests. I've followed Grim Dawn's progress since the Kickstarter. I didn't have a job at the time, so I never invested and I've held off on purchasing in Early Access because I didn't want to get a bad impression of the game. I finally cracked and bought into it. The game starts in a basic hub city, and with a basic ""go kill this weak boss"" quest. After that, the world opens up. You are indroduced to factions that you may work for and gain reputation that gives you access to faction stores (not unlike WoW). Some areas you'll never see in the main quest line, and the game really rewards exploration with lore and loot. And the class system is divine. It can be a little overwhelming at first (don't expect to keep your first character). The game has a wide selection of classes that all play differently. They all fit a stereotype (Soldier = Warrior, Nightblade = Rouge, etc.) but at level 10 you get to select a second class. Some of the classes don't blend very well, such as a Soldier/Nightblade build. Many skills require certain weapons in each class, and they can conflict with each other. Building a character takes careful planning, but is very rewarding.If you enjoy exploring, loot and rewarding leveling, this is the perfect game. It's amazing what a small indie team can put together when they are truly invested. Grim Dawn is an A+ example of old gaming done right in a modern time of microtransactions and DLC. Once this game is completed, you can be assured I'll be investing in any and all expansions. tl;dr Buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								When i first played the game it reminded of a Diablo/Torchlight kind of top down rpg. But, the more i play it the more addicting it is. Love the classes, love the ability to make each class different ways with talent points and be able to respect out the points in powers you dont want in your build. While the graphics might not be as eye catching as Torchlight, they arent cartoony like it either. What i love is they dont overwhelm you with bright colours, they only let the spells illuminate thru the darkness, a wonderful experience! At level 2 you decide your class, at level 10 you have the option of dual class your character. My only complaint is you cannot respect out the points you put in the bottom mastery bar. So dual classers take heed, spend those mastery points wisely, you cant undo those mistakes. Ultimately, you may end up deleting a toon or two if youre a min/maxer like myself, but thats fine because half the fun of this game is leveling up a new toon you either made a build for or found online. The crafting system is fun, and you can kite with both melee and casters if that is your playstyle. The amount of ways to build a character are endless, you will have loads of fun experimenting, if you find yourself dying read some play guides and builds. They help Tremendously! A character you may believe is weak could be the most powerful if you slot the points the right and gear based on your primary attack will make you 100% more effective.  I highly recommend this game, get a friend and play multiplayer always because solo is always slow, 1 or 2 group members and the exp flys.			"

Highly recommended!I've played released games **cough, cough, EA, cough** with many more issues than I've encountered with this ""Early Access"" version.  I'm 27 hours in with very few issues - possibly 5 crashes in total.The Titan Quest roots are very obvious, which in my mind is a good thing - I have hundreds of hours in Titan Quest, and am currently replaying it again in co-op thru Tunngle.Its difficulty is higher than TQ; some balancing might fix that (yesterday's hotfix is said to address some balancing issues - I got two large updates overnight). It also doesn't have TQ's respawn fountains. If you die, you respawn in town and have to use whichever portal is closest to your death marker. In some cases, that can be a looooong slog back to your grave marker to reclaim your XP. I've therefore gotten into the habit of throwing up a portal every so often, even if I have no intention of travelling back to town.Buy it, play the heck out of it, enjoy! "

								This game is excellent. If you're hesitant, what can it hurt to try it out? This game is fleshed out for what has been released thus far (June 2015). There's still some bugs here and there but overall, a very smooth experience with lots of stuff to explore and freedom to build a character you want to play by mixing up two masteries. I was thinking it had a very diablo 2 feel when I first started playing but over time I realized Grim Dawn really has it's own unique feel. The C'hthonian cultists dialogue is great, for example - and the creepiness definitely works. The mood and vibe fits the magicocalypse feel of the game. The faction system makes things interesting and melee combat in an arpg never felt so rewarding with the options available. I'm stoned and could have written this better, but just buy it, experience it.			"

								This diablo-like game has great controls, fantastic stability for an early access  (I think I've only had it crash ONCE, in the many hours I've played.  What AAA title can say that?).  The graphics are fantastic.  Details everywhere, environment, charachters, storyline.  Solid levelling and skills system, with a myriad of items.  I just want to thank the graphic designers of this game, the developers, and testers involved.  You've released a great, solid game.  I would request one feature, a checkbox for the disabling of loss of XP on death.  Purely personal preference, but some of us don't like losing XP and possible levels when we accidently wander into the waiting ambush of murder as we explore a dungeon.  Not a complaint, just a kind request :)			"

Early Access Review
								I highly recommend this game so far, with some minor caveats.**Possible spoilers in this review**I enjoy action RPG's more than any genre. I've put well into the thousands of hours in Diablo 2, hundreds in Diablo 3, and a good amount in many many others (Torchlight 1 & 2, The Van Helsing series, Path of Exile, etc.) So when I say this game surpasses almost all of them, it's probably on par right now with Torchlight 2 and Path of Exile, but falls short of the amazingness that is Diablo 2.But to be among games like TL2 and PoE is a huge compliment, I think both of those games are great. This game right now has the majority of things it's needs to be doing right, done right. Many of the problems and ""cons"" I have about this game can, and hopefully should be rectified by ""official launch.""So lets go over what it does right -Pro's --In depth character customization allowing for varied builds, whacky characters, etc.-A deep itemization, solid crafting system, good enhancement system with gems or ""add-ons""-Combat is fluid and fun.-Combat is not ""cheap"", in the sense that it does not have things to bypass builds or such. (For example, in Path of Exile, no matter how tanky you build and get, a end game boss can one shot you due to game mechanics. I personally find that to be a cheap and unsatisfying game mechanic. So far nothing like that has seemed to come up. Note: so far**)-Online multiplayer has a reminiscent feel to Diablo 2.-Quests and Faction rep feels like you're making a difference in this world.-Ability to open up your class to more options via items that provide skills/bonuses. (For example, a rune that allows my Commando to dual wield pistols. This brings me back to Diablo 2 runewords where you get skills from items. This opened up the game to massive customization, and I love that aspect in Grim Dawn)-Ability to respec skill points without massive costs associated to them.Con's --Convoluted as hell stat system. Diablo 2, TL 2, PoE, etc. all had in depth stat/skill systems that were easier to understand. You had stats, you put points into them, if a item changed it, it would directly show how it changed it, and what it did. In Grim Dawn, i still have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what half the stuff is and how it relates to skills due to lack of information, and really poorly worded skill descriptions.For example:If i have an item that gives a +20% fire damage bonus, and have a skill that reads as such:100% weapon damage+50 fire damage+65% weapon damageWhat does the item do? Does it provide a + 10 fire damage bonus to that skill and that’s it? Or does the +65 weapon damage apply to the fire since its beneath it, there for making the fire damage portion of the skill be (65% weapon damage as fire + 50), therefor making it a (72.5% weapon damage + 60) due to the item. I don't know, but that’s how multiple of the skills are worded. Why wouldn't it be something simple like:If the 65% was supposed to be just weapon damage-165% weapon damage+50 fire damageOr if the 65% was a fire modifier-100% weapon damage+65% weapon damage + 50 as fireBut back to stats in general. There are 5000 different stats in this game, and 3 character panels just to show all the info. Problem is most of the info shown doesn't actually tell you what it means, or enough to deduce on your own what it means. There is also just info straight up missing.Again, for example:Cunning is said to increase your chance to crit, but I can't find a crit chance stat anywhere, although there is a crit damage % multiplier stat. Defense is a ton of numbers all over the place. If you go a hover the Defense ability stat you'll see numbers all over, with no info on what any of it means. I have armor absorption on my chest of 104, is that good, bad, I have no idea because I have no idea what that means. Is it a flat value taken off of attacks, is it a value that is then broken down to a % of damage reduced?I cannot stress how much the stats and skills need to be reworded and expanded on so the player base can easily understand what it all does, and how it interacts with each other.-The questing, and the map both are vague and frustrating. I get a quest, and they tell me to go someplace. That in itself is simple enough, Im fine with that. There are Stars (sometimes) leading me in the right direction, sometimes they just say ""go north east"" and I walk. Thats where the map comes in. From what I can tell, from playing a couple characters now, the map is static, it is not randomly generated. Again, thats fine, but the map is a god damn maze. With vague directions, and the map having 500 dead ends, and when you bring up the actual ""map"" you can’t even tell where you are, you get irritated fast. I still have multiple quests I haven’t done due to having no clue where to go anymore.It's fine if you want to make the map a maze, it's fine if you want to be vague, but it would be nice if you either did what torchlight did, and just put an icon on the mini map that constantly would let you know where it was in relation to you. Or do something WoW style, and show the area on the map where the quest is, and a general zone where the quest could be completed.-There's no options for the mini map. In many of games the map could be brought up to be an overlay on the screen, I haven't found a way to do that yet, and the mini map in the corner is lacking as of right now.-Very little to go off of in the beginning. Diablo 3 was a pretty fuggin bad game, but it made sure you knew what was going on from the start. Now I have a ton of AARP experience under my belt, so I was able to figure out what was going on with relative ease. The Skill system is like Van helsing, ok... Stats like Diablo 2, ok... etc. But I didn't even know I had a  built in ""town  portal"" till I was like lvl 10 and stumbled upon it. Things like that make a game hard to get into from a noobs perspective. I want this game, and the indie company to succeed, and with game design like that, it may not. Somebody who has never played an AARP before is going to be very lost, and unless they can figure it out on their own, or google it, they will just give up.---------------The reason why I wrote a short novel on this, and why it was mostly on the negative is because this game is still being developed and I genuinely enjoy it and want to see this game succeed. I am having as much fun now as I did with both Torchlight 2 and PoE when they both released. Thing is Grim Dawn hasn't even released yet, and I’m enjoying it that much. That means this could potentially be the game to dethrone Diablo 2 for me, but it needs work. This game is being made by an indie company, with apparently only 8 members. I want to support this game, so Im giving it a positive review, and already got my roommate to buy it and play it with me.This game has massive, massive potential. I truly hope it reaches it.			"

								From the original maker's of Titan Quest, this Action Role Playing Game, Grim Dawn, has done everything I loved from TItan Quest and then some. It has extremely smooth gameplay, and it really does immersify you into the world. It starts off somewhat easier than I liked but it has multiple difficulties and it picked up in difficulty very quickly. I recommend this game to any fan of ARPGs, from Blizzard's DIablo Franchise to the Torchlight games, this is a great addition to your line-up. It very well could become your favorite, it does too have an endgame, and this is all in the Beta, the game feels absolutely finished, they are just polishing things and adding more content, new class coming among other things!

								Sometimes there are games that deserve special mention.  Grim Dawn is one because it not only plays like a perfectly paced ARPG, but it is darn fun at the same time.  It looks beautiful with it's morbid decay prevalent on enemies and an attention to detail that is second to none in the genre.  Storm ravaged homes never looked this good before!  The skills in the game work.  There is none of the Diablo III nerfs and buffs.  If you put points into a skill it means that you can count upon it to destroy or save you.  The multiplayer is awesome also because it isn't mandatory and you can host your buddies without worrying about some server in the middle of nowhere being overloaded.Really the game is so much fun and I don't know anyone can pass upon it if the love ARPGs.  This game is a keeper!  Highly recommended!			"

								This gave me the same feeling I had when I played Diablo 2 for the first time all those years ago. Although i've not played many hours yet, I see me sinking many many many hours, possibly days, into this. If you liked Diablo 2. Or want more of a challenge that Diablo 3 doesn't give you, then this may be worth looking at. Granted it has a few bugs and isn't finished yet but the dev team have been working on this for years and are always updating it.Graphically it looks rather nice. Has that dark dispear feeling that I used to love about Diablo 2. Enemies are challenging and you can get swamped very quickly if your not careful. Loot system seems to work well and you can start straight away building your characters gear. The writing is good and interesting with different options for your character to reply with which can sometimes change the outcome of the conversatin from positive to negative. Looking forward to the future of Grim Dawn.			"

								It's been a while since I've had this much fun playing an ARPG. Better than Diablo 3 in my opinion. The world has a well done, dark aesthetic that really makes it come alive. The combat favors skill over level or stats (though both are still extremely important). And exploring always turns up some little goodie that made wandering the backways worth it.A small thing that stood out for me was the way they did markers for quests. They don't hold your hand the whole way with a perpetualy marker on your minimap. Alternatively they didn't throw you to the wolves and expect you not to miss this chest you need to open. The quest will tell you to go to X location and do Y. When you get to X location and get close to the quest you will see a star on your minimap. So you won't know where the chest is when you're all the way across the map, but you won't miss it because you didn't go into that one room.			"

								Grim Dawn is everything you could want from a ARPG, and more. Fun combat, loot, big skill trees, bosses, hordes of mobs, and more.. But what sets it apart from other ARPGs? Here is what I have found..So if you're a ARPG fan you have most likely played Torchlight, Diablo, and Path of Exile.. So what makes this game unique from them? First thing that comes to mind: Hybrid classes. You can pick any two classes and mix and match there skills and passives. That is pretty darn cool don't you think? So wanna be a tanky spell caster? Do it. Wanna be a tanky rogue? Do it. Wanna be a pet class that uses swords, and not range? Do it. Any two can mix, and the best part, THEY ARE ALL GOOD BUILDS TOGETHER.Second thing is the classes themselves: Solider, Demolitionist, Nightblade, Occultist, and Arcanist. Seem kinda generic? Not really.. Demolitionist is one of the more original classes I have seen in a game. It has deployables, physical and magical damage, AoE, DoTs, Range or melee or both.. And most importantly.. LOTS OF EXPLOSIONS AND FIRE!!! And to make it even better, you can mix it with any of the other classes. The only ones to me that seem kinda generic are the Solider (Barbarian/Warrior) and the Arcanist (Wizard/Mage.) But you can even make those original by mixing it with another class.Third thing: From what I can tell it has a GREAT dev team. For a early accsess it is surprisingly polished, playable, and fun. Plus it isn't even complete, which means more content (more classes please!) and acts to come. Even in its current state it has replay value, which will grow more and more over time.Pros:Awesome class systemGood combatDecent soundDecent graphicsRuns smoothlyGood crafting/tradingGood amount of contentCheaper than most of its rivalsOffline modeFuture mod supportCons:Not complete yet, which can be a negitive to some.No dedicated multiplayer, You have to host it yourself.Score for its current build out of 10:Graphics: 8Sound: 8Performance: 9Gameplay: 9Final: 8.5I love this game, and advise all ARPG fans to give it a go. And even if you're not normaly into ARPGS, maybe this one will pull you in.			"

Early Access Review
								TLDR: if you're a fan of these diablo-esque games, than you'll love this one to bits. If you've loved Titan Quest Immortal Throne, then you'll love it even more. If you loved the latter game because of the ancient mythology, well that's too bad.Grim Dawn, like its predecessor TQ, gives you more freedom in creating toons than in most other ARPG's. 'Building a Character' seems a much more appropriate description for its skill system than normal. For instance, there are no class specific items and gear. All loot has requirements based on attribute points and level instead of class. You can quite literally build stupid characters; soldiers wielding crossbows that have mostly debuff skills etc. The enemies you encounter will let you know if it's a viable strategy (i.e. if you get r4ped or not).Some novel ideas that are being implemented are factions and (in relationship to TQ) an expanded crafting system. Factions allow for a more convincing interaction with the many npc's and enemies in the world of Cairn. And on top of building relics (powerful buffing gear that create a challenge to come by and craft) you can find blueprints for all kinds of cool gear. Furthermore you have too find these characters, like more merchants and a blacksmith in the world and transport them back to your starting town Devil's Crossing.The world itself is dark and gloomy (grim) and feature the usual zombie-like enemies one comes to expect from games these days. But over time in early access all kinds of neat villains and monsters have been added, like orcish hordes, insects, enemy humans and so on and so on... you get the picture: loads of fresh meat to slaughter :)And slaughtering comes in busloads of weapons and skills with cool shiny effects and lights :D YEEEEE!I strongly recommend playing veteran if you're experienced in other such games, as it might be too easy on normal, veteran mode for me seems to work quite well however.HFBB "

								What do you want from an ARPG? You want it to be fast, responsive, and to have as little hassle as possible managing your loot and generally, the fun follows. Grim Dawn definitely is that. It's the finest ARPG we've had in some time. It builds upon Titan Quest's strengths while surpassing its shortfalls, bringing back the fantastic multi-class system. It's definitely fun solo, but bring friends and it just gets better. Well worth the small price of entry. If you're a fan of the genre, rejoice, you've got a new favourite.			"

								Ive played a lot of so called RNG diablo isometric games and this is by far one of the best yet. Its a great follow up to Titan Quest and wish I could say the same when comparing d2 and d3.Unlike a lot of other fixed camera arpg games grim dawn offers a camera that can rotate which is very handy for finding hidden areas or looking at an area in a different way. Plenty of lore to explore, set items, crafting, modify/upgrade abilities and even mix up your class choice to hybrid. Projectile attacks can be blocked (null) with other projectiles which is an interesting take on an arpg and not many have done it.The game has almost past my expectations other than map sizes, maybe im just being a tad too picky but I would like to see much bigger expansive maps, all in consideration this is a no brainer for diablo style game lovers, just buy it.

Early Access Review
								I love dungeon crawlers, I used to play them all the time growing up with my brother. We played so many great ones like the Gaunlet series, Baulder's gate, Diablo, Chaimpons of Norrath, etc. So one of the things I've always been looking for is rpgs like those games I used to play all the time but have always been let down by so many titles. I tried diablo 3 and it didn't bring back those feelings I got from my memories and Path of Exile was good but it lacked something that I could not put my finger on. Then my brother told me to buy this game and I was skeptical at first but got it anyway. As soon as I got into game and the music played, the scene took place, and my eyes grew wide to view this new world. I was sold instantly by this games atmosphere, then I actually started playing the game and was blew away even more. This game has done for me what other dungeon crawling rpgs of this day have not, this game has reinstilled my faith finding great rpgs again. I think this game is fantastic! Even for an early access game this game is extremly well done and not flacid or lacking in the departments which quite a bit of the games in this genre are. I freaking love this game and I'm no where near to being done. ten outta ten! I grab it, I pull it, I bite it, I chew, Ten Outta Ten!			"

								A well crafted game with excellent translations drom the awesome community (spanish translation is very good). I'm not a reviewer, so I just can say to you what this game looks to me and it looks very very good. The story isn't very original (apocalypse, another dimension bad guys, you're the chosen one between two worlds...) but it has it's own special magic which make you keep playing and looking for more lore in the field only to know what happened and what's going next. The gameplay is very fun, with power weapons and a lot of customization in your way to play the game (you can choose between 5 classes and mix two of them, add special abilities to the weapons similar to PoE, etc), also the gameplay it's between diablo 3 with it's fantastic view and PoE with a more complex way to defeat the enemies.Graphics are pretty good in ultra and the art design is ok. Maybe a little bit to dark or dusty to shine and be epic, but the whole world is coherent itself. Optimization...I would say it's a 7/10. It has some drops when there's 10+ enemies and some spells but in general is fine (windows 7 & 10, i5 2500k @3'3Ghz, gtx 570 & 8Gb RAM).TL;DR: if you like ARPG you should buy it, maybe still in eraly access but it has no major problems (also no minor problems as far I've seen), it's fun and it's cheap. Has lan multiplayer (very fun with friends & pizza), long story (20h and I'm not even completed the 3rd act) and great replay value. Also, sorry for my potatoe english.			"

Early Access Review
								I've tried this game for a while and I was quite pleased with it.The game has AWESOME music (dark, eerie, like i was used to in Diablo 1), It enhances the game to be ""Grim"".The pace of the game is NOT extremely fast (like some other games where you just button mash 200+ enemies away in mere seconds) and due to this it gives you the feeling that all your skills have an impact (explosions feel like explosions, etc).The Quests are compelling (enemy bosses sometimes quite exhausting), the game visual style is a nice mix of fantasy and victorian style.The playtime is i think quite long (im not even through with act/chapter 1).Playable characters and skillsets are nicely done.I personally really miss the MULTIPLAYER FEATURE. Its nice to play alone but it would certainly enrich the game if you could share the moments with your friends.A worth buy if you missed a dark, not too fast paced hack n slay game, even though i would wait for multiplayer patch if you want to play with some of your friends. After that, it will be a must buy!-----------------------------------------------------------UPDATE *Full Release* (February 2016):After playing over 120 hours, I thought i have to update my old review of this game.This game still rocks. It went a long way and all the updates were for the best. The last overhaul made the game finally complete (hence the release). Can't say anything else, just that for me its a really nice game that fills the gap thats has been left after diablo 2. Cool music, nice particle effects and graphics, levels have been reworked to look and feel special, deep crafting opportunities, skill mechanics, lore, enemy diversion, etc... Its a must buy!			"

								PWNing BLIZZARD LIKE A BOSS!Yes, GRIM DAWN is the game Diablo3 was supposed to be (but failed miserably)! Other that adding the endgame, I cannot imagine what else needs pollishing in this brilliant game. The addictive gameplay, the flawless graphics and the cool moves, the detailed environments and the immersive atmosphere, the balanced skills and the ability to dual-specialize, the great loot system, the natural progression of the character with the story, the streamlining of the classic chores (no identification scrolls, the town-portals stay open until you open a new one), the greatly designed and very interesting map...The list is long of the things this game get just right!This was the best hack-&-slash action RPG I have experienced in years!

								Grim Dawn is one of my all-time favourite games, and the best ARPG by a mile. Better than D3 and POE, I kid you not. And here's why:- Dev team (Crate): This game breathes honest game development in every detail. Crate is a dedicated team of pros who know what they're doing. Plus, they're communicating their ideas about the game, listening to player feedback, and respond on forums frequently.- Audiovisuals are very good and modern-looking. Especially weapon sounds are powerful!- Replayability: For some reason, creating new characters and starting from scratch is fun. Partly because of the following point.- Insane customization: 6 classes, class skills, items (many have skills too), components, relics, constellations... You can mix up to 2 classes to come up with your own original builds. Many builds are viable. Endless possibilities.- Heaps of loot to go thru: weapons, shields, armor, rings, amulets, other small garment, fetishes, books (casters are covered, don't worry).- Story: It's good, well written, dark (not your typical shiny fantasy cliche), and your choices have consequences down the line. Are you going to be selfish, altruistic, or something else? Your choice.- Lore: Apart from the main storyline, there are bits of information laying around for you to read, if you like. And it's well worth going thru it all.- Crafting: Simple (no mini-games) but very deep with lots of options. Your choice in the story decides what type of a blacksmith you get. How cool is that! So choose wise!- Factions: There are severals factions, and you can work on your relations with them to get faction loot, faction quests, and other stuff. Stronger and stronger monster heroes will start to hunt you the more hated you become by an evil faction.- Monster infighting: Some factions wage war against each other, so sometimes you can sit back and watch as they go at it. Fun as hell!- Secrets! There are quite a few of them, holding good stuff for you! These are not only small rooms, but even some large areas.- GUI is easy on the eye and well readable.- Localization: Even at this stage, there are many community-made localizations, directly supported by the devs.- Modding tools to be included after release.My score:9/10 "

												This game is shaping up to be the diablo 3 I waited for but never got. Loving the graphic style, its not as polished as some newer games, but its a huge imporvement from say, d2 way back. A nostalgic vibe but very clean and VERY detailed. Love the games atmosphere, its the dark, horrifying, well Grim world I adore. A much preferred vibe over D3's W.O.W style that made the whole game feel a bit cartoony in my opinion. I started with normal but quickly realized that vetran was much more rewarding. 5 hrs only so far but this game is sucking me in fast, 10/10. Oh its 25$ so 11/10.			"

								All i can say is wow. I will be honest, i was never a fan of the diablo series. However this game heavily reminds me of playing Baldurs gate dark alliance games (not the best games in the world) however it brings a wave of fresh nostalgia. The fact this game has grasped me as tight as it has by the balls is amazing to me. i was happy to see it leaving early access and hitting full release mode around the time i bought it. with what is already in place i am absolutely starving for whatever kind of content you are preparing to release and work on post launch. Some things i would like to eventually make an appearance -Harder difficulties-more classes (however what there is is really fleshed out) it would add more diversity to the multi class system, some classes do not synergize well in my eyes, that may be due to rng and lack of loot that makes it flow better. -a larger range of loot in general. -more visuals (many identical items in terms of appearance.) -possible character customization? -class reset books (understandably left out, you would just play one character the whole time)   -Attribute reset? ive screwed up multiple characters due to ignorance.Overall i really really love this game, those are just some suggestions that i have from the time i have played some may even be adressed and im not far enough to recognize it. I only have positive things to say about this gameOh! possibly add a recruit a friend benefit? i have single handedly sold this game to at least 6 of my friends. and i will continue to preach it! keep up the good work!

They keep adding content and they keep saying that they will not come out with final version of game until it is finished, and they aren't going to rush it, and I see that as a good thing.Any one who has gotten burned by EA titles, this is not one of THOSE developers and this is not one of THOSE games.

								All i can say is wow. I will be honest, i was never a fan of the diablo series. However this game heavily reminds me of playing Baldurs gate dark alliance games (not the best games in the world) however it brings a wave of fresh nostalgia. The fact this game has grasped me as tight as it has by the balls is amazing to me. i was happy to see it leaving early access and hitting full release mode around the time i bought it. with what is already in place i am absolutely starving for whatever kind of content you are preparing to release and work on post launch. Some things i would like to eventually make an appearance -Harder difficulties-more classes (however what there is is really fleshed out) it would add more diversity to the multi class system, some classes do not synergize well in my eyes, that may be due to rng and lack of loot that makes it flow better. -a larger range of loot in general. -more visuals (many identical items in terms of appearance.) -possible character customization? -class reset books (understandably left out, you would just play one character the whole time)   -Attribute reset? ive screwed up multiple characters due to ignorance.Overall i really really love this game, those are just some suggestions that i have from the time i have played some may even be adressed and im not far enough to recognize it. I only have positive things to say about this gameOh! possibly add a recruit a friend benefit? i have single handedly sold this game to at least 6 of my friends. and i will continue to preach it! keep up the good work!

								For an alpha game, Grim Dawn actually feels quite polished.  There are a few small graphical bugs, but nothing breaking.  If you enjoyed the Titan Quest games, Grim Dawn will feel very familiar.  The loot system, mastery system, and attributes/stats are almost exactly copied from Titan Quest, but still feel enhanced.  The game looks great.  Compared with Diablo 3's comic book style, Grim Dawn has a gritty, realistic, late 1800s style.  Looks much better than D3 IMO.I played a bladedancer to lvl 35 and really enjoyed it.  While it is obviously not finished, you could easily spend 50+ hours with what's there.  Easily worth the money, and you will know that the developers will continue supporting the game with more content.			"

								Grim dawn plays very much like Titan quest its spirital father but don't let that fool you, it is NOT titan quest. Grim dawn contains the best of titan quest from the satisfying ragdoll physics to the tried and true talent sytem while throwing out the silly greek skirts and bright beautiful landscapes for dark grimey pants and very dark twisted land, also guns! :DGrim dawn contains so far only a bare glimpse at what is to come but already I achingly wait each day for news on the upcoming updates, forcing myself not to play so I can experience more later. The biggest issue with the game is the speed of updates, I hate to sound like an empatient child I know they are trying to deliver the smoothest, most enjoyable experience they can but I'm addicted to this game already. Two words sum up Grim Dawn, from story to model animations; Beautifully macabre.			"

								So a few hours in and I really like this game and having in mind that this is alpha stage I imagine a lot of things will be fixed/changed/tweaked...It has a solid foundation to built on and even in this stage of development it is a fun and well done game. Of course for people who play these sort of games there isn't that one thing that makes it stand out from titles like Titan Quest, Diablo, Torchlight and so on. It is however a good mix of many of the good stuff each game had to offer (especially the dual class system) and I really like the somewhat darker atmosphere. Also storytelling is well done. Gameplay is, no wonder there, very intuitive and you get the hang of it really fast. Game mechanics are not that different from the above mentioned titles although I think combat is a bit faster (could be my imagination though). I'm really looking forward to new content and areas (hopefully some new scenery, new enemies, more skins and textures and so on). The game will grow, balance issues and bugs will get fixed and we will all have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of fun with this. It's off to a great start and I see myself putting some hours into that.			"

Early Access Review
								My concerns for ""Early Acess"" video Games:Not bad so far for an indie team development(I think I read only 7 dev on the project?)  I usualy am very leary of ""Early Access"" games but my one complaint of the game that I have seen and I am probably3 hours into the game so far is that the menu system crashed on me when coming out of setting the settings though my settings ""stuck"" and then when I am ready to quit it takes a long time to ""exit to the main menu""  But the most important part the game play has been rock solid! Kudos development team on your tight quality control for the easly access.  And keep up the quality and you will have followers.About the Game:Liked the look of this ever since it was announced of course Im a sucker for the RPG grinders.  If you are a fan of Titan Quest, The Adventures of Van Helsing, the Torchlight series and dare I say it the Diablo series, then you will also enjoy this game as well. The controls seem intuitive enough of most of those types of games so even if you dont check out the button configs you will be bale to play this game jsut as if youve been playing it for weeks.About the graphics and audio:Ther are a wide range of Graphics options as I stated before. The game has a good variety of visual effects and sound.  good use of lighting and texture mapping.  The environments havent gotten stale from reuse though I know that some things/areas reuse tilesets.About the Genre and price:Problem is I think that this genre is also getting to the point of saturation much like the nazi WW2 shooters did during the COD/MOH series.  But if you are a sucker for this type of game then get this.  Especially to support the indie devs.  They are the ones that pump out the same or better quality than the big production houses at a fraction of the cost. Check out my inventory, I have a bunch from indies to big name games but I am finding myself more pleased wth the pricepoint of the inde games. Caught it on the Steam sale for $15...will get my money out of it at this price!I say get it if you are on the fence.			"

You have choices to be made in the quests, I can't say what effect they have on game progression, but its making me a little jumpy hoping I made the right choices. Keeps the storyline fresh and keeps your attention.I bought the game on the Summer Sale, so terrific value for me.			"

												I purchased this game because of the co-op mode that you can play. My brother and I started playing it, and at first we had to spend about 10 min tweaking the graphics so things were easy to pick out. Once that was done we dove right into the game. It was tough learning what did what, but I guess that's what we enjoyed about the game. There really wasnt a ""hey you have to do this"" part of the game (if there was we totally missed it). If you enjoy games like Baldurs gate, Diablo and and top down dungeon crawler then you will surely love this game :) . 8/10 for graphics/audio and gameplay (but I'm sure if my computer was better the graphics would be better).

The character panel should be cleaned up a bit and more realistic. You have these amazing details and then lack in the character panel when your looking at your character you want to make that as much detail as possible as well because thats what people ahhh about when they build such an awesome character.

								Excellent RPG. Reminds me of POE and Diablo, but is overall different with great classes and skills. Guns and bombs seems pretty fun to me. Also, the story is actually quite compelling and is quite long. Purchased at full price and I believe it was worth every cent. :)			"

								Very, very, very early impressions (just under 1 hour):So far been really impressed with what I've played! The combat feels really nice and has a good ompf to it when your owning the enemies. What's also nice is the abilty to you use guns and be able to switch to traditional weapons like swords at the press of a button (Shotty and Greatsword combo is working nice for me).Since this is in part from the creators of Titan's Quest I'm hoping I won't end up having issues with the loot / enemy variation and gameplay getting too samey with loot not really progressing and become all too familar near mid to end game but so far so very good!

								It's grim. It's dark. And there are cultists. Whole world is being teared apart - the best time for demons cult to raise, of course. I won't be surprised if other cult led Cairn into Grim Dawn. Monsters everywere, but people are worse, as always.Techinally this game has Titan Quest mechanics with simpler main stats, same two classes per character, a little bigger skills tree and Devotions addition. Character/inventory screen is inherited too. But this game plays different from its ancestor. Less repetative, more brutal. And much more dark!			"

												I purchased this game because of the co-op mode that you can play. My brother and I started playing it, and at first we had to spend about 10 min tweaking the graphics so things were easy to pick out. Once that was done we dove right into the game. It was tough learning what did what, but I guess that's what we enjoyed about the game. There really wasnt a ""hey you have to do this"" part of the game (if there was we totally missed it). If you enjoy games like Baldurs gate, Diablo and and top down dungeon crawler then you will surely love this game :) . 8/10 for graphics/audio and gameplay (but I'm sure if my computer was better the graphics would be better). Love the game!			"

I would like to see more waves of enamy and not so much distance between packs. I do enjoy this game and hope too see what the finishing touches will finally be. The character panel should be cleaned up a bit and more realistic. You have these amazing details and then lack in the character panel when your looking at your character you want to make that as much detail as possible as well because thats what people ahhh about when they build such an awesome character. I hope to see some of these updates soon!!! :D oh and ps the weapons as well... Details guys Details! :P Thanks!!!!!			"

								Okay. It's simple: If you like Titan Quest, buy Grim Dawn too. The core game design is the same - you combine classes to get some interesting builds, and you farm for legendary and epic equipment. And of course the boss drops a loot for a different build, so you start a new one. And this goes on and on and on... until you finish the game. And then you play it again on harder difficulty and you loot new stuff for different builds and you keep smashing your left mouse button and you totally enjoy the environment design and exploring new possibilites within your builds. Yes, the game looks older than the year of its release. Yes, the core game design is very similar to Titan Quest. Yes, the story is simple (although catchy). But who cares if you simply love clicking this game. Oh... and yes, the steampunk-ish settings is amazing. I totally love rushing between hordes of enemies with guns and rifles... with my enourmous two-handed sword!			"

												I myself have over 1700hours on Diablo 3 with my barbarian alone. With only 40hrs played so far, i know im going to be playing the absolute sh!t out of this game. This Game is by far my favorite arpg, it fills the void we have all had in regards to the arpg genre. As a fan of ARPG and played almost all of them, i can tell you that this game is an example how an arpg should be. Its that good.Some notes - -Simplistic controls. The spells and attacks feel good and hard hitting, the combat just has that crunch to it.-The ragdolls are the best in this game. It's too the point where its never not funny to me. Nothing better than throwing a grenado at a human and seeing them fly through the air doing the splits.The pros: - The ammount of builds you can actually do(per class)- loot table- class customizations + combination- exploration and quests- secret pathways and walls- priced very wellCons:- story is faint and inadequate- normal difficulty is a joke- some crashes here and there- no map level variations(yet)			"

												If your a fan of Diablo 2 and Titan Quest, this game is a must buy. The skill system will be very familiar to people who played Titan Quest, you're able to choose up to 2 of 6 classes and mix them up creating a ton of build diversity. Combine that with the very broad devotion system, and this game blows pretty much every other ARPG out of the water in character customization.My only real complaint is bag clutter... there's so much bag clutter from crafting materials. But that's a very minor flaw all in all.This game has been in the making for a very long time, and the devs took the time needed to make sure it was done right.			"

												First time I review a game, but I really wanted to do it for Grim Dawn. As a big fan of Titan Quest, I supported the Kickstarter campaign of the game a few years ago, I really wanted that small team of developers to reach their goals. And clearly I don't regret it. Each update during Early Access has brought way more than I expected, and now that it is fully released, I can only recommend it.Gameplay :As for the gameplay, It is very similar to Titan Quest but with a few extra features like the Devotion tree or the numerous abilities available through items, that add a lot of customization to the game.  You'll love the number of builds you can create, some of them may have a hard time on Elite/Ultimate dificulties but there is no OP archetype build that everybody will do. The spells and effects look great, while remaining simple enough to allow you to see what's happening on the screen (very important as you'll have to doge the enemies spells, everything is dodgeable).Only thing maybe that will sadden some people, It is not as dynamic as PoE or D3 in terms of moving around the map. No spammable movement abilities, as the only ones need to be targetted at an enemy. But the music is great, and it is quite soothing to walk on the map, despite the grim athomsphere of the game !!Endgame :As it is now, Grim Dawn doesn't have the same end-game possibilities as D3 or PoE, but reaching max level (85) takes much more time than in D3, and I imagine that most people will create new toons to explore the different masteries combinations. However, it still has 2 ""bonus"" dungeons particularly hard, and a system of bounties similar to D3. Finally, the developers intend to release a Survival mode in the first expansion, (increasingly strong waves of enemies coming at you).Optimization :Everything runs smoothly, I only had to tick off Postprocessing Effects as I found the screen way too bright below the character, in some regions impossible to see the area surrounding the toon. Also, Steam Cloud option in Grim Dawn's menu leads to some lag when I pick up objects, but my laptop is getting old, that doesn't help. I can see some complaints about optimization issues, but with all the In-game options, I think that a lot of people can get the game running decently. With a middle range laptop from two years ago (Nvidia 740m for instance), I can still play in full HD on medium settings. I may have forgotten a lot, but really if you like a-rpg games, you should definitely check it out, If you are ready to lose a few hours of your life, that is. Also if you don't like grinding that much, or don't like a-rpgs because of the repitivity, you can still play through the game once, that will take you around 30 hours, way more than many more expensive games these days.Edit: Game still highly recommended, developers keep updating it ! Expansion with a new class is on its way too !			"

Early Access Review
								As of this review, I have put 22 hours into the game.I am not going to make a hardcore review detailing the nuances of every build, rather I am going to explain what the game excells over other ARPGs and what are its blemishes.What Comes Across the HorizonGrim Dawn shows its inspiration for Diablo 2 with a similar dismal art-style to suit the darker tones of its story. However, unlike Diablo 2, the game isn't afraid to give the scenary and the world color too. But GD isn't living in the glory of D2. You won't be fighting demons and angels; you'll be fighting eldritch beings from another realm, occutists, and all manner of creations from the great beyond and from our own hands.The weaponry and specializations (classes) in this game are also changed to a late Medieval time-period where explosives and guns were first in use. Weapons are also not limited to whatever specialization you have, yet they can be benefited by certain classes.While the story is nothing original, the execution is told with smart subtle writing. By giving only enough context in notes or from NPCs and by exploring the environments throughly, you'll find answers to your questions while always being left with more horrifying questions unanswered.It's a story that is more intriguing to unravel for yourself. You start by waking up shortly after a gallowsman cuts your noose once you've regained consciousness from being possessed. To say anything more will spoil the mystery, but if you're a fan of H.P Lovecraft, then I think you'll enjoy where this game is going. But let's focus on what GD does best of all: Experimentation.Forget About the Classes, Enjoy the ExperimentThe best aspect of GD is the variety of builds you can make. It's all based on what skills and/or weaponry you prefer, and the only limitation is what kind of final class you are looking for.At the start, you have no skills. Once you level up, you have the option of six class choices. And at level ten, you have the option of a secondary class from the remaining five--or you can stick with one if you really want--which is almost mandatory for more casual ARPG players.There is no specific class for one playstyle like with other ARPGs. No class is only a warrior, a mage, a ranger, etc. Instead, each class works as if it were split in two, and the halves were combined with other split-classes.If that is too confusing, here's a simple breakdown of them all:Soldier: Sword & Shield (also two-handed abilities) and general tankish perks.Demolitionist: Projeticle equipment expert (grenades, stun-jacks, mortar) and fire-magic.Occultist: Posion/hex spells and small creatures to summon.Arcanist: Ice and general-type magic spells.Nightblade: Dual-wielding expert, crit-based attacks and illusion magic.Shaman: Two-handed expert, lighting focus and a large creature to conjure.Some of these classes can be entirely played alone. However, some classes, like the Arcanist and Demolionist, will feel barren of abilities if you don't add another class. The result is a system where you can make some unique builds with your friends, even if you all start from the same class. For example, do you want to play a Van Helsing build (original)? Combine the Nightblade with the Demolitionist (two-wielding swords, get a cross bow, and combine it with Demo gadgets). Do you want to play as a two-handed Battlemage from TES? Combine the Shaman with the Arcanist.You get the idea.Although some classes are obviously designed for a weapon-type, there is nothing in the game to stop you from using whatever you want with the classes. Most skills do not require a certain weapon.Armor is not restricted by your classes either. It's all based on what attributes you select (physique, cunning and spirit), which can be modified further with the Devotions perks, and those too have special skills of their own.The best way to find what works for you is to start six characters to level 10. It will take you 15 mins to 20 mins each if you go the Slith island. For the first three, upgrade your Mastery alone.  From 4 -10, get your Mastery to rank 10 and try out the skills.If you're not satisfied, you can try another build. Once you have tried two or three out, you'll probably get an idea what you want. By the sixth run, you'll know what to choose for your final character.It sounds tedious, but it's really engaging to see what works and what doesn't. And because it takes so little time you won't get tired either.The reward for experimenting, while not being restricted to create whatever type of character you wan,  is the best thing to be found in GD.Not All SunshineYou're going to grow weary by reused enemies. Thankfully, enemies will only respawn after you leave the game. My strategy is to always reach the next portal to start my next game. Even if you take breaks, some levels are littered with enemies, especially in Act 2.Bosses don't fare much better. Something I can't overlook after playing Van Helsing with unique boss-fights. The Warden had some tactics, but Cronley was a sponge with nonstop mobs.The areas offer a lot of exploration. Possibly too much. Later, you can unlock more areas to old places for a classic RPG feel.You are not forced to go through the story in order--you can bypass Act 1 if you want. But the enemies will be tougher if you choose to do it. (To the game's credit, you can fight enemies 10 levels higher than you.)These issues are minor, but the more you play the more the game can wane on you with its initial appeal. You should play with friends to mitigate the absurd enemy hordes you'll have to fight, but not impossible for solo players.Rating of Completion/CompetenceHere is a detailed list of my scale: 1 : A bug-filled mess with zero content or missing many features. Far too early to get into the games. Also, games that get updates infrequently. 2: A game with the beginnings of ideas, yet too soon to invest any time. Check back for updates to see if things improve. (Also, games that play well but do not have all the basic features, such as promised multiplayer modes.)3: A game that is in a playable state, yet may not have all its technical issues sorted out. Features are all available--all game modes--while they may not be finalized. Games in this section are cautious recommendations to buy, so you should check the updates.4: A game that is in a playable state, technically competent, and has enough content to be worthy of purchasing right now. Features are all accounted for and the updates for the game are frequent enough to not discourage cautious buyers. Of course, the timing of these updates should be with respect to the size of the development team. 5: A game that could be considered finished. It is in the final stages of development with balancing and other last minute changes to be resolved to be fit for release.Simple Rating: 5/5, which coincides with the developer's statement that 99.9% of the game is complete.I'm willing to give this game a full raiting because the developers have earned my admiration for why EA can be a great idea if done by the right people.Detailed Rating: 19/20 or 95%Content: 5/5The only things left for the game are some polish that will make a full-release build within the first week of Feb.Quality: 5/5It's a finished productOptimization: 5/5Besides my PC being too weak to run at the max settings, I have had zero problems.Productivity: 4/5Despite the limited development team of ten and of over two years working to make Grim Dawn a great game, Crate Entertainment has been able to add meaningful content or add useful monthly updates to make the wait acceptable. They are the best example of EA I have been a part of.			"

												With a good mix of charcter classes and expansive skill trees. Grim Dawn adds to be a solid addition to the isometeric ARPG genre.  The questing seems to be done in such a way that the side quests dont seem to get in the way of the main quests. Rather, they tend to give you more of that ""since your in that area "" kinda feel.  I'd been playing  Early Access for a good a while beofre launch and watching the development process for this game quite satisfying was pretty cool. Its like PoE meets Torchlight 2.  A good combo.

								TOTALY awsome game if you ever played titan quest it's pretty much the same but ""steampunk"". ONLY problem im haveing with it is that you either build ress and health or go glascannon. UNLESS u play any build with soldier. But that bullsh*t that needs some SERIOUS look over aside it's an awsome game. And id strongly recommend to purchase it.			"

												Holy crap. After having spent more time playing this, I can say it is well worth the $25 and then some. With the variety of different classes and dual-class combinations, as well as the beautiful hand crafted map, Grim Dawn certainly sets itself up as an ARPG in it's own class. Though my hours played are low, I can honestly say that this game is not something you'll regret grabbing if you like D3 or PoE.			"

								AWSOME GAME CANT WAIT TILL ITS FINISHED. making blizzard look like a joke game runs better than d3 and plays better. Already have a game guide before the game is even finished (took blizzard a year after d3 released) that has real numbers and how the mechanics of battle work and i mean real numbers, not well u do this and things happen (pointing at blizzard) but not the way we worded it since we cant give u numbers in fear that u could point out how flawed the game is. yeah it not pretty but its supposed to look dirty.

												The thing I missed most about the first Diablo, was the atmosphere. I've got myself these days installing it back just to sit here, put the game on and listen to the music and walk through the dungeons, feeling I was there, running against this ♥♥♥♥in huge demon, It is great to see that after all these years, after me becoming older and♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game is still capable of ""fooling"" me.That said, I'd say that Grim Dawn is the first ARPG in DECADES which made me feel the way Diablo 1 does. The game is neat, well developed, with a consistent approach, innovative and old school at the same time.So, don't waste your time on reviews: if you are an old school gamer like me, or someone who wants to move away from all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games we have nowadays, buy this gem, and give yourself a goodtime.

								This game has quickly become my new favorite ARPG.  Most others here who have written reviews have been spot-on.  I placed Diablo 3 offiically into the freezer and am absolutely fired up for this dark, dingy, raw experience.This 8-man indie team has done what millions of dollars of *new* Blizzard creativity couldn't... or wouldn't. (I say *New* Blizzard because Diablo 1 and 2 were simply epic).  If you're skeptical about purchasing and are on the fence about plunging into an uncertain $25 investment because of its ""underdog"" nature, that's fine.  I was too.  The only thing I am truly wondering is where has this ARPG been for the last 10 years.  BUY THIS GAME.  You will NOT regret it.			"

												I never played Diablo, and this is the first game of its genre that I've played. With that said, I didn't know what I'd think about the game when I bought it. I decided to take a shot and try something different from what I'd normally play. And boy, was it worth it. I'm about 6 hours into the game and it is a blast. I've played games like Divinity Original Sin, but for whatever reason I just couldn't get into it. But this game was well worth the price, and probably one of the best games that I've picked up in a while.			"

								I love this game, as you can probably see from my 200+ hours of Early Access Hack'n'Slayin'! But why do I love it?Well, as you might know, Grim Dawn is the indirect predecesor of Titan Quest, which I already loved. No other game ever made the quest of legendary loot so much fun. There are a myriad of different item categories and quality levels and it always feels rewarding to get a new awesome item.Grim Dawn takes the playing principle of Titan Quest and adds some nice additional features, such as Rogue-like Dungeons, a Devotion System to enhance your character beyond just level-ups, a fraction system which gives you individual rewards based on who you are in highest favor with, and quest tables for all major faction for an infinite supply of side quest.Long story short: You always have something to do, to explore, to kill, to loot. I never get tired of playing this game and can only recommend it for anyone who has a fable for games where you can never get enouch epic loot!			"

								Okay. It's simple: If you like Titan Quest, buy Grim Dawn too. The core game design is the same - you combine classes to get some interesting builds, and you farm for legendary and epic equipment. And of course the boss drops a loot for a different build, so you start a new one. And this goes on and on and on... until you finish the game. And then you play it again on harder difficulty and you loot new stuff for different builds and you keep smashing your left mouse button and you totally enjoy the environment design and exploring new possibilites within your builds. Yes, the game looks older than the year of its release. Yes, the core game design is very similar to Titan Quest. Yes, the story is simple (although catchy). But who cares if you simply love clicking this game. Oh... and yes, the steampunk-ish settings is amazing. I totally love rushing between hordes of enemies with guns and rifles... with my enourmous two-handed sword!			"

												I myself have over 1700hours on Diablo 3 with my barbarian alone. With only 40hrs played so far, i know im going to be playing the absolute sh!t out of this game. This Game is by far my favorite arpg, it fills the void we have all had in regards to the arpg genre. As a fan of ARPG and played almost all of them, i can tell you that this game is an example how an arpg should be. Its that good.Some notes - -Simplistic controls. The spells and attacks feel good and hard hitting, the combat just has that crunch to it.-The ragdolls are the best in this game. It's too the point where its never not funny to me. Nothing better than throwing a grenado at a human and seeing them fly through the air doing the splits.The pros: - The ammount of builds you can actually do(per class)- loot table- class customizations + combination- exploration and quests- secret pathways and walls- priced very wellCons:- story is faint and inadequate- normal difficulty is a joke- some crashes here and there- no map level variations(yet)			"

								This is a Gem!!! This game brought back the feeling of being 12 sitting in font of my firends pc and finding Diablo  for the first time on gamespy ( This is not diablo..its better!).  This is what Diablo could have been, its dark, its really really bloody, and it makes you work for your loot ( unlike some games that throw loot your way to keep you playing). When you do get a new piece of shinny ( like my first epic bolt action rifle thats got flames comming from the barrel! ) you hold on tight. Its not just the shinnies though, the Boss mobs and special mobs the devs have made are not only hard♥♥♥♥♥hell, but after using up all my potions and having to flee more then once back to the desolation of the god forsaken town to use all my hard earned money for more potions to go back for another round with that flying eyeball of doom, I came to understand theres alot of work that has gone into this title. The first time I left the town it was sunny the birds were singing and the decomposing flesh was falling from the masses of dead things..truly a nice spring day, then a drop of rain then more then later its a full blown storm. Later then sun goes down and Im glad I bought that hat that increases my light radius and looks like Mathias Thullmans from one of Warhammers epic books as it gets damn dark in this beautiful gem of a game. I wont write a book because there is plenty of that inside this title. I will say this if you like Dark fantasy, Fintlock weapons, the occult, the world is at an end. Shinny loot. Choices that affect the world around you. bad♥♥♥♥♥classes like a Witch hunter ( one of the many classes you can play ) then Grim Dawn is for you! Now I must leave you my ffriends I have licked my wounds put vial of green sh#t on my dagger and polished my flaming rifle, my flesh bound off hand is whispering to me and my  flying raven is itching to get another stab at that damn eye ball again!P.s did I tell you about the shinnies and the Monsters ;).

TL;DR: A+ | Grim Dawn is sexy. Lots of shiny loot and foes to explode into a bloody mist. For only 25$, it promises hours of addictive dungeon crawling fun.Grim Dawn is one of the most addicting ARPGs you'll play on Steam. There is much offered here: atmosphere, lore, phat loot, a simple-yet-robust skill tree/stat system, and plenty of Action Role Playing Gaming to go around.Atmosphere >>The world of Cairn is painted as a desolate place pushed past the brink of a destructive extinction. Lands are varied in their construction: from dry fields, to swampy meadows, to dank dungeons and haunted ruins (and more), every act offers a multitude of wellcrafted areas to explore, farm and quest in. Not only is there variation, but every level is relatively large in size. There's -lots- of content here. There's also really good music. Sounding somewhat gothic, most of the instrumentals used set the mood of Cairn appropriately. Everything feels dark and helpless, yet at the same time there's enough tempo/rock to reinforce that you're a badass battling hordes of zombies..and WINNING. So while the ambience may be grim, there's also a twinge of hope. I thought the music was really effective.Lore >>If you appreciate a good story, you'll really enjoy the writing in Grim Dawn. If you're a mid-20s gamer like me, you probably played many RPGs on the PSX and the SNES/N64. One thing I miss alot about those games is that they never really had voice acting. You had to read what they said--so effectively you were playing an animated book. Grim Dawn doesn't really use any voiceovers except for combat sounds and phrases. I actually think this adds to the charm of the game. I always feel that with any kind of visual art, a percentage of what is produced for the viewer should be left to be made within the viewer's own mind. Being able to read through quests and journal entries and not hear someone read it for me allows for a much more immersive experience in regards to the backdrop of Cairn. The stories are dark and ominous, filled with political intrigue, blood, torture, lust and murder. If you've read The Sword of Truth or Game of Thrones series, you'll find the lore in Grim Dawn addicting. Sometime at the beginning of Act 3, I began wishing that they would release a Grim Dawn novel. I'd buy it.I read a comment that said this game didn't have much lore to offer; I couldn't disagree more. The Survivors of Burrwitch,  The Survivors of Homestead, The Amalgamation and The Herald, The Investigations of Inquisitor Creed, An Arkovian History, The Torture of Uroboruuk, The Prison of Warden Krieg, the battle between The Order of Death's Vigil and Kymon's Follower--these are just some of the journal entries you'll collect throughout the world; you get the idea! LOTS of stuff here to read and enjoy. Phat Loot >>You can't not fill up your inventory in 20 minutes in this game. It's impossible to go broke/not have gear/not have materials to craft. Everything is vendorable and almost everything except rare components is purchasable. The gear, depending on rarity, will also have various stats and spells attached to it. Some items will give you the ability to cast a fireball or summon a pillar of lightning from the sky, others will allow you to repulse enemies or lay pools of poison at their feet should they attack you. The gear is buff and it definitely feels rewarding whenever you finally pull a nice upgrade from a tough mob that you've been dying to. You may also craft gear at the Blacksmith starting in Act 3, but be ready to spend lots of iron bits and scrap metal. The Blacksmith is the brother of RNGesus, so you may either get a semi-decent item or an AMAZING item when one clicks the ""combine"" button on the Blacksmithing menu. With the availability of scrap and iron bits in the game though, you can go out and farm for an hour or two and have a considerable amount of resources to play with in order to get something exceptional.Skills/Stats >>There are 3 basic stats in the game: Physique, Cunning, Spirit--upon getting enough XP to complete a level, you earn 1 point that is allocatable to one of these. Physique offers HP, HP Regen, Higher Armor Class, and Critical Hit Avoidance; Cunning increases your specialized melee/ranged damage types (Bleeding, Piercing, Internal Trauma), Accuracy, and Critical Hit Chance; Spirit increases your Energy(MP), Energy Regen, Bonus Magic Damage, Duration Modifier, and affinity with Enchanted Items. Apart from the 3 primary stats are numerous stats and modifiers related to gear. These are too varied to list here, but these are only affected by gear and skill selection and are not innate to your character but only to the class you choose.There are 6 classes to choose from: Arcanist, Shaman, Soldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade. Each specializes in a weapon type or element type (all can use -any- weapon they desire, classes just have skills that give them proficiencies in certain weapon types over others). From summing massive beasts made of bramble and thorns, to drowning your opponents in pools of flame, piercing them with shards of aetherial energy, or cleaving crowds of manticores in two with a massive two-handed sword.. Grim Dawn fills any niche you desire.Your class isn't chosen at Character selection. Instead, you're allowed to select your class from the skill tree by pressing C and allocating points into any skill tree you want. You can select a second class after level 10 (if you wish). Every class has about 5-6 skill paths, sometimes more, each path with 3-6 skills each. You can mix and match from any skill path, so long as a skill that you want doesn't require another skill in its path that you don't have any points in.I prefer to do minimalistic builds when I play ARPGs, so most of my emphasis on my character is in Passive stats/aurus with only 2 real skills that I use consistently. However, you can craft your character just like an MMO if you wish and have all 10 keys on your hotbar occupied.ARPG >>This game is an ARPG at its very core. Isometric camera, a dark world, plenty of dungeon crawling/roguelike (although if you have a rift open, you don't need to start dungeons over from the very beginning upon death), rich story, tons of atmosphere. If you enjoyed Baldur's Gate, Sacrifice, Divinity, Diablo, Ultima Online, Elder Scrolls, etc. You will enjoy Grim Dawn.Conclusion Worth every penny. If it had a full price sticker ($59.99), it'd still be worth every cent..and then some. Support Crate and buy a copy today!			"

								I've been following this game since the Kickstarted campaign started. I normally don't buy EA titles but after the ""Content Complete"" update I just couldn't resist.This is a masterpiece, this is what an ARPG should be. Unlimited skill customization, amazing character progression, well done loot system, extensive lore, great physics and hit feeling. 9.5/10P.S. Even on christmas day, devs released a hotfix. They're working all the time and I suggest you to check their website, they actually care about their players and implement any wanted features or suggestions. They deserve a lot better, help them out fellow gamers.			"

								Kill, Loot, Repeat.  Even though it is in early access this game seems polished with some minor hiccups.  Only issues I ran into were the random crashes.  I can deal with these since they were few and far between.  The only one that sucked was when I was in the final area almost at the main boss.  We had an issue with MP as well one night, but after a server reboot this was fixed with 24 hours.  All in all, if you are a fan of the ARPG games, this is worth the pick up.  Lots of loot, lots of choices, and some cool classes.  The game was a lot longer then I thought it would be, which was nice to see.  The guys at Crate did a great job with this title.  Good luck with the release!			"

								A very enjoyable ARPG. Synergic abilities make for a lot of experimenting with dual-classing - you can mix any two come level 12. To compliment your abilities there are components you can apply to items (one per), and if you find several of them and combine them into a more powerful version they grant additional stats and usually an ability. Monster slaying feels visceral and crisp, bosses are powerful yet manageable and the story is quite engaging, if somewhat grim. No crashes and almost no bugs even though it's still in alpha status. From RPS: ""a truer heir to Diablo 1&2 than any of its recent rivals (...) very adeptly filling a vacuum in our gaming lives."" Highly recommended!			"

								Grim Dawn is hugely enjoyable and satisfying. The gameplay is visceral and engaging unlike other games I will mention - Diablo 3 - which I've just given another go up to level 50 on expert. Diablo 3 feels like a game by the numbers made by people just going through the motions. Grim Dawn oozes creativity and clever touches both visually and in terms of gameplay. There is no comparison really - I know which I'd choose!I hope the makers of Grim Dawn can find a way to keep adding equally inspired content - I would happily pay more for this.Congratulations on ARPG perfection!

								I will likely ammend this as I play, but WOW WOW WOW. Before I nought this game at a price I usually stay away from, I checked out the reviews- not a negative one. No thumbs down and a slow evening made me want this one. It is wondrous, lots of shooting and slashing in a world mixed with fantasy, apocalypse and a good helping of steampunk. All in all, it is a great mix of Diablo, Fate and a lot of Torchlight, a wondrous romp that I cannot wait until Multiplayer. If you are one of those old-schoolers, the die hard rpg's that made the genre this one is for you.			"

Early Access Review
								I have now finished my first play through of the Alpha of Grim Dawn, levelling one character to 23rd level and played approx 20hrs. Despite its Alpha status, I have not come across any ground breaking bugs, and only seen one or two glitches.The Alpha contains only one Act so far and a max cap of 25th level, and is missing some character classes. Graphics======The graphics themselves for maps and models seem to be lifted from Titan Quest, which is not a bad thing as they were bloody good, but that was 6+ years ago now. Look at Van Helsing and Path of Exile for superb looking maps and characters. The underground maps look excellent though, I am not sure what is different, but they look better than there above ground counterpart – perhaps due to the lighting which is done very well.A day/night cycle adds to the atmosphere on the above ground maps though, along with weather effects such as rain/lightning.This seems overally critical, but I think my main point is that the creatures and NPCs blend into the background too much. While this is fine for cover and surprise, when your own character blends in……its all a bit 'grainy' for want of a better word.Maps====Very good – hardly feels linear at all, with plenty of ‘side’ areas and doubling back. The map itself is a HUGE area, with littered chaos gates/portals to access. The map screen is pitiful though, opening a small window rather than take over the whole screen and you cannot zoom out enough to see the whole area.There is a good variation on villages, hills, swamps, caves, rocky areas, and like all ARPGs, back pedalling as you hit a blockage in the 'maze' and have to re-path. As mentioned the Day/Night cycle changes things slightly.As in TQ, you can also move the whole map around to rotate the map (click and hold with middle mouse then swing left or tight) which is handy, as sometimes doorways are lost as they do not automatically highlight – chests etc can also be hidden in corners so rotating the map can be helpful every so often.A locked door in a mountain caused me to look up what it is, and apparently the consequences of a quest I did means the map behind the door is locked to me – which is annoying as there are supposed to be hard mobs and a greater chance at better loot behind it.Mobs====Some nice variations. Mobs have different attacks, some are quicker, they have fire, poison, freezing, stunning attacks, guns and spells...there has also random starred mobs - a big mini boss. Checking the forums it seems that there are over 70 bosses in this act alone. These bosses have templates of other creatures – a Werewolf may have freezing powers etc.Mobs swarm, appear from behind you and you generally need good crowd control.A spider is misnamed though – the leaping spider actually runs quickly at you rather than leaps.Spiders, werewolves and rats, zombies are slightly overused, while the Humans, sonic birds and giant things are not, but there are plenty of different mobs to keep you happy. Skill Tree & Classes==============A direct copy of TQ, one or two classes picked which you then sink points into the class itself thus allowing you to pick appropriately levelled skills. Basically, you get three points per level (curiously, the first few levels I got 6, 5 then 4 then 3 per level - unsure if a bug or not) to put into skill points. You can level the class, and as you get to 5, 10, 15 etc points these open up class skills. So a class skill such as the Raven requires 5 points in Occultist, and then you can unlock points in the Raven skill itself.There is only one default attack which is a shame - you cannot mix attacks like you could in Van Helsing or Path of Exile. I may be missing something, but I could not see a class description of my character, so unsure what stats she is supposed to be picking - something along the lines of ""Demolitionists use cunning for ranged weapons blah blah blah"" something I could ignore if I wanted to Melee, but advice nonetheless. Loot====A HUGE amount as should be expected from the makers of TQ. Multiple stats make your pour over items as you are unsure if it increases your character and the broken token pieces have returned from TQ - combine 3 together to get a full strength one that has a bonus skill or added stats. You unlock extra backpack space as in TQ, and there is a shared loot stash should you need it. Stats are not the only thing as resistances and regen also to be considered.Yellow > Green > Blue items, and upgraded token pieces as well.I have not seen anything that allows crafting of any kind yet, but there was nothing in TQ either. It seems as though TQ Defiler and TQ Vault may also have Grim Dawn variations soon as well for all those of you that love to level multiple level 70 characters.Gameplay=======Really enjoyed it. Classic TQ. Which in itself is a problem as this is Grim Dawn and it needs its own stamp – change the front load screen to something different would be a great start as it is identical to TQ. Re-arrange the skill tree – not the mechanics, the presentation of it so that its not TQ. Roll on Act II…. "

								As a player of Titan Quest for many hundreds of hours I was really excited when I found out that Grim Dawn was being created. So recently I bought the game and have been playing it quite a few hours now. Firstly anyone expecting to get an updated TQ is in for a shock. While the game has the same top down viewpoint the game is quite different. The look and feel of the game are similar but GD is certainly no clone. Its post apocolyptic look is fantastic and the chracters are very different in their abilities. The game sometimes is a little uneven (savepoints) and at times you can be overwhelmed by enemies and the level you are at seems too weak to deal with so many enemies at once. You have to learn how to deal with that. I have played all of the content so far with a number of variations of character and it will be up to you to work out which way to play the game. This is one of the best parts of the game as it definitely has replay value in abundance I am certainly not disappointed with GD as it is a great game in its own right.  I would certainly recommend anyone to buy this.			"

												Firstly, I must say I backed this on kickstarter so I naturally may have some biases towards my love of this game. Grim Dawn is likely one of the best aRPG games I have played in recent years. To explore this I think I will break it down into several areas- World, Loot, Usablity and Progression. World wise, the game runs a single continous map which only has loading screens when you either warp far away or enter a dungeon. Besides that you could technically run through every map- to every town- in one swoop. It feels very similar to Diablo 2 or Torchlight 2- but with the middle travel sections cut out. Each act has a significantly different terrain to explore with different colours and props. You move from a swamp, to a desert, to a farmland, to a ice world, to a cthulia-esque demon area, to a almost C&C tiberium style crystal world. Each section of the world seems fresh, vibrant and interesting because of this. There is a massive variety of monsters and some which are reused for good story reasons... There is just so much to love about this world. But one thing stands out most of all to me. It isn't always dark. With a game with a title like ""Grim Dawn"" I was expecting a ton of grim darkness- and while that certainly resonates in the theme and props of the world, the game sports a full day-night cycle which basically just makes the colours of the world come alive. I appreciate that SO much it isn't funny. Loot wise... It has a nice progression, it has loot colour filters and it has a lot of different rarities. While the loot you receive may not be as crazy as say, torchlight 2, it is really smart about how it does the loot. Legendary items are always exciting to get- and they actually allow you to find ""empowered"" versions of the epics you found at lower levels. While there may not be as much variety as some games in the genre- they seem to constantly add more and use what they do have very competently. Usability- this is where the game SHINES. Just when I thought the pet system of torchlight 2 couldn't be beaten- here comes grim dawn. In grim dawn you can freely make portals anywhere, any time. You are mid dungeon run? Teleport back to town and empty out- need to get from one town to another? Use a portal. Too lazy to warp back to the main portal to portal to another portal? Use a portal. They require no mana, no items, they just.. work. I couldn't have imagined just how valuable this ability was until I had a chance to experience it. But besides that there are so many other little features we have found that just make playing grim dawn a pleasure. Loot filters, point by point respec, massive expandable inventory and shared stash, likely many other things I have taken for granted and forgotten. Either way it plays really well.Finally, Progression. Each level you gain stat and skill points- standard affair- up to level 85. Stat points are as you would expect, they provide broad boosts to various areas while also providing you with the points required to equip better and better items- cool. Skills- interesting. Because you can combo two of any class it is up to you to decide what you prefer. Do you like to summon creatures? Perhaps go for Occultist/Shaman? Want a bit more magical oomph? Try throwing an archanist in there instead. Each class has a sprinkling of both passive and active skills and toggle skills all of which may be upgraded over time. This allows people to really play how they want- when I as an occultist/shaman looked at my Nightblade/Solider friend we were shocked to see the differences. His tree was filled with passives and lots of active abilities- while mine had no passives, only a few actives and a massive amount of points to upgrade existing skills. Add in the ""devotion"" system you gain points for by fixing shrines and you have a lot of variety in what you can do. Even loot has intersting levels of progression, it often becomes a choice between higher stat boosts/other interesting effects and higher skills. It just requires a lot of tweaking and playing with, but you can really construct a nice character. There is one more final point I wish to touch on here. Okay so when the game was ""content complete"" me and a friend powered through 50 hours of this game together and in doing so only reached around act 3? Months later we came back together and decided to keep on playing. Now, a lot had changed, but we were still able to pick up exactly where we left off and keep playing. It took us less then half an hour to get our bearings and come back to playing it. This may not sound like much, but honestly the ability to quickly start playing again is something which I really loved about the game. When we went to play torchlight 2 again for example, we kept starting new characters- it just- didn't work nearly as well for the runback. It may not be much, but I really feel that this trait is a very positive one. Overall, I really loved this game. It is by far one of the best kickstarters I have EVER backed and I look forward to seeing what they do with it next. Promised free content upgrade in june sounds good- I know at least one paid expansion pack will be in the works thanks to my kickstarter pledge- but overall I really hope this game gets improved upon for years to come.

Early Access Review
								I have now finished my first play through of the Alpha of Grim Dawn, levelling one character to 23rd level and played approx 20hrs. Despite its Alpha status, I have not come across any ground breaking bugs, and only seen one or two glitches.The Alpha contains only one Act so far and a max cap of 25th level, and is missing some character classes. Graphics======The graphics themselves for maps and models seem to be lifted from Titan Quest, which is not a bad thing as they were bloody good, but that was 6+ years ago now. Look at Van Helsing and Path of Exile for superb looking maps and characters. The underground maps look excellent though, I am not sure what is different, but they look better than there above ground counterpart – perhaps due to the lighting which is done very well.A day/night cycle adds to the atmosphere on the above ground maps though, along with weather effects such as rain/lightning.This seems overally critical, but I think my main point is that the creatures and NPCs blend into the background too much. While this is fine for cover and surprise, when your own character blends in……its all a bit 'grainy' for want of a better word.Maps====Very good – hardly feels linear at all, with plenty of ‘side’ areas and doubling back. The map itself is a HUGE area, with littered chaos gates/portals to access. The map screen is pitiful though, opening a small window rather than take over the whole screen and you cannot zoom out enough to see the whole area.There is a good variation on villages, hills, swamps, caves, rocky areas, and like all ARPGs, back pedalling as you hit a blockage in the 'maze' and have to re-path. As mentioned the Day/Night cycle changes things slightly.As in TQ, you can also move the whole map around to rotate the map (click and hold with middle mouse then swing left or tight) which is handy, as sometimes doorways are lost as they do not automatically highlight – chests etc can also be hidden in corners so rotating the map can be helpful every so often.A locked door in a mountain caused me to look up what it is, and apparently the consequences of a quest I did means the map behind the door is locked to me – which is annoying as there are supposed to be hard mobs and a greater chance at better loot behind it.Mobs====Some nice variations. Mobs have different attacks, some are quicker, they have fire, poison, freezing, stunning attacks, guns and spells...there has also random starred mobs - a big mini boss. Checking the forums it seems that there are over 70 bosses in this act alone. These bosses have templates of other creatures – a Werewolf may have freezing powers etc.Mobs swarm, appear from behind you and you generally need good crowd control.A spider is misnamed though – the leaping spider actually runs quickly at you rather than leaps.Spiders, werewolves and rats, zombies are slightly overused, while the Humans, sonic birds and giant things are not, but there are plenty of different mobs to keep you happy. Skill Tree & Classes==============A direct copy of TQ, one or two classes picked which you then sink points into the class itself thus allowing you to pick appropriately levelled skills. Basically, you get three points per level (curiously, the first few levels I got 6, 5 then 4 then 3 per level - unsure if a bug or not) to put into skill points. You can level the class, and as you get to 5, 10, 15 etc points these open up class skills. So a class skill such as the Raven requires 5 points in Occultist, and then you can unlock points in the Raven skill itself.There is only one default attack which is a shame - you cannot mix attacks like you could in Van Helsing or Path of Exile. I may be missing something, but I could not see a class description of my character, so unsure what stats she is supposed to be picking - something along the lines of ""Demolitionists use cunning for ranged weapons blah blah blah"" something I could ignore if I wanted to Melee, but advice nonetheless. Loot====A HUGE amount as should be expected from the makers of TQ. Multiple stats make your pour over items as you are unsure if it increases your character and the broken token pieces have returned from TQ - combine 3 together to get a full strength one that has a bonus skill or added stats. You unlock extra backpack space as in TQ, and there is a shared loot stash should you need it. Stats are not the only thing as resistances and regen also to be considered.Yellow > Green > Blue items, and upgraded token pieces as well.I have not seen anything that allows crafting of any kind yet, but there was nothing in TQ either. It seems as though TQ Defiler and TQ Vault may also have Grim Dawn variations soon as well for all those of you that love to level multiple level 70 characters.Gameplay=======Really enjoyed it. Classic TQ. Which in itself is a problem as this is Grim Dawn and it needs its own stamp – change the front load screen to something different would be a great start as it is identical to TQ. Re-arrange the skill tree – not the mechanics, the presentation of it so that its not TQ. Roll on Act II…. "

												Firstly, I must say I backed this on kickstarter so I naturally may have some biases towards my love of this game. Grim Dawn is likely one of the best aRPG games I have played in recent years. To explore this I think I will break it down into several areas- World, Loot, Usablity and Progression. World wise, the game runs a single continous map which only has loading screens when you either warp far away or enter a dungeon. Besides that you could technically run through every map- to every town- in one swoop. It feels very similar to Diablo 2 or Torchlight 2- but with the middle travel sections cut out. Each act has a significantly different terrain to explore with different colours and props. You move from a swamp, to a desert, to a farmland, to a ice world, to a cthulia-esque demon area, to a almost C&C tiberium style crystal world. Each section of the world seems fresh, vibrant and interesting because of this. There is a massive variety of monsters and some which are reused for good story reasons... There is just so much to love about this world. But one thing stands out most of all to me. It isn't always dark. With a game with a title like ""Grim Dawn"" I was expecting a ton of grim darkness- and while that certainly resonates in the theme and props of the world, the game sports a full day-night cycle which basically just makes the colours of the world come alive. I appreciate that SO much it isn't funny. Loot wise... It has a nice progression, it has loot colour filters and it has a lot of different rarities. While the loot you receive may not be as crazy as say, torchlight 2, it is really smart about how it does the loot. Legendary items are always exciting to get- and they actually allow you to find ""empowered"" versions of the epics you found at lower levels. While there may not be as much variety as some games in the genre- they seem to constantly add more and use what they do have very competently. Usability- this is where the game SHINES. Just when I thought the pet system of torchlight 2 couldn't be beaten- here comes grim dawn. In grim dawn you can freely make portals anywhere, any time. You are mid dungeon run? Teleport back to town and empty out- need to get from one town to another? Use a portal. Too lazy to warp back to the main portal to portal to another portal? Use a portal. They require no mana, no items, they just.. work. I couldn't have imagined just how valuable this ability was until I had a chance to experience it. But besides that there are so many other little features we have found that just make playing grim dawn a pleasure. Loot filters, point by point respec, massive expandable inventory and shared stash, likely many other things I have taken for granted and forgotten. Either way it plays really well.Finally, Progression. Each level you gain stat and skill points- standard affair- up to level 85. Stat points are as you would expect, they provide broad boosts to various areas while also providing you with the points required to equip better and better items- cool. Skills- interesting. Because you can combo two of any class it is up to you to decide what you prefer. Do you like to summon creatures? Perhaps go for Occultist/Shaman? Want a bit more magical oomph? Try throwing an archanist in there instead. Each class has a sprinkling of both passive and active skills and toggle skills all of which may be upgraded over time. This allows people to really play how they want- when I as an occultist/shaman looked at my Nightblade/Solider friend we were shocked to see the differences. His tree was filled with passives and lots of active abilities- while mine had no passives, only a few actives and a massive amount of points to upgrade existing skills. Add in the ""devotion"" system you gain points for by fixing shrines and you have a lot of variety in what you can do. Even loot has intersting levels of progression, it often becomes a choice between higher stat boosts/other interesting effects and higher skills. It just requires a lot of tweaking and playing with, but you can really construct a nice character. There is one more final point I wish to touch on here. Okay so when the game was ""content complete"" me and a friend powered through 50 hours of this game together and in doing so only reached around act 3? Months later we came back together and decided to keep on playing. Now, a lot had changed, but we were still able to pick up exactly where we left off and keep playing. It took us less then half an hour to get our bearings and come back to playing it. This may not sound like much, but honestly the ability to quickly start playing again is something which I really loved about the game. When we went to play torchlight 2 again for example, we kept starting new characters- it just- didn't work nearly as well for the runback. It may not be much, but I really feel that this trait is a very positive one. Overall, I really loved this game. It is by far one of the best kickstarters I have EVER backed and I look forward to seeing what they do with it next. Promised free content upgrade in june sounds good- I know at least one paid expansion pack will be in the works thanks to my kickstarter pledge- but overall I really hope this game gets improved upon for years to come.

								I will likely ammend this as I play, but WOW WOW WOW. Before I nought this game at a price I usually stay away from, I checked out the reviews- not a negative one. No thumbs down and a slow evening made me want this one. It is wondrous, lots of shooting and slashing in a world mixed with fantasy, apocalypse and a good helping of steampunk. All in all, it is a great mix of Diablo, Fate and a lot of Torchlight, a wondrous romp that I cannot wait until Multiplayer. If you are one of those old-schoolers, the die hard rpg's that made the genre this one is for you.			"

								As a player of Titan Quest for many hundreds of hours I was really excited when I found out that Grim Dawn was being created. So recently I bought the game and have been playing it quite a few hours now. Firstly anyone expecting to get an updated TQ is in for a shock. While the game has the same top down viewpoint the game is quite different. The look and feel of the game are similar but GD is certainly no clone. Its post apocolyptic look is fantastic and the chracters are very different in their abilities. The game sometimes is a little uneven (savepoints) and at times you can be overwhelmed by enemies and the level you are at seems too weak to deal with so many enemies at once. You have to learn how to deal with that. I have played all of the content so far with a number of variations of character and it will be up to you to work out which way to play the game. This is one of the best parts of the game as it definitely has replay value in abundance I am certainly not disappointed with GD as it is a great game in its own right.  I would certainly recommend anyone to buy this.			"

								Kill, Loot, Repeat.  Even though it is in early access this game seems polished with some minor hiccups.  Only issues I ran into were the random crashes.  I can deal with these since they were few and far between.  The only one that sucked was when I was in the final area almost at the main boss.  We had an issue with MP as well one night, but after a server reboot this was fixed with 24 hours.  All in all, if you are a fan of the ARPG games, this is worth the pick up.  Lots of loot, lots of choices, and some cool classes.  The game was a lot longer then I thought it would be, which was nice to see.  The guys at Crate did a great job with this title.  Good luck with the release!			"

No doubt most of the game you are just mindlessly killing pixels, however the ability to choose two classes, with a multitude of skills and the devotion tree where you can further specialize, make this title worth picking up.I was shocked to learn only a handful of people designed and released this game, I could have sworn that it was put together with a team. Picked this up for the regular price of 25 bucks and it has been worth every penny.			"

Early Access Review
								Grim Dawn:The only game i bought Early AccessI love ARPG's,i played games like Diablo 2 when i was young,and in recent years games like Titan Quest,Torchlight 1 and 2,and Path of Exile.But i don't think any of them(maybe not even D2..) has hit *that* snare like Grim Dawn.I cannot explain it,it just feels amazing to hack into enemies,and launch explosives that gibs them apart as if it's a TF2 match!Not to mention the fact that while it ""suffers"" from the ARPG problem of 99% of loot being junk money and 1% being good,it's higher tier loot(Epics..Legendaries..the potential higher loot tier that some people have been speculated will be implemented) actually differenciates itself from the lower tier loot with things like a bit of backstory lore associated with it,having unique skills and passives and generally feeling more powerful than yellows and greens.Pros- Combat,it's meaty,bloody and feels great,physics are a big part for a successful combat system,and that is where some games completely miss the plank and either have almost no physics or just do it so silly it's out of place and weird.Grim Dawn somehow manages to strike a good balance between silly and badass physics,you can literally launch people onto roofs if you throw an explosive under their feet but you can also send them flying for abit when doing a melee crit!-Loot,as earlier explained it's loot is great,has unique art,personally a big one for me since i loved it in D2 and such. There are exceptions to the rule of course but i feel i'm still too much of a noob to really go into detail and know what i'm talking about-Skills! Here is where TQ's heritage comes to shine,even the skill layout screen looks similar! For those not familiar with TQ's skill system,basicly you have two classes,you choose one at level 2(?) and then another one at level 10,and you can freely invest skill points into both and you can come up with some really cool combo's.I have a Commando,which is a combination of the Demolitionist and Soldier classes,combining sweet passives and some skills from Soldier with the explosive skills from Demolitionist,and 2handing,and it actually works,it's pretty much a build i concocted on my own as i played and it works,i'm occassionally struggling against an enemy hero but not enough that it's impossible/annoyingly idiotic to beat them.The game also has some cons for me,but mostly pet peeves/non important issues-Bugs,currently the game only has one major bug for me and many others,and that is that large battles get REALLY laggy,as in it drops from solid 60 to 20 and even lower sometimes depening on the amount of spells and enemies on the screen.However Crate seems to be adressing this.-Setting,personally it's not my thing,i preferred the more ""tangible"" world of TQ over that of Grim Dawn but it's tolerable,if not abit generic(yay zombies and spiders...!)-Spiders,yes you heard me,stop putting these idiots in games,and stop making them so damn big! It's bad enough i have to see them when i'm showering x3-Difficulty,both in it's structure and normal's difficulty,never had i experience a game which was so extremely easy i only died 4 times throughout the whole campaign,and 2 of those were due to me either being distracted IRL or AFK.Potions abundant,enemies falling in a single hit most of the time..but oh boy then Elite comes across the field and just dropkicks you right in the stomach! Which brings me to the fact i cannot choose my desired difficulty from the start,in place there is a Diablo 2 style difficulty increase through multiple playthroughs,starting when you beat the final boss you get the option to jump into the next difficulty.Tolerable though i wouldn't lie if i said either make normal more difficult or give us an option to just jump into a new difficultywith new characters starting at roughly the average level at which you unlock a difficulty.However in the end i CANNOT recommend this game enough,i love so many things about it,it's easy to get into,and most systems are clear,well explained but hard to master if you decide to play the game through on the later difficulties(and it will kick your♥♥♥♥♥from time to time on those difficulties...Salazar......)But i heartly recommend this game despite some of it's design decissions i feel are abit archaic,because in place there are a lot of quality of life improvements like no TP/Indentify scroll and the fact the map remembers where you were and grays out areas you have been your previous session.Also apparently i do not know how to end revies properly. :DI'd say buy the game and give it a swing,if you don't like it you can always refund it ^^ "

I would much rather it be a fast pasce till say mid elite to ulimate and the it slows down bacuse I just don't want to grind in the early game. It has tons of content but if you want to spend 2 hrs a night playing good luck getting anywhere. This game is for the hardcore no life and not the casual. It's really sad too coz I wanted to experiment more.			"

								I backed this game back when it was on Kickstarter and can honestly say it was some of the best money I've ever spent. The crew at Crate were very fortunate to get their hands on the Titan Quest engine and have been able to spend their resources on expanding content, improving visuals, and making this game even greater than what was promised. This is the game that Diablo 3 should have been... dark, foreboding, and visceral (not a cartoony WoW influenced shell of what Diablo 2 was). Don't get me wrong, Crate isn't Blizzard and this game isn't Diablo. Yet for a studio that grew from 1-2 individuals this game is astounding, and it isn't done yet! If you love ARPGs, you will love this. There is a ton of content already out there so don't hesitate to purchase Early Access. Kudos to Crate for delivering 150% on the promises they made during their Kickstarter years ago! [100 hours played, every class to at least level 30, playing the new Arcanist class right now]			"

								Grim Dawn is a perfect game to refresh the hack and slash genre, ever since the hack and slash genre took a bad turn (*cough* Diablo 3 *cough*)But, it brings back that Diablo 2 feeling, which is great, smooth gameplay, and the ability to combine 2 classes makes it really cool and special, sort of like Path of Exile where you can make your own builds.I felt the story telling could be alot better, but overall, it tells a better story than diablo 3 anyday -.-I highly recommend this game for veterans or newcomers of the hack and slash genre, and its a great game to lose yourself in10/10 - IGN			"

								Im kinda new to this genre, having only played Torchlight II, and i decided to give a shot to this game, only by seeing the screenshots and how the user reviews were fine. It ended up being a nice shot.Its an action rpg. Its like an action game, which uses a point and click engine, but with tons of RPG elements, like itens, classes, a level system and a classic arpg camera. I found this game to be much deeper and harder than Torchlight II. Grim Dawn's story is rich, it contains choice and consequence elements and its very complete, with good side quests, factions and different characters you can interact with. There are 6 classes, but since you can choose to be 2 of them, there are a good number of combinations. My char. is a Witch Blade: Soldier and Occultist. The graphics are okay, i personally prefer the style of Torchlight II, but this is me. Since the game recently came out of early acess, there are minor bugs across the game, a lot of them are minor graphic bugs, since the map is huge. And i suffered some FPS drops in some big fights. There is a very complex skill system, which you can use to improve your char, by discovering shrines across the game, which ables you to choose ""Constellations"" to give special traits to your char. Well, its a very simple review. I reccomend this game if you like the genre or if you wanna try something new.			"

												Well...What can I say? I can only stutter and mumble trying to say something informative about this masterpiece. So, basically, this is the best ARPG on the market at the moment. Is it better than Torchlight? Of course. Is it better than PoE? In my opinion - yes, but it is also a different game so maybe I'm being too harsh. Is it better than Diablo 3? Hahahah, about 200x better. That's all I can muster without screaming AMAGAD DIS GAEM FTW BEST GAEM EVAR BUI NAW!P.S. I need to sleep now. I've been playing for 15h without a pause.P.P.S.

								Do i recommend this game.. Actually yes, I have been reading the Reviews on the shisty 4 to 5 non-recommend reviews, and non of them are at all useful, There all staring at graphics, and not game play, there complaining about a broken old 12 year old enigine, remodled and """"masked over"""" which is 100% not true, i been following as a legendary owner of the game for yearssss... And i watched as the built new physics and new abilites to the old engine, An engine is just that an engine, its 100% re-scriptable and 100% graphics mod-able... Soo these reviews are relentless and done by morons with no time.. Except one was pretty honest on his feelings. The point is, this is a real game, this isnt some game you pick up play for 5 mins and beat it. cause the graphics are pretty, or its ment for pure multiplayer death matching, like every dumb♥♥♥♥♥FPS game out there is... This is hard-core ARPG.. hell took me 12 hours just to be act 1, and search everything and figure things out.. The game is worth it, I also dont look at graphics, i prefer a good long story, and bout 45 hours of game play when i 1st run through.. and this game will deliver just that.. IT's still alpha, and myself is waiting for multiplayer to come in, so i can hang and play with other deep hardcore players of the ARPG genre... Dont listen to whinners, they'll find something wrong with any game... because its not the game they want... my quote for that is ""DONT LIKE IT, Wanna WHINE about it, LEARN TO MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN GAME""... Stop looking for (graphics) and start looking for what games where and still should be.. (gameplay, options, length, and story).. Not oh the graphic are out dated, i dont wanna play it.. psh...♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Enjoy guys, its worth it.			"

								After 160hrs of play time, now make that over 600hrs, I think I can recommend this now :P Right then, as others have said, if you liked Titan Quest, then you'll probably like Grim Dawn which despite claims it's just a  reskin of TQ, is actually more of a total conversion if you're silly enough to think GD is a ""mod"" that is. With better level design more polished game mechanics, quest choices that have actual game world impacts, rather than the usual +1 stat or gear, upgraded graphics and physics and some of the best ARPG artwork you'll ever see outside of Blizzard. Gameplay wise, it is very similar to TQ, with similar skills, though now we have AOE attacks outside of ye olde mage builds and the same old build synergies that gave TQ so much replay value and makes even the limited content in Grim Dawn worth replaying. Gear has more variety though, making even yellow grade stuff useful and allowing greater build depth, especially as relics give access to dual wielding melee weapons or pistols plus some components grant very useful skills. i.e. my summoner makes heavy use of the small AOE chaos bolt ability granted by void-touched ammo to carve through mobs and support their pets, while my solider tanks beautifully with health leach/draining abilities. All and all, as long as you invest in your skills etc (instead of spreading yourself thin...) you'll get fairly rewarding gameplay and delicious loot pinyata's. Of course, if you didn't like Titan Quest, then all of this will likely be a turn off, also the game starts off a bit slow, with some of the more fun stuff locked deep into each classes mastery's, albeit the ease of swapping out points makes this less of an issue, and usually there's some abilities early on that are quite effective if invested heavily in. Other issues as of build 24 is a still unresolved performance issue for some nvidia GPU users, which also occurs with Titan Quest and the usually fps drops from very dense mobs. Some users may also experience stuttering due to background I/O operations messy with loading of assets. All and all, this is an early access game that stands out as what early access should look like, fun, relatively stable and shining with promise from gameplay that already works and so is well worth the US$25 price of admission.[updated to build 24 + errors]			"

												The nicest thing I can say about the game is that it's very divisive.  I know the people that love this game love this game: the game was funded it via kickstarter and it was in early access for a long time.  The people who want this game know exactly what they're getting into, but for those same reasons the rest of us will find it lacking.  It's a loot based RPG, in the vein of your Diablo IIs and Torchlights, but it is also what I would consider needlessly complicated. For example, there are eight types of damage, but many of the damage types go by multiple names: you don't take fire damage over time you take Burn damage, okay that make sense I guess.  Chaos damage or ""Damage from Chthonian Beings"" They both start with C at least.  But you can also take Cold or Frostfire damage.  That seems like an odd choice.  Was it in a novel or something?Each class has access to 10 or so ""Active abilities,"" plus another half dozen or so passive ones.  Not bad!  Except that each ability has 12 levels of improvement for you to sink points into.  And then the majority of the active abilities have multiple passive upgrades for you to throw 12 more points into.  And you have to use those same points to level up your ""mastery"" stat to gain access to the new abilities and upgrades for your class.    And Ten levels in they have you pick a second class. Fortunately you can respec.  For a small cost.  One point at a time.  At an NPC sitting in a corner that no one as much as mentions ""Hey you should go talk to that Witch maybe."" Oh and you can further improve your character with Devotion points, which are completely different points used on a completely different screen. It's not that I mind a complicated game, but complexity does not equal depth.  No matter how many points you throw at it.  None of the various complex systems are explained overly well, nor do they make much of an effort to dole these systems out in parts so you can come to terms with any of them.  Oh hey you unlocked the Blacksmith?  Here is a list of the 60+ items he can make for you.  Some of them for items slots you might not even know you have.  Or requiring items that the blacksmith himself has to make from a handful of other crafting materials.  Oh, also all the crafting materials can be used to grant bonuses to an item.  The item that can augmented depends on the crafting material on a case by case bases.  Good thing you have that sizeable stash they never actually tell you about, hope you spend the time to explore the opening base.   People who love this game will love all of this, and they will mock me for being too casual or some such business.   Which is fine, the game isn't for me and I'm glad they enjoy it.  But don't come into this game because D3 is between seasons and you like loot based games. If you do pick up the game, do so because you hate that Diablo 2 became Diablo 3 and Torchlight was too jovial for your tasteEdit: There seems to be some confusion relating to my confusion.  I did not find the mechanics confusing, I found them complicated.  That complication does not add to my enjoyment of the game.  Yes, the internet exists, at any point I am but a few keystrokes away from infinite knowledge of a given subject.  That does not mean that gameplay mechanics should be designed and implemented without elegance. Yes the respec Witch does have a quest she offers you, but no other NPC ever mentions her and she is alone up in a corner of the starting camp.  A new player might not find her, is there a compelling reason that her quest isn't issued by another NPC to help draw attention to her position?  It is fantastic that the community for this game is heavily involved with it, and if you look at the online guide or the Wiki there is a plethora of information for you, I merely wish that more of that information was presented in the game itself, or was more intrinsic during gameplay.  That said, Grim Dawn is designed like this on purpose I am sure.  It harkens back to the classics of the genre, where study was required for a player to excel in a game.  That is fine, it's just not for everyone.   Also ""damage from Chthonian beings"" is taken directly from the mouse over text for Chaos Damage on the character screen.  If this actually isn't a damage type then it should be removed from the description.  This is also where I learned that Frostfire was a subtype for cold damage.  For a while I thought that it was some sort of hybrid Fire/Cold thing based on the name.  Fun fact: Chthonian is a real word meaning ""relating to the underworld.""  Go Go Gadget Classical Education.			"

You can go to the pizza hut, the dominoes, the papa johns, everyone has an opinion about where to go to get the pizza. So you go to the resturante across town, they serve you a pizza. Maybe you like the sauce, maybe no, but it's authentic. The owners own grandma taught him the recipie for his sauce and him and the boys work the kitchen all day. He made you a pizza with all the love and care he can put into his giant italian family. You gonna send that pizza back cause you don't like the sauce? I don't think so.

								Grim Dawn is an ARPG that may seem like any other type in the genre, but that just isn't the case for this game. Grim Dawn likes to challege the player in many ways, from trying to find the best loot, building a play style that suits you, and even trying to survive the games brutal difficulty it throws at you. The combination of skills in the game is ridiculous, you can choose a starter class and then later combine it with a secondary class to make the character you truly want to be. The music also adds to the atmosphere the game masterfully creates with it's visuals. It's fun with friends and it's fun solo. Just bring a lot of pots. Also you can spin the camera. Diablo 3 could'nt do that, right? Fact check me on that. Highly recommend, I look forward to the big release. Thanks guys.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR Best ARPG on the market.After the untimely demise of Ascaron studio with their Sacred series (everybody agrees that sacred 3 is pure sh*t right? :)), diablo 3 and PoE being what they are, and no other seriously themed ARPGs on horizon, Grim Dawn is the only hope. 1. Iron Lore' previous game - Titan Quest - is on my ""best ARPG ever"" list. I bought GD in early access (beta 16 or so) and it had non-stop stream of updates (monthly), so it's rare game developer that doesn't scam you (unlike bugbear with their Next Car Game for instance). So the devs are good.2. The setting is superb. Somebody may think of it as generic, but in my opinion it's not. Dark gloomy fantasy world, after the cataclysm, with humanity on verge of extinction, but fighting back, with magic AND gunpowder - by far, it looks very compelling to me. There are hidden quests that are quite good and emerge you into this game world even more. So let the storyline unfold a little and you will see this dark world at it's best.  The devs say that this game won't be the only one in this setting.3. Core gameplay is of a typical ARPG. Very good ARPG to be honest. Skill system is what i like here the most. Classes are not generic, you have to mix them in pretty interesting ways to get a good toon. You can make different toons for years and they all will play different. Say, i've got semi-passive retaliation warder, you just run into bunch of mobs, put totem and wait till everyone around is dead while your hp bar never goes below 70%. Want action? Enter the assassin blademaster - you have to move around as you're squishy, but damage output is tremendous. Or you can just take your trusty revolver, summon hell beasts and watch as they tear everything apart.Also, skill enchantment wih devotion system? Also, skills from items and item enchantments?4. Item system is very good i think. Also got craft with dropping recipes and multiple ways to upgrade items.5. Game balance is quite ok for the moment, no super overpowered classes, no super underpowered, monsters are also good balanced.6. i've played some coop with my friends and there are couple of downside to it. Faction selection - if server owner plays for different faction it's kinda bad for you, as you cannot complete your quests and obviously you cannot help each other fighting different factions.Also when game owner rage quits other players just crash to desktop.Nevertheless multiplayer is fun. Also pvp to death on hardcore ultimate? :)I've played this game since beta 16 or so and i can say devs really like what they are doing - no major game breaking bugs (not even minor ones), continous development and patches/dlcs.Do i recommend this game? Absolutely!PS i've updated this review for ""I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award"" because this game is hidden gem.			"

												So the full release has finally come.  I can say with confidence that this is one of the few examples of Early Access done right.  Crate listened to everything their customers/backers had to say.  I just purchased it in December, but issues I discussed on their forums were actually addressed directly.  This final version of the game truly is something great. All their hard work and dedication to their fans has really payed off.So, a review.  Grim Dawn is an ARPG in the likes of Diablo 3 and Path of Exile.  However, it really has more in common with the great ARPG's of yesteryear:  Diablo 2 and Titan Quest.  Titan Quest is an obvious one because it was built with the same engine and designer, and if you liked Titan Quest you will surely like Grim Dawn.  It also reminds me a lot of Diablo 2 with the Dark Souls-esque aesthetic and unforgiving attitude in building your character.  It fits somewhere between Diablo 3 (very casual) and Path of Exile (hardcore) in terms of how much it lets you respec your character.Pros:-Highly involved developer; listens to the community and balances as necessary (I think what we have now is incredibly balanced though)-The best skill tree and build possibilities in any ARPG to date-Plenty of awesome weapons and armor; set items; legendary items-An actual good crafting system-Upcoming mod support-The best ARPG I've played since Diablo 2 -Descent story and charactersCons:-Decade old game engine (This hasen't affected me personally, the game runs very well; you won't find the prettiest graphics ever, but I find it better than Path of Exile's)-Lacking the production value and buttery smoothness of Diablo 3 (True, but seriously, this is a $25 game made by 9 people compared to the corporate beast that is Blizzard)-Endgame content (It's really not that bad, it's managed to keep me hooked, but maybe I'm comparing it too much to Diablo 3's endless random dungeons; I'm sure mod support and future updates will help this a lot)-Lack of options in customizing an avatar (male and female are your only choices)-Not enough loading screen art (Just getting nitpicky now)Pro/Con:-Difficulty: Playing through the game on Normal is rather easy and it's possible for anyone to do without dying once; however, after playing through normal, you will need to play through Elite then Ultimate to continue leveling your character.  These are much more difficult than Normal and will force you to rebalance your gear, skills, and remain focused at all times.  So really in terms of difficulty, it can be both good or bad, depending on your preferences. There's also a Hardcore mode but that's not really my speed :)I haven't tried playing the game multiplayer yet so I can't really speak to how well that works.  In any case, I highly recommend this game to any ARPG fan!			"

												Outstanding game. Great atmosphere, incredible cross-classing system allowing for excellent depth of combinations, combined with the devotion system making it even more customizable. Taking flavor from many different dungeon crawlers, but ulitmately feeling like a true successor to Diablo 2, Grim Dawn does a great job of balancing all the things that are loved about the genre and adding new bits of flavor to make itself really stand above the rest of the competition. With frequent updates that make the game even more interesting and beautiful, this is a game and a developer that you should not pass up on.			"

												TL;DR version of review: If you like Hack`n`Slash games you need to buy this one. In my opinion Grim Dawn is part of Holy Triad of H`n`S right now (with Diablo 3 and Path of Exile). Game is long, includes variety of interesting features (like dual-class or reputation system) and is satisfying as hell. If you liked Titan Quest you going to love Grim Dawn aswell.			"

												Short Version:Do you love ARPG's in the 'classical' sense?  Do you giggle in delight while hordes of the undead and other vile creatures explode like piñatas into delightfully colored piles of loot? Do you thrill at the thought of digging through those piles to determine how to pump out an extra 5% of acid damage while maintaining your max resists?  Do you not give a patoot about your position on some ladder populated by automated bots and those fortunate(?) enough to earn a living playing video games?  If you answered yes to the questions above - buy the game now and let your work know you'll be taking the rest of the week off. If your answers were no, this game is not for you.Or, if you love PvP and find your satisfaction with a game is derived directly from the number of keys needed to be pressed in order to win, you will most likely not enjoy Grim Dawn.Want Specifics?Grim Dawn is an Action Role Playing Game in the tradition of Diablo and is created by the team who developed Titan Quest, a game which is also held in high regard in the genre.  During your adventures, you will first select a starting class which determines your overall play style. For example, if you want to be the guy/gal with a huge hammer you may select the Soldier (but, really, you can make *any* build work for normal difficulty).  After you hit level 10 you'll be able to select another class to either compliment or hybridize your build. So, going back to the Soldier with a huge hammer, maybe you'll pick the Demolitionist and add some explosive fire based AOE's to help deal with crowds. Or, maybe you choose the Arcanist and shroud yourself in a protective bubble to help mitigate damage.  The choice is yours and it really helps with replayability.Your build is equally impacted by your gear selection - and hear GD really shines.  There are multiple tiers of loot, from Vanilla White with no buffs or enhancements to Royal Purple with heaps of added effects that make you the rival of gods.  That same loot will also come with extra skills and buffs.  With so much coming from your gear, you will often times find yourself in the predicament of either upgrading your gear and losing a skill or keeping the skill and suffering from an overall lower armor/resist rating.  Personally I find those choices thrilling, and it really draws me into the game. however, if the thought of having the same weapon for (potentially) a dozen levels or more (due to an amazing skill it grants for example) turns you off, you may have some issues with the game. After gear comes modifications - you'll find a lot of crafting components in Grim Dawn, and soon your stash is going to resemble your grandmothers medicine cabinet.  A lot of those components can be combined themselves into even stronger iterations.  Those combined components can then be used to craft even more advanced items and those can be used to craft some of the most powerful items in the game. So, if you abhor the idea of hunting for crafting materials - this may not be the game for you.  That said, keeping track of it all really isn't difficult, and within your stash you'll be able to combine everything that is possible to be combined with one button press.Graphics/aesthetics:Grim Dawn is a dark and moody game, an environment awash in deep greens and blues for a majority of your play-through. However there are far more vibrantly colored desert areas as well as otherworldly zones bathed in red and crimson.  The overall graphic fidelity is great, but not at the same level as it's triple A cousin Diablo 3.  Likewise the combat animations are not as detailed or complex as D3.  However the combat is visceral in GD with the impacts of swords, clubs and fireballs all feeling weighty and satisfying as the denizens of evil are burnt to a crisp or beaten into gelatinous puddles.Stability:Overall the game runs fine, with some mild stuttering as you traverse the game world.  However, a wide spread issue is known regarding the game crashing (and locking the system) when you attempt to exit the game.  Currently, this is the most urgent issue that needs to be addressed with the game and I expect it will be in future patches, but for the moment choose to play the game in full-screened windowed mode to avoid any complications.Thanks for reading! I hope you choose to experience the wonderful game that Crate has created.Over All Grade: A-System used for Review:GPU: GTX 970CPU:i5-3570 3.4ghzRam: 8gbHD: SSDOS: Win 10FPS: 120+ during normal game play, dropping down to 30+ during very intensive fights when the screen is filled.

												I'd like to start by saying this is the only time I've left a review on a game I'm a nasty critic. I have played arpgs in the past. D2, D3, POE, and of course Grim Dawn. It's safe to say I'd like for this company to make more money. Only for the selfish desire of seeing well thought out games like this in the future. I've never felt so immersed in Hardcore. I play Veteran mode. You truly have to prepare before your engages. You'll remember bosses names become attached to certain items. Even if you die in the starting 10 times the game is a refreshing playthrough. The voice acting is superb male actors have that deep southern crisp to their tone. The hybrid class system is really fun. Devotion points also spice up your builds. You can easily get 100's of hours out of this game. It's well worth the money.			"

								It's your typical ARPG game but far better than most current ones in my opinion. The feel and look of the game brings me back to Diablo 2 days where things were just very dark and heavy when you first started out. I feel the creatures you fight are more punishing and your character development is far more open than most other games allow. You are able to pull abilites from different class sections, thus adding many combinations to your character development for whooping♥♥♥♥♥and getting the fats lewts. My personal favorite thing about the game so far is the music. It's incredibly well done and suitable for the atmosphere and theme of the game. I'm incredibly impressed and pleased with the game so far in this beta. It doesn't feel like one to me. Few short hours and have yet to experience any bugs with the game so far. Once more time is allowed, I will be putting more hours into the game and be adding to this review.  "

												Well, I haven't played this game long enough... compared to all the possibilities and depth of this game. After nearly more time I've spend for Skyrim and after 3 published guides (and even more following), I have to say that this game is all I ever wanted from an ARPG. You have 6 classes/masteries (and even more following in coming DLCs) from which you can combine two of them with countless possibilities through abilities, gear etc to individualize your gaming experience. You have also a deep story in a world set between middle age, steampunk and apocalyptic endtime. You have a crafting system with hundrets of recipes and blueprints and a fair reward system in battles against endgame monsters. The GD community is great and the developers even greater, surprising their fans with monthly news and updates. If you are a true ARP-Gamer, this game is a must-buy. True story.And ah yeah, haters gonna hate, gamers gonna play. :3			"

												Dark, atmospheric and expansive. So vast in fact, that beating the game on a 1st playthrough (normal mode) while trying to explore everything, will take around 40h. In these types of games the truly dedicated will beat the campaign a 2nd and 3rd time, on higher difficulty settings, to continue levelling up and amassing ever more powerful and rare equipment. Be warned that the RNG Gods can be fickle, item drops are random; class and stats restrictions will prevent you from using most of the rare items you find, though you can transfer them to other characters or friends.Fans of Titan Quest will see many similarities, and if you've played Path of Exile, Torchlight, Diablo, you'll find the same basic cookbook's been used to bake Grim Dawn. The Cthulhu'esque hordes are proliferating, humanity's been oppressed to near extinction, and you will click on thousands of demons and cultists to rectify the situation. It's not a new formulae but Grim Dawn's art, detail and polish give it a unique feel that warrants a recommandation and a spot in my personnal top 10 for this genre.			"

												~First 3 Hours~I felt giddy like a kid again first discovering Diablo, misclicking on everything trying to fight a group of monsters and hitting wooden boxes instead. The atmosphere, sound, visuals, monsters, lairs, green stinky water, voice acting, everything is just really good so far. Loving it.~10 Hours~Tried some coop, it ran really smooth and was so easy to set up. Loving it (still.)~15+ Hours~ Had first big boss fight, loved it, moved onto the western side of the map. Came across a bug, seems to have a 50/50 chance to crash when I exit, but thats it.			"

												Short Version:Do you love ARPG's in the 'classical' sense?  Do you giggle in delight while hordes of the undead and other vile creatures explode like piñatas into delightfully colored piles of loot? Do you thrill at the thought of digging through those piles to determine how to pump out an extra 5% of acid damage while maintaining your max resists?  Do you not give a patoot about your position on some ladder populated by automated bots and those fortunate(?) enough to earn a living playing video games?  If you answered yes to the questions above - buy the game now and let your work know you'll be taking the rest of the week off. If your answers were no, this game is not for you.Or, if you love PvP and find your satisfaction with a game is derived directly from the number of keys needed to be pressed in order to win, you will most likely not enjoy Grim Dawn.Want Specifics?Grim Dawn is an Action Role Playing Game in the tradition of Diablo and is created by the team who developed Titan Quest, a game which is also held in high regard in the genre.  During your adventures, you will first select a starting class which determines your overall play style. For example, if you want to be the guy/gal with a huge hammer you may select the Soldier (but, really, you can make *any* build work for normal difficulty).  After you hit level 10 you'll be able to select another class to either compliment or hybridize your build. So, going back to the Soldier with a huge hammer, maybe you'll pick the Demolitionist and add some explosive fire based AOE's to help deal with crowds. Or, maybe you choose the Arcanist and shroud yourself in a protective bubble to help mitigate damage.  The choice is yours and it really helps with replayability.Your build is equally impacted by your gear selection - and hear GD really shines.  There are multiple tiers of loot, from Vanilla White with no buffs or enhancements to Royal Purple with heaps of added effects that make you the rival of gods.  That same loot will also come with extra skills and buffs.  With so much coming from your gear, you will often times find yourself in the predicament of either upgrading your gear and losing a skill or keeping the skill and suffering from an overall lower armor/resist rating.  Personally I find those choices thrilling, and it really draws me into the game. however, if the thought of having the same weapon for (potentially) a dozen levels or more (due to an amazing skill it grants for example) turns you off, you may have some issues with the game. After gear comes modifications - you'll find a lot of crafting components in Grim Dawn, and soon your stash is going to resemble your grandmothers medicine cabinet.  A lot of those components can be combined themselves into even stronger iterations.  Those combined components can then be used to craft even more advanced items and those can be used to craft some of the most powerful items in the game. So, if you abhor the idea of hunting for crafting materials - this may not be the game for you.  That said, keeping track of it all really isn't difficult, and within your stash you'll be able to combine everything that is possible to be combined with one button press.Graphics/aesthetics:Grim Dawn is a dark and moody game, an environment awash in deep greens and blues for a majority of your play-through. However there are far more vibrantly colored desert areas as well as otherworldly zones bathed in red and crimson.  The overall graphic fidelity is great, but not at the same level as it's triple A cousin Diablo 3.  Likewise the combat animations are not as detailed or complex as D3.  However the combat is visceral in GD with the impacts of swords, clubs and fireballs all feeling weighty and satisfying as the denizens of evil are burnt to a crisp or beaten into gelatinous puddles.Stability:Overall the game runs fine, with some mild stuttering as you traverse the game world.  However, a wide spread issue is known regarding the game crashing (and locking the system) when you attempt to exit the game.  Currently, this is the most urgent issue that needs to be addressed with the game and I expect it will be in future patches, but for the moment choose to play the game in full-screened windowed mode to avoid any complications.Thanks for reading! I hope you choose to experience the wonderful game that Crate has created.Over All Grade: A-System used for Review:GPU: GTX 970CPU:i5-3570 3.4ghzRam: 8gbHD: SSDOS: Win 10FPS: 120+ during normal game play, dropping down to 30+ during very intensive fights when the screen is filled.

												I bought this game back when it first came out, hit level 35 (or whatever the level cap was then), and took about a year or so long break. I told myself I'd be back when they added multiplayer and increased the level cap, and well.. here I am, working on a Stormcaller and an Albrecht's Aether Ray build, and loving every second of it (the AAR grind is killing me softly).In a lot of ways, it reminds me of Diablo 2, but I find the system they've implemented for character skills (being able to combine two character classes, and the importance of understanding how to proc abilities) differs greatly and actually makes the game more interesting. It also ups the replayability with all the different combinations, which is a plus in my books.The only critique I can give is that unless you go looking for and read every single note, you'll probably end up missing out on some aspects of the story or the history of Cairn itself. If they'd expanded on some things - be it in conversations with NPCs or maybe even adding cutscenes similar to the opening one - it would have made following the story not only easier, but more enjoyable in my opinion.9/10			"

Early Access Review
								I've played a bit and I don't FEEL like I've progressed very far in the story, but I have to say that what I've gotten to play and experience thus far is absolutely wonderful. I'm almost level 20.The looks/art/graphics of the game are amazing. I love the atmosphere and how dark and gritty everything is. Since I come from the Diablo trilogy, I played on Veteran instead of Normal and that really made the game both challenging and fun. The   ability to customize my character via the abilities and skill tree is a lot of fun ( and the forgiveness of not knowing anything about these skills is also nice ). There are also a LOT of areas to explore. I've spent however many hours and I had only then realized I'd not went through all of the areas past the first town simply because the map just KEEPS GOING. Which is great! I absolutely love how expansive the world is, the tid bits of lore I find, and how everything is playing out. I read a lot of this game is what Diablo 3 should have been, and I can certainly see WHY people are saying that. It's a beautiful game, great customization, with a lot of places to go and things to kill. I largely recommend this to people that like games like Diablo, though I really like that this game has come into it's own.			"

												Titan Quest, at a higher resolution, more user friendly and in a gothic fantasy setting. Having the currently equipped item show when you hover over something in your inventory is helpful, as is showing the DPS change for weapons. The engine is much the same, however, this is not a change like Diablo 2 to Diablo 3. If you liked Titan Quest but want something a bit more modern, you should give this a look.			"

												Did you love Titan Quest? You'll love this game.Are you a fan of ARPGs? You'll love this game.Are you a newcomer to ARPGs? This game may ruin you for others.I have been playing this game on and off since Build 24 in early access, and I can safely say it's one of the best ARPGs on the market. Five diverse classes, with a nice dual-class system and very interesting synergy between allows for a wide range of build types. Hundreds of extra skills available from items and components to further expand your build, or just add extra attacks for fun. On top of this is the Devotion system - by purifying shrines throughout Cairn, you gain points to spend on an extra level of customisation on top of the class system, and reaching some of the more esoteric constellations can unlock some very cool skill augments for your attacks. Want your kills to summon skeletons? Sure thing! Venemous spines erupting from the ground? Flocks of golden birds swooping through enemies? Done and done!A surprisingly dark and adult story line, with some pretty well done voice acting and a wealth of in game lore to find which fleshes the game world out wonderfully. Choices that impact the game world along the way - the wrong choice could see a family, or worse, go up in flame...Now, don't get me wrong, this game isn't 'perfect'. Building a successful character can be a little confusing and daunting for new players, although the Normal difficulty is well balanced to allow almost any build to beat it. More damage types than the average ARPG can make keeping resistances up (and beating enemy resistances) tricky, especially in the harder difficulties although to me this just adds to the depth of the game.The game world is hand crafted rather than randomised, this may be an issue for you, but for me it's better to play through well made content than hodgepodge generic chunks slapped together into a ""dungeon"" or ""area"", so YMMV.Monster design is excellent throughout, and it's not uncommon to be fighting huge swarms of enemies to almost insurmountable odds...until you destroy them all! Sound design is very good throughout as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack. I look forward to seeing what Crate do with the world of Cairn in the future, and hope they build on and develop the game world further!			"

												This game is awesome! It can be a little buggy at times, but its definitely extremely fun to play. If you like games like diablo 2/3, or P.O.E. then this game will be right up your ally. It has the old school diablo feel with newer game features and its own twists. Along with the punishment of failure. i.e. losing xp on deaths, rogue like dungeons, and a hardcore mode. Frequent updates, and an expansion announced soon, multiple difficulties, and a vast amount of replayability make this game totally worth buying! 4.5/5 stars in my book.			"

								Grim Dawn is an ARPG that may seem like any other type in the genre, but that just isn't the case for this game. Grim Dawn likes to challege the player in many ways, from trying to find the best loot, building a play style that suits you, and even trying to survive the games brutal difficulty it throws at you. The combination of skills in the game is ridiculous, you can choose a starter class and then later combine it with a secondary class to make the character you truly want to be. The music also adds to the atmosphere the game masterfully creates with it's visuals. It's fun with friends and it's fun solo. Just bring a lot of pots. Also you can spin the camera. Diablo 3 could'nt do that, right? Fact check me on that. Highly recommend, I look forward to the big release. Thanks guys.			"

												I'd like to start by saying this is the only time I've left a review on a game I'm a nasty critic. I have played arpgs in the past. D2, D3, POE, and of course Grim Dawn. It's safe to say I'd like for this company to make more money. Only for the selfish desire of seeing well thought out games like this in the future. I've never felt so immersed in Hardcore. I play Veteran mode. You truly have to prepare before your engages. You'll remember bosses names become attached to certain items. Even if you die in the starting 10 times the game is a refreshing playthrough. The voice acting is superb male actors have that deep southern crisp to their tone. The hybrid class system is really fun. Devotion points also spice up your builds. You can easily get 100's of hours out of this game. It's well worth the money.			"

												This game is the natural successor of Titan Quest.It has the same two class system from TQ and more with a new deity talent system.The gameplay is similar to the one in Titan Quest with lots of loot and monsters, including unique hero-monsters.If you like hack & slash games like Diablo 2, Torchlight or Titan Quest - this game is the one to play.I don't usually buy early access games, and even if I do - I usually don't play them until the official release - but I loved the idea of this game so much that I tried it even in early access.I recommend playing this game even in early access as all content is currently unlocked.Edit : After the game is out of Early Access it does not disappoint.Here's hoping for many expansions for it !10/10 for this game.

Early Access Review
								TL;DR Best ARPG on the market.After the untimely demise of Ascaron studio with their Sacred series (everybody agrees that sacred 3 is pure sh*t right? :)), diablo 3 and PoE being what they are, and no other seriously themed ARPGs on horizon, Grim Dawn is the only hope. 1. Iron Lore' previous game - Titan Quest - is on my ""best ARPG ever"" list. I bought GD in early access (beta 16 or so) and it had non-stop stream of updates (monthly), so it's rare game developer that doesn't scam you (unlike bugbear with their Next Car Game for instance). So the devs are good.2. The setting is superb. Somebody may think of it as generic, but in my opinion it's not. Dark gloomy fantasy world, after the cataclysm, with humanity on verge of extinction, but fighting back, with magic AND gunpowder - by far, it looks very compelling to me. There are hidden quests that are quite good and emerge you into this game world even more. So let the storyline unfold a little and you will see this dark world at it's best.  The devs say that this game won't be the only one in this setting.3. Core gameplay is of a typical ARPG. Very good ARPG to be honest. Skill system is what i like here the most. Classes are not generic, you have to mix them in pretty interesting ways to get a good toon. You can make different toons for years and they all will play different. Say, i've got semi-passive retaliation warder, you just run into bunch of mobs, put totem and wait till everyone around is dead while your hp bar never goes below 70%. Want action? Enter the assassin blademaster - you have to move around as you're squishy, but damage output is tremendous. Or you can just take your trusty revolver, summon hell beasts and watch as they tear everything apart.Also, skill enchantment wih devotion system? Also, skills from items and item enchantments?4. Item system is very good i think. Also got craft with dropping recipes and multiple ways to upgrade items.5. Game balance is quite ok for the moment, no super overpowered classes, no super underpowered, monsters are also good balanced.6. i've played some coop with my friends and there are couple of downside to it. Faction selection - if server owner plays for different faction it's kinda bad for you, as you cannot complete your quests and obviously you cannot help each other fighting different factions.Also when game owner rage quits other players just crash to desktop.Nevertheless multiplayer is fun. Also pvp to death on hardcore ultimate? :)I've played this game since beta 16 or so and i can say devs really like what they are doing - no major game breaking bugs (not even minor ones), continous development and patches/dlcs.Do i recommend this game? Absolutely!PS i've updated this review for ""I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award"" because this game is hidden gem.			"

												So the full release has finally come.  I can say with confidence that this is one of the few examples of Early Access done right.  Crate listened to everything their customers/backers had to say.  I just purchased it in December, but issues I discussed on their forums were actually addressed directly.  This final version of the game truly is something great. All their hard work and dedication to their fans has really payed off.So, a review.  Grim Dawn is an ARPG in the likes of Diablo 3 and Path of Exile.  However, it really has more in common with the great ARPG's of yesteryear:  Diablo 2 and Titan Quest.  Titan Quest is an obvious one because it was built with the same engine and designer, and if you liked Titan Quest you will surely like Grim Dawn.  It also reminds me a lot of Diablo 2 with the Dark Souls-esque aesthetic and unforgiving attitude in building your character.  It fits somewhere between Diablo 3 (very casual) and Path of Exile (hardcore) in terms of how much it lets you respec your character.Pros:-Highly involved developer; listens to the community and balances as necessary (I think what we have now is incredibly balanced though)-The best skill tree and build possibilities in any ARPG to date-Plenty of awesome weapons and armor; set items; legendary items-An actual good crafting system-Upcoming mod support-The best ARPG I've played since Diablo 2 -Descent story and charactersCons:-Decade old game engine (This hasen't affected me personally, the game runs very well; you won't find the prettiest graphics ever, but I find it better than Path of Exile's)-Lacking the production value and buttery smoothness of Diablo 3 (True, but seriously, this is a $25 game made by 9 people compared to the corporate beast that is Blizzard)-Endgame content (It's really not that bad, it's managed to keep me hooked, but maybe I'm comparing it too much to Diablo 3's endless random dungeons; I'm sure mod support and future updates will help this a lot)-Lack of options in customizing an avatar (male and female are your only choices)-Not enough loading screen art (Just getting nitpicky now)Pro/Con:-Difficulty: Playing through the game on Normal is rather easy and it's possible for anyone to do without dying once; however, after playing through normal, you will need to play through Elite then Ultimate to continue leveling your character.  These are much more difficult than Normal and will force you to rebalance your gear, skills, and remain focused at all times.  So really in terms of difficulty, it can be both good or bad, depending on your preferences. There's also a Hardcore mode but that's not really my speed :)I haven't tried playing the game multiplayer yet so I can't really speak to how well that works.  In any case, I highly recommend this game to any ARPG fan!			"

								It's your typical ARPG game but far better than most current ones in my opinion. The feel and look of the game brings me back to Diablo 2 days where things were just very dark and heavy when you first started out. I feel the creatures you fight are more punishing and your character development is far more open than most other games allow. You are able to pull abilites from different class sections, thus adding many combinations to your character development for whooping♥♥♥♥♥and getting the fats lewts. My personal favorite thing about the game so far is the music. It's incredibly well done and suitable for the atmosphere and theme of the game. I'm incredibly impressed and pleased with the game so far in this beta. It doesn't feel like one to me. Few short hours and have yet to experience any bugs with the game so far. Once more time is allowed, I will be putting more hours into the game and be adding to this review.  "

								I bought this game last Saturday evening, I almost have 23 hours played as of now.It is the following Monday, 10:30 a.m.Wowwee.These guys (Crate Entertainment) get it. I have four hardcore characters over level 10 already just because I wanted to see how well and varied the system works for the game and the player; every nuance you ever found yourself wishing for in ARPG games is here in this system. I figured out a build perfectly suited for me, and it was a blast doing so.I bought 2 extra copies for my friends to play as well.EDIT: On the third of October at four in the morning my mouse lost the functionality of its left click while deep in a cavern or something or other. It was a MadCatz R.A.T. 3 and we started playing games together summer of 2013. I do not resent Grim Dawn or Crate Entertainment for making me click so much just for the shred of a promise of loot and renown, I know my little buddy was proud to give the last of his hundreds of thousands of clicks to get me a little farther, get me a little more xp. His last click effort he held it down, so I may have continued to delve deeper, but I couldn't pick anything up or stop moving so I pulled the plug.Also I played this game for around 35 hours straight starting the day before yesterday.

												Good, fun game. I played Titan's Quest and this game is a good 'evoluation' of that game (same people made the two games, so that makes sense). This game could be seen as the logical next step. The duel classification is wonderful, and is how I like to play my ARPGs.

												This game as you know is made by Titan Quest dev. team. So,those experienced player with the team would notice the nostalgia of it. But those newcomers like me would think this is a decent game. Here are some pros of the game base on my opinion.1.Unique skill build. You have an option to master 2 classes which has a variety of builds to play around. That's because of the loot you obtain which will be different everytome you obtain it. Then you combine a skill set of 2 classes into a distinct one of your own. Basically end-game build is yours to figure out while playing. BTW you can respec skill.2.A game influnced by Titan Quest(obviously),Diablo and Torchlight. Basically if you like ARPG,Hack&Slash,looting. You might wanna play this.3.Awesome environment. Good graphics.4.Set item, Item enhancement, Crafting.That should help you decielde to buy the game more or less.			"

								If you've already played games like this (titan quest, diablo, van helsing) you'll enjoy it. There's a multi-class system that changes your name based on what classes you pick to diversify your gameplay. The enemies are well put together, fun stuff to destroy as well.What I'd like to see is better highlighted items when the loot drops, sometimes it's difficult to pick up loot in an instant. The multiplayer menu is a little confusing at first go. Would like to filter what items you can see when loot drops too.Also, the items look pretty awesome as well. I'd buy it if you like this type.			"

								Grim Dawn is a 3D Hack and Slash with 4 classes at the moment. It's also in beta so it's not quite feature complete and I think they plan to have 2-4 more classes. (however I think it's close to full release)Ever played Titan Quest? Same developer. And he is learning. I loved titan quest to death. But Grim Dawn is so much better. From what I have played so far it is quite impressive. Some things are unbalaced (because beta) but most of the game is well balanced. The story is pretty good. (Warning. Spoilers of the first 5 minutes of gameplay ahead :P) You wake up just before your about to be hanged. Turns out you got possessed by a demon and it left your body just before you were hanged. You then proceed to explore around the town called Devil's Crossing. It's small. But as you play through the game you keep adding people to it. Apparantly some portals opened up and monsters started coming through. I have not figured out why or how yet and I wouldn't say even if I did because it would be a big spoiler. When you hit level 1 you get to pick a class. The current classes are Soldier, Demolishonist, Nightblade, and Occultist. The soldier is your average Sword and board. The demolishionist throws things such as Electrifying Jacks (like the small spiky kind of Jacks), Moltov Cocktails, and Grenades. The Nightblade is your kind of rouge class. And the Occultist summons pets to help him fight, a raven that uses magic to heal and buff freinds and zap monsters, and a hellhound that tanks for you and mauls your enemys.The Spec trees work like they did in Titan Quest. You have a bar that you can put points in. Putting points in the bar gives you stats and if you get certain amounts of points in the bar (1, 5, 10, 15 ect) You unlock skills that you can put points in. The more points, the better the skill. Also you will get upgrades for your skills. So when I get my Moltov Cocktail all it does is create a small area that burns enemys. Well. If I spend another 5 points in the bar and get a point in an upgrade then my Moltov will reduce the enemy's defence as well. One of my favorite things about this game is that you can have more than 1 class. Once you hit level 10 you get the option to pick another class. So it allows for some unique combinations. My first character was a Demolitionist that had a raven and a hellhound following it around.Overall I love this game. And I expect it to be even better when it's finished. 8/10			"

It can have some tough moments too, so much like anything else it has a trial and error element , I recommend experimenting with the different skill trees as they can hybridize.			"

												Imagine the fast paced slaughter of Diablo 3 but in a style where each enemy matters that feels like Diablo 2.Imagine creating a Diablo 2 character but getting to choose two classes, with two skill trees to level up that even effect each other. (And you can easily reset your skill points to try a new build without starting a new character)Boss killing runs for finding items. Friendly factions that gain good reputation with to purchase interesting and powerful items. Enemy factions you gain bad reputations with so more champion/boss style enemies appear, as well as increased enemy density. Lots of MEANINGFUL loot. Easily transfer items between characters. Offline play. Visually good environment. Good music. Interesting enemies. Complex (but not overly) game mechanics.Low level playing is fun and the beginning leveling feels quick and extremely rewarding.Mid level playing is fun and as you get more powerful your character takes on an entirely different feel as you starting combining skills and finding good items.High level playing is.... well I don't know yet because I keep making new chacters to try different builds. There are so many build options, even for the same class (which there are lots of anyway), that I keep making new characters because each build is THAT much fun and tempting.You can build a glass cannon that kills thing quickly while sucking their life away to heal yourself. You can build a character that simply stands there unkillable and watches everything around it dies from a type of damage reflect ability. You can build a character that controls an army of summoned creatures to kill things for you. You can build a character anywhere in between.Having playing Diablo 2 consistenly from the day it came out, then really enjoying Diablo 3 even though it had an entirely different feel, I can say that Grim Dawn has done something right. Somehow, Grim Dawn has combined the good from both of those games while leaving out the bad, and making the game mechanics more complex in a very expansive and positive way.I recommend this game to all ARPG fans.

Early Access Review
								This is by far, hands-down the best early access title I have every played. There is so much to like about this game from build varieties to the massive amounts of loot you can get. The art direction has obviously been influenced by Diablo 1 & 2 and has kept it more mature. This visual style is exactly what I wished Diablo 3 would have had and I couldn't be happier. It has a strong single-player campaign and pretty decent multiplayer (this is where it falls a little flat). Traditional ""Diablo-esque"" elements such as leaderboards, ladders, etc... don't exist here and if you want that competitiveness, then this probably isn't the game for you. Controls are what you would expect in an ARPG and there are no complaints there.Game length is good. I've played for about 20 hours now and am partially through Act IV (I like to explore and take my time). Maps are really big with lots of areas to explore as well so you won't get bored quickly. Dialogue in the game is text-based. There is no voice acting for NPC's that I've come across. This can get a little tedious at times, but nothing quick clicking can't solve. Optimization is pretty darn good as I am getting 90-120 FPS (depending on monster density) on my playthroughs at 1440p with a 980 Ti and settings all set to maximum. Achievements aren't working, but that's not a big deal as its still in early access. For those of you running ultra-widescreen monitors, you'll be happy to know that this game natively supports them. Visual elements such as spells and melee abilities can look and feel awesome. A swing of a hammer produces a satisfying ""meaty"" thump with the appropriate amount of gore and spells can be pretty dramatic.There are a few gripes and they mostly revolve around the inventory system (i.e. would like an ability to dump everything in my inventory into my stash, instead of one-by-one), but these gripes are with just about every single ARPG I've ever played and are really minor. Another thing I would have liked implemented are custom POI markers on the map. I found that many times this would have been useful, especially since the maps are so large.If you liked Path of Exile, Diablo 3, Titan's Quest, Torchlight, etc... This is pretty much a must have in your library. In fact, I'd wager that in time you will prefer this game to most other ARPG's available today.			"

								Despite the early access and a few remaining bugs this is a must-have game. If you missed proper character building in D3, this game is for you - lots of stats, abilities, procs, talents (kinda), damage types and mechanics really make your brain work while designing your build. Optimisation, crafting and lore are pretty good too.Only things I find bad about this game are not so polished animations (80% of them look like ~2000) and pretty poor elite (hero) mob skills - they're few, they're weak, mostly damage comes from autoattacks or monsters' usual abilities.

												The game plays and feels better than D3 or PoE. My highest level character is lvl42, so I can't tell you anything about higher levels, but the combat so far is very nice. It's not PoE's OP combat but it's closer to Diablo 2. The game's setting is very mature, the mechanics are well thought out. The only issue I have with the game is that the environments are a bit samey. The game could do with a little bit more epic looking places, like what we have in D3, although what it offers is really nice. It feels handcrafted and I like the layered levels too.It's worth it for its price, so if you are an ARPG fan, grab it as soon as you can!			"

								I'll try to keep this simple, no promises though, there's a lot to talk about with this game. I also may edit this review if more comes to mind, already did once for grammar.TL;DR: Basically... if you want a game that has the dark, gritty feel of Diablo 1/2 as well as the awesome character building, and Path of Exile didn't do anything for you (it certainly didn't for me), get this game. You will NOT regret it.Here's the rant/info, typed it up in a hurry, but I'd like this game to get more support, so yeah:I played Diablo 1, Diablo 2, and Diablo 3 very extensively (thousands of hours probably), and briefly checked out Path of Exile and have watched gameplay of Torchlight 1/2. To be perfectly honest, PoE and Tochlight just didn't ever pull me in (not sure why, I guess I missed the dark vibes of D1/2, which PoE had, but something was still missing for me), and Diablo 3 was a pretty huge let down over the long term.Grim Dawn has several base classes, and you get to pick two. For instance, my main is a Witchblade (warrior/occultist). I could've gone for a straight Warrior build, or a straight Occultist build, but opted to do a hybrid build which focuses on pets, while maintaing the ability to tank and do high damage with a two handed scythe and a cleave ability from the warrior tree, while also taking a skill from Occultist that is an AoE life leech/DoT. There are a ton of ""clicky"" items in the game, in the form of actual equipment and augments for said equipment. So many in fact, if you really wanted to, you could probably skip active abilities from your class trees and just use these abilities (though I wouldn't recommend it). For example, I found a legendary caster offhand the other day that grants me an ability to summon a skeleton knight pet with no timer (on top of other pets I already have via Occultist).... and a couple of item augments, one of which grants an AoE nuke, and another which grants movement utility.On top of being able to customize your attributes (no resets so be careful), skills (resets), and items, there is another feature in game called Devotion (resets), which you put points into, which are gained after clearing ""shrines"" in the game. It's basically a constellation chart (similar to Skyrim). The abilities you put points into range from passive bonuses and active abilties, to procs (for those unfamiliar with the term, an ability that has a percentage of occuring on attack, on being attacked, at a certain HP %, etc). As an example, I have procs for Life Leech, Energy Leech, Skeleton summons on enemy death, Hellhound summons on attack, etc.The customization and build options are incredible, and without spoiling anything, the ending is quite the cliffhanger, and leaves it WIDE open for expansion packs. Honestly, I could continue typing about this game for a good while, but I won't. Already typed way more than I originally intended. Long story short, if you enjoy D1/D2 style ARPG's, get it.			"

												I've played close to 15 hours here, so I don't know the entire game, but played it enough for an impression I'd like to share.In short: it's a classic hack & slay action RPG. If you are looking for exactly that, you'll be happy with the game.GraphicsThe good: detailed enemies and landscape creates a nice atmosphereThe bad dated engine (especially in matters of the effects)The game looks good considering the engine used. Just don't expect state of the art graphics. SoundIt's ok. The music is nice and the effects are ok too. Some NPCs have voiced text, but most don't and neither does your character.GameplayIt's a traditional hack&slay action RPG, with all its ups and downs.The good: nice character building system (combine two classes, distribute skill points, attribute points and devotion points) interesting decisions to make every now and then nicely balanced difficulty nice writing of the story got some sort of a crafting system despite a linear gameplay, there is some room for exploration items can grant entirely new skills.The bad: apart from the gender, you have no way to customize your characters looks AI is dumb no tooltip for actual DPS change of new items you find (only base damage) Matter of taste: The areas are not random but the same with each playthrough. That leads to more detailed and better designed areas, but also reduces the motivation to play through it more than once (which can still be fun with a higher difficulty level and different classes), since you know exactly what's coming. Of course the game does not requite a lot of brain power. You walk around and kill what moves. It's something to relax with instead of mentally challenging. Due to the masses of loot to find, most of which is of course irrelevant. A loot filter prevents you from picking up most unwanted stuff, but most of what you find you still won't use.Compared to:Diablo 3: Grim Dawns character building system is more flexible and complex, but at times also cluttered. Technologically Grim Dawn is several generations behind Diablo 3, but the graphics are still decent, and this only matters if you really expect state of the art technology.Torchlight I and II: Grim Dawn is grittier and darker, and apart from that most that I said about Diablo 3 applies here as well.Titan Quest: Basically Grim Dawn is a successor to that and has a lot of similarities.ConclusionIt's a fun hack & slay action RPGs. Apart from being in matters of technology not very advanced, it's a great game.			"

								Μy eng isnt my main languange but i'll try to explain how i like Grim Dawn.These days i was trying find a good RPG game. I've tested demo version Diablo III, Torch II and others games but none of these so excited me. Im not looking weird skills or talents, but my enjoy is looking for a good environment.Recenlty i finished the ""The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing"". Great game though but Grim Dawn have good areas, you enter inside in buildings, caves, tunnels that ""Van Helsing"" did not.  Now im enjoying with my Soldier, smashing zombies and skeletons!!! The fun is you can smash them to the air!!!classes with option of dual spec that i cant wait to test them all !!! "

								I've only played for a few days, but I'm having a blast. This reminds me of Diablo II so much, it's as if Diablo's blood courses through Grim Dawn's veins.Pros:+ Every environment has an atmosphere to it, even the more grotesque areas have a dark charm to them.+ The climates of the most northern zones begin to change into a frigid landscape.+ Dual Classing with multiple ways to build a character.+ The world is made in such a way, that firearms fit right in.+ At times, the game won't hold back any punches.Cons:- Games hosted on your internet, so if you log off, the game drops for everyone else.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants that ""high"" they got from Diablo back.

								Game is amazing. I honestly got nothing negative to say due to it still not being released fully but for the positivity.If you liked Diablo 2 and/or TitanQuest you will enjoy this too. Extremely similar and equally enjoyable. If I could, I'd give it two thumbs up.Another really good thing is that the game is going to support modding, so its gonna be kept alive even longer through the community, and so far the community is lovely. Both on offical forums, reddit and here on steam forums, though I do not browse the steam forums too much so my experience will differ from others.If I had to pick a negative thing, its that the game can crash for whatever reason and you might lose your characters.I had steam cloud save on and I had a copy of my characters beign stored in both the my games/grim dawn folder and steam cloud save folder. This allowed me to get back my characters, but other than that. I don't got something negative to say. Game is extremely enjoyable and well worth the pricce they are asking for.100 times more worth it than for example, AAA titles like Battlefield and Call of Duty for their copy-pasterino content.			"

								Almost 170 Hours in and i still love this game.This is such a great ARPG because it combines a lot of the good elements of many ARPGs and mmos, without feeling too much like any of them. Classes seem balanced and the multi-class option is nice but in no way required. The graphics are really smooth and the engine seems quicker and more robust than others in its catagory. The best thing about Grim Dawn to me is the massive maps that arent randomized but hand made and very detailed. And this game is designed to have a lot of varities in the grinding. Unlike diablo 3 which choose to go the more generic route with grinding and make everything drop anywhere, you get items you want from certain types of monsters in Grim Dawn. If you want a poison wand, then killing Trog casters who use venom skills on you has a higher drop chance of this type of loot. I could just go on and on about this one. Best game ive played in years. And i am a big POE fan as well. If you like POE or Diablo 2, definitely buy Grim Dawn. What a fantastic ARPG.			"

								This is definitiely one of my favorite if not my favorite ARPG game I've ever played. Torchlight being right next to it. I enjoy the darker atmosphere more than the bright pretty Torchlight. But the gameplay in the first chapter, even in early access was so fun that I've held off playing until it's finished to avoid spoiling it, until I can binge on the finished game. The story actually drew me in, storylines in games usually aren't a big draw for me, but I found myself reading averything I could find.  If you a fan of ARPG's or dark storylines this game is for you. I backed this game in kickstarter in the hopes of a dark arpg reminiscent of old diablo, and that's what I got. I am very glad I backed this game and I am awaiting eagerly awaiting it's finished version. It's most definitly worth a buy, once it's fully finished. Even now it's still really good, and worth a buy, if your willing to wait for a finished game.			"

												As someone who never played Diablo and other Diablo-like games and hearing so much about this and how it's ""the Diablo iii that Diablo ii fans wanted"" and seeing this game on sale I decided to give it a try. With only a little over 8 hours I have to say this game is brilliant. I've been completely obsessed with this game for all that it offers. It's neat looking graphics, the dark setting, the soundtrack (especially at Devil's Crossing, I've been obsessed with that song), the gameplay, everything. I love the 6 playable classes and the way you can mix them up and the very gratifying action. Overall I was really impressed with this game and I intend to sink many more hours into it, I also very much recomend it to fans of the genre and to people who just want to give it a try.			"

												i don't leave many reviews, but this feels enough like diablo 2 that i had to spread the good word. as a loyal blizzard fan from the original warcraft 1, starcraft 1, and diablo 1 i just wasn't getting any satisfaction from diablo 3 anymore. it was decent for a while, but it just didn't scratch the itch. this game does it.it takes everthing good about diablo 2, keeps it, and adds new updates. personal town portals you can share (with no scrolls to worry about), they just throw the bosses on you in the game world (without making it huge totally separate cutscene bull***t). and they straight copied the maggot layer from diablo 2, just changed the names. it's hilarious.there's not a thousand difficulties to worry about, you have to earn them. there are bounties to do during the campaign. i paid the full 25 dollars, and it was worth every penny. and bought it for 2 of my other friends. the story is decent, and it kind of has a western/fallout feel to it. worth. very much worth.

												Long Review  Inc.I have a lot of nostalgia attacked to games I grew up playing, and I often have trouble finding new ones.  In the ARPG genre, I grew up on Diablo II, and spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in that game.  Since then, few have held my interest the same way: Torchlight, Torchlight 2, Titan Quest being the exceptions.Until now.Grim Dawn may be my favorite game in the genre now.  I cannot say enough about it.  Grim Dawn was made by the makers of Titan Quest, and many of the game systems share many of the same features.  The game offers a playthrough style identical  to Diablo 2, where the player plays through the narrative three times.  The first playthrough can be played on either Normal or Veteran (harder, yet better loot) offering a better play experience for new and experienced  players alike.Priced at $25, this game is a steal.  Half the price of a Triple-A game, yet all the quality.The classes allow a lot of variety and experimentation.  The player picks two ""classes"" each with several  different possible playstyles, combining them into  the player's final ""class.""  While it could use a few more skills in each class, the mix of actives and passives, and  the accompanying devotion system, leave countless ways to play your character.  Even  in the same class, one could playthrough several different ways.  Combine this with skills granted by items and the  player is presented  a deep class system with enough variety for playthrough after playthrough.On the subject of items, the game offers quite a few affixes on items, giving a lot of depth to gearing.  A player new to the genre may be intimidated by the number of possible stats on any piece of gear, but the game difficulty is such that a player should have no trouble absorbing what each one does by the time that knowledge is necessary.The aforementioned devotion system  is a large array of passives, allowing a character multiple ways of augmenting needed stats and acquiring new abilities. The tone is dark and gritty, yet as the narrative progresses, the aesthetics and the mob types change, so as to offer the player a variety of visuals and combat scenarios. The UI is unobtrusive, and yet presents enough information to allow smooth gameplay.The one drawback for me is bagspace and stash size.  They are too small.  That is the case in EVERY loot-based game, so here I do not dwell.  However, the extra bag space you get is separated from the main bag, leaving you with several  smaller containers, rather than one large one.   A minor complaint, but one I feel worth mentioning.Overall, this is one of the best games I have played in a long time.  If you loved Titan Quest, or any other classic ARPG, this game is for you.  The price is a steal.  Seriously.  Buy it.			"

												TL;DR If Diablo III had balls, it would be this game.This is what Diablo III should have been. Large areas to explore, no oversized characters or massive enemies that don't make sense. Bosses don't take 30 seconds to die and they sure don't spam ""Arrogant Nephalem"", ""Enough!"" repeatedly when their health gets lower.Dark and grungy,, cross class ability, huge selection of character skill customization (devotion and skill picks).As any class you can use guns, crossbow bolts, swords, shields, daggers ,etc but your class determines their effectiveness (and your stats).Light radius means something! Day/night and weather effects, no static ugliness here.The amount of detail in the environments is just stunning zoomed in or out (max settings).			"

I did run into a couple of extremely mild bugs, but on the whole this game is production quality and a real treat to play.

However if you want a awesome game where you can put a little thought into your character builds (you can also redo skil points which is great but its not overdone like diablo 3).This game is alot of fun and is more like what diablo 3 should have been, your first character you wont know what build your really doing till 12 or even a little later wich is okay, pay a little money to redo some skills and your good.This is a fantastic game AND ITS LIKE 25 BUCKS!!!!!!! Buy it, spend a little time planning a build and you wil have soo much fun.On a side not check out the pyromancer, occultist mixed with demolitionist. Soo much fun and great skill options with using a gun. Try to decide what elemts you want to focus on, one main and one secondary for focus.			"

								In short : Titan Quest 1.5. Yes, everything you loved about Titan Quest is here, in the exact format as you would remember it (yeah even the UI). However Grim Dawn have a much better story and deeper system.If that's not enough to make you jump in, then sadly this game is not for you...			"

								Great ARPG and a great game in general. I'll probably be playing this a few months a year for a decade, like I did Diablo 2. I did not enjoy Diablo 3, but I loved Path of Exile. This is great for when you don't want to bother with Path of Exiles tedious trading, and still keeps the complexity that makes an ARPG interesting for a long time.			"

								bought this game for like 13€ a year ago, but I started playing it now, best decision I've ever made, can't believe that such a small team made such an awesome game, and unlike other teams that realease games in early access theyve actually finished it, as you can see from the reviews most people played it for 100+ hours, so the game is obviously huge, and that alone deserves a big thumbs upIf you like diablo, titan quest, torchlight, look no further, you will love this one!crate entertainment, congrats on making this game, you could have just make a mediocre game and run with the money, but youve clearly put a lot of effort in it!

												This game is similar FATE .(To all my WildTanget players from the old days) The mechanics are similar, items, everything. One of the things I love about this game is its vast items, land, and quests. I enjoyed reading the dialouge, as I have to anyways if I want to know where I am going. No complaints at all, no glitches or anything. I think the game is ready to get out of Early Access. I can gaurantee that A. I will be playing this game all year and B. This will explode in sales by how good this game is, in my opinion of course. 10/10, Hopefully there will be more updates and pesky DLC's for more quests, that said, if I ever run out of them..			"

At least, as far as mechanics, character progression and gameplay go.I'm not a big fan of the grimdark setting, and I think the mythological setting of Titan Quest was really refreshing for this genre, but still - I'm willing to look past that.This is probably the best ARPG that you can play without an active online connection right, at very least. And, of course, it does also have multiplayer.			"

												I've played close to 15 hours here, so I don't know the entire game, but played it enough for an impression I'd like to share.In short: it's a classic hack & slay action RPG. If you are looking for exactly that, you'll be happy with the game.GraphicsThe good: detailed enemies and landscape creates a nice atmosphereThe bad dated engine (especially in matters of the effects)The game looks good considering the engine used. Just don't expect state of the art graphics. SoundIt's ok. The music is nice and the effects are ok too. Some NPCs have voiced text, but most don't and neither does your character.GameplayIt's a traditional hack&slay action RPG, with all its ups and downs.The good: nice character building system (combine two classes, distribute skill points, attribute points and devotion points) interesting decisions to make every now and then nicely balanced difficulty nice writing of the story got some sort of a crafting system despite a linear gameplay, there is some room for exploration items can grant entirely new skills.The bad: apart from the gender, you have no way to customize your characters looks AI is dumb no tooltip for actual DPS change of new items you find (only base damage) Matter of taste: The areas are not random but the same with each playthrough. That leads to more detailed and better designed areas, but also reduces the motivation to play through it more than once (which can still be fun with a higher difficulty level and different classes), since you know exactly what's coming. Of course the game does not requite a lot of brain power. You walk around and kill what moves. It's something to relax with instead of mentally challenging. Due to the masses of loot to find, most of which is of course irrelevant. A loot filter prevents you from picking up most unwanted stuff, but most of what you find you still won't use.Compared to:Diablo 3: Grim Dawns character building system is more flexible and complex, but at times also cluttered. Technologically Grim Dawn is several generations behind Diablo 3, but the graphics are still decent, and this only matters if you really expect state of the art technology.Torchlight I and II: Grim Dawn is grittier and darker, and apart from that most that I said about Diablo 3 applies here as well.Titan Quest: Basically Grim Dawn is a successor to that and has a lot of similarities.ConclusionIt's a fun hack & slay action RPGs. Apart from being in matters of technology not very advanced, it's a great game.			"

I've tested demo version Diablo III, Torch II and others games but none of these so excited me. Im not looking weird skills or talents, but my enjoy is looking for a good environment.Recenlty i finished the ""The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing"". Great game though but Grim Dawn have good areas, you enter inside in buildings, caves, tunnels that ""Van Helsing"" did not.  Now im enjoying with my Soldier, smashing zombies and skeletons!!! The fun is you can smash them to the air!!!classes with option of dual spec that i cant wait to test them all !!! "

								If you are a fan of the aRPG model games, you will love Grim Dawn. The development team was the same that worked on the Titan Quest series (TQ and TQIT) which was very well executed and recieved a large amount of praise. The engine for the Titan Quest game was utilized for Grim Dawn, which was a good basis for the game as it was already polished and the extra time and effort added in Grim Dawn has sealed up any and all cracks left over from the Titan Quest franchise. The item and customization system is very in depth and allows for countless possiblities when considiering the class types, damage types, specializations, etc. Overall in terms of aRPGs Grim Dawn allows for more customization than any other of its kind. Highly recommend any who are considering this game to pick it, it is worth the 25 dollar price tag. If anything just snag it at the next steam sale for 12 dollars, you won't regret it.			"

												EDIT: Since the full release, this game has only become even more desirable. The mechanics are polished and streamlined, the itemization is almost doubled, and the engine has been optimized dramaticallyYou want this game. ARPG veterans and newbies alike will find something to appreciate, and the deep skill system makes for endless possibilities. The world is not as dynamic or interactive as big AAA sandbox games obviously, but the combat mechanics are so solid they might form a black hole from their sheer density. So many items work together in so many ways and your skills can be tweaked on a very granular level with the respec system, though I might gripe that skill points are still a bit scarce as of build 29. Seriously, just get it. It would take a long time to really describe why this game is great, but if you love action and loot, this is the place to be.			"

												Probably the best ARPG I have ever played. Grim Dawn offers an outstanding character customization, the dual clash selection from 6 existing classes plus the devotion system and the numerous passive and active skills from equipment and enchanting components create literaly infinite playstyles to explore and enjoy. The faction system makes the game more interesting both in farming and questing. You can explore the world for many secret locations, treasures and even hidden quests. To top it all of it only costs 24,99 which is a very good price for a game with great repeatability and I strongly recommend it to all the ARPG fans.			"

I've been playing solo, I've made 3 hardcore characters on Veteran difficulty, they've all died and I still want to keep playing.Yes, It's still your basic click and kill ARPG, not too much different in terms of gameply. But you have to expect that going in. You are literally only dropping 25 (less than that on a sale day) and you are getting an up to date and unique D2.Pick it up when you get a chance. "

												I'm done with Grim Dawn, it was fun, I played about 100hrs in which I've created 2 characters, I've reached Level 44 with one and 74 with another, was able to glance through the first missions on the last difficulty (Ultimate) and acquired a couple Legendary items that was useful.The game has a good interesting story, although it's very digressive because of multiple factions, I often was confused with the multiple ""main"" plots. Don't get me wrong side-quests are a good thing, it's just that I felt there wasn't a compelling main story. I've finished the game I thought ""That was it?"". Aside from that the stories and quests are very well written and presented, specially the ones you collect as lore items, it was intriguing to always look for another piece to know what happened next. A big plus also for quest branches, allowing to actually change the game and story.The gameplay is good, there's good amount of skills for each class with different builds and play-styles, not to mention the amount of masteries with the double-class sytem. The combat system often got me excited, often got me mad, it's great to put your skill to some use and not only the random click-fest that usually is ARPGs. I mean, there's interesting combat mechanics, like healers, and support mobs that have to be killed first, it's movement intense and you have to coordinate the skill usage.The graphics are good, the scenery is dark, bloody and gothic, the animations though could be better, for example, the character animation when it's running often feels like it's on a roller blade, character posing stand-still is ugly, and often I got stuck in the environment after the animation of one of the movement skills I had.Itemization is a problem, I got several items that I had no use for me while lacking items to progress the game, I understand this is a RNG game, although some sort of mechanism needs to be in place to fulfill this gaps, like the loot system implement in Diablo, or a quick and easy way to trade. Anyway going alone or ""self founded"" as the community says is quite a task, and would demand a lot of time. That's the main reason I've got bored: looking after loot, not finding and knowing that would take a lot of time to get it.TL;DR;It's a good ARPG ""Diablo like"" game with an well written story, good graphics and regular to poor animations. I definitely recommend if you like ARPGs.			"

												I was a big fan of diablo 1 and 2, and yes i played diablo 3 much aswell, but this game is what diablo 3 should have been. The story is really good, and that comes from someone who normally does'nt give a damn about the lore in games. I read every single note i could get my hands on. I have nothing bad to say at the moment. It's a really really good game, and i highly recommend it if you liked/like to play diablo and/or titan quest.What are you waiting for? BUY IT			"

												Got about 260 hours into this game. I have created so many characters it isn't funny. I don't like comparing games to other games. But for those of you who don't know what ARPG's are. Its like Diablo 3 on Steriods. Classes have unique abilities, and passives. You can dual class. There is blood and gore everywhere. Dark and colorful auras.This game looks nice and is nice. Got it on sale, But I wouldnt mind paying full Price for this. guys over at CRATE really outdone themselves on this game. Its good.			"

								Simply amazing. I haven't had this much fun since Diablo 2. This game really scratches that itch. I was disappointed with Diablo 3 and found Torchlight 2 to be fun but too cartoonish. I am a huge fan of Titan Quest and its amazing expansion, and you can definitely feel the influence here with the excellent skill trees and class combination system. The loot is great and often useful, and levelling up actually feels like an event and an achievement. You have the chance to think about your character and how you want him/her to develop. The graphics are great, nice and dark. The music is awesome and definitely fits the bill. The levels are quite varied and there are hidden places and side quests scattered around, so exploration is rewarded. The boss monsters are original and fun to fight. The story is not the most deep and philosophical one out there, but that's not the point of games like this. Oh, you do get to influence the development of your town based on choices made during certain encounters. The crafting system is complex and rich with possibilities of creating useful gear. This is an early access game, although it feels pretty solid already: there is lots of content already out and more is on the way. It most certainly is worth the asking price. In my opinion these guys deserve it for delivering a great action RPG experience!This game is for you if you like:-Titan Quest.-Useful loot without endless grinding.-A genuinely dark atmosphere (à la Diablo).-An ARPG that isn't too dumbed down.-Proper character classes/skill trees.

								This game is still in Alpha, so my review needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I've played D3 for hundreds of hours, maybe over one thousand. I've played PoE a bit, and this seems to be a good middle ground of both. Where D3 turns into a grind/mash fest that is fairly well polished and has a large team behind it, this is the darker, fuller-storied step brother. There seems to be a much more detailed storyline, and getting through the game takes quite some time. I'm trying to remember back to my first completion of D3, and I want to say it took me maybe 10 hours from start to finish. Grim Dawn seems to be significantly longer, and there are more side quests, to boot. One feels more involved in the Grim Dawn community, as there are factions that need to be built up in order to purchase certain set items, akin to WoW style gameplay.The character build system is vastly different than other ARPGs, in the sense that there is a structured leveling system, but you can single- or dual-class your character with tons of options to customize. Beyond that, the Devotion system offers more fine tuning and other optional abilities that can be built in with each class. Overall, there seems to be a much more diverse system of builds that are viable in Grim Dawn than other ARPGs. I have yet to complete the game a single time in nearly 25 hours played, but then again I am trying to explore all of the content as well.Overall, I'd suggest this game if you want a decent storyline with difficult gameplay and an expansive skill system. Being made with the same engine as Titan Quest, Crate borrows the 6 class / multiple points in many talents with upgrades feel, bringing that old TQ nostalgia back in droves. Would buy again!			"

												Update after playing full release: Totally blew away my expecations even during the early access phase (which my comments below are based on). Extreme amounts of choice added through the devotion system (similar to an addition skills tree), graphics and animations look perfect and are optimized well. Only bug I'm still experiencing is other players gear not showing up after it is equipped by them (though it reappears after transitioning to a new area or using a riftgate).Excellent game even in current form July 2015. I prefer this to Diablo 3 even with the announced future plans. Grim Dawn is much more complex in terms of damage and defense types, and in terms of character customization. The game really shines in these two places. Class combining is done super good. Lots of choice with little or no feeling of restirction. At this point, it's a little clunky (character movement animations, map navigation, the odd bug; its crashing a fair amount for me at this point...). The final product will be good for sure.			"

								This game is awesome! If you have played Titan Quest then this game will be very familiar. I am 50+ hours in and I still am not bored in the least and the game just gets better the longer you play. This game isnt going to just hand you levels and gear easily. I like the older school feel of choosing my class and at level 10 you choose your 2nd to combine or dont if you want to focus on a single class. Each class and class combination feels great and each one their own. I am a Conjurer myself and I love my pets. The skill trees are set up just like Titan Quest and the UI is similar in alot of ways also. This game may have a similar feel as Titan Quest, but it will keep you going with its beautiful visuals and sometimes challenging content. Each area you explore looks different and has a unique feel to it. There is plenty of lore in the game also if you are you that looks for a story. As you run around exploring you pick up pages of certain books or letters and slowly piece together a decent story. The multiplayer experience is nice also. If you are in a full room of 4 people, then you can expect a decent challenge and it feels good when you down a really challenging mob or boss. If you love games such as Path of Exile, Diablo II, and Titan Quest then I strongly suggest trying this game out. Its worth every penny to me.			"

No complaints at all, no glitches or anything. I think the game is ready to get out of Early Access. I can gaurantee that A. I will be playing this game all year and B.

												I've played close to 15 hours here, so I don't know the entire game, but played it enough for an impression I'd like to share.In short: it's a classic hack & slay action RPG. If you are looking for exactly that, you'll be happy with the game.GraphicsThe good: detailed enemies and landscape creates a nice atmosphereThe bad dated engine (especially in matters of the effects)The game looks good considering the engine used. Just don't expect state of the art graphics. SoundIt's ok. The music is nice and the effects are ok too. Some NPCs have voiced text, but most don't and neither does your character.GameplayIt's a traditional hack&slay action RPG, with all its ups and downs.The good: nice character building system (combine two classes, distribute skill points, attribute points and devotion points) interesting decisions to make every now and then nicely balanced difficulty nice writing of the story got some sort of a crafting system despite a linear gameplay, there is some room for exploration items can grant entirely new skills.The bad: apart from the gender, you have no way to customize your characters looks AI is dumb no tooltip for actual DPS change of new items you find (only base damage) Matter of taste: The areas are not random but the same with each playthrough. That leads to more detailed and better designed areas, but also reduces the motivation to play through it more than once (which can still be fun with a higher difficulty level and different classes), since you know exactly what's coming. Of course the game does not requite a lot of brain power. You walk around and kill what moves. It's something to relax with instead of mentally challenging. Due to the masses of loot to find, most of which is of course irrelevant. A loot filter prevents you from picking up most unwanted stuff, but most of what you find you still won't use.Compared to:Diablo 3: Grim Dawns character building system is more flexible and complex, but at times also cluttered. Technologically Grim Dawn is several generations behind Diablo 3, but the graphics are still decent, and this only matters if you really expect state of the art technology.Torchlight I and II: Grim Dawn is grittier and darker, and apart from that most that I said about Diablo 3 applies here as well.Titan Quest: Basically Grim Dawn is a successor to that and has a lot of similarities.ConclusionIt's a fun hack & slay action RPGs. Apart from being in matters of technology not very advanced, it's a great game.			"

								This review is of the Early Access release as of 7/26/2015.As someone who has played way, way too much Diablo II and Titan Quest, Grim Dawn certainly scratches the same itch as those games. It does have some notable improvements: the faction system, improved crafting, better NPC interaction and an overall greater feeling of immersion in the setting than Titan Quest. For the most part, the game mechanics feel right.While I have seen a few minor visual glitches, I have not encountered any crashes or show-stopping bugs at this point in the game. That said, my system exceeds the recommended hardware specs by a good bit, but my frame rate is still poor. I expected this to some degree, as performance tuning is usually the last thing done before full release once all the game content is in place, and this is an Early Access game. As it stands, the game is playable with all graphics settings turned down. Fights with large groups of monsters certainly seen a drop in fps.Overall, Grim Dawn is playable and fun at this stage, but if you have very low-end hardware, I might wait until the developers have had time to do some more performance tuning before jumping in.

												This game as you know is made by Titan Quest dev. team. So,those experienced player with the team would notice the nostalgia of it. But those newcomers like me would think this is a decent game. Here are some pros of the game base on my opinion.1.Unique skill build. You have an option to master 2 classes which has a variety of builds to play around. That's because of the loot you obtain which will be different everytome you obtain it. Then you combine a skill set of 2 classes into a distinct one of your own. Basically end-game build is yours to figure out while playing. BTW you can respec skill.2.A game influnced by Titan Quest(obviously),Diablo and Torchlight. Basically if you like ARPG,Hack&Slash,looting. You might wanna play this.3.Awesome environment. Good graphics.4.Set item, Item enhancement, Crafting.That should help you decielde to buy the game more or less.			"

								If you've already played games like this (titan quest, diablo, van helsing) you'll enjoy it. There's a multi-class system that changes your name based on what classes you pick to diversify your gameplay. The enemies are well put together, fun stuff to destroy as well.What I'd like to see is better highlighted items when the loot drops, sometimes it's difficult to pick up loot in an instant. The multiplayer menu is a little confusing at first go. Would like to filter what items you can see when loot drops too.Also, the items look pretty awesome as well. I'd buy it if you like this type.			"

								Grim Dawn is a 3D Hack and Slash with 4 classes at the moment. It's also in beta so it's not quite feature complete and I think they plan to have 2-4 more classes. (however I think it's close to full release)Ever played Titan Quest? Same developer. And he is learning. I loved titan quest to death. But Grim Dawn is so much better. From what I have played so far it is quite impressive. Some things are unbalaced (because beta) but most of the game is well balanced. The story is pretty good. (Warning. Spoilers of the first 5 minutes of gameplay ahead :P) You wake up just before your about to be hanged. Turns out you got possessed by a demon and it left your body just before you were hanged. You then proceed to explore around the town called Devil's Crossing. It's small. But as you play through the game you keep adding people to it. Apparantly some portals opened up and monsters started coming through. I have not figured out why or how yet and I wouldn't say even if I did because it would be a big spoiler. When you hit level 1 you get to pick a class. The current classes are Soldier, Demolishonist, Nightblade, and Occultist. The soldier is your average Sword and board. The demolishionist throws things such as Electrifying Jacks (like the small spiky kind of Jacks), Moltov Cocktails, and Grenades. The Nightblade is your kind of rouge class. And the Occultist summons pets to help him fight, a raven that uses magic to heal and buff freinds and zap monsters, and a hellhound that tanks for you and mauls your enemys.The Spec trees work like they did in Titan Quest. You have a bar that you can put points in. Putting points in the bar gives you stats and if you get certain amounts of points in the bar (1, 5, 10, 15 ect) You unlock skills that you can put points in. The more points, the better the skill. Also you will get upgrades for your skills. So when I get my Moltov Cocktail all it does is create a small area that burns enemys. Well. If I spend another 5 points in the bar and get a point in an upgrade then my Moltov will reduce the enemy's defence as well. One of my favorite things about this game is that you can have more than 1 class. Once you hit level 10 you get the option to pick another class. So it allows for some unique combinations. My first character was a Demolitionist that had a raven and a hellhound following it around.Overall I love this game. And I expect it to be even better when it's finished. 8/10			"

								 I admit, total over the ARPG's over the years I have literally thousands of hours of gameplay. Grim dawn is amazing and Im going to play at least a thousand hours of this , Great Diablo 2 feel but runs newer and smoother (without Dsync like path of exile.) It can have some tough moments too, so much like anything else it has a trial and error element , I recommend experimenting with the different skill trees as they can hybridize.			"

								Titan Quest developers went off a created a darker more richly detailed world with a nod to more mature fantasy settings. The atmosphere drips from your screen as the character you build pulls you ever further into this great action role playing game. 'Grim' is properly used in the title. A sense of forbodding hangs over the people and the land. Very well crafted game. Loving it and well worth yout time and money.			"

								This is the best aRPG I've played since Diablo 2. They nailed everything; the story is great, the atmosphere is great, the graphics look awesome, and the character building is very open-ended. While it's not yet finished, the first half of the game is already very fun and very well-polished. The classes and skill trees are basically complete, so there's no reason not to start playing now.			"

								Ok let me start off by saying this. I have been a pc gamer since 94 have played D1 D2 D3, TL1 Tl2, TQ And many other Dungeon Crawler game's. Grim Dawn by far is not the best but is is not the worse either. i will make this review to the point. Grim dawn is just like any other Dungeon Crawler but the feeling i get when i play is as you are the only surviver on a misson to kill thousand's of undead enemys. I get the same feeling when i played dead island, War Z, Day Z etc. Only diffrence is not a fps fized camera view and a more real like RPG feel. The game dos lack many things at its current state. But it is in early access so what more can you say about it. I give Grim Dawn a 10/10 in its current state. It's the same basics as normal dungeon crawlers but once again has its own twist an game play feel to it. Buy it is well worth it since its in early access its not perfect remmber but it is still a great soild game. I can not wait for the finished product.			"

								Simply amazing. I haven't had this much fun since Diablo 2. This game really scratches that itch. I was disappointed with Diablo 3 and found Torchlight 2 to be fun but too cartoonish. I am a huge fan of Titan Quest and its amazing expansion, and you can definitely feel the influence here with the excellent skill trees and class combination system. The loot is great and often useful, and levelling up actually feels like an event and an achievement. You have the chance to think about your character and how you want him/her to develop. The graphics are great, nice and dark. The music is awesome and definitely fits the bill. The levels are quite varied and there are hidden places and side quests scattered around, so exploration is rewarded. The boss monsters are original and fun to fight. The story is not the most deep and philosophical one out there, but that's not the point of games like this. Oh, you do get to influence the development of your town based on choices made during certain encounters. The crafting system is complex and rich with possibilities of creating useful gear. This is an early access game, although it feels pretty solid already: there is lots of content already out and more is on the way. It most certainly is worth the asking price. In my opinion these guys deserve it for delivering a great action RPG experience!This game is for you if you like:-Titan Quest.-Useful loot without endless grinding.-A genuinely dark atmosphere (à la Diablo).-An ARPG that isn't too dumbed down.-Proper character classes/skill trees.

								This game is still in Alpha, so my review needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I've played D3 for hundreds of hours, maybe over one thousand. I've played PoE a bit, and this seems to be a good middle ground of both. Where D3 turns into a grind/mash fest that is fairly well polished and has a large team behind it, this is the darker, fuller-storied step brother. There seems to be a much more detailed storyline, and getting through the game takes quite some time. I'm trying to remember back to my first completion of D3, and I want to say it took me maybe 10 hours from start to finish. Grim Dawn seems to be significantly longer, and there are more side quests, to boot. One feels more involved in the Grim Dawn community, as there are factions that need to be built up in order to purchase certain set items, akin to WoW style gameplay.The character build system is vastly different than other ARPGs, in the sense that there is a structured leveling system, but you can single- or dual-class your character with tons of options to customize. Beyond that, the Devotion system offers more fine tuning and other optional abilities that can be built in with each class. Overall, there seems to be a much more diverse system of builds that are viable in Grim Dawn than other ARPGs. I have yet to complete the game a single time in nearly 25 hours played, but then again I am trying to explore all of the content as well.Overall, I'd suggest this game if you want a decent storyline with difficult gameplay and an expansive skill system. Being made with the same engine as Titan Quest, Crate borrows the 6 class / multiple points in many talents with upgrades feel, bringing that old TQ nostalgia back in droves. Would buy again!			"

												Update after playing full release: Totally blew away my expecations even during the early access phase (which my comments below are based on). Extreme amounts of choice added through the devotion system (similar to an addition skills tree), graphics and animations look perfect and are optimized well. Only bug I'm still experiencing is other players gear not showing up after it is equipped by them (though it reappears after transitioning to a new area or using a riftgate).Excellent game even in current form July 2015. I prefer this to Diablo 3 even with the announced future plans. Grim Dawn is much more complex in terms of damage and defense types, and in terms of character customization. The game really shines in these two places. Class combining is done super good. Lots of choice with little or no feeling of restirction. At this point, it's a little clunky (character movement animations, map navigation, the odd bug; its crashing a fair amount for me at this point...). The final product will be good for sure.			"

								Decided to give this a go after playing a lot of Titan Quest and Diablo 2. Gotta say, this game is really similar to Titan Quest, as others have pointed out. But since I loved TQ, that's a really, really good thing. The atmosphere is creepy though, so that's fresh (think Path of Exile). Played about 3 hours so far, I can see myself playing this game a lot! One thing that could be better tho, is the optimization. Ofcourse it will be improved, since this is an Early Release title, and it runs decently on my really old PC, but titan quest ran A LOT better, and since it's the same engine, i expect it to run somewhat similarly. This isn't a huge problem though, on the lowest settings and on a slightly reduced resolution i have stable 40+ fps.TL;DR: If you like ARPG games, do the devs a favour and get this, it's worth every penny.Do I recommend it? ♥♥♥♥ yes			"

								This is definitiely one of my favorite if not my favorite ARPG game I've ever played. Torchlight being right next to it. I enjoy the darker atmosphere more than the bright pretty Torchlight. But the gameplay in the first chapter, even in early access was so fun that I've held off playing until it's finished to avoid spoiling it, until I can binge on the finished game. The story actually drew me in, storylines in games usually aren't a big draw for me, but I found myself reading averything I could find.  If you a fan of ARPG's or dark storylines this game is for you. I backed this game in kickstarter in the hopes of a dark arpg reminiscent of old diablo, and that's what I got. I am very glad I backed this game and I am awaiting eagerly awaiting it's finished version. It's most definitly worth a buy, once it's fully finished. Even now it's still really good, and worth a buy, if your willing to wait for a finished game.			"

												i don't leave many reviews, but this feels enough like diablo 2 that i had to spread the good word. as a loyal blizzard fan from the original warcraft 1, starcraft 1, and diablo 1 i just wasn't getting any satisfaction from diablo 3 anymore. it was decent for a while, but it just didn't scratch the itch. this game does it.it takes everthing good about diablo 2, keeps it, and adds new updates. personal town portals you can share (with no scrolls to worry about), they just throw the bosses on you in the game world (without making it huge totally separate cutscene bull***t). and they straight copied the maggot layer from diablo 2, just changed the names. it's hilarious.there's not a thousand difficulties to worry about, you have to earn them. there are bounties to do during the campaign. i paid the full 25 dollars, and it was worth every penny. and bought it for 2 of my other friends. the story is decent, and it kind of has a western/fallout feel to it. worth. very much worth.

It's not a story driven game though.Smooth on old computers (my PC is 10 years old)Loot.  Loot.  Wait....  more loot?Cons :Components are annoying.  They're just a time sink which I'm not dealing with at all at the moment.  Once you get high level, I'm sure there are strategic decisions, but at lower levels they're just junk which you can habitually use on gear and reclaim.  It's not interesting, and I'm not doing it on veteran.Some quests can permanently stop you from access to certain merchants without any clear indication of what actually happened.  One stabbed guy says one thing, the guy who admitted he stabbed him said another.  Who do you side with?  If you said the guy who was stabbed, you're wrong, and lose a merchant.			"

												EDIT: Since the full release, this game has only become even more desirable. The mechanics are polished and streamlined, the itemization is almost doubled, and the engine has been optimized dramaticallyYou want this game. ARPG veterans and newbies alike will find something to appreciate, and the deep skill system makes for endless possibilities. The world is not as dynamic or interactive as big AAA sandbox games obviously, but the combat mechanics are so solid they might form a black hole from their sheer density. So many items work together in so many ways and your skills can be tweaked on a very granular level with the respec system, though I might gripe that skill points are still a bit scarce as of build 29. Seriously, just get it. It would take a long time to really describe why this game is great, but if you love action and loot, this is the place to be.			"

The progression it handled perfectly. 5.	Oh, and don’t like how you built your character? Respecing is made easy and not cost prohibitive. Some annoyances: 1.	Poorly optimized: rotating screen can cause some stutter/ drop fps. 2.	Most don’t really care to play an RPG at over 100 fps but this game has trouble cracking that. Still looks damn beautify decayed though. 3.	Some interactions are not voiced. Would make the game more immersive if they were. The level of depth is astounding. Have to give it to this game. "

												Preface: I bought this game when it was 50% off, but I still think it's worth the asking price of $25. I usually say that if I can get a 1:1 ratio of dollars spent to hours played I'm happy, and I'm over that by a lot already. I've been wanting to write a review of this game for a while but I've waited until I've gotten some more play time into it so that I can give a solid review. Right now in the game I'm on Elite difficulty on my main character which is a Witch Hunter. First I want to start off by saying that this game reminded me of how I felt when I played Diablo 2. I'm not one for hardcore characters or anything, but I still enjoy a challenge. This game definitely provides a challenge.My first run through of this game was on normal difficulty, but if you are fairly experienced with these types of games, I would suggest going the Veteran route. It's one of those games that might kill you, but you can definitely strategize in the future to plan around getting killed again (though it does get more difficult). What I love aside from the dark atmosphere and fear of death all the time is the different types of augmentations for your character. You build it from the ground up in many different ways, and after level 50, you start getting access to Legendary items. There are attribute points (for your basic stats), mastery points (for your skills and buffs), and then shrines which give you access to devotion points which allow even more customization--something that all ""classes"" or masteries have access to. Depending on how you spend these, you can develop new skills or strategies or even survival methods. I'm not one to mind grinding games too much (especially when Diablo 3 was only story mode runs...), but this game offers choices on how much you want to challenge yourself. Though at a certain point (i.e. higher difficulties) it's thrust upon you. Even still, these higher difficulties offer challenege dungeons and harder areas to play in. It's definitely a game that I recommend using the wiki page through your playthroughs to help maximize your rewards in the game. It's a game I can play by myself which I love. I would definitely recommend getting this game if you want a hack and slash experience with great loot and skills. I'm sure others might say things against that, but it's all up to you!One thing I would like to nitpick is that there are some buggy aspects when pointing and clicking by different levels in this game, and even things that allow you to kill enemies a little better through walls. But these bugs aren't super bad, just can be a mild inconvenience. Thanks for reading, sorry it was so long!			"

												i don't leave many reviews, but this feels enough like diablo 2 that i had to spread the good word. as a loyal blizzard fan from the original warcraft 1, starcraft 1, and diablo 1 i just wasn't getting any satisfaction from diablo 3 anymore. it was decent for a while, but it just didn't scratch the itch. this game does it.it takes everthing good about diablo 2, keeps it, and adds new updates. personal town portals you can share (with no scrolls to worry about), they just throw the bosses on you in the game world (without making it huge totally separate cutscene bull***t). and they straight copied the maggot layer from diablo 2, just changed the names. it's hilarious.there's not a thousand difficulties to worry about, you have to earn them. there are bounties to do during the campaign. i paid the full 25 dollars, and it was worth every penny. and bought it for 2 of my other friends. the story is decent, and it kind of has a western/fallout feel to it. worth. very much worth.

												Spiritual successor to Titan Quest, or Sacred 1 or 2.  You like those, you will get along with this.Pros :Good skill system (if you've played the aforementioned games, you'll understand it).Decent story and progression.  It's not a story driven game though.Smooth on old computers (my PC is 10 years old)Loot.  Loot.  Wait....  more loot?Cons :Components are annoying.  They're just a time sink which I'm not dealing with at all at the moment.  Once you get high level, I'm sure there are strategic decisions, but at lower levels they're just junk which you can habitually use on gear and reclaim.  It's not interesting, and I'm not doing it on veteran.Some quests can permanently stop you from access to certain merchants without any clear indication of what actually happened.  One stabbed guy says one thing, the guy who admitted he stabbed him said another.  Who do you side with?  If you said the guy who was stabbed, you're wrong, and lose a merchant.			"

												EDIT: Since the full release, this game has only become even more desirable. The mechanics are polished and streamlined, the itemization is almost doubled, and the engine has been optimized dramaticallyYou want this game. ARPG veterans and newbies alike will find something to appreciate, and the deep skill system makes for endless possibilities. The world is not as dynamic or interactive as big AAA sandbox games obviously, but the combat mechanics are so solid they might form a black hole from their sheer density. So many items work together in so many ways and your skills can be tweaked on a very granular level with the respec system, though I might gripe that skill points are still a bit scarce as of build 29. Seriously, just get it. It would take a long time to really describe why this game is great, but if you love action and loot, this is the place to be.			"

												It’s an absolutely marvelous world that I love. Its dark and of course Grim, it’s full of detail and texture. Plenty of variety as you travel through Victorian nightmare to underground caves and insect hives. Then blink in the sunlight as the second act pushes all that aside to randomly be about cowboys instead. Environmental touches are everywhere, completely selling the idea that this is a fallen land past any chance of actually saving. The abandoned villages and the crumbling walls of dungeons or the sadistic experiments in Warden's sickly green laboratory.Exploring it is a smooth and epic-feeling experience that regularly demands long treks through enemy territory to get to the next boss or quest objective. Just about every path is scattered with both big combat engagements and dungeons to dip into for an extra boss fight and bonus loot.Gathering loot is a cornerstone of the genre. Those junk items are worth so little compared to the cost of buying a health potion that it never feels satisfying to sell. It’s usually usable gear like swords and shields like the one you’re currently using. This makes it a real pain to sort through in search of worthwhile upgrades and gear to hold onto. Going back to town is at least painless, with a free Rift Travel spell that puts you right next to a shopkeeper and a portal back to where you just left. You can at least set the screen to only show that loot in the first place.Magic in particular quickly steps up from a few basic sparks to screen-filling pyrotechnics, with fire-strikes turning into full explosions and what are meant to be simple lightning-based stun effects packing enough punch to not just kill enemies outright, but send them flying across the scenery as if literally dismissed as unworthy to fight for real. Spirit or for some people Mana, is well balanced to let you cut loose with these abilities on a constant basis. Each Mastery has a powerful set to choose from, though upgrading them and unlocking new skills has to be balanced with leveling up passive increases that help provide the stats needed to wield better gear and keep up with the monster curve.Plot is there if you want it though, in the occasional lore text and conversations with friends and villains, and I did like the slow building up of the town of Devil’s Crossing from a town of survivors basically sitting back and anticipating death to actually being a small community with a chance. The acts also unfold out to provide plenty of different scenery as you cross the huge world. Huge to the extent that even early quests to a neighboring town feel like small odysseys which are littered with bonus dungeons of every size, including special challenge ones that disable rift travel and make the only way out either victory or death.

								Awesome game! Has a Path of Exile feel, and nice combat features. The game itself is very well made and the art and graphics are well made as well. Since the beginning I was intrigued to go further in search for better loot and weapons. The game has classes on which your abilities are based off of, and the feature of this game that makes it nice is the fact that the abilities can always be changed. There is no permanent path! You're free to play the game freely and you are easily able to change your play style at most points in the game.			"

												This is an awesome ARPG, and has gotten much, much better since I purchased it a while back in early access. This game absolutely nails the atmosphere, music, art, and overall feel of the game. The world is massive, insanely detailed, and very fun to explore. The combat, classes, abilities and builds are great. The closest thing I could compare this game to would be a modern day, much better version of Titan Quest + Diablo 2 + POE. I'm pretty sure a lot of the same devs worked on TQ as did this game. For the price though, this game is an absolute steal, and you would be doing youself a disservice as a fan of the genre not to pick this game up. This game is absolutely fantastic.			"

												I have played this game since its early release and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed games such as Titan quest, Diablo and Torchlight. The developers have being faithful to their words and are responsive to community feedback. TL:DR Very well designed and clear cut Diablo-esque ARPG game that handles well and is extremely fun, but lacks the technical optimization and stability of a AAA title.Pros:- 6 very different character classes to choose from. Each with their own charm.- Every skill is meaningful and you can customize your character to your heart's content.- Combat is responsive and fun.- There are a large variety of drops from common to legendary. Rare items are rare enough that they are satisfying to get, but not so rare that you have to grind for days at a time. Caveat is that RNJesus will give you the same useless epic item seemingly over and over again.- Crafting is fairly useful and fun.- Lots of lores and interesting back stories.- Very long and intricate story line for an ARPG.- Overall extremely polished and fun game.Major Cons:- Game is not very well optimized. I have an average set up and sometimes still run into frame rate issues on med-high graphics.- Game is not entirely stable after the latest patch. I have being experiencing crashes once ever hour and with quiet a bit of my save date lost everytime. It might be only on demolishionist, but it has become very frustrating.Minor Cons:- Devotion system is very cool, but it grows so slowly and feels negligeble. At no point do you feel like ""WOW I AM SO GLAD I MAXED OUT THIS TREE."" It's a constant sense of ""another point here and...meh.""- You get a lot of the same unique item all the time for some reason.- It can be very grind heavy, especially with the reputation system. You might like it.- Game story is okay. But no one really plays this type of game for the story.- Graphics and animation isn't as flashy as some of the AAA games, but it is charming and fun.- No real voice acting, but who cares in a shoot and loot game.

Early Access Review
								Wonderful post-apocalyptic Action RPG. Spiritual successor to titan quest made by the team reponsible for Titan Quest. Even though it's in early access, the game does a wonderful job of holding my interest via massive skill trees and a multitude of wonderful combinations therein. The difficulty can be quite brutal, and at least for me that is some of the games' charm.It's about time I updated this reviw in light of all the new elements Crate has added to this wonderful title.Let's talk about Devotion system first. You run around the world purifying and repairing sanctuaries that have been damaged or defiled by an evil presence. As you do this you gain Devotion Points, you assign them to various constellations to unlock bonuses that range from passive stat boosts, to skills that proc on hit/certain damage type/etc. to active skills. It adds an extra layer of customization to your character that is separate from, and can be extremely complementary to, your mastery build. The number of constellations is staggering. There are 45+, each ranging from 5-8 nodes. With Devotion Points capping at 50, you have to pick and choose very carefully, as each constellation awards you with certain attunement bonuses. Other constellations require one or more (depending on how potent they are)attunement bonuses in order for you to be able to invest in them.The only downside to the Devotion system appears to be how long it can take to acquire your points to really delve into the system.On to the new mastery types! During 2015 Crate added two new masteries to the game: Shaman and Arcanist. Shaman is a full-time two-handed weapon wielder, with a solid repoitoire of utility skills, and even a few pet summons.Arcanist on the other hand is essentially your typical mage build. Defensive skills that can prevent or reduce damage, utility skills that can remove negative effects from yourself/party members and beneficial effects from enemies.Both masteries pair quite well with a number of the original 4.

												Awesome game, a little confusing in the beginning with the devotion tree, but pretty nice once you get to know it. Class customization is pretty nice.			"

												Grim Dawn paints an evil and sinister world, with an epic, yet a kind of down-to-earth story. Inspired by Lovecraft, it is weird, horrific and sometimes absurd. It's also very atmospheric. Grim Dawn is colorful but the shades are dark. The music has a melodic and lighter tone to it, but the background it is framed on consists of oppressive and dark ambient drones. When you enter underground places, the latter gets much louder, truly capturing the feeling of traversing a dim dungeon filled with all sorts of undead horrors.Grim Dawn is a perfect game for hardcore play, where death means actual in-game death. No online requirement means no lag, and everything is in sync. If you die, it will be your own tactical fault. If you are careful and plan well, you will beat the game, and it will be rewarding.Actually, the only thing I needed to know to fall in love with this game was that developers strived to make a game that respects your time. The hunt for loot is fun and rewards exploration instead of mindless killing over and over again. Grim Dawn is an action hack-n-slash RPG that promotes quality over quantity. Items are fun, character builds are varied and many, legendary items can make you change your playstyle, world is detailed and has a day-night cycle, lore is fulfilling and entertaining, combat is satisfying, story is to an extent player choice-driven and well-written, exploration is rewarding. Yes, I recommend this game very much.			"

												Amazing game overall. The only aspect that could have been done better is multyplayer player hosted games are typically laggy and there is a lack of ""community"" feel. That said if you have friends to play with or just prefer single player this game is absolutely worth it.			"

												Been a fan since before they were Crate Entertainment, When they made Titan Quest as Iron Lore. When I heard about this, I jumped onboard at once. this game has so much depth, I've been experimenting with different builds, and there are so many ways to customize your skills and abilities, it's ridiculous. At least that would explain why I've played this game in 12 hour stints.I cannot get enough of this game, spread the word to your friends: If they like Diablo, they'll love Grim Dawn. I really wnat to see this succeed to prompt a sequel and get this company the recognition it deserves. "

												Probably the best ARPG I have ever played. Grim Dawn offers an outstanding character customization, the dual clash selection from 6 existing classes plus the devotion system and the numerous passive and active skills from equipment and enchanting components create literaly infinite playstyles to explore and enjoy. The faction system makes the game more interesting both in farming and questing. You can explore the world for many secret locations, treasures and even hidden quests. To top it all of it only costs 24,99 which is a very good price for a game with great repeatability and I strongly recommend it to all the ARPG fans.			"

												Grim Dawn has captured my attention for over 100 hours and I have enjoyed every minute of it. So many builds amongst the classes available, great lore and story, tough boss battles (once you get to higher difficulties), and an all around great darkish theme. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys ARPG's such as Diablo, Titan Quest, Path of Exile etc.			"

												The True Diablo 2 sequl!!!  As someone who has played diablo3, torchlight1 &2, and POE, this game is the closet to a real dialbo 3 (in the vien of the first two games).  Why those other games are are ok to good in different areas, there are drawbacks and things that make you go..""why did they do that?"".Diablo 3 - weapons are just decorative they don't feel like weapons just extensions for your body and a vessel for the skills, there isn't much mystery and everything seems so linear. I won't even go into the loot system or the orginal auction for money house... there were too many things wrong with this game (although it is fun to play on console with couch co-op)Torchlight - nailed the loot system but the first game was linear and lacking in class options.. second game solved some of that but the art style was cartoony,  It was a good game just not a proper sequel if you were looking for a real diablo sequel.POE - Nailed everything especially the skil tree, but the microtransactions and always online kinda suck... Would of rather paid full price for the game and had weapons and armor with actual particle effects (don't like how you need to buy them.. I have bought some but would rather unique weapons have)Grim dawn fixes all those issues... if you want a true d2 sequel.  Atmosphere, insane loot, weapons that have ""crunch"", weapons that mean something, skill trees that are massive and mix and match classes with a constilation skill system. It imo, is on par with POE for skill choice.Story in this game is great too. You are in a repressed world, where humanity is fighting back. Everyhing is bleak and dark themed.  You feel it, it captures that magic of the original diablo.I have not played online with this game so I have no idea what that is like... but as a single player game this game is amazing!			"

Early Access Review
								       There is so much to say about Grim Dawn, so I will try to make my review short and concise, yet informative. First off, if isometric ARPGs happen to be your favorite genre, Grim Dawn is the absolute best game in this genre that I have ever played. The mechanics are fantastic and really easy to learn, and follow. One of my personal favorites is the option to use two classes for your character. The dual class system gives the player so many options for however they would like to play their character, such as a tank, warrior, magic user, etc. The story is great, and really immerses the player in the lore of everything that happened after the Grim Dawn. On top of the main story line, there are many different side quests the player can embark on. Upon gaining enough respect with different groups in different areas of the game, a bounty table is opened to the player, which allows the player to fight different bosses, and continually gain experience.       The loot system is another great feature. As with most isometric ARPGs, the player can clear every area multiple times, which gives you the chance for items and equipment that can only be found in a certain area. The game also has great replay value. If you play the game in normal mode and beat it, the game will have you replay in harder settings. The final thing I will say about the game is about the aesthetics, which are great. The game is visually appealing, but isn't cluttered up with too much detail, which can ultimately be distracting.        The final thing I would like to say about Grim Dawn is: BUY IT! I promise it will be the best $24.99 you have spent on a game.			"

												I found out about this game on mmorpg.com while looking at the list of recently released game.... This game is AWESOME! I havent been able to stop playing. I would say I've already gotten my monies worth at this point and I feel like there is much more to the game left for me to explore.The story, combat, quests, and world are all very detailed. The skill trees, ability to dual class, and the amount of gear to find and craft is over the top. It's been a while since I've been sucked into a game as I have been in the past few days. If you are a fan of ARPGs you owe it to yourself to play this game. Final Score : 9/10**********************************************BUY THIS GAME**********************************************The only negatives I have for this game are that some elements in the UI could use a little polish. Example : When you first start the game, it's not immediately clear that you need to create a character first -> not a problem since you'll figure this out in a half a second but the process could be smoother. Also, when you level up if you close the window without assigning points you'll need to press S or re-open the skill window some other way since the level button in the middle is disabled again. The additional bag icons are not immediately obvious.			"

												Well constructed ARPG in the 'lots of stuff to pick up and modifiers to consider' mold. Main point of concern for me is the overall tone - it's at a level of dire grimness that, were I note amused by the over-to-top nature of it, would be utterly oppressive. Endless stacked corpses everwhere, place names like Wightmire and Devil's Crossing abound - it's all rather trying way too hard. It's a shame, in that the one piece of its Titan Quest pedigree it fails to live up to is the very thing Titan Quest did best, crafting an interesting and cohesive world and aesthetic. The world of 'Cairn' is just... uninspired and generic. Saddening. Still, the gameplay is great, so take it as you will.			"

								Grim Dawn doesn't do anything mind blowing or reinvent anything in the ARPG genre. What it does is do it's job and it does it well. It's satisfying and fun to play. Remember this is an Alpha release that still has a ton of develpment and content addtions coming. This is not a finished product. Please understand what early access is and look at it in that light.If I had to make a suggestion I would ask that the skills come a little faster and that they have more visual ""oomph"" behind them.

Early Access Review
								This is the best Early Access game I have played on Steam so I felt compelled to write a review. I've been playing almost since it's inception.If you're looking for a fun Hack'nSlash with replayability this is the game for you. There really isn't much else to do in the game besides wading through hordes of monsters, going back to town and selling loot...but there's a certain appeal that keeps you do it over and over. Finding that one piece of gear to bring your character's dps over the edge, finding that one crafting component that fits nicely with your weapon, specing and respecing your abilities to see what works best...all of these things work in conjuction to keep bringing you back. The graphics are great, the sound track is original and the overal gritty atmosphere give this game an unmistakbable personality that sets it apart from other games of the same genre.There are a few down sides though. First and foremost the updates are very few and far between. It's been a year since  release and its feels like the current content is wearing itself thin. I felt like I was on the edge of my seat druing the first few months of playing but now I just hop on if I need to kill some time before leaving the house. Everything has been explored and my char has reached a plateau. Playing is rather drab when I know I can't improve no matter what I do.Multiplayer definitely needs work. The lag is a little ridiculous...expect a 1-2 second delay with every swing and every spell you cast. You also lose connectivity after about 30 minutes of playing. This game is definitlely meant for single player but it would be nice to have some solid multiplayer action.While the crafting feature adds a nice touch and is fairly easy to learn (basically stack components of the same type, combine them to make a powerful version and drop it on an item) There are some that are ridiculously hard to find. I've been playing for almost a year and have found only 3 of one type, just shy of completing it for an awesome weapon buff. There are others that drop once in a blue moon and I can play for months without ever getting a drop. I've never played an MMO with such rare loot drops.All in all it's a solid game. I'd definitely reccomend it to a friend. While it is addictive at first, don't expect it to keep your attention for very long like some other games. "

I even bought a copy for my brother so we could play together! It's got a Diablo-esque feel to it, but also has it's own uniqueness, as well! One example is the components. You can collect components and attach them to equipment, or you could save up 3 of them and combine them into one! Doing this will create a full component that grants improved stats than the original components give, but also gives a completion bonus! This could be anything from a new skill, to boosted stats, to elemental damage! It's still got some bugs in it, like the SFX repeating, but it's not complete yet so I'm sure that'll be fixed! I have performance issues on my gaming computer, but after lowering the settings it works great! Overall, I give this game a 9.75/10.			"

								Now this is how  you run and Early Access Game.  If i didnt know better i would think it was finshed.  Btw i just picked up another copy just to have for a pal down the way who might want to play as i see the price going up very soon for this game as it is way under price as is.   There is realy alot of hart and soul put into this game and if they were to take another year to finsh it i would be ok with that because i think the Dev love this game as if it was there only child.  It is not just another action rpg,  it is the top dog of arpg and busting at the seems with content.			"

												When I first started playing this game I thought, ""Oh, this is yet another arpg... well... I'll give it a couple of hours then move on.""  I'm now at over 130 hours and still get sucked in to play more.  Once you finish the main quest line, and the few side quests, there isn't a lot to go back to except trying different classes and combinations - but what a great job the devs have done with making those choices interesting.  If you enjoy arpg's at all, you should give this game a try.  It is ""pre-release"" but to be honest I've had almost zero problems with it.  It's actually more polished than a lot of ""final release"" games I've played.  This game is a great value for the price.  Edit - March 27, 2016 Now that it's finished the game is even better.  If you have any interest in diablo or arpg's you absolutely must have this game.  I can't wait to see what this studio does next.			"

								Quite simply amazing, graphics and gameplay or both lovely, the storyline and lore are both intriguing with eldritch undertones. Also combat does not require you to continously click away at your enemies you can simply hold the mouse button down. There is questing to be done, all manner of monsters to slay and factions to please. Yeah this game has factions. All this from an eight person team, which is what really blows me away. I can not wait for this game to be finished and hope the team releases more games in the future!			"

												I got Grim Dawn on a whim. A couple friends said it was pretty good and the reviews were pretty positive. So I dumped the $$ and jumped right in. Boy am I glad I did.Grim Dawn is what you'd get if DIablo and Titan Quest had a baby. I really takes the best from both and throws out all the crap you don't like. The skill trees are nearly identical to Titan Quests (different skills, of course, but the look is exactly the same) and the play is top-down Diablo-style clicking. GD also adds a Devotion part that allows you to get even stronger by filling out constellations. Sounds odd but in practice it works. The only thing I dislike about it is that there's so much loot and differing stats that it's hard to prioritize - and that's hardly a beef when it's just part of the learning curve.Get this game if you are able. It's worth it.			"

												Pros:- Great customisation- Doesn't require to be online (perfect for those with poor internet)- Multiplayability is good- Even though it is grim, art direction is great and music ambience too- Penalises you (and rightfully so) for choosing your setup poorly. I went for ultra glass-cannon and got obliterated even though my damage was immense. It makes you think about how you should play.Cons:- Upscaling levels. I leave an area because it's 6 levels higher than me, come back 6 levels later and they've been scaled up again? What's this about? If this is intended as a difficulty increase, fair enough, but then why not upscale lower level areas as well to make them good exp when grinding mats as well?- I'd love to see the game fully voice-acted and a few more soundtracks as well. Especially since you'll play many hours at a time			"

												If you liked Titan Quest, you'll love this! It has some gameplay similar to it and some decent character customization layers as well.  And with character customization I mean skill and builds, not the way your character looks. For me personally it's always a nice feeling getting some loot on one toon and then roll another just as an experiment with that loot. Also, if you like building characters to see how far you'd get or how effective it would be, I would also say this game's for you.There's a bunch of classes to choose from, with even more incoming in an expansion and you're able to mix and match 2 of them. Not only can you pick from those 2 classes to suit your playstyle, but the gear you can find could complement your character playstyle or allow you to play the same toon in a completely different way.All in all, this game's, in my opinion, a must have for rpg fans that like playing from an isometric standpoint and collecting lots of shiny loot to build the character for the playstyle they'd want to use!Cheers!

I hope that will be added before release. The music is amazing and fits with the theme well. Can't get enough of this at the moment. Highly recommend for all those Titan Quest lovers out there!			"

												Dont get me wrong Titan Quest veterans, but this game is a better implementation of the Iron Lore's engine, such a complex and well built system coupled with a unique fast paced gameplay that reminds me a lot of Diablo 2, an intense and challenging walkthrough with an epic ARPG engine that fitted so damn well. Not to mention the lore and core decisions which is really a thing in this game. Congratulations devs.			"

												I wanted to get some in-game hours before I reviewed the game.  Now that I'm close to 150 hours, I can feel confident in saying BUY THIS GAME.  The gritty post-'Grim Dawn' setting is surreal - kind of like the old west meets medieval England.  When the @#$% hits the fan, your best weapon might be rusty old shotgun held together with bandages, or a big @$$ saw blade lashed to a boat oar - you do what needs to be done to stay alive!  'The Grim Dawn' as it's called in the game is when The Aetherials entered our/their world and all went to hell - literally!  There are blood cults battling to bring humanity to a 'new beginning'(but we've all got to die first, see?), mutated creatures corrupted by the mere presence of The Aetherials in our dimension, and vile humans who are keen on taking advantage of every poor sod who can't fight back...  And all is not as it seems - can you even trust the person huddled next to you in the few safe havens left?  Are they even human at all?  And what about the strong person the survivors have rallied around, who's helped us along and become something of a 'leader'?  Is he/she leading us to safety - or to our doom?The game runs well on average hardware, so no super-machine is required, and I've never had a game-related crash.  All the fancy bits are there, like varied weather, volumetric lighting, motion blur & ambient occlusion, so crank it all up if you've got the GPU muscle.  The game was developed by many of the same people who made the AMAZING ""Titan Quest""(what, you don't have that?  Go get it!  Make sure to get the Anniversary Edition, which also contains the expansion 'Immortal Throne').  If you've ever played a Diablo game, then the mechanics will be familiar.  The available character abilities are WIDELY varied, so if you're that tank-y type who likes to dive in and cleave skulls up-close, feel free.  If you're the wizardly mage who'd rather evoke swarms of locusts and summon up up razor-thorned vines to hold your foes in place as the bugs eat them alive(oh joy!), you'll be right at home.  Or maybe you'd rather wield dual pistols, like some post-apocalyptic Wyatt Earp?  It's up to you.  And with free reign as far as character slots, you might try ALL the builds(and there are literally dozens of combinations)!  There's a great community surrounding the game and the official forums are a great place to discuss character builds, strategy, etc.I am very happy with spending the money to get Grim Dawn - in fact, I would have paid double the price.  As I said, at the time of writing this review, I have right at 150 hours in-game, and there is so much more I haven't even gotten to yet... and I WANT to play more.  If THAT isn't a testament to Grim Dawn being a good game, I don't know what is.			"

								Awesome Game! Love it!I've now played for weeks and have leveled 5 chars simultanously (for each class 1 Char) so I could exchange the dropped good Gear for other classes than that I was actually playing through the Group stash (well also it could contain little more than it actually does, even with unlocked 3 other Tabs it is still to small for my purposes :) ) And also when you play with Highres like 1920x1080 you ask all the time, why to hell is the Inventory so small there is so much place on the screen which is unused :) What a waste :) Think of all the nice loot scattered arround which you just cant loot because of lack of your inventoryspace you know! :) If the Inventory Screen is an ode to D1 and D2 then I have to say to this times there wasnt more room on the screen to make the Inventory bigger, so not everything must copied from Diablo, I agree with this opinnion in this case. But this are just small issues of cosmetical nature for me, noneseless the Game itself is GREAT AND WORTH TO PLAY AGAIN AND AGAIN! Like I said before, I've played for weeks with more than just one class, and I played EXESSIVELY like I played D1 and D2 and HEY MAN this game does not feel like an unfinished Game at all (even now at early access state)After few minutes of Gameplay you will be obsessed of the dark and demolished World of Cairn. You just cant stop to play and want see more of the World more of the Story more of your Chars progression and so on. Actually I like GD more than i.e I liked other ""Diabolish"" Games like TQ. Why? It is just the Dark-Age and the setting in which GD plays, the surroundings aren't polished, shiny and overcolored! like other Diabolo-Like Games I've seen before. I like this cataclyied end-of-the-world-environment of GD very much. Just the right place to rise up and become a Hero in a World which has lost all his hope you know? :)And like I said before, you dont feel when you play that this game is in an early-acsess-state, and still with every patch I've seen till now the Devs make the Gameplay and Feeling of the Player better and better. Amazing Game, amazing Devs whom are very interested in the Game-Community and their thoughts about the Game and they support the community in several ways. Love this Game! Thank you very much for making a Game like this nowadays!GD is just that what D3 was intended to be (a sequel to the great games D1 & D2) but failed!			"

								I love this game. When you start it, you may think it's just one more of the same. But the fact is that you don't need to be an expert or read tons of walktroughs to understand and maximize your characters. It is also great to know that every couple of months you get new content to the game (quest, items) so you can move fast ahead with other players or even be the first to reach a place or get a new item.The wide options in config let you play this with incredible grafics in your modern pc, or to play (as I do) on your 8 years old toaster :D.

Be warned though, it doesnt hold you hand. You actually have to search and find quest objectives and theres no big arrow to guide you. You have way more freedom to move between areas than other games in the genre too which i feel is great.If you see this in a sale, grab it with both hands!

												the quality of this game took me by surprise. I caught wind of it on a Youtube Channel list of overlooked games and thought I'd give it a try and boy was it great. Especially considering the fact that it's an Early Access game, which as of late has been really hard to find a diamond in the rough such as this.  It's a really enjoyable and quickly engaging ARPG that can  be played either as a multiplayer or singleplayer game with no detriment either way - it's totally fun whichever your preference!It's rather hard to describe this game fully but when I play this game I feel the same way as I did when Diablo 2 first came out. It's the gameplay of that series mixed in with a little bit of fallout in a pseudo post-apocalyptic steampunk medieval setting.  It's the perfect game for fans of top-down hack-and-slash RPGs in a DnD-esque world!colour me impressedoverall rating: 10/10			"

								A refreshing take on the action RPG genre, Grim Dawn doesn't dissapoint. Even though its still in early access, the mechanics are in place and the game runs smoothly and without bugs. If you are a fan of the action RPG genre (Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight etc.) you SHOULD pick this game up. It is more fleshed out than all of the other games and is a complete package.GD has more complexity than diablo 3 in terms of item crafting, classes, game mechanics etc. The story in GD is narrated mostly through text boxes but is easier to follow and is more interesting than the story in Torchlight 2 and PoE. I haven't seen the end game yet but there is already so much to do in the game that for just $12.50 on sale, its a steal.			"

								I love tweaking builds. I have spent 100 of hours building different odd characters in D2. To me that is the fun of APRG. Not the loot, not the clicking, but coming up with character builds that is fun. Grim Dawn is almost the only post-D2 ARPG that allows such tweaking fun. If you were utterly disappointed by D3 like I was, try this. I bought this in Early Access (still so when I run this review) but it is more like an episodic release to me.I have no idea about the multiplayer though. I am old and have no more time and no more buddies for that kind of things anymore. :P			"

Skill tree looks a bit meh so far compared to path of exile, but we'll see. So far pretty positive, can't wait to play more. Only downside so far is that some areas are really dark ( which is good for atmosphere ) but you can't really see that well what's going on. There is a colourblind option though, which I'm gonna try for sure. For the discount price, worth a buy imo.			"

												Everything you want from an action RPG this game delivers it! Diverse and deep build variety and options, killing mobs feels great, awesome loot (some of the best and most interesting item designs I have ever see in an RPG),difficulty is perfect, not D3 easy but not so hard that you have to spend 3 days reading the wiki before you can make a reasonably effective build. Also tons of secret areas and secrets to explore and find, a super in depth crafting system with unlockable recipes, a very interesting faction system that gives you access to some nice vendor items and upgrades... Just a boatload of awesome stuff, honestly!Biggest inspiration for this game was definitely titan quest, so if you liked that game you will feel right at home. It takes everything that was good from Titan Quest and makes it even better, adding a lot of additional mechanics. Mention to the constellation system (you get points from shrines in the world that you can invest into the constelation tree, unlocking some very powerfull bonusses and abilities) so essentially you have three different skill trees (2 classes + constellations) to build the character of your dreams from.TL;DR If you like to play action RPGs, this is a must have			"

								Simply outstanding and fun!I tried and tried to love D3 but it was just dull (for me at least). This however, is completely different in that it`s alway fun, dangerous and runs like a dream. Be warned though, it doesnt hold you hand. You actually have to search and find quest objectives and theres no big arrow to guide you. You have way more freedom to move between areas than other games in the genre too which i feel is great.If you see this in a sale, grab it with both hands! If its full price, grab it quick and start having fun :-)			"

												the quality of this game took me by surprise. I caught wind of it on a Youtube Channel list of overlooked games and thought I'd give it a try and boy was it great. Especially considering the fact that it's an Early Access game, which as of late has been really hard to find a diamond in the rough such as this.  It's a really enjoyable and quickly engaging ARPG that can  be played either as a multiplayer or singleplayer game with no detriment either way - it's totally fun whichever your preference!It's rather hard to describe this game fully but when I play this game I feel the same way as I did when Diablo 2 first came out. It's the gameplay of that series mixed in with a little bit of fallout in a pseudo post-apocalyptic steampunk medieval setting.  It's the perfect game for fans of top-down hack-and-slash RPGs in a DnD-esque world!colour me impressedoverall rating: 10/10			"

								A refreshing take on the action RPG genre, Grim Dawn doesn't dissapoint. Even though its still in early access, the mechanics are in place and the game runs smoothly and without bugs. If you are a fan of the action RPG genre (Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight etc.) you SHOULD pick this game up. It is more fleshed out than all of the other games and is a complete package.GD has more complexity than diablo 3 in terms of item crafting, classes, game mechanics etc. The story in GD is narrated mostly through text boxes but is easier to follow and is more interesting than the story in Torchlight 2 and PoE. I haven't seen the end game yet but there is already so much to do in the game that for just $12.50 on sale, its a steal.			"

								Just like Diablo 3 I feel like GD went through a period where i thought it was a waste of money and was frustrated with how the game looked and played.  I can safely say that that isnt the case anymore.  Much like most other Diablo clones on the market these days drops are plentiful and with the added bonus of these....renamed gems dropping off of nearly every enemy.You have actual choices in questlines to do what you want and makes the experience that much more enjoyable.   The monster types have a ton of variety and melee feels like your attacks are connecting with every single hit, which is a big plus for me. The skill tree is alright with you gaining a subclass to pick from at around 10.  A lot of the skill tree is just passives for other skills with you just choosing 2 or 3 abilities even though you have a hotbar like in WoW instead of the dated 4 slots max in Diablo.If you are looking for a singleplayer game that stays true to Diablos grim and bleak atmosphere and isnt that bad of a game so by all means pick it up.  7.5/10			"

												One sentence description: A tedious grindfest in an loot-filled, but otherwise empty world with awesome character development system.The first hour or two is fun, smacking up massive amount of enemies in a dark fantasy world that faced a disaster. Combat works perfectly, tight and smooth. Like in Titan Quest you can choose two out of six classes that make up your character. Any combination is available. It's a really interesting system, it just takes long to really get started since you don't get many skill points per level to manage two classes. You mainly focus on two or three skills for the first 30 levels.Like it's ""predecessor"" Titan Quest, the levels are mainly open plains filled with enemies, or dungeons, again filled with enemies. Now that we've gotten modern take on the ARPG genre in the form of The incredible adventures of Van Helsing for example, that hosted different locations, levels on this game feel boring and uninteresting most of the time. I'm about halfway of the game at the time of writing, and i don't want to spend another hour going through every bandit camp on yet another open plain just to find myself at another dungeon that looks like the one i just cleared an hour ago.  Even the interesting skill system don't compensate for that repetitive slaughter. It's a shame, since i'd really like to build my char, play with the class-system and experiment, but the idea that i shuold waste dozens of hours to grind them to the levels where i'm having a good amount of skill points to test the skills is a no-no.The Crucible DLC is fun, it's fast paced, just pure fighting, looting and fighting again on an arena. But you need a good char to make it far in there. So, either you grind exp there little by little, or you'll just suck it up and run though all the plains and dungeons in the main game, killing everyone. I can see it's mad fun when i finally reach the higher levels with awesome gear. Shuold you buy it? Depends. If you have time to kill, and i mean really a lot of time to kill. You don't mind about repetition, doing the same thing at the same looking place time after time, then this is the ARPG for you.  It's not a bad game, it just takes a long time to get anywhere, it's slow and uninteresting.			"

												Diablo 2 was amazing. Diablo 3 was great in it's very own special way. Grim Dawn is what hardcore Diablo 2 fans wanted. I hate to draw the obvious comparisons, but it's inevitable. However, Grim Dawn is... deeper and more difficult, but much more rewarding. Building your character, skills, items and modifications... you're really rewarded for putting a lot of thought into your builds. The lore is very interesting if you read and pay attention, but the game is still fun without it. Less fun in my opinion, but still a very playable game. The map system is done in a way to make you explore. There is no simple waypoint for your objectives. You'll probably have to bring up your quest journal to figure out where to go. Even still, objectives may be outside of the location specified in the journal. I chalk this up to ""realism.""Being able to play exactly the way you want to play is definitely a feature in Grim Dawn. Do you want to be a brute and smash your way through everything? Do it. Do you want to be a mage casting spells, buffs, de-buffs, and more? Go for it. Dual wielding? Shaman? Conjuring beasts? Do you want to combine some of these different skill sets? The possibilities feel endless. Environments are distinct, as are enemies, factions, and even missions. This is a grind and loot game, but it's done very well. TL/DRPROS: Graphics, SFX and music, character builds, variety, lore, gameplay mechanics, mission variety, loot system... it hits all of the notes. CONS: Some of the voice acting is not... spot on. With the amount of love obviously put into this game, it's easy to look over.			"

												I am a big fan of Action RPGs.I played Diablo 3 since it release, Path of Exile since its release on steam some years ago, Titan Quest back then when it was only available on Disc and then again with the release of the Anniversary Edition.With path of exile I had technical Problems with my computer, so no POE for me anymore, Diablo 3 was due to its unsatisfying gameplay and never ending game idea (just bigger numers, up to Level 500, 800, more and more and millions of damage...thats no real satisfying motivation to play for me). And then the anniversary edition of Titan Quest was released. And this convinced me to by Grim Dawn. Why?Because it took me again to Action RPGs. And it remembered me of Grim Dawn.Because some of Titan Quests old developers are now working on Grim Dawn. And you can feel it. Grim dawn feels like a much better and enhanced version of Titan Quest and I mean that positive.You can choose up to two classes and combine them. Soldier with magical skills? Assassin with Pets? Everything possible. Obviously there are some combinations stronger to others. In order to personalise you build even more there is the so called ""Devotion System"". You will find shrines in the game and with restoring them you get points you can spend in a seperate skill tree and get different boni on resistances, damage, health and new special moves, which you can level also.Additionally there is a rafting system, which gives you actually nice items, relicts to enhance your equipment and potions which have a short lasting effect.Also there is a faction system, giving you new items and blueprints from your allies and stronger and more enemies when killing a certain amount of them. This keeps you motivated to play for quite some time and offers you new options.It`s worth mentioning, that the gameplay is not as fast as in Diablo 3, feels more like Path of Exile. But in my opinion something good, since its event satisfying to kill smaller enemies because you have a better feeling of the damage you deal. Subjective which system you like more.The Story is also...OK I think. You have some choices, which to some degree chages your gameplay experience. For example you have the coince to kill one npc or not. Depending on your choice you gain some reputation with one faction and lose the option to gain some with another one or you will lose some reputation at one faction, but gain one whole new faction. With every Playthrough on the different playthroughs (normal, Epic, Ultimate) you can decide, if you want to make a different decision and reset reputations or continue the way you played before. Pro: + Graphics+ lots of secrets to be found, game rewards exploration (there are some secret questlines and hidden objects)+ dark world and artstyle fits the world, nice detailes+ Incredible satisfying combat, you can actually FEEL the hits you deliver+ different ways to combine the equipment and skills and the so called devotion system+ you are motivated all the time, enemies level with you to a certain point and the game usually is chalenging (in a good way)+ depending on how much you are interested in the game it offers different ways of complexety, you don`t have to farm everything, but you can if you want+ a little nice thing is, that you can have the map open and run at the same time. Incredible helpful and is for example not possible in Diablo 3+ not so fast in the Insane Damage Numbers of Diablo 3 (and still feels like more)+ you can upgrade you base city and safe people...Cons:- ...But it doesn´t really matter, only to enhance your reputation to get better equipment. Doesn`t make that big difference- sometimes you have no chance and you life Bar goes down in a second, no chance. But not as bad as in Diablo 3, where its quite regular, that you cant move and  have no options. Because in Grim Dawn there are some skills beeing activated when your health is below a 30% or something like that and restore your health to safe you.I can recommend the game to all fans of Path of Exile and Titan Quest. I bought the game in a sale, for 15 - 20 Euros the game is totally worth it and if you like the previous mentioned games, you will like this one also. Grim Dawn has lots of different content. You want to safe people? Repair a base, even if its very simple, you want to level, enhance you skills, craft new equipment, farm stuff, kill lots of different and very callenging enemies or think about the best builds? The game has everything. Costs far less then Diablo 3 and has so much more love inside...			"

The game camera can zoom and rotate. Crate has used this to hide chests and secrets in corners you wont see without rotating the camera.The loot is pretty nice and a lot of it drops.All in all, If you like Diablo, Titan Quest, PoE, or Torchlight, give this game a try.
