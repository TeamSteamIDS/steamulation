												As of the 1.6 patch this game has swapped to, and begun the path down, pay to win. In the patch players had their stats nerfed, movement speed, HKM charge, durability, and those stats were put back in... as 1 hour consumables you can buy.All vehicle and glider purchases, outside of packs, have been changed to be rentals for up to 30 days. Besides the tutorial bike you have to wait for ""special events"" for offers that get you faster perm vehicles or chances at perm gliders.Crafting has been disabled until patch 1.8. Endgame zones we had before have also been disabled till that time.The classes have recieved massive revamps, almost all of them are a shadow of their former selves and if you are a returning player then you probably lost a ton of your progress in the migration.The game is in a very buggy state, they had been working on this patch for 9 months prior, however due to the chinese parent company The9 pushing the patch before it was ready and layoffs hitting Red5 the entire combat system they worked on over those months was scrapped and reworked 1 month before Friday's release of the patch.The old professional voice over work is gone, replaced with temp voices that were put in to cover until they could pay the VAs to do the recordings of the new script, and rerecord the old lines that were changed.The real kicker is that this was Red5's last try. If this patch did not massively succeed then the game was going to be shut down in North America and Europe. With its last remnants moved over to China.It had the opposite effect. The community is enraged. 9 months of feedback, bug reports, and warning not to push the patch through were ignored. The buggy migration code was pushed out before it was ready under orders from the parent company.Currently China is not set to recieve the patch. They are using the entire North American and European player base as bug testers before the patch and the migration code goes over to China.I was first wave Closed Beta. I got to take part in the opening moments of this game when Mark Kern was at the helm. I was there at PAX Prime the days it was first announced. I got to help crash the game, I got to see PvP, PvE, Thumping, when they were all first implemented.This game is not worth your money. I once would have recommended this game. I once got a bunch of my friends playing.What the game needed was to do as Mark Kern envisioned: push the melding wall back to reclaim the earth. To unlock more content to explore and play in as a community effort. We needed new frames to be released. Not for a massive revamp that removes frames and crippled the rest.			"

												Update: After the 1.6 update is had been made 100% clear that this game will not last very long at all. I have a feeling it will go under sooner or later so I really wouldn't waste my time on it.FireFall once allowed you to explore the land and play wherever you want. You had a nice and simple class system where you could pick up a class and start playing it without issues. You could play instances with a brand new class and no one would complain or even notice you were a low level.That world has gone. The new FireFall (The release 1 year ago) feutures a leveling system. Which forces you to play in set locations until you have gained enough experience points to move on to the next level. Even after playing your faviroute class all the way to level 40 you will be greated for many players typing LFG or LFM into chat. As they're looking for items in instances which are only available at level 40.You can no longer play any class you'd like. You have to stick in each level zone until you outlevel it. (If you get a class to level 20 but suddenly want to play a different class you have to go back tot he starting zone and play there instead)You can't really play with friends as if you are 5 or more levels above them one of you is going to have a hard time getting experience points and therefore will end up leaving the lower level behind.I have been playing FireFall for 2 years but this is where I get off the fanbus and say farewell to all my friends I have met in this virtual world.I've spent over 150 pounds on this game hoping it would someday become the shining beacon that it had promised to be. Unfortunately this beacon is yellow coloured and I don't like yellow beacons if I'm honest. If you're looking for a game with repetetive gameplay, an empty and boring storyline with a horribly boring operator talking to you every 5 seconds then this is the game for you! The AI is flawed in so many ways. The 'alien' race is weak and easily killed where as the common bandit will destroy you in a few bullets.The whole 'horizontal progression' system of firefall went out of the window and now has been replaced with 'vertical progression'We no longer travel the horizon, we take the elevator.EDIT: I'm glad so many people agree with me. Maybe this will encourage the developers to re-use or go back to some of the older assets :)			"

												I Started playing this game waaaaaay back when beta first started. So ignore low play hours on steam. This game has gone through some rough times, and 2 major and complete overhauls since they first invited people to beta. They started pretty weak... then turned it into something amazing, but far from complete. Then a bunch of whiny babies complained about it and thus left us with another Sub par major overhaul of the core game mechanics. This game used to be all about exploring where ever you wanted. Thumping where ever you wanted, grinding where ever you wanted. An actuall sandbox about resource collection, crafting your own gear out of what you collect and true exploration.Now, it's just another ""grind missions here, then move on to the next map, grind missions here, then move on. They limited you sooo much from what their 2nd core systems had. Now you have to follow their paths, do what they want you to do. Not to mention you have to grind for yer gear. Stupid RNG system with Loot rolls, really original guys... While it is a unique game, they ruined what it could have been instead of taking a risk and sticking to the amazing game systems they had.

												It takes a lot of talent to ruin a fun game as much as these devs are. I have never seen a company so focused on destroying their own game. The whole thing has only gone downhill in a way I thought impossible.Playing this makes me wish it was illegal to release games as betas.Last big update made me lose 80% of my gear and abilities with pretty much ZERO compensation for them, and the comepsation that I did get is worth maybe a day of playing.The bugs, oh god they're everywhere. They are growing in numbers and nobody can stop them.Oh, I'm not talking about the enemies there. We are still dealing with bugs that came up during the early builds of the game, and they just keep getting worse with no attempt to fix them.""Pretty much everything not loading in properly? How about we change an unrelated thing that nobody asked for.""The devs are like children trying to ""help"" their parents with something. They are so focused on adding stuff they think is cool without any care of what will come out of it.I have never before had a game leave such a bad taste in my mouth.			"

												A litte about me:  I've been playing this game on and off since closed beta..  Most of my time here is pre-steam and I've dumped a ton of money into this game (commander founder pack, vehicle packs, Beans, etc) -  I'm a long time gamer and usually pretty understanding when it comes to wipes, redesigns, and rebalances.  I've seen this game though its many changes/stages and been pretty understanding and optimistic through all of its versions.I could drone on and on at this point about the faults I find in this game, how I've lost faith in the developers I once respected, and how the game just isn't fufilling for me as a vet to play anymore... I'll spare you from that. --What it boils down to--As it stands now I feel the game has lost its soul and at its very core is just not fun to play regularly anymore.  They've disabled a lot of features (like crafting), killed ""thumping"", and just plain sucked the life out of end game.  They've done a lot of rebalancing and redesiging up until this point (which was fine) but this just feels different and as a whole un-nessessary.-- In my opinion --You'll do best to save your dedication, time, and well earned money for a game more deserving of your attention.  This game is a sinking ship.... ...The  violins are playing, and it's time to head for the life boats.			"

												When I first started playing, back in early 2012, my first impression was overwhemingly positive. Although the progression system was quite close to the current one (level based gear with module slots), the game showed enormous promise to become its own ""thing"". It started with 0.5, where the new tech tree involved a much more horizontal progression, which was less about inflating numbers and more broadifying your combat options. It also brought in a constraint system (fixed at the time), which forced you to make decisions about the gear you could equip. It sounds like a bad thing on paper, but it actually made you *think* about your character. You could decide exactly how to build it, how to specialize it. Your character was truly one you'd call your own.Another milestone passed, and the tech tree was refined in a deep, complex crafting system while the character progression focused on constraints (which became upgradeable through gained experience and collected resources). As your constraints improved, you could equip stronger, better gear (bringing some vertical progression) while making sure you could never equip all of the top quality ones at the same time.It was an ideal diagonal progression system, one that I sincerely hoped would stay for good.As for the world, well... we were promised an open, sandbox-ish world that would evolve and change through the players' actions, and for a time we had something quite close. Coral Forest used to be quite a dangerous place where watchtowers and other key points could fall to the Chosen any time if left undefended. Places like Sunken Harbor and Thump Dump could even be submerged by the Melding, and that had consequences, albeit temporary. Still, we really had the feeling that the region was the last bastion of humanity surrounded by an implacable force from another world.And most importantly, anyone could contribute to an event (ares missions, thumpers, melding tornados and so on...) and be equally rewarded regardless of his own progression.Everyone mattered.Everywhere mattered.Every*thing* mattered.So, what happened?Well, progression is now back to being level-based with slottable gear and no constraints. The consequence is you don't need to care about your character, you just pile up level after, equip that white Gun'O'Pwn because it's better than your old purple Gun'O'Whack you picked up 5 levels ago, you see numbers inflate exponentially and it doesn't mean crap because your enemies' health increased by the same factor, you follow the same jobs over and over since they're all variant of kill/fetch/escort (Yep, there are escort missions. The kind that makes you ragequit 99% of the time).The crafting system has been simplified to the point of being dumbed down, yet at the same time required several times more material grinding than before, especially when some components can only be gotten through the goodwill of the RNG.Said RNG also govern the result of your craft, so you are not even sure if the result is what you want.The old open world has been segregated into level-based areas, so players too high or too low for an ares mission, job or whatever would be penalized in the rewards gained (that's right, if you are a lowbie and want to try something challenging, you are screwed).Virtually all of the 'chosen war' aspect have been taken out of coral forest. No invasions, no incursions, a few strike teams every once in a while... the ""last bastion of humanity"" became a dull, unchanging place.With the release patch, the game changed from an innovative, off-the-beaten-track MMOFPS into essentially WoW with guns. It had a lot of promise, but instead went the generic, unimaginative way.I regularly played this game for two years and enjoyed the hell out of it. I just don't any more the way it is now.For people who never played the beta, you might enjoy it. You just wouldn't realize how good it could have been.			"

												I just realised I didn't reccomend this game. And I don't know why! (TL;DR VERSION BELOW)Firefall is unique MMO. Why? Because:1. It's really free - you can even gain pets without paying a single dollar. Just chance for pet is pretty low, but you have 100% for advanced frame YOU want after gaining max level.2. It's one of VERY rare MMOs, where there are guns, just like in good old shooters, not some auto-attack + abilities. Of course, there are abilities, don't worry, but there's even a class which has... Guns instead of abilities. Yep, 5 weapons instead of them. But ok, onto review here.BASICSGameplayGame is set in First Person or Third person perspective - you can change it in any moment. You play game as a mix of typical MMO (like WoW) and shooter (like CoD, but I'd say it's not very similar). There are 5 main character classes which you can change it every moment, you don't need to make new character. Of course every class has it's own level to level. Every frame (they're called like this in game) has it's two advanced versions, which are modifications of main one (with exception of Dreadnaught - he has 3 advances).CombatFirefall is shooter + abilities - Left Click to shoot your weapon, right click to use special ability of weapon and press 1-4 buttons to activate abilities. You can also use items from 5-8 buttons, like grenades, medkits etc. Also, there is meele under G, but I don't see many players use it. I'm a fan of it, though. Your primary weapon (each class has it's own locked to them, advanced frames can use their weapons + main frame shooty) has limited ammo, while your secondary one has unlimited. I won't say too much about them, I don't wanna waste space.Missions and worldThere are 8 main missions (more coming with new update. MANY more) which you can do in normal mode or hardcore mode, solo or in group of 5 players. You can take smaller missions from Job Board, but they're a bit boring. But hey! But what if I don't wanna do missions? No problem. Firefall is fully-open world.  You can get anywhere you want, as long as it's not a big melding curtain. Because it most probably will kill you. You can do missions, you can go to randomly-generated events (plenty of them, you won't see many during 1-9 levels, but it will change) or you can just explore world - game even gives you achievements for finding hidden locations. However, game becomes grinding your way after some time, which is sad. You can avoid it, but leveling up this way will take very much time. There are 5 locations - Coral Forest (1-24lvl), Sertao (25-36), Devil's Tusk (37-40), Amazon (40) and Broken Peninsula (Desert where nobody lives. Sad)CraftingThere is crafting in game, but I won't call it VERY interesting, rather simple and easy-to-go. You place a thumper, a device which mines stuff, you collect things from killed NPCs and then you refine it. You salvage things for research points and crystite (currency), and then you research things like new weapons, modules, medpacks using research points and CY. After you researched a thing, you craft it with more CY and iron/tungusten/whatever/refinedthingsfromenemies. Voila, you've got your gun/module/ability or medpack.Leveling upHow to level up? Well, you can't level up by messing around city. Do missions, if you have LOTS of free time. Do random events, if you want to or you don't have too much free time. Level up with other guys, there are big numbers of these. I'd love to say PLENTY, but this game is so unpopular. I hope it'll change soon. Maybe thanks to my reviev ;)But what after leveling up to 40? You can still mess around last location. You can go to Amazon, VERY hard location and try to fight with Chosen (enemies) for forest domination (yep, AI isn't best, but they'll try to capture your bases while you try to do same to them). You can go for raids or hardcore missions for better loot.STUFFClassesThere are 5 main classes: Dreadnaught, someone who takes tank role, Assault, guy all-about damage and mobility, Biotech, healer (bad at it, tbh. Dragonfly rulez), Recon, NOT a sniper, I'd rather call him light infantry, and Engineer, a painful class to play. Sets up sentries and supply stations. You'll probably choose him as your first class. That's normal, I did same. They're just too weak at higher levels, and without support... Powerful at watchtower retake.Each class has two (or three) advanced frames. After paying some money or gaining level 40 you can choose one. Each advanced frame has his own set of abilities and weapon, but they can use main frame stuff. They look like this:Dreadnaught - Rhino (DPS) - Mammoth (Tank) - Arsenal (Screw abilities when I can have gunz)Assault - Tigerclaw (Specialist of PWNing single targets) - Firecat (AoE)Biotech - Dragonfly (Healer) - Recluse (Damage + poison, healing only with BIO skills)Engineer - Bastion (Right course for engi) - Electron (Powerful support, but nobody plays as him)Recon - Raptor (Sniper with charging rifle) - Nighthawk (Sniper with bolt-action rifle)Random stuffCurrencyThere are some ""money"" things. We see here: Crystite (CY) - collected from almost everything. Used to almost everything. Credits (CR) - Collected from final box in small numbers (you gain them after some playing). You can also sacrifice CY for more CR, in exchange rate of 25:1. Used to buy things from market, self-revive or buy RB. Red Beans (RB) - premium currency. Used to buy things from shop, make your inventory bigger. It's possible to buy them, of course, but also you can request exchange of your CR for RBs. You place how many CR you want for 1 RB, and then number of RB you want. If somebody finds your offer lucrative, he'll trade it. I did it many times, safe.Character customization - You can change the way your character looks in any moment. You can change his head, skin color, hair style, hair color, even sex, why not? We haven't got a shortage of battleframes. Also, you can pay for additional customs - like helmets - or just drop them during gameplay. You have many options to customize your character, but it's not TES, expect rather a bit better-than-WoW customisablity.Graphics - Good. Very good from a distance. Beaches of Copa, forests of Redwood or Kearney's Transit Hub, desert of Sertao, lava pools of Devil's Tusk and Amaze Amazon of Amazon. From closure, it's still good, but not that good.Community - GREAT. THESE GUYS ARE AWESOME. Seriously, in my whole career here I saw only two guys being rude or spamming. New players ask questions, they don't get shouted, they get answers. There are multiple clans, I reccomend being a part of one - not hard to enlist. I'm in [WaR] and I received a warpaint from them, thanks :DTL;DR versionGame is worth any money. Best part? It doesn't need any. It's free in 100%, even pets. Has 16 classes. No auto-attack crap, you have your trusty weapons and 4 skills. Good graphics. Amazing community. Found a friend which most probably got banned... Woops.In short:Gameplay: 9/10 Good idea as for MMO, guns, abilities, open world, but too much grinding end-game.Graphics: 7/10 Good from distance, but not very good from close-up. Also, some people may not like a bit anime theme here, I'm not sad because of it though.Audio: 0/10 Aero's accent is annyoying. (Joke) But in real, soundtrack of this game is awesome. Sounds are bit higher than decent, and are often buggy. So I give 7/10Overall: 8.5/10 - Dang it, it's a free game, if I have to add this little detail it would be 9.5/10. If you like shooting games, GOTTA TRY IT!Uhh... Rating is appreciated? Thanks. Was typing it for 30 minutes.Missed something you wanna know about? Write in comment and I'll add it to reviev! "

												What can I say that would ease the pain? That it was great while it lasted? Those are the words that should be said for an awesome game that's closing its doors for the final time; celebrations of the life of a community and good game that ran for well over a decade. I had a few of these experiences. Phantasy Star Online for example was one of these, (the first one mind you. There's still Private Servers, but no point since PSO2 exists). I played a few other little MMOs here and there in my youth. In 2012, I found this awesome game called FireFall, and fell completely in love with it. It had the makings for an awesome story, awesome gameplay/gunplay, it was an MMO and an FPS combined... and something like this was new to me. Hell, it was one of the firsts... by which I mean if I point my gun at something and pull the trigger, it dies. No tab-targeting to be seen.I was a founding Commander too even. Watched the game grow during the early days of beta. You could go anywhere in the world, you could shoot whatever moved... there was actual things to do. Pretty sandbox-y for those early days. I remember spending a couple good years with this one group... well, several groups actually, although with this one community army, I could never really get into it offically... so I just operated as an outside agent. It was the game that got me to buy my first graphics card since I wasn't really big on the PC market back then... so I can thank Firefall for that. The other group, we had a teamspeak and good times. Sure it was a little rough... but I'm generally pretty chill. Good times were had, before that got broke up; this of course being after everyone else had quit... the game became stagnant due to a MAJOR flaw; the developers at Red5 Studios were rebuilding the game from the ground-up, so that left us with little-to-no updates outside of hotfixes. They'd started this whole entire promotional bit with a bus (which is sitting in a warehouse somewhere now), prizes to be given out for their Founder Packs (which were available for a good year or so), and no actual NEW content. No new guns or gun designs, no new Battleframes; nothing.Then comes a new update that kills PvP off (which was fine for me since I didn't play it anyway), which was pretty lackluster to begin with... adds some new zones to teleport to which didn't let you go very far. They rebuilt crafting, and progression to a near-unplayable level. For example.... you could have this really nice Tier 3 Plasma Cannon (Assault), but then you can't get anything else.. abilities, armor, servos... nothing. Or you could kit out your plating and become a little bit better than paper mache (READ: tinfoil), but then you couldn't kit out anything else because of constraints. Math went in and between a few people collabing together, they figured out it'd take 13.5 years to max out.... one Battleframe. ONE. Not all 15... just one.Well, come later on and after enough hell-raising, instead of fixing the stupidly-high progression requirement ceiling (they reduced it a little bit but not by much), they spend more time with their Twitch streams and social garbage such as Red 5 TV... and rebuild the game yet a second time. More waiting... more time spent... and still as friends left, I stuck with it. I stuck by them... and little did we know that Red 5 was pretty turbulent internally; all the senior staff had been fired off at this point, The9 which was the people funding Red 5 at this point had a complete strangle-hold on them at this point, and returns were being requested. They booted out Mark Kern... one of the main CEOs of Red 5 (READ: the guy who FOUNDED Red 5 in the FIRST place!!), and hired another guy to lead development for a little while. Progress got quicker, and then Open Beta hits... after 2½ years it finally hits and people are estatic. They added a new Battleframe which was pretty cool... until I figured out how bad it was. It was called ""Arsenal"" which was this hulking Frankenstein-esque junk frame thrown together from various other frame abilities and parts, made fat as an insult, and carried a pretty poor LMG with did crap-all to anything you shot at.. and its abilities were poor imitations of other weapons which didn't even last but a few seconds, a butchered Engineer ""Salvo Proxy"" called some sort of new lame ability and made its ultimate. That's right... ultimates replaced the fourth ability... which had turned this game's skill system into that of a damn MOBA's abilities (three boring abilities, one half-decent ability)... which seemed great at first for the other abilities, until they changed those too! They kept throwing nerfs about, making the enemies stupid-hard, and making us stupid-weak. No skill anymore, just the feeling of being curb-stomped into the ground over and over.Another half-year in Open Beta, and finally comes the 1.0 release... but not before yet ANOTHER rebuild of the game. Now we're reduced to levels (in which the only frame I ever was able to play; Accord Assault) insta-leveled to the cap of 40 due to all the XP it had obtained, and a semi-linear storyline. There's still open-world stuff to do, and everything. And surprisingly... my best friend decided to come back! And a new generation of people joined us in the new community I was a part of (READ: Still am, still proud. PG forever, I tell you what), and together... we completely dominated the game. The fun was back, with stuff to do and new places to visit... although those older places (Area Y; Jungle, Area Z; Antarctica) were still on hold..........Unfortunately... good times have to end I suppose. Eventually, things got pretty bleak after more members of Red 5 got let go. The9 was increasing its grip on the company from what the community could see; what with Reddit being that thing that seems to bring out the best and worst in people (though I don't use it myself; I can read, however), Various AMAs from disgruntled employees who were struggling at this point to survive (For example, Tony Reyas whom I had spoken to personally a few times while he still worked there... good guy that one.), and talks of yet ANOTHER rebuild of the game (We had gone through three-four at this point? I lost count years ago)....And so now we arrive at what I could only describe as the Chrono Trigger-variant of post-Apocalypse 2300 as far as this company goes, (if you want, you can listen to that piece of the soundtrack... it's called ""2300 A.D.""). The last Firefall Live was quite some time ago, last year in 2015 if I recall... they don't even use their studio for it anymore (which looked pretty ""repo'd"" to me). Most of the CEOs are gone now. There might be someone there but I have only loosely followed the game and the resources of the company at this point... as I've moved on. I was a mentor for the longest; still am... had life issues to take care of course, but there... there's just no point anymore in worrying about it. At this point, the forums are dead and broken (see the following screenshot[puu.sh]), the community is completely divided and broken, the devs don't bother speaking to us anymore except for FadedPez (AKA: Frank Lettieri... I salute you, you poor soul) who is already attempting to hold everything together with what appears to be some lint, some cloth string, and scotch tape.............(More in the comments)			"

												I can't believe I'm making this review, Firefall, the one and only MMO that stood out from all the others. Stood, because Firefall as it was is gone. And as the original CEO of the company (Mark Kern) said ''It's just a WoW clone with guns now''. It's not what he wanted at all, ever. Mark Kern was ejected from development. And it's precisely at this point that firefall went downhill. In the state it is now, do not even bother playing it. It's 100% like any average boring MMO.My brother, my father and myself have all loved firefall for what it was during the beta. My brother started during early alpha, supporting the game for what it was SUPPOSED TO BECOME by buying the founder pack, along with some accessories like the firefall beanie. Both my father and me started around the early-mid beta. THIS was when the game was at it's best.Mark Kern now would appreciate if the players would stop supporting The9 and Red5, and let this game die so that he may revive it again. And in the possible case that the devs would refuse to let Mark buy the game back, he is planning to make Ember, a game that would be like firefall during mid beta, the game everyone loved and the game that stood out from all others.Anyways, I deeply thank you for reading this review and I wish firefall to rest in peace if Mark isn't able to revive it.EDIT : Ember forums are up! link to it : http://forums.emberthegame.com/ "

												Some of us played this game for years, before steam release for quite some time. It took some of us months or even a year to get the best gear, weapons and abilities. But now Red5 decided to take away most of our gear and make all of it useless. All of that time playing the game, for nothing now.They also don't seem to care a lot about feedback. Really a disaster right now.EDIT: The game is dead. Devs are gone and pretty much everything is broken. Don't even try.EDIT2: Still dead.			"

												Never before in my 15 years of playing online games have I seen a game so utterly ruined by its developers. Short of shutting down the servers there isnt much more that can be done to make this game any less playable.Firefall used to be a very nice game that really only lacked in having a larger community, I would have rated it 4.5/5. After patch 1.6 where pretty much every system in the game was ruined/removed and everyone's characters lost everything (not to mention the removal of over a third of the classes) I would rate it a 1/5. New people can no longer switch between classes and they removed the crafting system entirely. What makes all of this worse is the fact that the only motive red5 seems to have for doing this is the huge leap towards monetization of pretty much the entire game (you need money to get good gear, a crafting system would circumvent that).TLDR: Was good, now entirely crap.

												The end.My last review for this game:This game, was once amazing, better than any other free-to-play games. Long years ago, when this game was in closed beta, it had everything. A lot of players,living community, amazing and unique gameplay, exciting balanced pvp, hardcore pve...loved to waste my time in there.Time has passed, and with every update ,they scarred the game.Every update made it worse each time, and made a lot of players quit.It is really shame, what happened to this game-it had potential.I will always keep the best memories and experience from this awesome game, unfortunately even the bad ones, like the fact, that this game is DEAD. May it rest in peace.(Game in original stages, its closed beta had a solid 9/10 gameplay. And now? It is...dead.)			"

												Two years ago this game was marvelous, a large and vibrant open world with interesting missions and an awesome community. That community has been stabbed in the back, entire sections of the game have ceased to work (The first mission after the tutorial for instance), veterans of the game have lost almost if not all of their high levelled battleframes/rigs. With players being unable to partake in the 'story' missions the playerbase has hit rock bottom. Until a later date then the devs and The9 can pull their collective thumbs out of their collective asses there is no point playing this once great game unless you want to witness the death of an MMO			"

												EDIT: As of today a new update is in action. Said update removed 6 classes, 3 entire zones/maps, over 15 abilities, passive perks, slowed combat down to a crawl, removed crafting replacing it with 1000% more grindy korean styled tinkering, removed all the alternative fires from weapons save for 1, gave all the weapons insane spread and recoil and allowed you to spend money buy combat boosts. Yay.Don't waste your time with this. Go play warframe instead, much more reliable, fun and optimized experience.Firefall devs are hellbent on killing their game. Ever heard of a game that kicks the bucket? Well we're talking about developers ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the bucket.In summary the problems with this game are:*No endgame content, whatever exists of endgame is a bunch of repetitive dailies that lead to a dissapointing bullet sponge boss. But hey, I can tolerate that because free mobility, jetpacks and gliders.Mobility got nerfed to ♥♥♥♥. *Horrendous balance. 1/3 the classes in the game are broken overpowered, 1/3 are broken underpowered the remaining 1/3 is just broken.As of this update, 3 classes are viable to use everywhere and only 2 are actually fun to use and everyone who likes the other 7 gets to suck a ♥♥♥♥.*Reverending grind (seriously warframe has less grind than this). It takes multiple HOURS to farm a single max tier item. Now, you might think ""It's end tier, it SHOULD take a long time."" and that's good and all, but here's the problem, you got 16 classes, each class has a unique primary and 4 abilities + a core.The primary and the abilities need 3 modules each. Do the math and try to figure out how much time it takes to max a single frame.Did I forgot to mention if you want an ace custom (that is, personalized with special bonuses/stats that fit your playstyle) you need to craft an additional custom prefix for each your abilities and weapons? All that plus 5 secondaries shared among frames.But hey, I can tolerate that because free mobility, jetpacks and gliders.Crafting has now been replaced by tinkering.What does this eseentially mean? Well you can no longer craft your weapons and modules and you need to find them in random drops or crates you open with keys brought from the store. (Yes because that worked out so well for tf2, dota, csgo, payday, spiral knights and god knows whatever else, the difference is that in those games crates contain cosmetics, not upgraded weapons that you will need to use)In order to upgrade said weapons and modules to make them upto raid stadard you need to spend thousands upon thousands of credits and salvage hundreds upon hundreds of weapons all paired with an RNG to have a crit tinker (that gives big bonuses) or a noncrit tinker (that gives smaller bonuses) (that you can pay premium currency in the store to get tinker tools to give you a higher crit chance) and said proccess has to be repeated for all weapons, abilities and modules 9 times. (Assuming every single tinker is a crit, if its not, you're gonn have to redo untill it is, because noncrit tinkers are worthless.)Tinkers are essentially stat improvements that increase various stats of your weapons.*Lack of combat variety. Combat is composed mainly of braindead mobs moving slowly and shooting at you as you shoot them back. But hey, combat is still fun because free mobility, jetpacks and gliders.Combat now has even less variety since all alternative fires, a massive chunk of abilities and all signature perks got axed.Yay.*The worst imaginable raid system to ever exist in the history of ever. You can only do each of the 3 raids once per week with 20 people, and out of those 20 people only 4 get 1 item that's not even guartenteed to be epic (epic meaning that you won't need to replace it down the line with something better). If you got nothing, wait untill next week do the raid again and pray that you get something this team. What this means is that you can raid every week for a straight year and get nothing. But hey, I tolerate that because jetpacks, gliders and free mobility.The raid system is now EVEN worse.You got only 1 raid, that you do once a week, BUT there is a cap on the ammount of reward tokens for it you can hold to a number of 8.So, you got 2 insanely limiting factors at once at play.So, that essentially means that you can only farm for 3 items out of 10 frames at a time, and you can't stockpile for when updates come.*Really bad optimization.  Not much to say here. It's reeeaaaaally reaally bad folks. But it's ok. I can cope with all that because the movement system is extremely fun, you can fly forever, jump around freely perform airplane tricks while still in combat, never touch the ground and still be helpful to your team and generally mobility in this game is really fun and really invigorating.Yeah, this doesen't exist anymore either. All frames took a massive movement hit as well as gliding. Infinite flight or really fast movement aren't possibly anymore.So why is this review negative? There is no reason to keep this in anymore, the game has lost most of its redeeming qualities.2 important notes.1.)Every 2 months a COMPLETE overhaul happens every 3 updates that completely change everything into what is basically a new game. So far we've had like 4-5 complete overhauls.2.)Usually, said overhaul is the for the worst. For example, in an older version of firefall you had pretty much completely unlimited and free airplane flight with minimal investment which meant everyone could enjoy it and everyone could have fun without sacrificing other parts of their build.There were no levels and all proggresion was horrisontal.In the same update you could also craft 101% ace custom weapon with you being able to tailor every single stat of a weapon however you wanted to select what fit you best.That got axed in favor of more grounded combat and the neverending grind of a crafting system I mentioned above that allowed nearly no customization.If the devs don't trust their own game why should I?Ultimately, I think the game is worth trying out just for the experience because it has jetpacks  and flying bikes. As of today, the flying bike that needed 1 straight month of grinding has been nerfed to ♥♥♥♥ so the developers can resell it to us for real money which they are.Last but not least, remember those pay2win boosts I mentioned above?Well, if you pay red beans, the premium currency gotten with real money or with trading, you can pay for hourly boosters that reduce the damage you take, how fast your ultimate charges, how fast you move and how far you can fly. (More jet energy, that also affects how much you can heal someone if you're playing dragonfly because your heal gun uses jet energy as ammo)In the end, I can't really recommend this game in its current state.But hey, in 6 months another complete overhaul will happen since the lead designer got canned just like the 3 ones before him, I'll see you then.

												I do recommend this game, but only because it's free to play, if you had to pay for it, I don't think it would be worth it.This game is fun for a while, then it gets a little repetitive, then it gets REALLY repetitive.In this game you're a battleframe pilot.  In the beginning you can use the basic versions of 5 unique battle frames, they each level independently and though you only have to do the main story missions once, you can replay them all you like.  Each basic battleframe has 2 or 3 unlockable advanced versions, these are unlocked either via cash shop, the player-run market with ingame currency, or using pilot tokens from leveling another frame to level 40 (max level).  The problem is that there isn't a very large variety of things to do, even at the start, there are about 4 different types of random events around the map, there are a few (not nearly enough) area missions you pick up at the bulletin boards in town, or main missions.  After you outlevel the area you're in, you move onto the next one.  There'll be some different monsters/people to kill, but essentially it's all the same.  The even worse problem is that you have to do this for any battleframe you use... There's no different story, no different events or missions, or quests... So essentially you'll do the same thing (which in the beginning is exciting but it only lasts at most a matter of weeks.) over and over again for as many battleframes you want/have.Having friends in the game to play with only prolongs it so far.

												Updated 21st of Augst 2014: New patch, new changes. They've ramped the dynamic content up a lot. For all those complaints about being 'forced' to do Jobs to exp, Red5 responded. You can now go from 1-40 doing nothing but randomly spawned missions if you wanted to. These include things like Chosen drop pods, bandit ambushes, lockbox assaults and similar. They added the mobility to Assault many were asking for, and did a tuning pass on a lot of other frames to fix a lot of problems people were having. All in all the devs have been really responsive to the actual issues. Of course you'll now see people on the forums complaining that the game is too hard now! All these enemies! We wanted a war not challenge!All in all they've been doing an excellent job of polishing up what needs polish and adding in new events and trying to work up new live events for the players.Updated the 9th of August 2014: I just wanted to update this a bit to say that the devs have remained constantly talkative in game, interacting with the community and answering questions and the like. I've gotten a chance to play with quite a few of the crew from Red5 and they are all pretty passionate people. The forums for this game are turning into a pretty toxic mess, but in game I've seen nothing but positive changes as Red5 continues to try to iterate and get the game more polished. The first few weeks were pretty rough but I've got to meet a lot of cool new players who seem to honestly enjoy the game. Red5 seems to have a direction they want to go and seem to be following it much better then the kind of random experiments they were doing before. After yesterdays Firefall Live I have more faith in their ability to take feedback and data and move the game forward.Just, you know, avoid the forums. It's pretty much the bottom half of the internet. If youtube and news articles have taught me anything its that you never read the bottom half of the internet.I've been playing Firefall since near the beginning. I want to make something clear for anyone who reads the negative reviews: They are horribly nostalgic. The 'constraints' system boiled down to 90% of the population using the same build (Max cooldown and jump jets) so they could fly around in circles and spam abilities without a modicum of skill. Regen was high and it was easy to make yourself literally invincible. The game was incredibly easy and no one wants to admit this because that'd ruin their rosey naval gazing.On to the game we have now: It's bigger. The world is really well made and has a lot of interesting locations. The different frames all feel different enough to be noticeable. You can hit level cap in a week or less if you just pay a bit of attention to how you gain exp. Crafting currently is too overtuned in that the prices are sky high, but that'll probably get toned down. (Dev's have said they wanted to start high and go down because almost no one whines about having to spend less to build things.)All in all its a really solid shooter with heavy RPG elements. There are really fun raids at endgame and the instanced dungeons that tell that main story are generally really fun. You can solo all of them (Well not the raid. At least not that I know of.) but they definitely shine with a group.Also the assault class plays like a Tribes spinfusor soldier. Huzzah to that.			"

												....where did it all go wrong?...First of all, to any of you veterans who remember me as Herostar, the mammoth who could, and the guy who made his nighthawk so fast he could keep up with the lower power LGVs, Thank you for everything you've done. And to HERD, the army I was in so long ago, I won't forget the things you've done either.Firefall was one of the best games I had ever played a few years ago. It was fun, it was open, it felt like an adventure that I could play and control. The random encounters were exciting and rewarding, and the amount of times I led the charge to defend Orbital com's tower might even match my hours on record...Unfortunately, it tanked. It's most recent ""rebuild"" of the game just.... Damn.First of all, the first release of it was so bug ridden, so mutated, so broken, that they had to temporarily disable reaching the level cap, and your Map went from useful to Annoying due to the amount of buged waypoints it showed up. It was comparable to even famous games in how broken it was, and the difference was, This is an MMO.They've patched out few bugs since then, readded the level cap (but didn't relevel frames you had. my mammoth still needs to be remaxed) and the gear was so durastically changed, I went from able to fair my own in amazon to not even capable of running missions alone. And they removed some of the best missions, and deleted or changed the lore. This game was one of my favorites. Was. now it's nothing but fond memories and burnt hopes.Red 5, where did everything go wrong? why would you do this?...The world may never know.			"

												Let me just say this.Firefall used to be great.It really hurts me to say that, and even writing this review is hard for me, but I need to say it, Firefall used to be a game where you could go anywhere and do what you wanted to progress, to fight who and what you were in the mood for and be able to explore to your heart's content.Fighting off bandits at a road ambush.Facing wave after wave of wildlife as you protected a mining drill that was gathering resources for you.Teaming up with tons of players to fend off an attack on a town that could actually end up with LOSING that town until a reclaim mission was made to fight to take it back and push back the corruptive melding that had washed over it.It was all amazing.With enough skill even your basic starter setups could do difficult missions and most of your progression was give and take when it came to gear, so you couldn't just be ""the best"".but then over time something happened, they started moving away from these kinds of freeroaming, levelless system and more towards what every other MMO was doing, every update seemed to push a little more of that charming unique factor out.now there was levels and you had to stay in your level-designated zones or else you'd either get overwhelmed or have too little reward to be worthwhile.now there was boring post-apocalypse deserts and drab dead landscapes of volcanoes, the game lost that beauty that the original area (now the place for starting players), that feel that made you WANT to explore the world and see the sights.but then it got worse.another update.this one removing more of that uniqueness, trying to cash in on other mmos of the type, trying to find audience with crowds that it didn't quite fit while pushing the older crowds away, removing features, altering the fundamentals of weapons, even outright removing a class option.but worst of all in my opinion.it removed the ability for new players to have the freedom to change classes between the 5 core classes whenever, they were locked to a single battleframe class until they hit level cap on that class and unlocked another class or variant.it was terrible.it was the point I stopped reccomending the game at all.and now, it looks like it's dead, or at least close to it.so it pains me to say it.but I just cannot reccomend Firefall to anyone anymore.it's just no longer the game that I loved, and it probably never will be.

												Ages ago, I would have given this game a glowing recommendation. An MMO that's free to download, no monthly fee, and can get any purchasable content through your own hard work and dedication, rather than cash. It was the answer to all of my problems with MMO's in general.The game was incredibly fun. All of the playable frames/classes (except Accord Engineer) were all fun to play. There was tons of different things to do. There was an active community, which was an absolute pleasure to converse with most of the time. It was good enough for me to log over 2,000 hours in it.However, the development team decided to take the game in a completely different direction in order to appeal to a new Chinese audience. Open world PVP had all of the benefits taken away well in advance of these changes, in favor of an arena PVP that wouldn't see the light of day until nearly half a year later. All of the balanced Accord frames became unusable after level 20 to support a new progression system, and the Arsenal advanced Dreadnought frame was removed from the game. What remained was a group of frames that were ultimately not fun to play after the large amount of changes to each.Currently, Red5 is not staffed. There is nobody working on the game. The plethora of bugs present in the game will not be fixed. There will most likely be no new content added to this game, save for the unlikely event that another development team is assigned to continue the game. The forums aren't even being moderated.After a lot of promise, the game is finally inching its way towards death. We just need to let it die.			"

												Firefall is a Open world 1st/3rd person shooter similar to tribes. There is resource harvesting and dynamic world events that let you feel like you're in some kind of living world.  If you like playing team games, resource harvesting, basic crafting and killing aliens and bugs then you should like this game.It's okay for a free to play game, there is time gated content that requires you to level up your stating classes to unlock advanced ones. There is visual styles like paint patterns and color schemes that you do have to pay for. You can pay to unlock advanced frames but you can’t pay to level up the equipment you use.You can however pay for XP modifiers so you can level up faster, there are random daily incentives that lure you into staying logged in for up to about an hour and to do so daily.Crafting is time gated with the ability to pay to speed up crafting.The cash shop has social items as well that don’t do anything other than in game fireworks and junk similar to making pets appear.You shouldn't waste money in this game, the developers change features and flip/flop on designs when ever they feel like it.Why is this not recommended? 3.0 2/22/2016+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Well looks like the engineer got another nerf, thanks.Oh yeah crafting has been disabled until the next update.... Let that sink in: game features are disabled post release, pending major game changes...post release...Guess this is the NGE i was waiting for...Why is this not recommended? 2.0 2/5/2016+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Summary: Game released Jul 29, 2014, 1.5 years later they decide to change major game mechanics with several classes and flat out delete one class. The game continues to decline into an accessible crap pit. Like some one running up to your bike and sticking training wheels on.Since they change almost all of my rigs and i lost of bunch of stuff they gave me a bunch of XP tokens i used to level up most of my rigs. SWG CU all over again, im just waiting to get screwed by the NGE.Need more? read below Why is this not recommended? 1.0 12/21/2015+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++From beta, all the way up to what was released, the developers decided to either throw away or parcel up systems and abilities into something that could be monetized since the game was intended to be a f2p game. Complex systems rewarding crafting systems were simplified so that more players would join.Resources are a prime example of something completely thrown away., Originally resources had quality levels. Anyone that played Star Wars Galaxies would have immediately seen the inspiration of the system from that game. You could ultimately affect your crafted equipment by the quality of the resources and the quality of those components you made from them.There is this fog that kills you called ""the melding"" that you use to be able to push back, they got rid of this mechanic and just left the areas open for everyone.. ie no work they also removed alot of the npcs from the area that you would have fought and leveled up to push it back. You didn’t have or need all of these frames, all of the specialized equipment that only the advanced frames have were originally usable by the base frames. You could mix and match parts to suit your play style.Ultimately what you have today is H-O-R-S-E when originally they had basketball. It’s not a bad game, but it was a better game that was ruined for money.They decided basketball was too risky and people might not want to play.			"

												I've only HEARD the horror stories of 1.6... And they have me deterred from even FINISHING my install for the main client itself.So, let's go over a history lesson of what the game had right and wrong from start to finish.So, in the beginning when I start playing the open beta back in August of 2014, the game kicked ♥♥♥. There was so much variety it made my head spin! You could literally keep finding things to do... Thumping, fending off angry Chosen, ARES missions, Chosen Strikes, defending Sunken Harbor and Thump Dump....That ALLLL ended when the game launched on Steam. The variety of things to do mysteriously vanished, along with the sense of direction the game initially had, quelling all chances of growth slowly as time went on. The first features to be removed of course, were the chosen activities. Next on the list came resource variety, taking away literally EVERY resource, ALL 18 of them, and replacing them with Iron, Tungsten, Titanium and Uranium. The bio- and mech- resources already in the game got more additions, increasing the rediculous ♥♥♥♥ING level of farming and grinding required to even step ONE foot forward in the damned game.Move on to 1.3, things have gotten even worse with the removal of the Battleframes' variety and reducing the progression style to your basic-♥♥♥ level up system, going even FURTHER BACK from the Constraint system. In addition to this, the unwanted and un-needed focus of story was put into the game, getting in the way of the gameplay itself and literally ♥♥♥♥ING with the pace nine ways from a Jesus' Chicken Sunday..........................................BUT AT LEAST AT THE TIME THE ♥♥♥♥ING DEAF-AND-HALF-A-RETARD DEVELOPERS HAD A SUSTAINED IQ HIGH ENOUGH NOT TO DOUSE THEIR OWN GAME IN GASOLINE AND THEN CARPET BOMB IT WITH CRASHING ZEPPELINS FILLED WITH FOUR CUBIC ♥♥♥♥TONS OF HELIUM, PURE OXYGEN, CONTAINERS OF PURE SODIUM, AND NITROCGLICERIN AND LIQUID ♥♥♥♥ING NAPALM IN SEPERATE CONTAINERS, ALSO ALL IN CUBIC ♥♥♥♥TONS MULTIPLE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING TIMES UNTIL THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT A HORRIBLE DISFIGURED, SMOKING CARCAS SOMEHOW STILL ALIVE BEGGING TO BE SHOT IN THE HEAD FOR IT TO BE OVER WITH.THIS... Is what 1.6 has done, according to what I've learned. And I DARE NOT get on for the sake of my own sanity. The introduction of lockboxes, Spiral Knights-and-a-half level grinding and farming, and temporary stat boosts have milked what remains of this victimized game for what little left it's worth.In addition to that, literally EVERY MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING BATTLEFRAME IN THE GAME HAS BEEN NERFED UNTIL IT IS A GOD DAMN FOSSIL DEEP ENOUGH IN THE CRUST TO HAVE SUPPOSEDLY BELONGED FROM THE ♥♥♥♥ING JURASSIC PERIOD OF DINOSAURS. AND OH MY MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING *GOD*, DON'T GET ME STARTED WITH THE INSANE, SADISTIC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T THAT IS REMOVING THE ALTERNATIVE FIRING MODES FROM LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE PRIMARY WEAPON THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE EQUIPPED IN THE GAME.AND IF *THAT* ♥♥♥♥ ISN'T ENOUGH TO SCARE YOUR STUBBORN ♥♥♥ AWAY, THE ♥♥♥♥ING WALL-OF-CHINA LEVEL OF BUGS WELL DEFINITELY TRY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HORRIBLE AUDIO RECORDINGS REPLACING WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY IN THERE ALONG WITH EVERYTHING YOU OWN POSSIBLY BEING DELETED OR RENDERED INTO A RENTAL.This game suffers from something I call Destiny-itis. WHY Destiny-itis? IT'S THE ONLY ♥♥♥♥ING EXAMPLE ACCURATE ENOUGH TO DEPICT A GREAT ♥♥♥♥ING GAME BEING EXPECTED AND SHOWING ITSELF TO BE SO POORLY DONE IT DOESN'T EVEN QUALIFY AS A 16TH OF SOMEONE'S LEFT FAT ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥ CHEEK.That being said.... There's literally nothing you can find you'll enjoy here more than you'll enjoy in most other games. HAVING finished my angry, relative rant to this review, I've learned a while ago, to hope for the best and expect the worst. In THAT respect, Firefall hasn't disappointed, but with the target goal of building back its playerbase, it's long since passed the point of no return with Red5 Studios being purchased by a Chinese business company. If you care for your wallet, money, sanity, time, ♥♥♥♥s, ♥♥♥♥♥, happiness and fun,... You won't EVER wish this game on ♥♥♥♥ing ANYONE. NOT YOU, NOT YOUR ENEMIES, NOT YOUR ABUSIVE STEP FATHER. NOT ♥♥♥♥ING *ANYONE*.			"

												[Disclaimer: I downloaded the game just to write this review. I played it for 3 years, many many hundreds of hours I suffered it's buggy grind. No more. I just wish to prevent you from repeating my mistake.][Disclaimer#2: This review is LONG. TL;DR version is at the bottom of the review]I am Megakoresh and this is my story in the game that set out to break the rules and ended up breaking only hearts:In Novermber 2011 I have joined the beta for ""Firefall"" that was having all the right ideas for ""fixing"" the MMO genre, fixing all the things I hated it for. It also was coming up with a revolutionary method of development at a time - community-driven development was not nearly as widespread then.Game started with a PvP component and sheduled tests twice a week. People would organize, play, provide feedback, the next patch the feedback was directly implemented and fully documented a to what was changed and why. When PvE launched in April 2012, this continued, the game was slowly improving leading up to the major patch in August 2012, when the game opened the cash shop. That patch and the systems that came with it was the biggest and the last long-term imrovement to the game. 2 years ago. The signs that the game doesn't really know where it wants to be, of mismatch between features, of the lacking gameplay and shooter component, were subtle at first, but community, has picked up fast and warned the developers of the things they needed to work on. These larger warnings were ignored, but smaller suggestions were constantly being implemented, often without considering their ""compatibility"" with the game's design, but it pleased those who posted the suggestions and created this illusion that the ""community-driven"" development was still going on, even if by now it was in fact searching forums for issues and solutions that the developers already decided on, acting them out and then claiming it was ""requested by community"".As time went by the development focused more and more on economy, [mostly vertical] progression, adding various stats and senseless enemies upon a barebones stat-driven gameplay system which meant any additional content was suffering from diminishing returns as far as gameplay is concerned. Any extra ability didn't matter because of 30 second cooldown, which, like most things in Firefall, absolutely doesn't fit the fast-paced, spammy combat. Any extra enemies were just extra-buggy reskins of already buggy current enemies and so on, you get the idea.As time went by, the players, who signed up for a game that promised to be a true MMOShooter, started getting frustrated at the continued focus on the MMORPG grind, economy, progression treadmill and ignoring the gameplay, despite consntantly trying our best and spending a lot of effort on feedback, thinking that the developers still consider it with the game in mind, not their own personal biases.Wasted effort and continued degradation of the game are sure ingredients for conflict and as the feedback started to be intertwined with [rather reasonable and polite] calling out the devs for them ignoring the feedback on the topics of gameplay and variety, we all have realised who Red5 really were, as they began aggressively defending their philosophies without (unlike the community's complaints) any evidence to back it up. This followed into more negativity from the community, which in turn has followed into.... censorship. Yep, in a totally unexpected display of unprofessionalism, seeing that the threads and voices of the ""veterans"" and people who wanted the Firefall from 2011, were being heavily supported by the rest of community, Red5 went over and simply banned the people in question, including me, from the forums, where 99% of the feedback is discussed. Following that, as soon as people recognized my name on their devstream in the twitch chat, they immediately banned me from it as well.After that they proceeded to keep making the same mistakes they were making ever since August 2012. These spanned across EVERYTHING in the game: from balancing:Weapon X is hit-scan, fast firing, high damage per shot, designed for ""skillful marksmen""; too OP. Options: make it projectile, >>reduce fire rate to increase skill level<<, nerf damage. They did: nerf damage. ""Skilled marksmen"" my ♥♥♥.to resources:Our resource system is too complex, but not deep enough. Options: nerf amount of resources and levels, increased the imprortance of comboing resources for different results to give players more freedom; ADD OVER 9000 RESOURCES FOR MAXIMUM INVENTORY SPAM!!!. Guess what Red5 did. And then they added inventory limits a year later because servers couldnt handle it. Pfft...to enemies:Enemies are too easy for leveled players, need to make them harder. Options: add more abilities to current enemies, add telegraphs, high damage attacks, area-buffing, make each enemy a threat and scale spawn compositions OR BUFF ALL THE HP!!!!. Guess what Red5 did.In addition they highly encouraged fanboish behaviour; screaming and flaming on forums was not punished so long as it was in favour of the dev's point of view. One of the CMs tried his best to try and bring the old spirit back, to be objective and fair, but ultimately his efforts were in vain. Still, he was the only bright spot after Red5 showed their true colours, I hope he quits and finds a good studio to work in instead. When you were just defending some stupid mechanic like death penalty (which isn't supported by this game at all, and you will see why as soon as you start playing), without insulting anyone, the devs would often ""Like"" your post, which you can guess what effect it has on a fanboi. The devs eventually hid visbility of ""likers"", just displaying their quanitity instead.Eventually most of the older players got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at being ignored, censored, screamed at by fanbois, and left. Those that tried to circumvent the game's grind through exploits after months of begging the devs to reduce the grind, were wiped and left too. The game started dying and the devs started running out of money. So what did they do? Take a wild guess fellas. They started frantically implementing whatever 2 year old suggestions (that were screamed about to them over the course of the beta) they could implement in a short amount of time. But by this point it is much too late. The game was built upon a base design for a shooter with minor MMORPG elements, but the meat and most of the bones that were added in during the development are that of a traditional MMORPG grindfest.=================================================================As a result you have a game that is an extremely repetitive and boring ability shooter, with abilities having 30 second cooldowns, adding nothing whatsoever to the variety (they scale down to 5 seconds, which in some cases makes it extremely OP, but it will require you to pay hundreds of $$$ or grind for hundreds of hours and babysit research for months to get to that cooldown). It's jetpacks, freedom of movement and very lush colourful world coupled with excellent aesthetics and graphical fidelity will provide a high ""WOW factor"", until it blows off and you realise that the jetpacks are just tools for random bunnyhopping around, with that being the only reliable way to avoid damage. It's MMORPG elements are just as lacking, with a severe lack of content, buggy and grindy gameplay and enemies and the same boring ""dynamic"" quests, that have to be repeated thousands of times.A ton of money, tears, wasted effort and broken promises; this game is a testament to the ""Never believe in 'ideas'"" rule of modern gaming industry. The community is nice though. One of the best out there, so at least that is not a lie. If you are going to play this game, it would be nice if you tried and keep that tradition. It is the only good thing about the game aside from it's looks.			"

												This game when I started playing it back in late July 2014 IT Was Awesome just what I wanted but after months of playing it. It changed, The devs took the fun from it and replaced it with nerfs and upgraded NPC damage to the point of making the game frustrating and just a grind. Now all my friends from other games that I got into Firefall have just stopped playing and some friends I met ingame Firefall just drop by now and then but most of them haven't been on for months.This is the classic mistake game that devs make, they put out a great game and then second guess it to chit, while nerfing it as they are saying they will be putting out new stuff soon. All the while players see only false promises and upgraded NPC damage that they have to use gimped toons against.Red 5 pretends to listen to players but only if it suits thier purpose as to what they want to do .!.

												Good Free game and surely, not Pay-to-Win. You can actually enjoy leveling your character in-game, with or without the help of others. But the community is very helpful if you know how to ask.Great soundtrack, cool sound effects, beautiful graphics (if you got a decent PC setup).The action might get linear after getting your first 40-level Battleframe, but after that it get more easy to enjoy all that happens around you.Like the game description says: ""... constantly changing world, deep narrative, endless customization, and rewarding player progression, Firefall will consistently deliver spectacular content that will please both PvE and PvP players"", i guarantee it to be true.

												As many posters have illustrated before, this game has taken a turn for the worse since true release. I played back in beta where the focus was on the idea of thumping (obtaining resources) and teamplay, with open world events being common such as having areas taken over and such. There was MASSIVE potential for tech tree progression, the crafting system, and development of the storyline.And that's where it all went wrong. Nowadays, the focus is mostly on grinding up to certain levels and then instancing to fight the same things over and over and over again. The storyline is bland and has made perhaps 5% progress since closed beta, and the balancing is horrendous. Each time they make a change to a component such as crafting, something becomes ""overpowered"" or easier for the community. They then proceed to nerf this, which leads to another area becoming popular. Nerfs upon nerfs upon nerfs. No real content changes, failing to understand that their new crafting is fundamentally flawed to begin with.Combat wise they made the game too much of a mix. A focus on teamplay oriented mining, or solo adventure? How about we try to do both and fail miserably simultaneously? They are just all over the place. I could rant on and on about this game, but there is honestly just too much. TLDR: This game had potential and now it's a grindfest. Enjoy for maybe 10 hours if you REALLY want to try a new class, or pay an insane amount of money for very little. Your choice.			"

												It's a fun game for the first couple of hours that you play it, while you're getting accustomed to the world of the game. Then some of the harsh realities start to hit you. The game starts you off by allowing you to choose one of several basic classes, like Assault, Dreadnaught, Recon, etc, and upon reaching level 40 (max level) with any of these classes, you are given 10 pilot points to unlock an advanced version of the class. Herein lies one of the game's irritating problems. The grind becomes very, very annoying. It's just continual back and forth between Job Boards, with a few world events thrown in like crashed LGVs or thumpers. It would be fine if it was fun, but once you do it a couple of times, the missions get extremely repetitive and tedious.  One of the annoying ways the Job Board missions can make life hell for you is by forcing you to travel long distances back and forth, and if you don't have an LGV (a type of vehicle) or your glider is on cooldown, it becomes very tedious. Yes, I understand the developers need to make money somehow, and this is clearly a way to make people consider buying an LGV, and that's fine, I just don't like it and I'm warning others. Unlocking advanced frames is extremely, extremely grindy for a new player that hasn't been in the beta for a long time and already has everything unlocked. Say you pick Recon as your starter class, and you want to unlock one of its advanced classes, the Nighthawk. Unless you straight up buy it with Red Beans (the premium currency), or from the Community Market with credits (another premium currency, you convert between the regular currency crystite <> credits, and credits <> Red Beans; it's not easy to obtain the large amounts of credits needed by exchanging crystite), you're going to have to first go through the grind of leveling up your Recon to maximum level, and then once you've unlocked your Nighthawk, you're going to have to start the leveling process all over from the beginning to level that up. If you want to unlock any other class, now you have to level up the Nighthawk to level 40, etc. etc. Simply put, it's extremely, extremely grindy.If that wasn't all bad enough, that's just grinding with classes. The grind you have to go through regarding crafting is another pain. I will say playing some of the classes themselves are fun, but the process of getting to play any of them properly is nowhere near fun.EDIT: In fairness to the game, I will say that they have done a nice job designing the actual world itself. The graphics look very nice most of the time (unless you get close to any rocks in the game, my god those are ugly). Using gliders and the LGVs feels nice, it's just the process of getting there that's a huge pain. The game's soundtrack was also very nice to listen to.			"

												Been playing since they first invited players for Alpha stage...As the top review goes.Thats pretty much it.They have changed it to the crappy generic MMO crap instead of its own idea due to players being grumpy, spoiled brats.PvP Content removed since then.I'm sure its coming back. it was removed due to a reason at first but then brought back then removed again for the same reason.PvE was pretty much was about exploration, this game had everything revolving around exploration and freedom.You had to do everything yourself. Like, everything! And it was amazing.Then everything changed when the generic MMO players attacked....			"

I had hope, but now it is lost. #MakeFirefallGreatAgainRecently, the ex-CEO of Red5 made a petition to see what the interest would be for a new Firefall, one that us gamers deserve. A Firefall on Unreal Engine 4 with no pay-to-win features, no Chinese investors taking over the game's production. A proper, good, and FUN Firefall. His idea is called Ember and this is the petition link: https://www.change.org/p/crixa-labs-make-ember-a-spiritual-successor-to-firefall?recruiter=562901777 "

												I played it, I had fun, sunk hours into it day after day. got good at it too. my friend and I just wanted to relive the days from a year agowe read the reviews...we read them all...we wanted it to not be true...it can't be true......We log in and find that my biotech is gone, that the level system ""changed"" and all i have left is my recluse; my friend lost his enginer since he did not level to a new frame, he lost it all. we are given each a new frame to ""replace"" the one lost, both only level 20 we get ingame and are greeted with a bunch of mail from Red5 giving us ""armor crates"" and ""module crates"". confused we open them and get some weapons that fit our levels with some cosmetics / skins on them. i head into the inventory to find i now need to equip armour looking things, thankfully given to me by one of the crates. I notice all my resources gonei notice all my modules gone save for the few i just got from a cratei see my abilities goneStripped of all I worked for, I sit defeated. my weaons are ♥♥♥♥ now, my frame is ♥♥♥♥ now. Im ♥♥♥♥ in battle. All Im left with a few hundred thousand usless currency to make up what I lost apparently.So here I am, me and my friend. Rich but screwed over. This was a horrible change over a year. barely anything carried over and we are left with nothing to do except run around, shoot sh*t, level up, and die.TL:DR: Friend and I lost everything we worked for and the game was watered down leaving nothing to do.

												2016 March Update: The most fun about this game for me was how the Dreadnaught, especially the Mammoth played out with some of it's special abilities. One that stood out was the Tremors ability which for one had one of the best animations and it helped you when your mate is overrun and is down. With recent patch the Tremors and Teleportation Shot (another ability I enjoyed as it also was a helping hand in the same situation) were removed and replaced with abilities that are only useful for other situations which we already had the rest of the abilities for.The direction this game is going is not really bright and I no longer have any interest in this game, it was fun and cool with friends, but not anymore.Overall: 4/10Orginal Review from 2014 July:""FireFall have delivered many great things since it was first released (closed alpha) and I can only say the game can be insanely fun, unlike other MMOs FireFall feels a little different, it's a game that you can hardly compare to other MMOs, which is good.Here are some of the positive things that make FireFall outstanding.- Random Events. (Randomness is the main reason this game feels different and it is the feature that makes it insanely fun to play)- Graphics. (It is not realistic, it stays closer to Borederlands style than reality, which gives the whole game a better feel, more smoother and relaxing feel)- Design. (The World is very nicely designed, with places that won't make you wish to never go back to, instead, it is something you don't mind to visit thousands of times)- Enemies. (The enemies in this game reminds me to Borderlands, every single enemy looks awesome and well designed. While some are cute and fun to squash, others are cool and badass ""I'm looking at you Terrorclaw!"")- Chosen attacks/wars (Invasion aint here yet. The game is capable of showing from tens to hundreds of enemies at once, making these Chosen attacks/wars an experience you don't get in any other MMO, fighting against an army of enemies is more fun than anything I've ever experienced in MMOs, it's like you are in a LoTR battle)- Battleframes (frames are your armors and each class has a different armor. These armors are for 1. look awesome and for 2. are paintable, they are not completely customizable, but you can still put on a different jetpack or a reactor on your back)- NOT PAY 2 WIN (Yes, it is extremely rare to see a F2P game that is not P2W in any form. FireFall is completely free, there is in game curreny ""red beans"", but everything you can buy with them can be acquired in game for free)Now, here are all the negative things that bothers me.- Playing Alone. (FireFall was intended for Coop, like any other MMO and solo players will suffer the same thing with this. The game is fun for solo too, but if you play nonstop, then it will become repetitive after a week or so)These are bad changes that only early beta/founders feel as negative, it won't change the gameplay for new players.- Nerfing. (These devs like to nerf classes and when they nerf, they give hell, so it is hard to love 1 class for a very long time, if it gets a nerf the next month, cuz the best thing about it is getting too common)- Lack of Random Events. (Random Events are in it and are awesome, however, back in early beta, there were Random Events at every 100m, giving the player unlimited fun, but then they reduced the number of random events and now you only see a couple in a big area)- Nerfed Chosen Army. (Back in early beta, when there was an attack of chosens, the fight took well over 30min, everytime the chosens attacked, it felt like you are fighting the battle of the century, the legendary epic super awesome battle for humanity, those Chosens were FEARED by players, but then they got nerfed, yes that hell nerf, and now chosen attacks can be done in 5-10min, chosens' power were also nerfed, they are now just another enemy, not feared, not hated, forgotten...)- No Chosen Controlled Areas. (As I said before, back in the days, it was really hard to win a fight against the Chosen army and the game system is that the chosens can take over bases and watchtowers. Everytime I logged in I saw at least 3 bases/watchtowers taken over by chosens and I always went there and tried to take over the base/watchtower with like 20-25 other players, it was like an Epic LoTR battle, but after the devs nerfed the Chosens, everything went down, I havent seen a single base or watchtower taken over by Chosens ever since the nerf...)All the negative changes are something that is bad for founders and early beta players, but for new players, those are things that won't bother much... so those things won't affect your gameplay, if you havent experienced them in the early beta/alpha.I still have a damn good time in FireFall and this game got more potential than most of the MMOs out there. If you have read this and feel that you should not play it, even tho I praised the game like it was a diamond in the MMORPG genre, then still, definitely give it a try, you will like it and you might love it.Finally, I know I pointed out many negatives, but the positives were all something that can only improve gameplay and the negatives are something that can be brought back into the game anytime.9.5/10""			"

Original review (Improved and expanded review below)This game was so good in closed and open beta, my account is 4,5 years old created December 14, 2011 03:57, I figured I'd give the game a try again but wtf, it's just a empty shell, lackluster and just plain boring, I regret spending so much money on this game during closed beta and the beginning of open beta when it was still fun.I would suggest anyone to stay away from the game and instead play something like warframe, I don't play that anymore either, but I still do find myself coming back to that every now and then and don't feel so dissapointed when I do everytime.Please don't waste your time on this, the developers totally ruined this game.Edit:Just for the record, I've spend 200 euros on this game:Founder's Pack: Commander  Timestamp1/23/13 4:30am$100 USD ARES Starter Pack 7/11/13 1:56pm$100 USD That goes to show how great the game was, I was willing to spend that much money it was so much fun, but now it makes me sad that I have to tell people to stay away from the game, that it has become that bad compared to what it was.Edit2:Improved and expanded reviewI'll summarize the pro's and cons a bit and explain down further where necessary for anyone that hasn't played and wants a more indicative review for what to expect:Pros:+Very adjustable graphics+Great concept *1+Good balancing+Dynamic Environments+Generic enemy actually has background and lore+UI feels good, no clutter or anythingCons:-Community is spread out, same thing like in GW2, everybody is at the max lvl zones-Dynamic events get repetitive, you'll ignore them after some time-Game doesn't feel rewarding, you are grinding but you don't know for what *2-Game does very little to keep you playing, you will not feel engaged-Game has been washed out from the original concept, everything is very... lackluster *3-Not so well optimized, people still have issues on high-end machines*1 The concept of the game was great, the thing is, in closed and open beta you really felt the pressure of the enemy, you could see whole parts of the world fully under control of the Chosen, even the starter region was always under attack, I purely logged in everyday to check if we could save the day, it was so much fun liberating the entire map and then keeping it under control.You had Chosen squads patrolling in huge numbers and if you didn't stop them they'd take over control of areas, the game was remorseless it was hard on newbies because they wanted to apply the idea of everywhere is the metagame.It worked for a while, everyone could play with everyone and you could see who had been playing longer but it didn't matter cause they played together with the new people it was enticing, now it's just the same ""This area is for lvl 1-10, that one for 11-20"" etc and people don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about others anymore, it's basically what happend to WoW, before the burning crusade there was a real community, after that it became a mindless grind and everybody became a zombie with only their self-improvement in mind.*2In the beginning I the game was very rewarding, you could either grind the credits or xp and you'd get the items you want from the market that were crafted or buy a new suit, you were either saving up materials to craft parts yourself or one of the above and you would always set goals for yourself, if not then you'd play just for fun, because it was actually fun! Suprise huh?!Sometimes I'd just forgo progression to help random people thump dirt because we enjoyed defending thumpers in difficult areas or because they just needed xp and I happend to have the founder permanent bonus xp for parties applied to my account so I'd help them with their grind.*3Like I said in the previous comments, everything is washed out, the game lost it's focus on the original concept and just went for the mainstream to save it and like the others say, the company just doesn't care as much anymore about the player's opinions and thoughts as it used to, they REALLY tried to involve and informed us of everything in the beginning, that was part of why it was so great.So besides it getting washed out into just another generic mmofps the company behind it as well lost it's will to make it into something great, which is sadly sorely projected onto their game.Additional notes:I'd like to point out this video it's from June 2014:

It goes to shows how many Chosen there were when they were taking outposts and this guy is decked out he can take them on but you can see has has to output massive dmg and he's still getting quite injured even when in turret mode, you just don't feel that powerful in the current state of the game, like the game doesn't give the you oppertunity and otherwise other people won't give a damn either.This is one of my own videos to display a bug cause I used to be active on the forums back then in October 2013:

Nearly all your equipment ether gets deleted or is worthless now. Also my main class, the arsenal gets completly deleted. The fanboys flamed me for hours why am I complaining, I get compensated for the losses. But sorry, that stuff is not even a quantum of what I loose now. Also I dont even have a class to play the game anymore ^^---I already wrote and deleted a review to this several times, so I wont give this game a long review anymore:- It is one of the most awesome Shooters with RPG elements and open world, I ever played.- it has a kinda interesting story- cool weapons and abilitys- cool classes- very well designed open world fights and dungeonsWhat makes this game so bad:- bugs- butchering of the crafting system- butchering of the ressource system- bugs- butchering of the leveling system- totally bad made events, that will make you hate the game- the almighty present of the item shop (you can play the game well without it, but it is just too strong)- the community- grafic optimiziation is simply not there- if your ping is just a little bit too high, welcome to hell- oh they also butchered their story as wellThey should go 2 years back and start again -.-			"

												This was ""the game"" to play during its prime. I loved it, honest to God. The graphics were lovely (quite a big fan of the low poly look), the game played nicely, the bosses you had to think about and strategise with your team. Then haul ♥♥♥ back as you were starting to get overrun at the end of the mission. I miss those days.You could fly around, change classes at will, use gliders, vehicles, mining ""thumpers""...And one of the head brass at Red5 killed it. Buried it. Congratulations you f*ck wit.

												The game is officially DEAD. It was awesome back in the day, but the company funding the devs didn't think that investing on new tools was good, so they made the devs work with 4 or 5 years old stuff to make the game work. And they did, for a bit, then they started to break things, they removed crafting, thumping, all the fun stuff was gone with the promise of making it better. Instead of doing it on a test server first they brought a broken version of the game to the live servers..and a couple of months later it officially died. I was dumb enough to pay 70 euros when they first launched, never again. It was open world, tons of missions, resource thumping, then defenending the thumpers while they farmed resources, random players walking by would join your thumper defense, sometimes the AI controlled enemies would attack a base, and if lost, that map zone would be locked, and to retake it you had to cooperate with other players, everything you needed from a shooter + rpg game was there. You had cars, bikes, you could use yuour jump jets to get on the highest mountain on the map and use your gliders to, glide, and see the entire map from the sky, it was fookin awesome, with those cartoonish graphics, but it was nice. It had tons of classes to choose from too, it's a shame that it died :(The bright side, a sucessor of Firefall is on the works, Ember. Fingers crossed!			"

												I've followed this game for years-- Ever since Engineers had a blowtorch instead of a grenade launcher.And lately, every patch has successively dumbed down the gameplay to the point that the game just isn't fun anymore.Try too hard to make your game appeal to the widest audience you can, and all you'll end up doing is falling into mediocrity. That is the literal definition of ""pandering to the lowest common denominator"".Don't try to please everyone-- You can't. Don't try to please the widest amount of people possible-- all you'll do is make something bland and uninspired.Don't try to copy a successful formula-- it's been done for so long that the industry itself is stagnating.This game had an incredible amount of potential. But the publishers threw the devs under the bus and crippled the game for the sake of making it more ""marketable"".This is a tragic loss.			"

												Please note I played way more than 30 hours, I played during the closed beta for about 400 or so hours before it arrived on steam.What can I say that hasn't been said before. The game was probably one of the best MMO's I played in recent years. Well before they changed so many things that never needed to be changed. Things that made this game stand out amongst the plethora and constant releases of MMO’s. This was mostly due to Mark Kern being booted from being CEO, this is when the game started going downhill, and when some of the best and unique parts of the game being stripped down and removed. If that name sounds familiar, he worked as a team lead on some of Blizzards most popular titles. His stance on the current state of the game, in an interview via MMOBomb Originally posted by Mark Kern Via MMOBomb: pretty much a standard MMO now, instead of the simulated massive war game that I had always wanted to make”.  So it’s pretty much now your current run of the mill MMO.     Some of the best missions got removed, same with the lore, crafting was removed (which now has made thumping pretty much useless), frames being heavily restricted...and among other things. This sucked for many of the veterans that supported the game by buying the founders packs to support of what many of us thought was an amazing game (like my friends and I did after playing a long while), only to get screwed over in the long run by the new development path of the devs/new CEO. But to make this short, the game, which showed so much potential and promise, is pretty much dead now with almost no signs of changing and reverting back to what the veterans loved about it, and what made it unique. It got so bad that they were not able to pay their devs due to them not having the funds.   Though hope still remains since Mark said that if the game sees the sunset, then he’ll try and buy it back and save it, or if that doesn’t work (if he isn’t able to re-buy it), then he’ll make Ember, Firefalls spiritual successor. So there's hope that we will still see some version of Firefall in the near future. If you want to play it, I say it's worth a look, but I wouldn't invest any money into it, since it does appear to be failing. http://www.mmobomb.com/features/mark-kern-firefall-different-early-id-re-purchase-became-available/ -  His quote on the current state . Also may be a reason why he was removed. (though they come from employees that were under his leadership)  http://www.mmobomb.com/news/mark-kern-launches-petition-ember-firefalls-spiritual-successor/ - Some extra info on his new game if he can’t get Firefall   *Edit - Guess Steam hates MMOBomb.  *Update/Edit #2 - That Ember thing I mentioned, it appears it now has a forum https://forums.emberthegame.com/   If the link doesn't work (or Steam removes it), then just type in ""Ember the game"" in Google. GLHF, and I hope to so you nomads on the new frontier!			"

												When I first heard about Firefall, it was right about the time it went to OBT. The first few hours of gameplay was confusing as hell, because there was no tutorial for crafting, resource gathering, no information about the story etc. Yet, I dug myself into the game. I wanted to learn it. I poured in it around 200~ hours in open beta. After I understood the mechanics, I was simply sucked in into this world.It was a sci-fi shooter, with a moderately deep, but quite hard-to-learn crafting/leveling/gathering system. The idea, that  - a player had the choice to thump (mine) 4x4 different kind of materials - which each had a quality system from 0 to 1000 - while you had the option to explore the whole map to get the highest quality for your gear - keeping low quality for the ""level-ups"", which was kinda like the talent-system in vanilla WoW - and depending on the quality and property of the material, freely modify what you are about to buildwas fascinating. It was hard. There were grindy parts, but the whole game felt like a big cooperation between palyers. Unfortunately the story was progressing very slowy, and the content was quite shallow, while the crafting system was a b*tchslap to all those players, who thought this will be an easy game. Half year before the game came out, I took a brake from it. Then it came out, I logged in, and my heart was broken...They simplified it to the extent, that even WoW is better now in 90% of its aspects. Unless you would like to shoot-'n'-grind a few hours, this game is not for you.Until they give back the OBT crafting/thumping/leveling system, this game is a no-go for me.			"

												This game will trick you into thinking it's good, while it actually is horrible. By that, I mean there are a lot of almost saving graces. The gameplay is fun, the way frames are made to do something wildly different than most other frames is well done. But that's about where the good parts end. I let my hope get the best of me, and continued playing this and progressed quite far, so I've seen everything the game has to offer at this point, as far as actual content. I have 3 frames yet to unlock, but I think they'll probably remain locked forever, because I'm uninstalling. Let me tell you just a few of the completely broken things in this game. 1) Bugs. This game is filled with bugs, left and right. At time of writing, I cannot login, because the login servers are down- DURING A 4 HOUR LONG EVENT. Which leaves innumerable players (including myself) unable to get the rewards from said event. I wish I hadn't logged out, because I'd at least earned credit for the event. But I figured that since my screen was frozen for up to two minutes at a time (Not a problem on my end; CPU, ram, gfx card all WELL within tolerances) I might restart my computer and see if that helped. Turns out, I can't login at all now. That's just one of countless bugs which plague this game from start to finish. 2) The game is a grindfest. You can't play ONE frame. I mean sure, you get to level 40 with your first frame, ""Yay now I can do the 3 endgame raids there are!"" Yeah but not well. The thing is that to get the right perks to make your frame actually decent, you need to level up other frames. Some as high as 40, some only to 10, 20, or 30. Regardless, if you want to maximize your play experience, prepare to spend hundreds of hours grinding. This grindfest brings me to....3) The crafting system. Which is even more of a joke. For one level 40 epic item, the time spent grinding the same thumper in the same zone is maddening. Not to mention the fact that it's not just one zone you'll have to do it in, it's usually two or sometimes all three zones, for different items. 1200 uranium bars, AKA 6000 uranium ore, when you've got a chance at around 100 uranium ore average from a 5 minute long thump. That's for ONE of the materials involved. Bone fragments are much harder to come by, but required in similar numbers. Oh but you can just buy it off the market instead, right?? Lol, sure, if you feel like....4) MORE GRINDING FOR FREAKING CREDITS. Yup, the main source of credits being injected into the economy, comes from farming crystite(Warfront will get you 15-25k per hour, or would before they nerfed the drop rates). You can convert 25k crystite into 1k credits every day, and you can easily farm 25k crystite in about 1-2 hours, per day, at level 40. But 40 epic abilities? 20-40k credits. 40 epic core? 50-80k credits. So if you wanted to get those credits from just farming crystite, it would be close to a year before you could buy what you wanted to. Luckily, there are other options for gaining credits, it doesn't have to take that long. You could.... grind another frame to 40 and sell the mods from getting level 40. Or you could... grind world mobs on a thumper in hopes of an epic drop that you can sell for the credits to buy an ability for your frame. Have I made the point clear about this game being one long grindfest from start to finish? 5) The content is mediocre at best. There's really a very limited variety in what works in the game. Yes, all the frames work quite differently. On a spectrum from ""LOL you're playing THAT frame? /kick"" to ""Nerf Raptors."" I wish I were kidding, but that's how it goes. This is partially mitigated by the fact that all players can play all frames. At 10k +- 3k credits each, or buying them for real money/red beans. But again, if you want to be able to solo thump, and do bane/kana, and do warfront, you're going to need at least 3 frames at 40, probably 4, and if you want them to be perked properly, you're looking at 8-10 frames at level 20-30 or higher, some more frames you won't use at 40, but you have to level just for a perk. 6) PVP is a joke. Broken Peninsula is just that. Broken. The frame imbalances are so severe that if you don't use one of the currently OP frames, you're going to die constantly. Raptor, Rhino, Recluse, maybe a nighthawk, otherwise, get ready to eat lead salad all day long. 7) Devs are very heavy with the nerfbat in areas that don't need it. Especially droprates, which they've nerfed time and again during my time playing. I'm just glad I farmed BWA while it was possible to get more than a single green. They went from a guaranteed two blue ""necro"" weapons, plus the chance at a green/blue mod or the warpaint, to ONE drop. It might be a green weapon. It might be the warpaint. But you get ONE. Did I mention they reduced the loot, at the same time they made the instance take about twice as long as before? Nerfiest Nerf I ever nerfed. It's not so much harder, as you're not allowed to skip mobs that you could skip before. Other times, they seem to forget the nerfbat exists, like raptors, which are currently the most overpowered frame for just about every situation. Or recluses, which simply gets better the more enemies you throw at it. At some point, the recluse turns immortal, simply because of the fact it is amazing AOE damage, and gets 10% of it's damage as heals. It is just... imbalanced isn't strong enough to describe the way that the frames work. I dedicated a lot more hours to this game than is reported by Steam, simply because I don't always launch the game through steam. I've played a LOT. And honestly. I wish this game was better. But for all the potential it has, I've seen it going downhill fast during the time I've played. I highly recommend not even installing this game. The gems it has are very visible, and it's easy to get hooked, and then gloss over the ""minor inconveniences."" But the inconveniences pile up, and when they add something new... be prepared for a crashfest. I personally showed a developer a bug in warfront, soon after it was released. It was one of at least 4 MAJOR and I mean game changing bugs. This particular bug was the difference between a 6 minute objective, and hitting the timer at 20 minutes and everyone dying, and having to wait the 2:30 to attempt the whole objective over again. Which I still don't consider as bad as the bug where the entire raid's game crashes. Both of which took WEEKS to fix (if they even are fixed, they weren't consistent bugs). I've been addicted to hope in this game for too long. The current staff responsible for the direction the game is heading, and the actual game itself, are incompetent. This game is going downhill fast, and I strongly recommend you stay away from it, unless you like reporting bugs constantly in a game which is *supposed to be* released. I can't stay addicted to hope. For all the good things in it, this game is just bad.			"

												As many others reviews are saying, do not even bother installing this game if you're new to it. As you create y our character  you will be doing sort of a tutorial to introduce you to the game. Then, as you reach lvl 10 there is a MUST DO quest that won't work no matter what you do. So you have like 15-20 mins gameplay available. Also there is no hope on getting it fixed as it seems that there is nobody working on the game. But of course they still selling 115,97€ and 79,99€ packs.......funny scammers.			"

												Firefall has a personality disorder. Its centerpiece is supposedly a world war between a besieged humanity and a superior alien civilization, but players spend most of the time roaming around engaging random clumps of indigenous bandits, mining for resources, and killing mutated fauna. There is a lack of sense about the relevancy or urgency of the war.Leveling mechanics, itemization, crafting, and questing systems are conventional and unremarkable. Narratives conveyed in missions are discontinuous, because the missions themselves are randomly sequenced. The encounter system is simplistic: most scenarios reduce to close-range engagements as enemies materialize into existence near you. Enemy AI is mediocre: No squad tactics, no flanking, no suppression, no cover. Combat is mostly reduced to jumping and backpedaling away from enemies. It becomes less about surviving enemies, and more about surviving the point-blank splash damage from your own weapons.Play it for the eye candy and esthetics, and for the easy adrenaline. Look elsewhere for more filling and better execution. Intelligently challenging PVE battles, cohesive narratives, and a world story that invites urgency elude Firefall at this time.			"

												tl;dr- If you haven't played this game before, do so right now-- while there's still a game left to play. But if you're a veteran like I am, playing this game again will just get you thinking about the ""Good ol' days"". At least it did for me.I really wanted to be able to give this game a positive review. I wanted it more than anything else in the world. It has so many good memories for me, and when I first played in the summer of 2013 near the end of the closed beta, I remember thinking that it the most fresh and innovative MMO that I had seen in a long time. (Granted, I'm sort of an antisocial person, so I tend to hate MMOs because I don't play too well with others.) But since I picked it back up a few weeks ago, I can only say that things have gotten worse since I last played, which was about a month after the Sertao patch first went live.Even then, I thought FireFall was going down a negative slope-- but back then I thought it was either just a fluke that would be fixed in the next few patches, or because I had simply burned myself out by playing it too much. But now it's become clear that Red5 has fallen so far that they can't recover. Especially after the buyout by the Chinese company ""The Nine"", (Which sounds like the name of a terrorist faction in a cyberpunk movie, by the way.) and when you take the time to consider that the members of Red5 that recieved the money basically immediately blew it all on hats. It kinda shows how little respect and care they had left for their own game near the end.As for the quality of gameplay, like I said before, it's been on a negative slope for a while, but I only just noticed how steep the slope was. The open world experience overall used to be much better. There wasn't a set level barrier between areas or even strict ""levels"" at all. The whole world was open to anyone at any power level, and you could proceed and explore at your own pace. If you ♥♥♥♥ed up and went somewhere too strong for you, that was your own mistake. Now the zones (Coral Forest, Sertao and Diamond Head) have fallen back into the classic MMO mistake of being segmented and cordoned off into areas with seperate level requirements. It really cockblocks the fun factor of exploring this game and forces you back into grinding in one spot until you're strong enough to move on rather than growing through exploration. Back in MY day, anyone could go to Sunken Harbor any time they wanted, but now it's a level 30+ zone.The quality of the quests has seen a sharp decrease as well. Except it's not even consitent. The old ARES missions that have been here since the summer of 2013, and even the first 25% of the main questline are still pretty fun and well designed. The remaining 75% of the main quest and the new open world missions, however... Well, it's obvious where Red 5 dropped off and The Nine picked up. Even based off of voice acting quality alone and ignoring the rest of the missions. The bad voice acting was funny for about 15 minutes but then it made me die a little bit inside after I realized why. That being said, the new ""missions"" are also horribly broken and glitchy. Overpowered bosses, convoluted objectives that could just be replaced with something so simple as a door key, et cetera. I was having troubles defeating a level 20 boss in my level 45 armor because of how broken he was. I've also heard complaints from guildmates (who are also veterans in maxed out armors) about the exact same mission near the end of the questline (which I have failed to make it to because of a game breaking bug earlier in the campaign). The9, convolutedness isn't a substitute for balanced difficulty at higher levels. Like I said, I wish that I could have given this a good review. I really wanted to. Despite its greatly increasing flaws, this game is still very unique, especially in the F2P MMO scene. With its true 3D movement mechanic and diversity between classes, FireFall's potential was immense. But now when I look it all I see is what could have been and what soon won't be. One of my favorite games is circling the drain, and it's breaking my heart.			"

												Red 5... what are you smokin on? I don't know what happened to this game within the course of the year i was away, but all these negative reviews made me curious. I just had to go see for myself.There were a ton of bugs to begin with, sure, but now they have multiplied. Issues from simple animations and graphics all the way to the game mechanics itself. Constant clipping, rubberbanding and horribly long loading times.Missing/broken equipment. LIterally everything on my characters have been altered to a point that the builds are no longer valid. Even content that required cash purchased no longer work or exist. This game been one of my absolute favorites for  a long time. Spent a few hundred hours on one steam account (until i forgot it's info) and then a good amount of time on this account. I was happy to have such a vast landscape to openly explore and have borderlandsesque fun with randos. However, instead of improving and fixing the experience that has already been provided, Red5 insists on 'expanding' and 'upgrading' without so much as a second thought to repercussions to the game's integrity and it's player base. The changes themselves won't deter newer players, but the inconvenience and bugs that come along with them certainly will.I guess it's time to move on. "

												A lot of the thoughts in the negative reviews are 100% correct - This is sub-standard MMO, questing fare. Get the quest, walk, collect or kill, return, repeat.However, there's something to it. The multiple abilities, the various characters, the movement with jump-packs. There is something here.I thorougly loved Borderlands, and there are striking similarities (a bit too similar in parts), but this game certainly has the base for something bigger. I'm only level 8 at the moment, but will certainly be making it to 40, and putting some money into the game for the XP boosts.I'm conflicted, but I'm having fun.			"

												They really ♥♥♥♥ed it up when they removed crafting.  Completely remove it.  ""It will be back, but better, in... 1.8  or 1.9 or so"".Yeah, right.  At the speed this thing is progressing (1.7 came in April, and nothing since then), we'll get some kind of (♥♥♥♥♥♥, I expect) crafting back in 2017.  If we're lucky.So, my interest died.Crafting, and especially thumping, was so rewarding.  You could just start, and other players (there were other players!) would just join.  And vice-versa: you could join anyone who had deployed a thumper, defend it against attacking wildlife, and get a reward too.  I loved this form of ad-hoc, sponaneous, low- or even no-barrier teaming.  I wish more games would adopt such mechanics.All that is gone.  And will likely (says my inner pessimist) never return.Other than that you have hardly anything to do.			"

												You brought me tons of joy and hours just lost in the game world. For someone like me who loves MMOS and shooters, this game really filled that void.I remember how in the early days thumping was so fun and awesome. That feeling of going up against a huge horde that were dropping in ODST-like was simply amazing and cool. And blasting insect like creatures to smithereens was harken to the starship troopers movie.And then came the so called big changes, that at first seemed to make the game even cooler, but it was just a facade. The build was released with serious issues and everything just changed for the worse.Sometime in June 2016, I finally called it quits on the game. Honestly I never felt so sad and depressed for giving up on a game. I will always treasure those memories the old Firefall gave me. I will never forget how I looked forward to the end of the day to get back home and logon to just a good time blasting away and meeting fellow pilots.RIP Firefall my old friend. We had a good run.

												this game was an amazing icon of what could've been. i started in 2014 and played for a while, then i deleted it to make room for skyrim since i didn't have the storage. i more recently came back and what has happened absolutely kills me. the devs took everything that people had once loved and threw it out the window. there was so insanely much potential in this game and it was ruined before the game even had a real chance.

												Review and tips focused towards new players, i am a beta player with over 2 years test experience in this title.----First off, you need to know that this 3rd person shooter is also a MMO experience, so keep in mind you need to grind levels and components, a lot of time is needed to play this game, and with how the system works (and a good point i might add) is that you cant just sit there and leech from other people, you physically need to participate to gain XP and credit. So be prepared for a long-lasting (but awesome) experience so long as youre someone who enjoys actually playing the game and not just ya know..sat leeching from someone or not giving a crap.***Gameplay: 7 / 10The content is good, the single player missions are good, the different variations of World events and randomly generated content work great! The only problem is, there's not enough different types of mission and it can quickly become repetetive, which goes the same for story missions, theyre enjoyable but there just isnt enough of them (yet). I highly recommend playing with friends especially if they can give you a ride, or (i highly advise) you puchase with Red Beans of ingame Credits, a BIKE. Without a vehicle this game is a looong walk simulator, but as soon as you get a vehicle and craft yourself a lot of 1-use glider pads this mobility problem goes away (it sorta forces you to get a vehicle, but thats ok they need to make money somehow to sustain these big servers).PvE Content is very well balanced and challenging, if you charge into a base full of bandits or chosen at your level, expect to get yourself killed very quickly as especially the Chosen, are a force to be reconned with. PvP is promising but ultimately, there's no balance and its only fun for the few. The classes you are allowed to play cover all the basic roles (tank, support, healer, dps etc) and the advanced battleframes (which i recommend Bastion, Dragonfly/Recluse, Raptor/Nighthawk or Mammoth for new players as these currently seem the most powerful) grant even further power to your class.They have confirmed, and are adding a lot of content in the future including a level cap rise with (confirmed) at least 2 new world-zones, so expect a LOT of good things for this free-to-play title.***Sound: 7 / 10The music feels very gripping with its orchestral quality and all weapons sounds great, you really feel the oomph of your weaponry and explosions from afar you can almost feel the vibrations from. Sound quality is excellent! Though the roaming music can sorta make you a bit sleepy. The musical score is wonderful in missions and cutscenes but the roaming music is too boring. The game's vocal content and all NPC's (and quest givers) is about 97% fully voice acted! Some of those accents though are not very well spoken, and may sounds a bit cheesy, several of the voice actors seem uninterested but overall, sound is good.***Graphics and worlds: 5 / 10 The maps look average and the systems overal graphics are well toned (character style inspired from Street Fighter 4). I wouldnt call firefall next-gen, its sorta in between last gen and next gen. It's optimized enough to run smoothly including in huge fights of 40 players and a hundred enemies at once on the screen (which is amaaaaziiiiing) but GPU Temperatures can run a little high so i highly recommend turning a few things down (shadows low or off, and antialiasing off unless your computer is an icecube). The worlds although they looks pretty, (gunna be honest here) will p### you off, as every obstacle, every mountain with no climbable surface, every tree/rock/nook and granny and just how lumpy the ground is, seems to do its utmost best to slow you down and hinder your ability to go someplace, which is why they sell glider-pads in game to make money off of you. Because of the terrible pathing in maps and how it fights and pushes you to the point of frustration when youre trying to be in a rush to go someplace, it heavily impacts this rating. The maps by design are agonizing.***Overall: 7 / 10There's a lot of potential here, keep in mind you DO have to spend some money if you want to get anywhere near end-game here because of long distance traveling and the advanced battleframes being stronger (mostly), but with the extra content coming, the community being really supportive of Firefall, and the playerbase being really co-operative and nice in game, i highly recommend this title.Remember, it's free-to-play, but if you want to get serious about this game, you will need to spend a little money OR, spend a lot of time. Recommended: Get a vehicle, unlock the class you really want to play, tryout a 100% XP boost to get out of the first 10 boring levels and BOOM! You got yourself a really fun game, with great PvE experiences, and a solid future. "

												I feel horrible saying this, but all of the other reviews couldn't be more correct. You're going to hear a lot of the same stuff from me compared to all of the other reviews.Firefall used to be one of the best games I had ever playedIt had levelsIt had lootIt accommodated so many play stylesIt had so many different pathsIt even had a full-blown story with side missionsBest of all, this was all freeThen, update 1.6 hit. Like a truck.Everything that I knew,everything that I had learned, it was all useless.They added these weird, more advanced levelsThey completely reworked every single frame (class) in the game, so everything played differentlyThey temporarily removed, then reworked the crafting systemThey compeltely changed the leveling system, so that you had to stick with a class all the way to half level, so once you chose, you were stuck with itI can't express how disappointed I am from this change, and all of the other Firefall vets/Pre-1.6'ers know what I meanIt was perfectEmphasis on 'was'If you're considering this game now, I'm sorry to say that you're too lateRIP Firefall, it was fun while it lasted			"

												What can I say... Back in the days of closed beta I was a top toer backer. The game was great, horizontal progression, which was interesting and challenging. Good class balance and actually intersting way to develop a class. Good PvE, great PvP. The game standed out from the pool of other MMO which played just too alike.But then... Then Red 5 killed this game. They take all that made Firefall unique and threw it away. Now we have ♥♥♥♥ing levels and all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, crafting is junk, gameplay is so much generic, that it is not even funny.I would gladly pay again to play this game as it was in closed beta. But this iteration? No, just no.			"

												The game was aweseome and fun, then they added the Amazon. That wasn't that big of a problem as you didn't have to go there to enjoy the game, since it was broken. The current update, as of today 1.6, has pretty much killed the game. It removed good parts of the game, including the reason to help other players.This is a bad move from the dev team. Now I will be uninstalling this and not playing it again.			"

												Before 1.6 this was the greatest game. It was the only one I played ever since I joined. Once 1.6 came out I was really excited. But then my heart sank as I found the game to be riddled with bugs, content gone as everything went so downhill. I read a post about 'the future of firefall'. I thought they were gonna fix this problem, but no, they announce that they're gonna release it on other platforms. In the state of Firefall at the moment, I doubt this would amount to anything at all. I really hope the devs listen to us and make this game great again.			"

												Oh my god. Shockingly news that it is on steam! Well as a closed beta tester, This game sure have come a looooong way.  It is a truly Open World MMO mhm. As well as its unique style of using abilities like in MOBA MMO's having an ultimate. Fun thing about is the JumpJets which makes you able to hover towns and climb the roof tops. It seems they added new areas! I'm looking forward to explore more areas! :') Can't wait!			"

												WARNING: This is an outdated review, I don't plan on going back to Firefall and relearn the whole damn thing so there are no plans currently to rewrite this entire review. Enjoy my rant.Ah Firefall, one of the few MMO's out there who have shown promise and does it's best to live up to it while other games   cough cough!* Destiny cough cough!   have failed to deliver and as a result developers (and publishers included) over hype it's content.Now you may ask: ""why Firefall? surely there are better MMOs out there!"" no, there really aren't. I have played Rift, SWTOR, WoW, Warframe, Runescape the list goes on and none of those MMOs have impressed me in the least. SWTOR is basically WoW with a Star wars coat of paint plagued by EA's greed and Bioware's massive ego. Rift, was 'okay' but it's still WoW with a new skin and nothing more. Warframe was 90% of the time a Dungeon raid grinding simulator plagued by microtransactions and slow progression all set to make more money, and while I am aware the devs must make money to continue development of said game sometimes it can get out of hand. And finally WoW, their business model is a dying animal from 1999 dragged into this modern world hoping for customers. And while WoW is addictive it's community is toxic as hell. If you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest looking up some of the role play. Now what exactly makes Firefall different from all the rest? Firefall is a F2P FPS/TPS/MMO with of course, jetpacks. It's setting is in the future so it's a sci-fi MMO and that all together is all the reason you need to play it. Why you might ask? because every other MMO out there is trying to be the same thing which is pretty much Dungeons and Dragons. This is a fresh breath of air within the MMO side of gaming that should be explored further, but everyone seems to be quite stupid so let them rot with their WoW clones.But this isn't enough information for you to play the game and try it out for yourself. I am explaining this from my opinion, what I should really be doing is giving you the good sides and the bad sides of this game instead of hitting on other games for their lack of creativity. Gameplay:  While Firefall's combat may not hang on button mashing a spell in multiple slots, the combat is no where near perfect. The combat is a little glitchy and tends to be awkward when fighting NPC's due to NPC's ""skiing"" around with poor animation quality. Which is yet another problem with the combat, the animations need desperate work because it makes indie zombie survival game combat look as fluid as clear water (although it isn't really that bad, but close enough.) First person perspective's animations are just as bad because the view model seems to break quite often either by random chance or exiting large frame drops, so for the most part you'll be playing in Third person. Now don't get me wrong the combat is fun enough to continue playing, but it needs help if it wishes to keep shooter fans such as myself invested.And now for the meat of the game, grinding! because that's fun right!? doing missions over and over and over and over until you get to the next level so you can go to the higher level area and do missions there over and over and over and over again it's so much fun I muted the game! Why?! why do dev's think an MMO's primary goal is to drive yourself insane? I don't want to do the same things I did with the last class until I get my next class to 40! Can you guess what you get in return for grinding all the way up to 40?  *plays drumb roll*  if you guessed more grinding then you. are. the WINNNNNNAAAAAH!!! you get to go play Warzones in Devil's Tusk with other overly powerful level 40 players and get boat loads of XP you can't use! But wait! there's more! if you didn't think tedious resource gathering was enough for you, now you can go do tedious resource gathering as enemy players eat your limbs off in seconds while watching them ♥♥♥♥ your family in front of you crying tears of blood! FUN RIGHT?!Here's a better idea, make the end game worth it. You tortured people all that way just to give them the same thing they were doing at the lower levels but this time far, far, worse! Let's say for example: at the end game you can now get four player special ops missions that require certain skill types such as stealth, distraction, stealing, etc and in return you can get cosmetics or higher chances of getting purple items- something atleast worth leveling to 40. Because I couldn't give a damn about how powerful my character is when all you have to do is stay in the air and fire down death until you complete X Y and Z objectives. Plus mobs can't complain on a forum about how over powered you are so I really can't care about my strength unless fighting in PVP which pretty much boils down to who has the most purple gear anyway... Storyline:  Ooooooooh boy, I am not going to have fun explaining this. I'll get straight to the point and say it's a poorly written saturday morning cartoon show. The writing is so tasteless it makes me want to dry heave!  Everything  is predictable! for example: ""jee, I hope giant crabs from space don't rain on us"" *giant crabs from space rain on you* ""oh no this was so unpredictable your  armor's power is draining and now you can't fly because reasons...Oh dear, let me bring them back up as slowly as I can."" And they do nothing to mix it up. Whatever you do when you play this game, avoid job boards unless you are an achievement hunter.The good news is the story can be ignored, the bad news is no one cared enough to make a compelling cast of characters. Yeah, you have your hot hacker chick telling you what to do and a redneck uncle engineer to add as comedy relief but at the end of the day you have no reason to care for these people. Yeah I get it, I'm not expected to care for the virtual characters, but for the sake of the player, at least make them half decent. The plus side however, most MMOs don't have voice acting at all. Of course games like WoW have shop dialogue ""oy! come to sell yer ♥♥♥♥ son?"" ""I buy and sell ♥♥♥♥"" ""hurry up on over here so I can buy your ♥♥♥♥"" ""I sell quality ♥♥♥♥ at the ♥♥♥♥♥iest price!"" But the majority of it is text, it's not like I hate reading but when the entire game has a weak plot and a crappy UI I have already lost interest at level 1. So Red5 get's points for placing honest effort into it. Final Verdict  So what are the good things I can say about this game? well it's free, you can unlock everything within the game for free if you are willing to work for it, and it has a great community as well as developers. But the glitches and the lack of content is what holds me back from speaking positively about this game. It's not like I didn't try to like this game! I really wanted to enjoy Firefall, and I still do, but it's a love/hate relationship. I have 322 hours on record as proof that I enjoyed the game enough to soldier through it's flaws and eventually write a review on it. And in return I give Firefall a 6/10, it's above 5 because it is trying to be a good MMO that doesn't constantly try to harpoon your wallet every chance it gets like most MMO's I have played. Now do I suggest you install FF right now? well, the in game music is broken, the UI is always glitching (it can even go as far as restarting your game) and this cannot be fixed via hotfix. Despite that go ahead and install it if you have the space for it otherwise move along.			"

												So I used to play this game back when it was fun. Came back after a few years to see whats changed. Guess what .... everything has changed and its ♥♥♥♥. Back in the day i threw hundreds at the game for frames and gliders and what not. Logged into the game only to find out everything that had made the game fun had gotten stripped. Those right click attacks with each frame, removed. All the mods I worked my ♥♥♥ off for, removed. The power cores I got from raiding, no slot to equipt them. I'm not upto date on what the developers have gone through with this game but holy hell, the game used to be good with potential to be great. Now its a sorry excuse for a browser game, wouldnt even buy it on mobile.p.s. to any veterans out there I ran the hooch.			"

												i remember doing countless OCT and BK runs with the same amazing people over and over and then helping out the newbs when they came into the new region untill they could fight for themselfs and held their own ground in events, everyone knew each other, everyone worked as a team. Then racing with my friends and new allies from sunken harbour to thump dump (bottom to the top of the map) and stoping to fight off invasions if there were any good times indeed. The game was very good but Red5 and their chinese overlords kept changing all the systems and in the end me and alot of others after a update came back to find all our classes reset with all gear gone and my current 45 biotech that i logged in to got forced into repluse and put back to level 1. the whole crafting system also disappeared without warning as well and still isnt back.i have lots of memories with this game since i have played heaps of it on and off of steam. i really really wanna say is a good game but since that update i cant say that. this game was the best its truly sad that this game has been screwed over the potential was limitless.

""Ummm, NOT SURE...""You DEVs, those in charge, are the biggest bunch of indecisive, no brained idiots who have ever tried to run a game, or company for that matter. How is it so difficult to plan, test, impliment then keep your hands off??? Is that too much? Idle hands? Instead of all these changes, that then get changed again during the next big update...how about waiting until its ready to go then do it!! ELITE RANKS...cant get it right the first time, so mix it up again. How many months was that planned for? did you not have meetings, brainstorming, testing and double checking...then later simply add crystite amounts and caches...why not the first time around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Im done, you can stick your free, dead and tired game up your powercore, and I hope for the sake of all the others who have wasted, or who may waste any more time on this dead fish of a game, you guys close up shop asap and leave the gaming world for jobs in anything but!

												Don't bother. This game has been reworked about four times now. Even after kicking that idiot Mark Kern to the curb, development still has absolutely no direction whatsoever.Most of the balance changes are actually decent. However, this latest update disabled a lot of features because suprise, they're being reworked. For the fifth time. Also, end game zones? Being reworked as well, so good luck finding stuff to do at max level, especially since thumping is no longer fun in the slightest.For those who played before, remember the arsenal frame? It had pretty decent firepower with its LMG, and abilities granted weapons with limited ammo to be used in certain situations. A shotgun with high damage, a particle beam for long range AOE, and so on. Its ultimate was great, my favorite one in the game. Ever see Macross? The mechs which could fire off a ton of missiles at once? Basically that, though the rockets here arc like mortar fire. And it was AWESOME!Sounds like a cool frame, right? Well, it's gone. Just removed completely because the developers are too stupid to figure out how to bolster its shortcomings. And not one single frack was given when people who loved it clamored for it back. They did offer pretty nice compensation, but as cool as the vehicle is, I'd rather have my Arsenal back. Save your time and energy for something else. This game could have been wonderful, but they spent far too much time just figuring out what they wanted this game to be... and still are! If you must try, I'd recommend not spending any real money. Let's face it, the game and Red5 are on its last legs. I'm actually surprised it's lasted this long, especially after its abysmal failure in Asia. I really don't think they'll make it to the end of 2016. Need to get your shooter fix? There are plenty of better offerings on Steam. Go try one of those, and leave this game to die. BTW my play time was mostly using the proprietary launcher, not Steam. So ♥♥♥♥ off with hours played BS.			"

												Let's start with the bad since that's probably the first thing many people will notice before they can adequately give it a chance:  this game is a buggy mess.  At one point in my first week of playing the social network went down for about an hour or so, so there were no squads, no local chats, no zone chats, no private chats.  That was...interesting for an MMO.  Also count in the sheer amount of times youll have to /rui or simply relog on the game and it's easy to see more than a few problems with this ""new"" release.  One other thing I wasn't particularly impressed with was the voice acting.  Some of the higher 'brass' sounds like little more than some doughboy CS developer-type guy.  Some of the voice acting simply sounds LAZY, where you expect the person you're reporting to to at least SOUND like he/she commands some sort of air of authority.  Additionally, more than a few of the accents sound forced.  OK so fair enough, this game didn't cost me anything to download but spacetime.  Despite the issues, this game has a LOT of redeeming qualities and so now we'll move on to why I recommend it.  While the level cap is low for an MMO (currently only 40; I've gotten a little more than halfway there at this point in time), Red 5 offers within Firefall a world lush with touristic scenery (the first town, Copacabana, is similar to an island vacation destination), Borderlands-esque graphics (cell-shading) and gameplay, and random bad guys including oversized bugs (giving it a Starship Troopers kind of feel at times), various rebel factions, and a cult of sorts that goes by the name of the Chosen.  In this world, the ""Melding"" has descended after a massive semi-apocalyptic event called the ""Firefall"", spawning the Chosen and as an ARES mercenary it's your inevitable destiny to push this purple tyranny back into the shadowy depths from which it came.  As someone who just hit their 20's in game, I don't know if there's ever an overall resolution towards this problem but I'm sure having a good time getting to that end point.As you level up, there are several towns for almost every level range so location diversity is never really a problem.  Each of these towns has it's own job board which supplies you with a set of level appropriate gopher/defense missions to help you level.  There's also a main string of campaign quests that you steadily unlock as you level up that add to the story of the war against the Melding.  In some of these missions you actually push the melding back by activating a SIN Uplink in the area (so THAT's what those are for!). In your time spent playing Firefall, there are several other things to do if you don't like the mainstream find/grind missions.  Several random missions occur in your local area, ranging from melding tornados (around level 15-20 it seems are the lowest ones you can find) that you have to spend some time shooting down to random LGVs and Thumpers crashing down in your area which you can save for a decent chunk of xp and resources.  Sometimes Chosen dropships like to pay visits to SIN Uplinks in towns or at watchtowers and attack/take them over, after which it's team ARES' responsibility to liberate and take back the area.Using Thumpers in itself is another gem of this game's overall existence.  Yet another choice while exploring the world is to scout out mineral nodes that randomly spawn throughout.  Find a node, call down your thumper, and prepare to defend it for the next 5 minutes while it mines resources for you and bugs are trying to destroy it.  A successful thump gets you xp and resources based on the % of the minerals present in the area you're thumping.  An unsuccessful thump sees your thumper destroyed, but that's OK!  You can just craft another one!Crafting is one area of the game that seems a bit overwhelming at first, but it actually ends up fitting into the game quite nicely for those higher teens and lvl 20+ areas.  Almost everything you pick up is salvagable, which gets you research points, crystals, and refinable materials that can later be used in crafting.Mobility EARLY game is KIND of an issue, but not really.  For the most part you'll be walking around everywhere until level 25 when you get a reusable ground vehicle, but there are some alternatives.  1-use ground vehicles drop from quests and I believe they're also craftable if you so desire.  In addition to the possibility of ground vehicles you have the entire hang gliding system which is it's own source of entertainment, not to mention a much quicker way to get places.  I especially enjoy climbing the highest mountains (there are achievements for climbing these mountains as a matter of fact) and spawning a glider pad to fly off of them.  Some of these mountains literally make it possible to fly clear across a region from one side to the other, just don't fly near the Arclight! :DAs far as replayability is concerned, you don't have to ever create a new character if you don't want to.  All the different classes are separated by what are known as ""battleframes"" in game, which one can change not unlike a shirt or some other equippable article of clothing.  Now, each time you equip a new frame you haven't played before it starts at level 1 but all the early missions are replayable for xp/resource credit.  I should also mention that starting out as a free player you only get access to the  5 different accord frames, which are the basic frames in each of the 5 different battle classes.  Here's the beauty of this particular free2play game, though:  you don't ever have to spend a dime of your real money in game to get everything there is to get, it might just take a while longer.  There is always the option of buying stuff for those that are impatient and want to try out some of the elite frames sooner rather than later, like me.  Bought Electron and Bastion on the first night.All-in-all, I do recommend this game.  It has a lot of potential.  It's very engaging; the gameplay is moderately-paced and 3-dimensional based in a wide-open world.  Listening to the soundtrack is often pretty relaxing.  This game also does have PvP, though I've spent next to no time exploring that particular venue cause there's so much other fun stuff to do in PvE that, quite refreshingly, doesn't seem so repetitive.  Even the campaign missions you unlock changes up the scenery and the objective in each one so it's not simply a generic mission formula.  It's obvious they took some time to plan the campaign missions out.  Now if only they'd spend the time to make sure that some of my local town job quests didn't get stuck loading the next objective or that I'm at least ALWAYS able to invite my friends to quest with me in a squad (I will not forget that ONE experience, but to any potential players reading this, it was just the ONCE).  Try this game if you like F/TPS, cooperative gameplay, and a decent story line.			"

												Ignore the older just-after-release reviews. Yes this game had a rocky start, yes it didn't deliver right away and yes it used to be very buggy. But the team shows true love for their game and has been constantly upping the ante and making this a game that gets more and more fun. I think the developers are doing a truly admirable job turning this game around and delivering a very satisfying and addictive game. The free to play concept is worked out quite honestly while at the same time leaves some room to splurge on a few nice extra's. Just walking around, enjoying the scenery, questing and chasing random events is a fun, and if done properly, fast way to build a few nice characters. Atmosphere is great and as a busy man with not too much free time this is a really nice way to spend a few hours once in a while. Good graphics too and runs smoothly on a proper PC.Just simply put, one of the better FTP games on steam and I'm glad to see the community is getting on the bandwagon because this game deserves it! The special events are a blast btw!			"

													A study in game design theory, Firefall is a title that is fantastic on paper and mediocre in practice.  Most of what's present is forgivable, but the primary attraction is ultimately its biggest liablity.  Ultimately, it won't appeal to MMO fans due to it's watered down questing and pve mechanics, and action fans will dismiss it due to a lack of refinement.  	Firefall's story revolves around the discovery of meterological elements that allow us to build fantastic technology, such as jet pack suits, advanced weapons, and space ships.  The goal of traveling to an Earth like planet is foiled by further plot mechanics, as the ship crashes into Earth, rendering most of the surface uninhabitable.  The obligitory aggressive alien species comes to Earth to take over, and this sets the stage for blah blah blah.   	Poorly written sci fi tropes doesn't compel a player to continue on with the story, so the game heavily relies on the action elements.  These are where the biggest problems manifest, because the actual meat of the game is mediocre at best.  The game has a one to one action component, which is unusual for MMO's as it's a genre that caters to point and click, but Firefall tries desperately to stand out.  Instead it feels like a mechanically stripped down shooter with very little to differentiate itself from the hundreds of other FPS games, and strapping a jet pack to your character does very little to help.  	The actual physics of flying feel so static and boring that it really shouldn't have bothered.  Instead of using it as a method to travel quickly from place to place, it simply allows for altitude adjustments, and has very little “skiing”, something that the tribes games were lauded for.  Strategically, it's still important for melee centric enemies as you'll jet above them and shoot as they attempt with great futility to nibble your ankles.  If an inertial effect was added to the jetting the game would be a pleasure, especially with the varied terrain.  As is, moving from point A to B in the game is a chore.	Production values crush what enjoyment could have been gleaned from the rest of this game, as the graphics, sound, interface, and general design are adequate, but that's it.  The view distance for terrain, monsters and allies is good, but up close they look pretty meh.  This is in no small part due to an unusual cartoonish design, somewhere between Borderlands and World of Warcraft, but nowhere near as endearing as either.  It comes off as generic and unexciting, with little if anything unique about it.  Enemy design suffers the most, as it isn't just dull, it only has a handful of variations.  In about 3 hours of gameplay, I had seen the same arachnid design used for about half the enemies, and zombie like enemy soldier for the other.  From the sound of a machine gun to rockets firing, to my commander speaking to the lowly civilians, everything sounds awful.  The voice acting especially is cringe worthy, with the theater commander taking the prize for most obnoxious line delivery this year.  	Potential is squandered on a regular basis in the gaming industry, but rarely had expectations been so high; a 1 to 1 action mmo with jetpacks, a pvp component, and a free to play model.  All that's left is an excellent case study in how design doesn't necessarily equate to execution.  Firefall isn't terrible, it's just a really basic, stripped down action game that just happens to have an MMO component tacked on.  Both are incredibly basic and unrefined, and leaves very little to entice fans of either genre.  In the end, it really isn't worth your time unless major improvements are made. "

												This game used to be the best game, period. Now returning after half a year or so, I found out that the devs have destroyed this game. They removed 75% or more of the game and are not longer replying on forums / social media since March.Parts of the map are broken, missions don't work, character system is changed (removed some characters), crafting is gone, instances are gone, most of the dynamic events are gone or broken, skills have been removed ( a lot ).The community is pretty much no longer there, as I've seen maybe 50 player max online at a time. They are all waiting for Red 5 to bring back pre 1.6.Come on Red 5, use that bloody version control and fix this game! Or if that's to hard, at least post a message, somewhere!IMHO this game is ABANDONED!(over 500 hours in this game.. shame..) "

												This is going to be a short and to the point review, so forgive the lack of flattery or filler.This game has been holding onto life by some force I don't even recognize, to be honest.I played this game back in closed beta and it was amazing and new to me. Given it didn't have much content, but it was always updating and the story was opening up. I would've given the game a 7.5/10 score.It's been a long time now and I have played a good chunk of time again, and I am sorely disappointed.* It's full of bugs and glitches that aren't typically fixed. Some are, most are not.* Updates don't always fix what's broken and they include what the community has called 'Ninja Updates' that they intentionally hide so as to try and avoid confrontation from their playerbase.* A game once made to reward skill and strategy is now just ""Who can do the more AoE damage"". Skill is no longer a thing. The deadliest and most used classes are AoE classes, aside from Dragonfly healers of course.* PvP is more or less dead. Now the PvP zone sees only the occasional battle but is more or less quiet and only for getting materials.* The game is horribly optimized. Beefy computers can see lag. Amazing connections will still see latency problems.* The phrase ""Don't fix what isn't broken"" is often seen in action.* Most of the crafting in the game is worthless. You can skip over it till endgame and not suffer for it much at all.* Just to keep up with most of the playerbase, you have to play for weeks to get daily rewards just to get VIP status to earn enough in-game currency to do anything.I tried to enjoy the game and even joined an army (guild, clan, whatever you wanna call it) and ran around with them but it was already too late. I had seen the game poisoned for me beyond repair.Now I rate this game 3/10. It's a waste of time.As far as I am concerned, the only reason this game is still alive is because they have something that hasn't been done better yet. If someone came up with a game similar to this and actually did it justice, I would probably be all over it and I doubt there wouldn't be masses of players wanting in on it too.TL;DR - This game isn't worth the headache, the time sink or the urge to pay into the game just to get a leg-up. Skip it over and wait for something better.			"

Don't let the birds get me.I'm primarily a traditional MMO player, so I was really surprised that this FPS-heavy one where everyone has battleframes caught my attention. I'm not really a fan of mecha, either. But for maybe the first 700 hours I played the game, it was great. I played mostly assault-style frames like the Tigerclaw, where the whole point of the frame was to be nimble and jump around the field a lot, with an afterburner letting you stay in the air for a long period of time. This was also key to managing a lot of the terrain easily. But after the last major patch and subsequent fixes, I can't stay in the air more than a few seconds. I can't do all my terrain tricks any more. I can't even use my vehicles the same way. And this is all intentional. Even if I could, a lot of the old storylines have changed. Sure, the scenery looks better in places. Certainly busier, at least. But the heart's gone out of it, I think.Within the game, there used to be a hidden crayon drawing, taped up behind a bookcase, from a kid who was the admiral's son. Just one of the billions of people who died in the initial tragedy, but someone whose death we knew about. It was just a small thing that most people never saw, but for me it made everything and everyone we lost personal, and served as a reminder why we shouldn't give in and let the Melding and oblivion overtake us. But, like so many other things, that's apparently been lost or moved. And dim memories of the past are no longer enough to sustain the effort in this game, especially when it appears they're no longer shared by whoever is directing this, now.The ""new"" starting story is very much on rails, and should be easier for someone who has never played it before. Some of the new story with its enhanced scenery is even pretty cool. But further along its handholding turns into handwaving away the things that matter, and now I reluctantly raise my own hand to say goodbye.			"

												The beta builds for Firefall in 2012 were so much better than this current build, and by that I mean around Aug/Sept/Oct time; cuase I didn't really get to play the beta as much as I would have, since something happened to my client, it's wouldn't run or even uninstall. I didn't get to play Firefall again till it was on steam a week or so ago.They took most, if not all, the fun out of this game. The areas are level based now, I remember being able to roam the whole map just about. The random events are gone as far as I can see. No more invasions by the melting or chosen, I remember watchtowers being attacked all the time, and random invasions here and there; don't see any happening now. The crashed thumpers and LGV's are still here, but seem to be fewer than before to me.Then there's the crafting and reaserch. There wasn't any research when I was playing beta. I don't mind it, but they put in TOO much; it needs to be combined and have AT LEAST 50% of it cut out. Either that or make a lot of other ways to get reaserch points other than savalaging, or reduce the points costs as well. And what happened to all the minerals? There's nothing but sand/dirt and iron now that I found around the starting area, there used to be at least a third mineral too around the starting area.I also remember a horizontal skill/gear/weapon tree that you got a point (or whatever) to spend on every level up for a frame; that was option based, as in every level of the tree had at least two choices (such as between two weapons, a weapon or skill, booster/gear item or something else, and etc.) and you could always wait another level to get the second (or other choices) if you wanted both (or all). There was also a particular ""upgrade"" path to advanced frame 1 or advanced frame 2, so you could get to an better frame quick if so wanted, or both advanced frames.And there's durablity now, and for EVERYTHING? Wasn't in the beta and we don't need it.I'd really like to know wtf happened to this game, it was so much better in the beta when I played it. Which is usually the opposite of betas/games I've played, usually the beta sux more so then the release for a game; but not this time, firefall beta was much better then released firefall.			"

												What was once an amazing open world, free-roaming, badass fight for humanity's surival packing unique crafting/leveling systems... has declined into every other MMO you've ever played. Dev's can't figure out what they want to do and this has been in ""beta"" for 3 years since I joined; every other patch wildly changes core systems.Everything in the open world feels blatantly scripted and there is no longer any meaningful dynamism in zones.It's by no means pay to win, but I can't make myself support the game for a virtual hat that costs 20$!

												Long time player, since early closed beta i supported the game in hopes it would change. But in all honesty it has not. All the money we used has gone to pay for there youtube channel staff do sing a longs, to there 3 GM's doing a livestream taking 5 mins to talk about the game then using the other 45 mins of the time they are getting paid to work talking about useless post about the community. (showing other players off) he gameplay itself is ok and fun, but the game is a grindfest, and gets boring really fast. A few bug fixes have been implemented for example removing the enemies aimbot system which in beta they announced it was how the enemies were suppose to behave, to a few market and UI glitches. But the game now that its release STILL has many bugs, and is not polished at all. I do not recomend this game, being a veteran player of the game. The only feature that i have not seen break in this game is there RMT system, which if it did it would be fixed asap unlike the other bugs in the game. I honestly do not know what they are doing with the money they are recieving from players but, this game is still a beta.  Passing by the forums, ive read players complety disagree with other reviewers about the game. Take mine to heart, being a closed beta player to launch, and any other honest players review. Becuase now they the ""Fanboys"" of the game are reading and downvoting most honest reviews. Try it out yourself and you be your own judge. Thank you for your patience.Best, Rundas~			"

												Once apon a time, Firefall was amazing. It was actively being developed, new content was dropped all the time. The devs listened to the community. The combat wasn't *exactly* balanced, but it was good. It was innovative and showcased several new and interesting ideas.  None of that is true anymore.  It is no longer actively developed. Current content stops working all the time. The devs (such as they are) have fallen silent. The classes and combat balance now heavily favor some classes over others. And the innovation was dialed back until the battleframe powers no longer had anything new or interesting.  A change in management, and Firefall was destroyed.			"

												This is a prime example of a game with very talented developers, with horrible leaders. The game had major promise during beta, with massive world changing events in game, it was amazing! Even devs would come to play occasionally (whether with us, or as a world boss).Almost all the mechanics that made this game fun such as Chosen incursions, ""thumping"" for resources, even pushing back the melding, is gone. The game is a husk of what it once was. From what I can tell all motives to work together are gone, or just not worth it. What The9 did to the game is aweful, and now they are trying to get rid of their shares.I have to put credit where it is due, making a game like this is no easy feat, Red5 has made a powerful game engine and a beautiful game. But lets not forget who brought this game down to needing money from someone like The9.Mark Kern from what I read, has made a lot of horrible decisions, don't trust him with whatever game he is trying to make, for the FireFall fanbase. He didn't help make the game as much as he is saying. https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1tuf3c/this_is_why_mark_kern_was_removed_as_ceo_by_red_5/Unfortunatly this game seems like a sinking ship.

												I cant make a definitive decision on this game as the entire things has been turned on its head: I'll explain.When this game released, the game's creators clearly wanted a system to have class and area progression much like you see in the mmorpg genre.   they had a complex crafting system and dual currencies to support the free-to-play business model.  After establishing these, they started adding PVP systems into the game.   nothing lik factions, but instanced arena setups much like you see in class-based shooters like team fortress and unreal.  it was participative and completely optional, but had its own progression and rewards system, as you can expect in amodern shooter.   some time after this, they moved focus back to the storyline and the thin mission system that would move you through the lives of 3 main characters, represented with some voice acting and dialog.  This, also, was completely optional, once you left a tutorial area.   This is where the good times seemed to end, as after a few months, I logged in to a completely different game.   I logged in and gone were the class progression elements of classes, and imposed were new inventory limits, changes, and systems.      Frames (the suits that your character wears,)  now had more slots and gear, and the gear was relegated into level resstrictions and tiers.   Frame guns were no longer tied to the role of the class, and could be mixed and matched.  and the complex crafting system that could produce guns with a huge variety of effects had been reduced to a much smaller gear table, with a diablo-rune attachment system.   frames were no longer progresseive, but standalone and purchaseable without any requirement but currency (paid or earned.)  and the free-roaming world had been consolidated into a hub to go on various instanced dungeons.   in short: every sandbox piece of this game had been stripped and relegated into a theme park I did not want to visit.     After some research, this seems to be the result of internal restructuring in the company, that included changing enough of the design team to completely omit the original creators.  So while at first I heavily reccomended this to anyone with a decent system, I say, now, that this is just another game in the pile of theme park, microtransactive mmos with very little to drive a player to progression or exhistence.

												I played this game a while back and loved it, I got high level with a bunch of different battlesuits (forgot what they are called). I recently came back to this game and saw that my highest level was 4 and that I had to replay the tutorial. After about 5 minutes of playing the inventory came up on my screen and wouldnt go away, I thought ""hey just a bug, ill relog"". Turns out this was a reoccuring bug that happened at least 5 times before I decided just to quit the game.			"

												Questing, leveling, and crafting design makes this game play and feel like it came out in 2001. I can't wrap my mind around how you can design such nice combat and fun abilities and smooth movement and still try to make an old school escort and fetch treadmill. Early game is just pathetic. You could find first graders who could design a better early game leveling than a zone full of 40 long boring escort missions that are exactly the same but randomized lengths from 10 yards to 5 miles. This is the worst excuse for an MMO I've played in a decade. They should have focused on the action instead of this garbage crafting and questing that's coded with zero effort but put in your face at every turn.			"

												Firefall is a good free to play, if only he had more courage in merging MMO and FPS elements that constitute the core, would have really been able to make ends meet. I refer to the social components developed only partially and AOLA lack of an open PvP adequately contextualized: the lack of factions (the Chosen playable would really manna) and dedicated servers to clan warfare on a global scale is aging considerably a title, especially as it is a true F2P that sells for real money only aesthetic elements and boost the experience, still deserves to be recommended to all for the breadth of what it has to offer and the incisiveness of some goodies like the live event and the economic system. Ultimately lacks that degree of innovation that could elevate to something truly unique.			"

												Really cannot say that I support this game anymore. It started off as a brilliant unique idea and has over the years gone through countless complete rebuilds until now it is barely the same idea. Most of the core of the game has been gutted to the point now as someone that has been playing this game since I bought into it in alpha... I am not even certain what the point of the game is anymore.It has basicly been dumbed down to zero for heavens know what purpose and to this day seems to go through some major new development direction monthly. Could it be a great game some day, at this point I honesly have to say no, that ship has sailed. Best just to avoid it and hope the devs learned their lesson if and when they perhaps decide to start a new project.			"

												The last patch literaly killed the game. Everything single piece of equipment you had is now unusable, which means countless hours for nothing. Losing everything is one thing but having half of the game taken down for future improvment is unnaceptable. The entire crafting system and the market are down as we speak until the next patch wich won't be up so soon since the last patch was months late. Those two features are how you get geared up and spend most of your in-game currencies on. Red 5 are unreliable,lying and sneaky developpers who doesn't deserve good people time and money.			"

												This was once a real fun game with all the potential in the world but because of all the drama with the creators R5 since just before 1.6 and all the layoffs, people quitting and not paying their employees during Christmas (of all times) they've lost all credability.  Each patch broke more than it added and everything seems half ♥♥♥♥♥ from quest item drops (from killing mobs) not showing up in caves but rather on top of the mountains above to the long awaited return of Devils Tusk (which has been in game for a couple years but they ""re did it"") which turned out to be a complete mess.  No atmosphere, you walk up to a lava pit and no sounds... No events, all the quests were broke (took 20 mins for the quest giver to give you the quest and another 20 for the quest to show up on the map).  The new world event they talked up for a month before the release was broken for weeks.  All the end game raids wouldn't allow full raid groups to enter.  Not a peep from R5 about this for over a week.  It was like they just said F it there's nothing we can say at this point.1.6 came out earlier this year and the player base took a nose dive because everything was broken.  There's currently like 300 people on durring the day (that's probably generous) and maybe 600 at night although that probably has dropped since I quit playing a week ago.  It's a shame this game had potential in Beta and it just never progressed correctly.  I have never been more dissapointed in a developer as R5.  They are the absolute worse bunch of clowns.  They NEVER test anything before releasing it for years they relied on players to do the testing. And, even when people went through the trouble of testing and writing bug reports they NEVER listened to them and just released the patch with all the bugs.They just lost the crafting designer which was supposed to be their next patch (to add that back into the game) and now I've heard that they scrapped it to start over because they don't have competant people there to take over what he left them.  I mean the incompetance just keeps evolving faster than the game.  Go read their glassdoor comments from past employees it will explain how terrible that company has become since the9 took over (A Chinese company) that funded them after the moron that ran the company wasted all their cash on a multimillion dollar bus that doesn't work and started a video production company that only did some crap parody music videos in someones back yard...  You cannot write this stuff the drama is something to really take in!If you want to be depressed thinking about what this game could have been feel free to level from scratch... You will see the possabilities but probably by the time you reach max level the game will no longer exist.			"

												For someone who actually funded the game nearly from the satart I have to say I am severely dissapointed, this started as a great premise, trurned into a work in progress quirky fun game that showed serious potential, then fell appart at the seams.  Now it seems that the team working on this game have gone the way of the Dodo Birds and disappeared from the face of the planet; the game is now seriously broken all the way to the main missions glitching (Devils Tusk Broken so that on trying to enter the main mission the game crashes out completely resetting the mission at start).  Crafting, special abilities, and more have been so completely reqorked that the original players that put serious time and even money into the crafting part of this game LOST EVERYTHING because they actually REMOVED the crafting system.  Seriously, who ever heard of a game that starts with crafting and then removes it completely????  Oh wait, now you can buy the needed upgrades, and that takes time to grind out more, or you can pay for it with moeny in the way of Red Beans, or can you, event that has so many issues it has simply become not worth using.  And as mentioned, I was one of the original Funders when the game first launched, buying the best package they offered even before launch, now I feel cheated, left out in the cold, and completely ignored just like the rest of the community that still exists (all 3 or 4 of them that I might see in an hour when trying to play at times) Seriousy, how can something so good go so bad, it is like that super hot girlfirend you got married to just to find out she was actually criminally insane, dangerous and a serial Divorcer looking for the quick cash cow just to cut and run to the next chump that falls for her huge Chimmey Chunga's.  No not bitter over this not at all,  make sure you get a prenuptual before investinmg ANY time or heaven forbid Money into this title as it stands right now.For easy reference for how the community feels about this game please review this URL provided beautifully from Steam:  http://steamcharts.com/app/227700 "

												I've had a lot of fun playing Firefall in the past but after the latest update I wouldn't recommend this game. They removed a lot of things from the game and are 'reworking' them before they put them back in, but I'm really not sure if these things will ever be put back in to the game. Crafting and the endgame zones have been removed and still havn't been put back in, and plenty of other changes people are unhappy with have been implemented. Everything I liked and cared about in the game has been removed. If the update ever comes where some of these things are brought back to the game I might change this review, otherwise I'd just say stay away from the game in its current state.			"

												Less than 1 hour into game and I had enough.All the bugs that put me off outright:*gimmicky movement - during second pre-quest sliding didn't work properly (character was periodically descending);*audio desync - frequent massive audio delay after firing rifle, at times also no sound from enemy weapons, just bullets hitting target impact sound;*impossible to close menu with cursor at times - it says to close it with esc - it fails to mention you are forced to look at all leveling up perks (blue symbol at left corner). Figuring that and running to second quest cursor menu again popped up and I had to franticly smash esc and n to close it. After 30 seconds of smashing it closed. During second quest before upcoming mob wave I opened inventory, closed it but cursor menu again didn't close, this time with no luck to close it.That's the first game behaving like that, all the other games work fine on my PC.

												Firefall is a open-world game that is fun for the first several hours, but then gets repetitive as there is not a whole lot to do besides begin leveling the upgraded counterpart after getting max rank. The game starts you off landing on copacobana, a resort town surrounded by a beach on one side and a forest on the other. You have multiple battleframes to choose from to suit your play style, such as the assault, recon, or the engineer. With each battleframe you get to max level you can unlock a advanced frame that sports new abilities and access to a new primary weapon. The world allows you to reach max level without touching a job board do to the abunance of ares missions that are scattered around the map. They will give you as much if not more experience than doing a job board mission in a fraction of the time, however the game is a huge grindfest and gets downright aggravating at times. The gameplay is alot like a watered down borderlands mixed with warframe. You fight dangerous wildlife, rouge bandits, and the infamous chosen which is humanitys main foe. There is not a whole lot to do in the game besides grind, grind, and grind some more.  After leveling my second battleframe I tried yet again to begin leveling another battleframe, but i couldn't bring myself to go through the tedious grind for a third time.When i was reading chat, every now and then the conversation would lean toward talking about the beta and how great it was compared to the way it is now. I did not have the chance to play the beta, but then i think i would be even more dissapointed in the game like so many others who have played and reviewed this game. It is very repetive, lacks content, and is honestly a snoozefest that couldn't keep my interest. Save yourself the time and the hard drive space for something better than Firefall. "

												Wow, I really hate to write a bad review of this game as I had praised it for so long. After a resource wipe, two gear wipes, a battle frame(one I really enjoyed) removed, and a complete change to the core of how the game is played I really can't say I like this game anymore. I was a Founder, I believed in how the game was created in beta and when it launched the first time. I made friends and even joined a good guild. Currently, with all the new changes this is no longer Firefall.Sure there were some positive steps in the right direction, but there were just too many in the wrong.Back in the day ""thumping"" was the way you not only aquired resources, it was a great way to level up as well. This brought people together as it was almost impossible or the avarge player to solo the largest resource collector.I heard crys for missions, and how the crafting system sucked. In all honestly, I belive the people crying for this were trying to turn the game into something else they had left before. The Devs listened to these morons and not the playerbase that was spending money, time, and enjoyment to this game as it was. Adding to the game would have been great, however trying to add new stuff seemed too hard and was deemed easier to just redo the game.If the game alright? I don't see why not, however my faith had been spit on, dragged through the dirt, and anything I tried to work for was stripped away from me.If you have never played Firefall I would say jump in and try it out. Don't spend money though as that just seems to promote stupidity.If you played the game before, just keep moving along. Your heart will break and you may constantly say things like, ""Where's my x?"" or ""What am I playing?"".			"

												TL;DR If you are bored give it a go and you'll have some fun, but...There is no development on this game any longer. The servers will remain up for an unknown amount of time. This game has amazingly fun gameplay, an awesome world to explore, great events, truly a wonderful game however the development team began a very daring and not well planned revamp of the meta aiming to make the game more role oriented (Tank, healer, support, dps). They improved most classes, devastated some others. The systems were also supposed to be revamped and while the progression towards advanced frames is improved thats about the only thing that got better. Crafting doesnt exist anymore, farming for money is pointless as questing gets you more, lots of quests are bugged and will never be fixed, etc. The game is truly unique and I will miss it, I was personally waiting for the development to finish their transition but that day will never come. Here's hoping they sell off the rights to someone who can do it justice but they said they are going to focus on developing the IP into mobile platforms			"

Jobs weren't ""Go fight a hand ful of monsters here"" ""Run 500 meters"" ""Fight 10 more here"" ""Run 1000 meters"" ""Fight 15 + A tiny boss"" ""run 1500meters back to turn in"" Rinse and repeatLets give everyone a jetpack, with hardly any boost put gliders extremely spaced out, and then make the gameworld and mission spacing RIDICULOUSLY LARGE.SOOO MUCH running without DOING ANYTHING.I preferred the first open beta.

												I bought in to the game back in 2011 ishhh and was extreamly pleased. The game was more rigid and structed with a free roaming system for if you want hard people go here or easier go there. Now it has a system of your lvl 40 but in a lvl 20 area soooo your now lvl 20. Its a nice system to keep balance but the game is about free roaming and doing your own on a global scale. There is no more rigid areas of attack from the enemy and where you must push them back as seen in 2013. Most the good bits have been removed with a ALWAYS changing class and stats system that cant make up its mind. Also instead of a LARGE map you can freely move about the chunked it up in to small little sections that get you loading screen each time you move.....

												Well guess its about time for me to finally write a review. Just going to start off by saying I've been around with Firefall for ages now, all the way back since closed alpha, hell my character is still the same original one. Over the years I have seen A LOT of core game changes, like so many I don't even remember all of them. A few changes were for the better, such as when progression was sideways, you aren't trying to gain levels but work on aspects about your frames by gathering resources to use. At least to memory this was my favorite of the systems, it was good. So right now we're sitting at version 1.7 if I'm not wrong, and yet again more changes to the core systems. Battleframe cores, which wasn't something I liked all that much to begin with, are now gone and replaced with generic armor pieces.  Old modules were replaced with new ones, honestly can't tell you why this was changed. Best guess is to have one kind of module rather than weapons and ability varients, still all in all I don't know why this even happened. Entire weapon classes have been changed, and this one seriously pisses me off. Rhinos are one of the dreadnaught arctype frames that used to carry a laser heavy machine gun, it was pretty awesome, and it worked basically how it sounds, a machine gun that shoots lasers. It also had an alternate fire that was a fairly neat and useful single continuous beam. Well the new Photon Lance has all the features of the old laser HMG, but without the machine gun part. To put it bluntly, what used to be an alt fire is now a completely standalone weapon. Oh it also has a fantastic range of 20 meters which basically puts the least defensive of the slow dreadnaught frames at a very close range to the enemy. Makes complete sense obviously. Look, Firefall is my baby. It is a game that I've been coming back to time and time again over the ages, no other MMO has ever received the same treatment from me. I care about this game a lot, and I seriously want it to succeed, believe me. Just... someone out there has decided to shoot themselves in the foot in a really bad way, in the past Firefall has been amazing and fun as hell. That Firefall isn't what we have anymore, its a shame honestly. Well, with the game's constant history of changes maybe we'll see something good again in the future, but I don't think so.			"

												Nothing much has changed to this game since June 2016 when I posted the review.  Firefall have promised a large patch to fix everything before porting it out to console.  I think them putting it out to console is what hs cost them this game so far.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------June 2016I played this game in Beta and had account for quite a few years, started to try it again since came out on steam.I think this game has been broken for a very long time. The idea and concept was very well done, then they started pulling it about trying to make it more simple. Thats what messed this game up.  They should of kept it complicated and helped players understand it by better tutorials.It seems my account is messed up and I dont understand how much of the game is so broken.  I think they should just now abndon or sell it on to another group and statr again. Maybe Firefall 2 learn from the mistakes when they started.  Planetside did thats why the game is really popular.Sorry guys gotta give thumbs down as too much feels incomplete and what the hell has happend to all my characters all kinda being lvl 20 now ? So confusing with very little content changes and mission changes.Maybe release the source code for fans to mod the game and fix parts. Recommend starting a Firefall 2 and learn from the mess of this one.(I rate this game 35% as it was good to start with)			"

												I was a founder for this game years ago back when it was a mmo shooter with rpg elements and an expansive crafting system. I took some time off to deal with life things only to come back to a game that lost most of its shooter elements to be replaced by meaningless rpg fodder and a handicapped crafting system. The game as it stands is a grinder with little redeemable qualities. You will empty entire clips into one enemy. You will traverse long distances to redo the same quest. And calldowns no longer work correctly.I think everyone should take the time to play this game for a few hours. It has its charms but should serve more as a museum piece for what the industry could be doing. Imagine that when I played this game religiously I was one soldier in a massive war spanning the entire Copacobana region with Chosen attacking all sectors. It was a fight where people in the chat had to determine on the fly what we would hold and what we would let fall due to manpower constraints. As a Recon, I held off Chosen at the Thump Dump Watchtower for half an hour until enough reinforcements could arrive. It reminded me of the glory of Tabula Rasa. Now you can sprint through all these areas with near impunity. There is no war. There is only the grind.			"

												** If you bought a founders pack or played prior to 2015, you can claim full store credit on the spiritual successor Em8er, which is under the new company by the old CEO of Red5.  Be warned though, he was largely blamed for Firefall's death due to his mismanagement and wasteful spending of budget and resources on extremely expensive promotional rubbish while the game was far from being profitable.Game is dead, it tops out daily at ~80 people playing on Steam.Firefall had tons of promise, I bought the $100 founders pack way way back when it very first came out.  The game was good on release but plagued with lag issues and bugs which seem to persist to this day.The game got boring because promised content updates never came, and instead they kept reworking and reworking the class/combat/item/resource/pvp systems over and over removing a lot of the uniqueness.  Literally YEARS the game going through its beta phases and being released there was a pitiful amount of content added, the first dungeon instance they added was fun but it was far too little too late.I got bored of the game quickly when it came out, and I would come back every year or two and think 'how have they accomplished so little since I last played'.

												That may be a tad harsh, but this game is still in development purgatory. Constant system overhauls and removing content to ""easy fix"" sometimes non-existent issues are very common, and its likely that if you enjoy something about this game it will be gone or completely different a few months later. What was once an open sandbox has now been molded into a traditional path of ""hubs"" divided by level. A very fun dynamic invasion system in which you had to defend outposts against the main antagonists has been removed as not to disrupt this new leveling experience. The spawn rate for what are called ""ARES Missions"" has also been reduced to curb EXP gain, along with the removal or nerfing of a few other fun events. Long story short, these developers aren't capable of taking a step forward without taking two or three back. Download it, try it, but do not get invested because you WILL be let down.			"

												As a player who has ^ much gameplay time i can say that this game was one of the best for me when i started. It was something like my world and even now i remember times i played with other players and chased objectives togeather with great enthusiasm. However some stuff have been changed negatively and screwed game up. I had tons of stuff in inventory including currencies, equipement and rare items which i've worked very hard on to obtain. Now game(it seems) has been abandoned very sadly but know that red5 can return this game and it won't be a loss for them neither for community. Now i'm pretty sad for game's current state and must say with heavy heart i don't recommend it in it now. Also i remember that there was a concept about a new area which should've been the largest of all among current ones but it hasn't been added. I don't wanna see this game dead like this :(			"

												Verry laggy, badly organized events, completely bottle necked crafting system that will allways be 5-10 levels behind your character, a shooter with all the AI of your standard MMORPG that means they get in range and start shooting with perfect accuracy they dont move unless you shoot them in the head and you need  a special perk for bonus damage for headshots i was immpressed at first for all the voice acting even on the side missions but i think thats where they spent the entire budget as this game spent years in development to be hohum on a day where the servers arnt bouncing you all over the place and if you try to change servers it just redirects you to the same problem server you were on.But after a couple weeks of frustration as you see that the higher grade crafting is exacly the same as the lower grade and quests you have to quit program and log in again just to get it to load the next waypoint you start wondering why your not playing anything else anything at all			"

												While improving stability, they have yet to re-implement the random mission spawners, they've gutted the crafting system, replacing it with near meaningless RNG crafting, and have level gated their content.  In short, they started out as a ""sandbox"" style of mmo shooter, but have now turned toward the ""themepark"" style of mmo shooter.  As it stands now, with launch but a few days away, i cannot help but feel that the glory days are already in the past.			"

												Firefall left me with an excellent first impression, and I reveled in it with a small group of my friends for a week.It presented itself with immersive gameplay, as it offered a open world atmosphere, fantastic random encounters across the map, and a voiced operator that guided you along your quests. The combat was a bit bland and minimalistic, but was decent for an MMO shooter, and allowed for a swift learning experience. Team cooperation for random encounters and bosses was encouraged, and a PvE environment allowed a friendly, and helpful community to thrive.The premium currency in this game is a wonderful thing to have to quicken the rate in which you advanced through the game, but wasn't a necessity. The art style didn't knock my socks off, but it worked with their futuristic, yet sort of leisurely, and laid-back feel of the environment. It was in a Post-Apocalyptic scenario, so I wish the game's storyline would cohere with a darker, more serious tone, to prevent the game from looking like a ""Paradise Paintball"" a bunch of pre-teens would play.What disappointed me, and led to the desertion of this game that I once thoroughly enjoyed, was the lack of apparent progression. The developers seemed to have forgotten to polish some key aspects of MMO's that made them fun. Levels, new abilities, and gear did not provide any distinct differences in playstyle, and offered little pleasure in using. The game unfortunately ended up in a grind, with run-of-the-mill quests that rewarded you with a whole lot of dissatisfaction. I wanted to keep in touch with the game, by waiting for new content, but by that time, my friends were already bored, and subsequently abandoned the game.4/10. I'd recommend this game to those with a couple friends that want to fool around for a while, but is not a game you should invest a lot of time or money in.Warframe fits the same Free-To-Play, Sci-Fi niche, and offers a better arsenal of weapons and classes.

												If your looking for an experience player who went through the whole story mode and beat the game. here I am! Lets talk about the game and what it used to be. Firefall used to be a game where you and a squad of your firend or people you met along the way would explore the vast world and fight side by side until the end. Getting wonderous loot and special bounties were collected and were largely rewarded, upon be finished. The game was great through alpha and beta, it was a one of a kind game, giving us the only good game in the world that was free and had no game changing elements put into the real currency market. Firefall's market was like no other I have experienced, it was a living stock market judged solely on the players. The world price of an item could change from 100 credits to just under 37 credits in just one minute if someone wanted it to. Sometimes that did happen, and the world felt so alive with thousands of players on ech server making it almost impossible to run into someone not wanting to team up with you. Players actively traded and made group agreements through the Faction system they had and still have today. Players made the cities feel like real cities interacting with the enviroment, making large scale wars against eachother in battle arenas or entire 30 man units agianst an armada of chosen endlessly spawning in the shadows. Players would make parties for each other when special events came up, For me New years was that day, 3,500 people showed up on the server to celebrate, some had their whole family playing, some were just getting on for the first time looking for friends. It was an amazing time to play the game. Soon they limited the size of the servers to reduce lag, understandable, but soon after this reduced it even more and more and more over time. Soon only 5 people could be on a server at a time. They decrease the spawn rate on monsters, made events more controlled and less loot worhty, made the market automatically reset every day, players started dropping from the game, akmost a thousand a day until only about 150 a day were online a day. When I was playing in the good days of the game, the highest it got for players, was around 30,000 or more in one day. The highest a week later was 20,000 soon it was 600 now it's around 250.Players lost interest extensively a the 1.6 update came about. anyone who has played it knows what im talking about. 1.6 was the supposed best update to the game. we were all excited until the news of what it was, was leaked. they were changing the way upgrades worked, they were removing 32 items needed for crafting. They were removing crafting all together, and they also removed most people's progress in the game. Me personally, I lost all 6 characters I had, All around levels 25-37. I sent in a report of the problem but never got a response, all I got in return were 16 cases of equipment and a forced character change. I didn't even get to choose my new character. I was forced to be sniper. I decided to deal with it and play out the game as a sniper. Just to see if it was all that bad. at about level 15 sniper is OP. now in my sake sniper is OP after level 5, I recived a gun that could deal 2500 damage and instakill anything no mater where I hit it. At level 32 now, and I have a gun that can do around 5500 damage. I can one hit kill players by hiting them anywhere I feel like. I can kill the end game boss in three hits and can't die because of my healing. It gets boring when you can't die by anything in the game and can kill everything. So I bought something for $5 a skin. though I might as well make mysel look a little more interesting if im going to join someone's squad. guess what, I never recived the skin. contacted customer support and they said they don't offer refunds. They basically told me ""Sorry yo can't have your money even though you didn't get what you paid for! Bye forever!"" and never got a response since. If you really want to play it, make sure you have at least 5 friends to play with. it makes the game fun with friends. Don't spend money ever, because you have a chance of just being robbed. In all honesty don't play the game at all. The origonal developers have stopped developing it for about a year now. the first director that was fired from directing Firefall is now making a new game called Ember. You can look it up if you like. This new game is supposed to be what Firefall was aimed to be. with the inteanded actors that were removed from Firefall. As of reasearching the forum site they made, right now they are making concept art and taking in suggestions on what they should do for the game.(EDIT):The game has become better although the problems still persist. although the game is a lot better then when I wrote this review back then.

												I've played this game for several years now, since it was in closed beta. Back then, it was a incredible game, it was unique, I loved the open world pve features the most and being new to this genre of gaming I settled right in and wasted many hours on the game. Over the years, updates were just going backwards, with every update they were removing features that made this the unique game that it was. Now, it's pretty much the same as any other game in it's genre. It's all about levelling up your characters and that's it. They took awat crafting which was one of my favourite parts. The storyline missions were gaining more and more bugs with each update, dropship transport was introduced (great!) then removed shortly after due to more bugs. At one time, this game had huge potential, it could have been so much more than it is today, it could have had a hhuge thriving future but sadly the development team messed this up as much as they possibly could.As it stands now, the game is no longer in development. There are no developers left at the company, so I'm guessing it will continue to work in it's current form until the server money runs out whenever that may be. It really is such a shame to see such a great opportunity for a game be thrown down the trash as this one has.For anyone considering Firefall, I would suggest to wait for Em-8er which is created by Mark Kern, the genuis who came up with Firefall. Em-8er promises to be what Firefall could have been.			"

												Sadly I can no longer recommend this game after recent events.  The9 has taken ownership and it no longer resembles the vision sold to us during beta.  It's a shadow of it's former self.  You can play it absolutely free, there is several hours worth of content and campaign storyline if you wish to check it out, but beyond that it's been dumbed down and several features have been removed, such as thumping for resources in which you could craft gear.  If you're looking for a shooter game with jetpacks, this would be the closest you will get.  The combat is smooth, which is a real shame the rest of it went downhill.  Do not buy red beans or items, you will be supporting The9 which no longer cares about its players.			"

												Like just about all MMO's out there, Firefall has is an amazing game when you are leveling all the frames and stuff, hell the storyline is legit too. However, due to a lack of a raid/group finder tool, it has a terrible end-game unless you're in one of the very few hardcore clans who are pushing pvp or pve content. The saving grace for it tho is all end-game content is PUGable atm so it's not impossible hehe. ^^ Overall I give it 8.5/10!			"

												If the veterans of this game out there enjoyed any part of it before, then don't buy the early access. Everything that made this game unique and fun has been deleted so that they could make Standard MMO: Guns Edition. They killed the crafting system, killed the incentive to get new gear from non-quest sources, killed the leveling system, killed the dynamic world, killed the auction house, and killed the freedom of choice that made this game so good. If you want to play a completely generic MMO, play one with more content. If you want to shoot stuff, then pick up a shooter game. It's plain and simple.			"

I would seriously (not exaggerating in the slightest) pay 60$ or even more to play the game it was in the beta.			"

												This game use to be great before the current update. I was fond on the wepon combo's and the oddity of it. for example the mini had a shield and it was practical with the slow build up time. Now it feels more generic, and lost it's special feel. the graphics increased , but now everything is pay to play and i personally dislike it. i do enjoy the buttons to deploy thinks much faster, but now i dislike it becuse it just feels like a normal fps with space and it is pay to play. If they return the weapons to before the current update, then it would be more interesting and likable, in my opinion of course. and instead of pay to play for color or items, maybe add some repeatible missions or daily rewrds to recieve the rarer currency then just paying.

												I've never seen something like this. I've invested over 200 USD as a founder and Red 5 royally ♥♥♥♥ed up what was a unique, fun game. Make sure you take notes that people who worked at Red 5 is not to be trusted. They made an awesome Beta that felt like a tech demo, got tons of money and proceeded to slowly ♥♥♥♥ it up to the point where it is now: bugged, broken, grindy, unfun. Every time I've logged on Firefall after the Beta felt like they implemented a new level of cluster♥♥♥♥. But trying it today bordered unplayable. Nothing really makes sense as quests simply start and finish in a broken way, UI and graphics issues where there were none before, disconnects and wasted time.Never invest into Red 5 and it's chinese publisher again. A few ex-employees are gonna [fail to] make a 'spiritual successor' to it..run from it like the plague.			"

												Graphics wise the game looks great, they had added a lot more stuff to do since beta. But a lot of the things they are incorporating is going horribly wrong. They went from a pvp non-leveling system and changed it to a pve leveling system to suit F2P audiance. Yet for some reason after official launch they have kept nerfing pve aspect because of players complaining how some frames are stronger than others at pvp and now they are even tweaking more things to suit pvp. The game is in a constant state of change in which gear you think is good now, might be mediocre in the next update.I do recommend this game for players, it is a fun game if you play with friends but if you don't like a game that keeps changing things, this isn't it.

												Firefall... was fantastic. Keyword was.I was stuck on this game for the longest time, I played during the beta and was immediately hooked. Upon release, I was even more impressed with the game, the changes were awesome and it felt like almost like a new game, but with the core fundamentals in tact. It was the best MMORPG I had ever played.However, as Firefall slowly grew older and ""new content"" was released and changes were made, they destroyed it very quickly. It's not even close to the same game anymore. There are so many bugs that needed to be addressed and never were no matter how many times you and everyone else reported them.If they one day made it how it was during the open beta or on full release, I would 100% come back to this game and fully support it. But since pigs have a better chance of flying, I will have to bid farewell to Firefall.			"

												Bugs and other crap everywhere.This game used to be good back in beta but has slowly diminished into thin air, the development seems to be at an all time low and i currently dont even recommend touching it. There are some game breaking bugs that prevent progression such as the ""Crash Down"" main mission you're meant to do.The controls feel fine the movement feels rather solid but at the moment the game has had a lot of the content taken out of it like crafting and thumping, rendering your old materials useless if you've still kept them. I used to play this game pretty regularily but now i'd say avoid it. It's broken and beyond repair...			"

Leveling is a such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the job bordes are SO repetative and thumping gives only 1/4 of mission XP.

Also there are signs of Firefall becoming a p2w so beware of that, if you start playing and then get disappointed eventually. Although the new player experience is awesome and 10x better than it was b4 it still bugs me how they practically made 50% of the stuff I have crafted salvage and this is not even the 1st time this happens, because there has been numerous other migrations in the recent years.

												This game has so much potential but random pay walls, basically not play before pay, haunt it. The biggest downfall of this game is the fact that the quests/missions are not well thought out. Going 900+ meters to an objective (talk to someone) only to come all the way back (another 900+ meters) to talk to someone else then going another 500+ meters to kill 10 bugs and talk to someone else ... that's every quest that I've run into and it's horrible. Great potential as mentioned, but not well executed at all.			"

												The moment you play this game, they quickly try to get your immersed in their universe by getting you to jump straight into their story campaign. The game then quickly gives you insight to each class and have you choose one to begin the campaign. Despite giving brief desciption, you do get a sense of lost on how truely worth wild some weapons/class are more than others. In most cases, I ended up using the AOE type gun because the mobs move around so fast and I'm spinning around looking for them because they might be going after your buddies or some stranger behind you then at the bottom of your feet, you got alien roaches poking you and you don't really know until they hit you because they are small and jump at random targets sometime. Being ammo based(you can replenish it with several ways), if you're not accurately skilled at aimming, you could be ending up wasting a lot of ammo. A lot of times when I shoot monsters, the whole feel of it doesn't feel right because I shoot, they stop, twitch then die and I'm standing there wondering wtf just happened.In one quest I had to go blow up some reactors or something in some enemy base? Base is empty, I freely walked through, then random enemies spawned that I quickly took out. SO BORING. Killing Hogger was more fun.Customizing your character is a bit lack luster, I wasn't impressed at the choices they offered. Their guns, although look different when compared to the next, didn't give that same feel like when you play other games like WoW. Getting stuff like a Thunderfury even though its subpar when compared to higher tier items like warglaives, is still a great vanity and awesome weapon to have around. Firefall, to me, all weapons look and feel the same to an extent or using the same template thats altered for unique-ness sake.Didn't understand upgrading much either and I got lost pretty easily. Because its so open world, you can get lost pretty fast when you're new or just traveling is a chore unless you use the glider. I found myself bumping into things way more than I would like. With other MMO, despite being less opened, players aren't likely to get lost or get caught somewhere like between two rocks under a hut and is not quite stuck yet not loose enough to get free. With enough patience, you could find fast routes.The quest though important for certain game mechanics, seems pointless and falls off the cliff of being side tracked. Placed me in an important military group only to make me run dumb errands like finding someone's husband? Hello?! I'm a elite warrior thats going to save humanity! Ain't nobody got time for this sheez! I didn't bother reading nor care what I was getting. I didn't understand the point at all. I felt very lost, out of placed and out of context when it comes to syngery or immersion in this huge epic story to save humanity. Didn't make me want to play more to unlock stuff. For a FPS type MMOG, I don't know how well it'll do. If any of you played Tabula Rasa, I felt more immersed into that game than this one and you had to walk everywhere... EVERYWHERE! Too bad it had some short comings it didn't fix in time. Hopefully Firefall gets back on track. There's some pretty embarasing and funny bugs and glitches that im surprised they didn't fix. As of now, I'm lost, bored, not caring much about the main/side story. Looking at the battleframes and such, I don't think my time will be of any worth investing either. It's a shame. Being how old WoW is, I still considered it one of the top tier games atm and they executed it very well. Only reason it's not as popular now is because people want something fresh. Some might contest because they like their ""FREE MMO"". Nothing tops SWG, pre Combat Patch. Give it to SOE for screwing up an amazing game like that.			"

												This game was fun in Closed Beta, if a bit bare and in need of content.  However, with the launch coming up, some major improvements have been made; it's almost a completely different game.  Definitely worth re-downloading if you've been in the game before to give it another try.  If you haven't played before, then you're in for a treat.I'm currently lvl 30 (out of 40), so I can't comment on the late game, but the first 3/4ths have been quite enjoyable.			"

												I liked it when I started playing, I got friends into it, and I came back recently to see what had changed. Think of it like this, you just built a castle with Legos, right? And Lego comes in and removes 90% of the pieces so you're left with only yellow bricks and 2 or 3 people. Crafting has been gone for a while now, after a bit of research. Some of the classes in the videos on the Steam Page are actually removed. I feel like the map has actually shrunk? The few team things left to do are monotonous and I don't like the game anymore. So, if you want to give it a try, the shell of what is left has a lot of potential and is a great weekend high if you're looking for something to do for a few days. It looks nice, but it gets old very quick and what you do at the start is essentially the same thing as the end game. There is no development or advancement in mechanics beyond a PvP region.I believe the best thing going for this game -RIGHT NOW- is that it's F2P. It is pretty, though.			"

												To the people reviewing the game: you are reviewing THIS BUILD, not the beta previously.Having played since CBT I can safely say that this is the Firefall we were promised so many E3s ago. They finally gave up on the silly esports and pseudo-EVE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and decided that if they wanted to be a fun shooter MMO they should just focus on being a fun shooter and a fun MMO- and Firefall is both. The beta builds were infamous for being a boring, repetitive grindfest but the public release is the exact opposite. It feels more like playing an open-ended campaign from start to finish than a traditional MMO. The equipment is simple but you have a lot of control over your gear. The content is plentiful, varied, and fun. The art is astonishing, and makes the game very easy on the eyes.If you ever wanted a Borderlands-style MMO, this is what you've been waiting for.Don't buy the negativity, try it for yourself. People have every right to be bitter, but not to lie about the state of the game.			"

												I bought into the hype to the cool price of a hundred buxx. Since the founders' packs days, they've hit the hard reset on this ""endless beta"" at least two-too-many times. I have not played on over a year, and I am almost certain whatever I had since last time is gone. Resources and equipment have been bounced back and forth, and nothing lasts. Even in the first year, the $100 worth of premium currency wasn't enough to get everything they had released by the next. There were even two phases of ""old currency;"" alpha and beta Crystite. Did you log in to exchange your alpha for beta in the proper window? No? It's gone.The community was always very loose and cliquey. More than 80% of my game time is looking for a group to do literally anything, at any level. Thumping was all the rage for the first month, and by the next year, you just had random people flying around, looking to killsteal from solo thumpers. You could not escape this then, but if the game really is dead now, maybe I can mineral-farm this-here space rock in peace.			"

												The world of firefall is really interesting and beautifully designed. However that is all this game has going for it atm.I played this game a year ago and quit because it had nothing to do outside of senseless grinding (you grinded for items to help you when you grind. There was no real goal in the game and nothing grinding took you too unless it was to level up your battle frames for a new battleframe). Came back to it today and was introduced to a large amount of major bugs that completely ruined the game for me already.Bugs i've encountered from today:-Key commands randomly stop working, only way to fix this is to relog your character. Sometimes the esc menu key command stops working and you have to force close the client to exit the game... (this bug alone makes the game not worth playing, its a bug that seems to happen frequently)-Items fall through the map, some quests require you to pick up and transport items, if you throw them (which you have to sometimes if you need to pull out your gun to defend yourself) the items will sometimes fall through the map forcing you to either restart or give up the quest.-Quests dont work, (for some reason they believed that the quests in the game should not be a part of the client folders when you download firefall. Instead every quest has to load from their servers each time you want to do one, and it doesnt even load the whole quest at once, it loads a part of it then waits till you finish the loaded part till it will start downloading the next part. The problem is at times it will get stuck ""loading"" and prevent you from continuing on in the quest.-Uncontrolled enemy spawns (not a bug just a dumb decision by the devs). Enemies can spawn infinitely from spawn pods resulting in 50+ enemies piled together in areas. The only way to get rid of them is to kill the them all. The only way to kill them all is with a group of people (good luck with that though since this game has a population of 20 if feels like) or you have to be 10-20 levels higher than the enemies.I want this game to succeed i'm sure a lot of people do but i really doubt it will. They added new content, i havnt tried it yet. But the amount of bugs i encountered from 1 day of playing has already made me hate this game again. Maybe in another year if this game can somehow survive, it might be worth looking at. For now you can have a lot more fun elsewhere. "

												Yep, it's awesome. Firefall was in development for over 4 years, and the results are just amazing. As someone that found out about it in 2011 and joined the Closed Beta soon after, I have to say it's been a rocky ride. The official launch is just the beginning, and much like EVE Online back in the day, this universe will be expanding. All in all, if you like running, jumping, jetting, flying, riding bikes and shooting stuff, and getting rewarded for it, (like 'Pandora', but it's actually Future Earth) this one is well worth a look.

Quite frankly I agree it's boring, nothing but grinding if you don't want to pay for the good stuff and if you do? GUESS WHAT? MORE GRINDING! never got to do Pvp and it's never really been my thing in MMO's either but all in all, nothing special I would look at anyone else's reviews as a Beta tester and just sit there and envy the real FireFall that I was so pumped for.So yeah really if you want a decent MMOFPS? go back to Planetside 2, or better yet Borderlands since this game feels like it was copying it as an MMO and failed.

The game doesn't feel finished or very unique in any way besides the environments. You spent the majority of your time doing the same few sets of side missions until you level enough to complete a story mission, then new side missions come and you repeat the process. The weapons all look the same and there are only 4 player abilities per class. You don't feel like your working towards much in the game besides progressing through the story.

In this group You will find 3 types of Engineers, the same number of Assaluts,Biotech and snipers and 4 types of heavy minigun and tanky Dreadnaught.+ First or Third person look, You can choose however You want.+ Multipe numbers of mini and huge world events, starting on Bandit Camps and ending o7n Melding Tornados. That mean you will work with players from all world.+ Really really really expanded crafting, for me the best untill this time in MMO games.+ All dungeons were created with a brain and nice dynamic fight.+ Wonderful graphic and good optimalization...-  ...but sometimes there is a bug when player falling under the ground and only reset game help.- In world some mobs and computers are not wise I can tell they are just typical idiots ( in dungeons or special events that thing dont affect ), they react after few seconds when I start attack them.So to sum up... I would give this game 8/10 ( The best free to play MMO ) it is a pattern for all games depend on free to play model. Beautifle graphic,good animations,tens of thousand players in game,interesting like for mmo game quests,nice crafting and vibrant world. Really recommended for all players looking for free shooter.If You enjoy this review leave a hand up or comment for me:)  Just one click will make happy for all day.			"

												The game feels like a joke. There's nothing to it. All the missions are the same. All the guns feel more overpowered than anything ever. Seriously, no gun physics. Overall it's a good game. But it's lacking details that make a good game great. It tries to strive for too much at the same time though. It wants you to hold it up to WoW, and all the other MMOs and say ""WOW! This is it, this is the greatest MMO ever."" When it's not.			"

 ---DEVS, YOU NEED TO FIX THIS ASAP!!!--- 1 Heart-broken gamer/10 So... I haven't played this game in a long while. But when I saw the Rocketeer DLC I got hyped about playing the game once more. So I installed the game again and bought several DLC Packs actually. I was really looking forward to playing my awesome Engineer once more.So I start the game and watch that awesome trailer where this group of ARES Pilots gets attacked by Araneas, amongst other things, while defending their Thumper. The trailer brings back sweet memories of all the awesome combat I've had with my Engineer. The Engineer quickly changes weapons on her wrist-mounted device and kicks ♥♥♥ etc. It's sooo awesome.So then I eventually get into the game only to find it almost completely redone!! (in my eyes atleast...)- The story is remade as far as I can tell... - The equipment/gear is completely changed. The armor looks reaaaally clunky and unbalanced... - But the most noticable change? I no longer have a wrist-mounted secondary gun.... I hold it in my fri**** hands... why?The wrist-mounted version was soo awesome.... why change that? That's what made the Engineer stand out from the other classes... - And the visual design on the Engineer/Bastion isn't even the same as the trailer anymore... that made me reaaaally pi****!... I mean how can you have the original trailer and not have the original visuals on the fri**** Engineer?! Not happy, not happy at all.... I won't be recommend this game to my friends anymore... not until this ""bug"" gets fixed...This is like what Blizzard did to WoW all over again.... sigh... why mess up a perfecly good game guys? come on... please... don't take this game away from me too... I used to love this game.... :(			"

												If you're like me and keep waiting for a FPS MMO, this game was perfect.  Sadly it's dying, and the lack of support hardly makes up for the free to play price.  The number of times you'll come across broken, bugged, or just plain missing content while trying to work through the game are enough to take the fun out, and the list keeps growing.  Server outages and login errors are more and more common, and the game just ""misplaced"" my 42 level character.  If you're new to the game like I was, you'll find that most of the google search results are from defunct forums, leaving you to guess at most features/missions.Despite all the frustrations (and let's not downplay that) I still think that if R5 maintained even a minimal support staff this game could be fun.  But in it's current state I can't recommend Firefall as anything but an aggravating endeavor, and the hospice care support means things will only get worse.			"

												Simply put, this game is absolutely nothing like it used to be. It was fantastic in beta... I played the hell out of it, somewhere in the ballpark of 400 hours or so. Arguably the best MMOFPS I have played to date, and I stopped playing it about three years ago. I spent money on this game, and that is something I never, ever do with free to play titles.I downloaded it again, tried to give it another shot... I just couldn't do it. It didn't even feel the same. This was after release, and especially after the most game-degrading update made to it since it became available publically. My fears were confirmed. You got greedy. You got lazy.Congratulations, Red 5 Studios. You not only wasted my time, but yours, and countless others who are also sitting here wondering what the hell you were thinking.During Closed/Open Beta:  9.5/10After release: 4/10 (after the lastest update.. Pft. Maybe a 2/10.)			"

												The fact it can run on a PC as bad as mine with medium quality and still look beautiful gives it a graphics rating of 10 of 10 in my opinion. I have been a Firefall player since the first days of closed beta. Anyone that tries it now wont believe that back then there was only missions, thumping (the resource gathering), and invasions/watchtower fights. They have furthered the experience one can have on Firefall through a Campaign that I give 9.5 out of 10.  The adding of leveled npcs and the leveling of battleframes will take some getting used to for me but hey, its still fun.  I highly recommend this to any serious PvE player. The NPCs get a 10/10 despite the glitches (which make it 10/10 because they are almost always hilarious). The developers of the game often play alongside the players and I have the honor of having two said developers on my friends list. Overall I give this game 9.7/10 for enjoyable campaign, fun PvE combat, seasonal events, the motorcycles (known to us Firefall gamers as LGVs), and the like. Also one more note: Have your friend(s) play with you for a more enjoyable experience. I am normally a ""lone wolf"" on some games, but on Firefall its a lot more fun and memorable with friends. I cant count how many times I stood shoulder to shoulder with fellow ARES pilots in a squad fighting the antagonist faction known as the Chosen. The game still has some issues however, but they are working more and more each and every day to fix them. Should you read this review and try it, I want to recommend you possibly look around as soon as your in for a teacher on the various functions of the game. The game isnt hard to learn, but many will have questions. Just type ""/z Hey I am new"" and people will welcome you with friendly greetings. If im ever on when you try it, I can lend a hand! Just type /addfriend Cyberwolf309 and then type /w Cyberwolf309 and tell me who you are and ill help~  One last thing is customization. You can earn and buy cosmetics for your character and frame, and use general customizations such as accent, hairstyle, etc. If you dont try this game, you are missing out!			"

												To be honest, the things that made me try this game out were the fact that some of my friends recommended it to me and that Yahtzee said that ""combat was fun"". Otherwise I wouldn't even notice it.Firefall is a futuristic MMO/shooter hybrid. After some meteorite hit Earth and everything went to hell, the humanity managed to survive, the player is some kind of mercenary, and whatnot, typical MMO stuff, or so it seems at first. The plot is actually quite good, at least when it comes to missions you take from job boards, which create certain story arcs, some of them even interesting. The voice acting is surprisingly very well-done, and it's a pleasure to listen to dialogues and whatnot. And then we get to gameplay...At the very beginning, we are given five battleframes, or classes of sorts: Dreadnaught who's slow but has tons of health, can put up shields and uses a huge minigun, Assault with a launcher that deals splash damage, high speed and mediocre defenses, Engineer who puts up sentry guns and disp-er, I mean supply stations, Biotech who heals and uses a needle gun, and Recon who's the fastest but also the weakest class, sporting a machine gun with a scope and huge range (TF2 counterparts would be Heavy, Soldier/Demoman, Enginner [duh], Medic and Scout/Sniper). Granted, those classes have ""upgrades"" or rather different battleframes that work similarly but use slightly different weapons and abilities, but those have to be unlocked by maxing out battleframe levels (they max out at 40). Fortunately, unlike other games where you pick a class and stick to it for the rest of the game, you can switch battleframes at every battleframe station. They level up separately, though.Now, let's get to the combat. You can freely switch between TPS and FPS modes (the former being easier to see what's going on around you, the latter being easier to aim). Enemies usually try to swarm you or run around and shoot you, and there are also special variations of enemies - bigger, stronger ones, exploding suicide bombers, freeze ones that slow you down if they are killed in your vicinity... this makes for a huge variety of different opponents you'll face. You can also use jet boots and jet packs mounted onto your battleframe to take off into the air and shoot enemies from there. The combat is fast-paced and full of action, and makes for a pretty fun experience.You can grind out your levels (as is usually the case in MMOs), but what I really like is the fact that there's tons of quests that can be repeated. Also, killing enemies doesn't really give that much experience points, the bulk of it will come from completed quests. This is a good thing, as grinding while doing quests feels much better than just grinding. It gives you a sense of purpose other than seeing virtual numbers increment.What is really good, though, is the fact that you will see some events going on around the area - some broken equipment ready to be repaired, other players trying to mine resources and defending the mining machine from monsters etc. Nothing stops you from joining in and helping out, and it lies in your best interest, as you will gain experience or resources of your own. That was a very pleasant surprise, as it's rare to see a MMO that actively encourages co-op.However, this game doesn't come without its downsides. The combat and gameplay might be fun, but in the end, it still comes to just grinding stuff out. At least it's a pleasure to grind out stuff, most of the time. Also, this game tends to be glitchy at points, and not all of those glitches are of the ""fun"" variety. I gotta admit, this game is still better programmed than some other ones I've seen before...Overall, this is a good MMO and game overall (which is saying something, considering I usually loathe grindfests). Obviously, the game is most fun when played together, but solo play is good, too, especially that you'll frequently come across other players with whom you will cooperate to achieve common goals.

												Set in the future this is a First Person Shooter Massive Online Role Playing Game.  Its free to play with an option to get a subscription or to buy the subscription in game.  This is not a bad game it features many dynamic events and also has the usual generic job board for more missions.  You can at anytime go and help other people doing things around the map.One draw back people claim is bad is the in-ability to join with friends...this is false....you can join at anytime by simply deciding to teleport to them.  There is a mod that was released that supposedly helps but does not....as it simply does what you can already do in game....the mod also messes up chat channels, teaming and bunch of things.Contrary to posts the game isnt very buggy...it uses high resolution graphics that are impressive thus a weak system might have some trouble...so that means the biggest complainers on steam should avoid this game.This game isnt boring and there is alot to do....although weirdly a huge percentage of the player base....seam to just wander around the low level areas.....and get mad when you go to one of the open events and help do them....as they believe they are losing too much of the reward....even though they outlevel the event anywise by alot.I found after a while it was interesting...i went to new areas and found very odd things....aliens and monsters....and found a huge amount of the player base not going to the areas....instead they where too busy in chat complaining about being bored in low level areas....ironic.Anywise i find this game fun and i think people should give it a try.  Its free to play and is different then most games.			"

												I've been playing FIrefall for a spell now, probably a little more than a month.  I was looking for a fun RPG to play, and came across it browsing Steam.  I have enjoyed this game immensely, getting to know the crafting, jobs, instances, and world events.Firefall has a lot of different stuff to do, though as many other reviews bring up, sometimes it can get a bit grindy(what with 16 or so frames to level).  That being said, there's a decent community on Firefall, and it's a lot of fun to run with other people in a squad, really letting you see the different classes work together.  The Types(classes) all feel different, and the Advanced Frames have some pretty fun changes, such as the Mammoth's ability to teleport, or the Raptor's Powerfield.It's not perfect, sometimes the job boards can take a while to load objectives, and sometimes the UI doesn't work.  While it might not be the best to say at least they have a quickfix(/rui) that usually corrects it... but hey, at least there's that.  The devs are still active, working on game systems and fixing issues as they can.  In fact, I even have gotten the chance to go on a run with a dev, which was super neato.All in all, I've really enjoyed this game's feel, from the combat which can often be intense and fast-paced, the myriad of events going on, and the variety of ways to play with the different Types and Frames.  Oh, and it's all voice acted, from all the job boards to the Campaign instances.Looking for something fun and free, give Firefall a try :)			"

												FireFall is a open world MMO first and third person shooter what is skill based. All fighting in the game, be it PVE or PVP, is all 3 dimensional as every player have jumpjets and different enemies fly or hide underground. Each archtype (class) of battleframes plays differently from each other and can accommodate a large variety of different playing styles. You can easlies be the long wolf or the leader of an army. The would is alive as missions and randomed events can happen anywhere at anytime, because of this you are always going into the unknown when traveling or fighting.There many stories to be told and found thoughout the world. Just because it seems like the end of the world people are not going to stop being people. The personal lifes and drama people have to deal with day to day just doesn't go away because the looming threat that everyone be killed at a moment's notice. Help out survivors learn their stories and maybe learn more about what is happen behind the scenes.			"

												This was a great game. Then, they ""improved it"". It is now a crap game.  The game still has bugs which have been there since release. Rather than address these, the devs completely revamped the game in other ways and basically dumbed the whole thing down.  They claim the recent ""improvements"" were down to community feedback, yet I am unable to find many members of the community who agree. Think Star Wars Galaxies if you recall that game. It was an awesome in-depth game that required at least a bit of intelligence and commitment to achieve anything, then came the ""new game enhancements"" which dumbed the whole game down so that even a 5 year old console player wouldnt be put off. This is the same thing. There's one simple rule with games, and many other things- If it aint broken, don't fix it. Or feck it up in this case. After 100+ hours of playing, I can't see me reinstalling this ever.			"

												Edited review for 1.6:The game has undergone drastic changes, and overall I find them to be very healthy for the game.  We have several new ways to hone our abilities, and grow stronger, to improve on our skill as a whole, while not overshadowing other players completely in the process.  Firefall is now a game about building yourself up for a fight that you can eventually win, and that's the fun of it.  The journey is there, and it is long.  It's fun.  It's exciting to share it with others.  And overall, I feel everyone who enjoys a shooter with MMO mechanics will love this game.The graphics are beautiful for their style, offering a unique look from the drab ""Realistic"" we see every day.  The game performs well, with constant optimizations that have made the game play well even under hectic firefights.  The gameplay is solid, with missions being straightforward, and although at times shooter mechanics can be repetitive, the combat stays fresh because you can easily switch to other classes on the fly, rather than having to deal with multiple characters or accounts.This is the MMORPGShooter that the world deserves.  Enjoy it!			"

												If you like third person shooters you should most definetly give this a try. Its not a deep game with lots of intricate game play and deep stats. What it is though is a heck of a lot of fun to play. Jump in and go guns blazing. You can play for hours jumping from thing to thing but its also very easy to get in and play for little snippets since most events are only 5-10 minutes long. And Jet Packs. . . who doesn't love Jet Packs?! I keep waiting to get tired of them and just don't. I think many will disagree with me but I also find the game to be very well optimized. I can be on screen with about 20-30 other players and at 30-50 mobs with all sorts of abilites and effects going off and have very little FPS drop. The game is able to dynamically downgrade your quality to keep FPS up which is a nice feature. It could be that it is not that well optimized and its this feature kicking in that does the trick, but honestly, I'm not focused on textures when I am hopping around like mad trying to blast baddies.Its also a pretty good F2P model. You can reasonably get everything you want in game given enough time, and the time spent isn't even that egregious. The main things people will want in the store are new frames and transportation. The frames can be obtained by leveing one of the free frames which gives you the ability to unlock a new one for free and so on. The transportation is really something you need to spend money on. You can get a free LGV (motor cycle) at level 25 but thats a pretty long way in and single use gliders will just get frustrating. The company has to make money somewhere so I think this is a good trade off. The other thing to buy is cosmetic stuff but that in no way is required and is just fluff.			"

												So this is my own personal review/feedback/whatever on Firefall as it stands right now at release. At the time of writing this, I have clocked 500 hours on the release version of Firefall, along with 62 days since it went. It’s based on my last few weeks playing, levelling lower frames from New Eden and beyond, taking on Titan bosses, campaign, etc, etc. Feel free to leave your thoughts or replies here, but like I said, this is my opinion on the game, yours may differ.Review was written 9th August 2014, Firefall build V1.0.1793.Story 6/10The story and lore behind Firefall is really quite good. It’s not just your standard end of the world survival or fantasy game that 90% of the market seems to be flooded with. It’s a great change of pace, the campaign storyline, be it a little short is engaging and I find its biggest issue is the lack of real character development since virtually every character you talk to once or twice, and then never see, or hear of them again. There are a few exceptions to this, like Aero, your operator for example who you will be with your entire Firefall career and Hobbes from the campaign, The Meddler from ARES Jobs but nothing sticks out long enough, or gets enough explanation to make me care about them, their backstory, it just leaves me thinking what a missed opportunity to dive into the Firefall universe. Sure, we don’t need to know about that one random farmer you helped retrieve a bracelet or something, but when it’s a character, really out of the ordinary, like the Meddler for instance, it really would be good to see their backstory.As you progress in Firefall, the story changes considerably. You start out as a brand new player in town, so you get the low work, collect this, collect that, etc. Once you start to gain the trust of the Accord and fractions though, you are allowed to move on to higher level work, like sensitive data recovery, target elimination. The story really does do an excellent job of keeping you interested in the world, since unlike most characters, Firefall gives you loads of lore, backstory, etc about the world you are living and fighting in. Moving thought the zones, the story is consistent, and gradually builds up from simple tasks to moving on to fight the Chosen in an all-out war with strikes, kidnappings, ambushes, etc.I am really looking forward to chapter two and beyond for the campaign arcs, if the first one is anything to go by, Firefalls story is only just getting started. Based on what I have seen, I personally rate the story a 6/10. Whilst it is very fun and engaging, the missed opportunity of lack of character development and very short nature of the Campaign overall is a huge downside, once the next chapters come out, I would very much hope I can improve this rating.Graphics 8/10One of Firefalls strongest points is its beautiful world. Coral Forest has vast open beaches to rocky cliff faces, to lush forest. Sertao is a rocky desert with dust storms, mountains and small areas of forest more inland. Devils Tusk is on an island covered with lava from erupting volcanos. These are just the zones that players will travel through and they really give the game a sense of vastness and beauty. Playing on Ultra, this game is out of this world.Firefall has this very unique art style, I can’t quite place my finger on it but it’s like a mix of Manga and Borderlands and to be frank, it’s something that works really well. This game is not designed to be hyper realistic like say Crysis is, but not completely out of the ordinary, like Borderlands goes for.My only problem is in some places, textures really are stretched out, ruining and scene. There also are quite a few spots where a texture goes into another, and you can clearly see how one is higher resolution compared to the other. Now this could be down to the way Firefall streams in textures as it needs them, as a player with a slow internet connection, I cannot give the game huge bandwidth to download textures, and there is no way to just download them from a launcher or via Steam.I personally rate the graphics of Firefall to be an 8/10, the only reason I drop marks for it is because in those patches where graphics suck, it just ruins the experience for me. I would like to think in the future, we can see more detailed models, textures, etc being rolled out and any areas where it is a little off can be patched.Sound 7/10Firefalls sound when just shooting, running around, etc is average at best. Pretty much every gun of the same variation sounds the same, no matter how good or bad it is, and most sound assets which you hear early on, you will likely hear again, and again, and again.What really saves the audio for Firefall is its voice acting and its background music. The voice acting for some is really hit and miss, some characters sound really out of place, but overall they do a great job of sucking you into the world, and it’s really nice to see that a AAA MMO went for full voice acted missions, on every job, campaign mission, NPC, etc. For some, this isn’t a huge issue, but for me I really like to have the story read out and brought to life, this is what Firefall does very well.The background music in Firefall, or its entire OST for that matter is nothing short of amazing. My favourite piece is from the first campaign mission, Crash Down. Sometimes I will want to go and play that mission just to hear that music again and again! I find that even 500 hours in, I love having background music at full volume still, something on many other games I find myself muting due to its repetitive nature or just average music. I rate the sound of Firefall a 7/10. Whilst many assets are used far too often, the voice acting and the background music and OST I would rate as a 10/10 on their own. Props to the composers and musicians involved in Firefall! On a side note, the OST from buying a starter pack seems to be missing many of the music scores used within Firefall, very disappointing but with a quick search, I’m sure you can turn up the entire music score online.Continued here: http://forums.firefallthegame.com/community/threads/kuros-review-feedback-of-firefall-1-0.4770821/ Review too long for Steam			"

I understand that bugs are bound to happen but not a game freeze that I can't even close with the task manager having to restart my entire PC is awful and I'm not gonna waste my time trying to troubleshoot it if I have to restart my PC every single time.

												Firefall had so much potential from day one (but then a ♥♥♥**** ran off with all the money or thats what we have been told happened) Then the game development only gone the wrong way to the failure it is today from a game that was based on Co-up in from of Thumper and tons of mobs you should protect your Thumper from which were so groundbreaking in gameplay that it was something new that has not been seen before in that scale and it just workt so incredibly good that we were so disappointed when they removed the idea that you had to thump for materials to craft gear and weapons and then they spit us right in the face bay not lissing to our feedbacks and (ruin) a great game so now us old gamers really feel we have wasted our money on what we ultimately had seen many times before! (If the game gos back to the old idea off Thumping for materials to craft gear and weapons it will win alot old players back + give us something for what we have used time, money and hard work on) Hope for the future of FF ?If I can recommend the game? Not at this point! But we never know what the future may bring!!			"

												Were do i begin, was a big lover of this game, but only before this new update, after a month or three of waiting for them to fix the ability to just log in (yes thats right i could not get past the log on due to been stuck on a loop trying to clam lost battle frames).After finaly logging in and been able to play the game, I find that I have lost many battle frames(one from each section totaling 5 lost, which equals loads of in game hours playing upgrading etc etc), a loss of all secondary fire for main weapons(except a few that they had to keep), but for some frames/classes you now have lost the one fire method that made the class fun, (IE detonating bombs, posion and many others).  For me these are the big ones, no fun trying to aim at every target, might as well play COD or some other first person shooter...think the devs lost a lot of focus on what they had.They have also, well looks like... down graded(changed) the graphics in expotions and bullets shooting quality of what looked good, to some form of what is almost comical. Lost abilityz / equipment that owned.  By the sounds of things items purchased from real money for to own, are now only reanted( not sure on that as haven't played enough to see what will happen and wont be playing much at all).Devs had a great thing going and was kind of looking forward to new things but they should have made a new game rather than make this one crappy.  maybe in 2020 when the next change happens thay can make it more like the old and I will play again.  why do these game makes take steps bacwards and ignore feedback for a quick buck return is any body guess.   well I guess this leave me with more me time and to find a better game that the garbage they have now created.Now in saying all that you may love this new version, might be great to play if you never played the old one, there is still some great aspect to the game like jet packs and walking about shooting stuff, but its not even a shaddow of what it could have been in the derection they took...sry devs a big thumbs down from me.

												It's a good game to have time to kill until Destiny comes out. The game is kind of generic, repetitive, and has bunches of fetch quests. There is no unique story to these quests you do, you don't care about any of the characters or whatnot. You just do them for the xp to eventually move onto similar regions. The shooting mechanics are fun and better than Defiance, but still feels a bit floaty compared to other shooters. AND WHAT IS WITH ALL THESE BUGS!? They are 90% of the game's enemies!If your like me, a hardcore FPS gamer trying to get into MMOs. Don't bother with this game unless your curious. Just stick playing with Destiny when it comes out.

Next our lord and saivor Gaben will announce Half Life 3.Okay now for the Elephant in the room, Yes that game have been through development hell that will make Duke Nuken and AliensCM look good. the Ex CEO tried to Kill this game and in trying so he ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off a large portion of beta/founders. You can see them here trying to scare us Steam newbies away from this game. Now it seems thay have simplifyed many features, crafting is one of them. Before you could mix adn match materials to effect the stats, you can't do that now which is sad.till level 24 you have to hoof it on your feet or gliders. you can either buy a bike for like $20 or get lucky and get a one use bike from a vendor that give's you randome items.Now to mine metals to craft you need ""Thumpers' there are two kinds one for 1-2 players and another for 4-5. these reward those who help defend the even if you stumble across them.I say give it a try all it will cost you is time and download.I'll update as i go along.

												I've put roughly 180 hours into Firefall so far. I say so far because I can see me putting in a whole lot more. Now I can see why people wouldn't like this game. Yes it has bugs (other than the ones you kill). Yes sometimes mission objectives don't load & you have to restart the mission again. Some times enemies just vanish while your shooting them. But having played a lot of this over the last 2 weeks I can say that there is a lot more to this game which will outway the glitches & bugs.So how is this different to any other MMO? Well apart from being a FPS or 3rd person shooter not much really. It has the same go kill this for this reward quest system. It has instances. It has raids. You find better gear to increase your character to be better for end game content. You can farm missions for resources and currency. You grind to get certain items. So pretty much the same story as any MMO. Well yes. But there are a few things that make this game stand out from the others. The dynamic world events are always ongoing. You will not be left standing around very often with nothing to do. From killing death teams to fighting for control of a thumper (machine used to extract resources from the ground). There is always something going on. I know other games such as Guild Wars 2 offer world events but not on the same scale as Firefall. The fighting in this game feels great. Feels like a really good FPS or 3PS. It feels like it should. I personally play in First Person and really enjoy jumping around dodging snipers and plasma cannons trying to shoot me down as I fire thermal rounds burning everything in sight. Its a lot of fun.Thats this games biggest asset. FUN. Yes it can be played seriously in a group in a raid situation. And yes if you roll in to a group instances under geared your probably going to be getting some abuse from the other players. But if you gear up properly you and your friends can have a lot of fun blasting away the enemy using plasma cannons, thermal cannons, poison shots, grenades, bombs and more. It can get really hetic. I would recommend this game to people who enjoy MMO's. This is not a pick up and play FPS. There is crafting and researching and levelled gear which you would normally find. So if your a MMO player give this a go. Yes its rough around the edges but its always being updated, theres tons to do and in a group its a hell of a lot of fun. It's also free to play (and can be played for completely free. Only real money is used for vanity items & VIP status which gives you a xp, money and reputation boost.)			"

												Extremely fun game to play for a little while, I was fully expecting microtransactions and that's fine - if it's vanity purposes. But, this is pretty blatant pay to win/pay to get ahead with a ""VIP status option"". Huge turn off along with some buggy quest I decided to uninstall it.Personally anything that speeds up the game the earning process by doing the exact same thing some one who isn't paying is, in my book, pay to win. I realize some disagree with faction reputation gains and EXP being pay to win: but it is to me, sorry.If you're not bothered by the P2W aspect, you're likely to enjoy it if you're a FPS and/or Borderlands fan.

												I have gotten into level 28+ so this is what i think of so far.TL;DR : The game is a walking simulator early until you get into level 25, Credits are getting easier, Thumping is useless and after the area is depleted you need to find a new one that has 60% materials that's hard to find and most of your party member left when its depleted. There is no more exploring when you reach level 25, They fix the quest with 30% more rewards when finishing a quest, but it's still a god-damn grindfest. It's still not recommended at the moment, but when they already ""Fixed"" these problem, i will come back to this review.OLD TL;DR : The game is a walking simulator, getting money is hard, thumping is useless after the update, generic questline. The gameplay is fun, thumping is fun, sometimes you gotta do exploring, and the game feels like Borderlands.			"

												I played this game a while back when it was in beta, and it was...tolerable. Saw it got fully released, didn't initially want to play it. My friends started playing it. I got bored. Downloaded Firefall after a week with hopes of playing games with them. The only thing we ever did was add each other as friends.Didn't wait for me to catch up in level. Didn't switch to a new battleframe (can do it at will for free) until I was the same level as their main battleframe. Nothing.The game is terrible and lackluster and a massive walking simulator for ""the first 20 levels"" as it was put to me by multiple people, friends and otherwise. They claim it revolves around ""dynamic events."" I barely encountered any at all. The Thumper minigame you can do is the only way you can have anything resembling a ""dynamic event."" Even that is terrible. No one joins in. Nothing. The only time I ever saw other players was in the main city. The game's idea of objectives (if you're doing missions from the job board) being ""near"" each other is have one objective 1km away in one direction, and then 2km in the opposite if there are multiple objectives.The art style is appealing only to those with a sense of style comparable to a 12 year old's.Overall, I cannot recommend this game. Not a single bit. How people find it to be enjoyable is completely beyond me.On a positive note, the soundtrack is good.			"

												I've been playing this off and on for 2 years, it took them forever to get out of beta but I gotta say I always loved this game.With the launch on the 29th of july here they finally added and changed things that always kept me from enjoying this game hardcore. A smooth leveling experience now, less focus on PVP and PVE missions, stories and instances and a much more ease of access crafting system.the world is gorgeous the hardsuits are fun and each has a different playstyle and I would honestly call this the PVE answer to APB being pvp. if you hate player vs player but love shooter mmos and enjoy exploring..this game might be for you.the cash store is filled with quick ways to level(nothing pay to win) ease access hardsuits(you can earn them in game leveling) and tons of fun cosmetics. the only real cons I can think of, I get motion sick on my bike xD and sometimes the combat feels a little jerky. But all in all a fantastic solid game with of course the odd bug and glitch but well worth it.			"

Product received for free
												Firefall was one of the most saddening trainwrecks of a game that could have been absolutely beautiful. I played since closed beta, was a founder, and spent a ridiculous amount of time on this game pre-steam. Every time I go to check back in on it and possibly come back, I hear about yet another wipe. Yet another core system change. I  played thorugh probably 3 tree wipes, weapon system redesigns, etc. They kept changing their mind on things right after people got fully used to the new system. It's absoutely unreal and if you want a good stable game that you can eventually learn everything in and not have to worry, this isn't it. Odds are they will rework an entire system every few months like it seems they've continued to do. And then you have to re-learn and re-grind. This game was so golden when it first released and in beta. I don't know why red had to kill it.			"

												This game has gone through some changes over it's long development period, but the absolute core component has remained in the game throughout, and that is the fun element. This game is just plain fun. Do you like jet packs and motorbikes? Do you like killing crap? Do you like Sci-fi? Do you like a great art style? Do you like....Hell, just play it already!They have refined the crafting and levelling process, to make it more new player friendly. There are heaps of different battleframes (classes) to procure and play. Also the developers are great, and very community orientated - you'll see them in-game playing.Oh, and it's free :) "

												This is a Borderlands type MMOFPS. It's basically a beautiful, open world play ground where you roam from job to job, while enroute being constantly side tracked with fun events that randomly spawn through the world. Every 2 or 3 levels the game moves you to a new location, keeping things fresh. Hang gliding through the sky never gets old. The core game is PvE based and highly encourages players to help each other as you pass by them. Everyone reaps the rewards as long as you pitch in. The crafting system is fun along with the mining system. Send a thumper crashing into the earth to mine resources. Refine those resources. Research abilities, weapons etc from research points you get from salvaging junk and old gear and then craft items based on all of those factors. The instance based missions are challenging if you do not get a fair amount of players on your team. The voice acting is great and the graphics are still nice to look at after almost 40 hours of gameplay.Things that I do not care for. Job board missions take you all over the map. This is to entice you to purchase either VIP which gives you a special anytime glider pad to put down or purchase a motorcycle. Motorcycles are badass but cost a ridiculous amount of real world money. There is a way to exchange in game currency for Red Beans (real world $) but as usual this takes such a grind that you would have to ""dedicated"" (a nice way to put it) to get anywhere doing it. I have VIP'd a for a few months but I also think that is a little pricey as well.The cosmetics for your player are great. Battleframes to purchase with real money look great along with accessories. All the class in the game are available for free and all are fun to play. Whether your healing or throwing down turrets or just walking down Chosen with a huge gun. There is something for every play style.This game took a beating in the reviews when it first dropped but has greatly improved since. It is free to try and definitely worth a shot.			"

												Firefall is a fairly fun game. It's free to play; microtransactions are present, but for the most part you can get items off the Cash Shop (Red Bean Store) with currency earned in game. It's a first person/third person shooter with jumpjets. The game world is interesting if you are into the sci-fi genre. I started playing when it game finally released a month or two ago, and I'm still enjoying myself. I haven't spent a penny on the game, yet I've unlocked almost all the advanced frames within that time frame. Also, the gunplay isn't too bad, only annoying thing is sometimes the enemy's movements are a bit off/unpredictable/laggy, but that could be due to my horrid wireless connection.I'll end my gibbering with a pros vs cons list.PROS:+Interesting Sci-fi world with vast room to expand (both lore/story-wise and game content-wise)+Third/First person shooter +Jumpjets!+Free to Play with not alot of Pay to Win content (A Bike/LGV is great for running around, but I believe you can get one early on now, instead of waiting to level a frame to 25)+Cash shop items can be bought with in-game currency.+5 base frames with different playstyles mixed in with a fair number of advanced frames to change it up.+Customization of your character is free (recent patch gave everyone all the haircuts/facial hair options)CONS:-Not a huge amount of things to do once you've hit max level (level 40 right now)-Glitches/bugs can sometimes be an issue (which is normal for an newly released game, sadly)-Mostly a PvE (Player vs environment) game with a PvP (Player vs Player) mode and area sort of tacked on.-Is a bit grindy ( at least your not paying for it, eh?)-Some parts of the game aren't as well balanced as they could be.-Crafting in the game is widely considered a bit of a joke and a waste of time (Recent patch has reduced the cost of some items as well as allowing for you to pick what subtype of item you want, but the reseach costs I believe have stayed the same. Less of a crapshoot, but still costly).			"

												Really cool and fun game. And while it might seem like it's pay 2 win at first glance it's actually not since you have currency exchange to buy all the premium currencies with basic one (well you upgrade crystalyte to credits and credits to red beans) ofcourse there's a daily limit to how many you can convert but still. Alos majoroty of the ""premium"" stuff can also be sold on exchange for credits.(I guess I could say it's pay to obtain stuff faster). Anyway overall the game feels like mix between Borderlands (graphics, questing and open world wise) and warframe considering you have multiple battleframes and only one character. I haven't tried PvP aspect yet personally but people claim it's fun so I'll take that for granted atm. As for battle frames at the moment start with 5 basic frames and there's 11 more advanced frames so there's 16 in total at the moment. Now to get advanced frames you have 3 options: 1(captain obvious): Buy them for red beans,2 buy them for credits from exchange3 level up any frame to lv40 to get 10 tech points with which you can buy the for.Now while the game is extremely fun it doesn't come without flaws. For instance jobs get repetitive and boring as hell and since the objectives get placed randomly it sometimes places them on weird places like on top of the mountains. It also seems like the game requires a bit of skill to progress since ranged enemies hurt like hell and mobility is key to not getting shot so use your jetpack all the time and don't stand still.Another flaw I noticed is lack of ""extensive"" tutorial so it might get confusing for new players there is tutorial for basics but it doesn't involve the crafting system which and how to obtain materials (besides thumping).Also 1-use items are quite annoying especially the glider pads since I tend to use them every cooldown cuz they're fun. They are reusable(permanent) ones but they're a bit expensive.Thumping to gather resources while fun at first it gets tedious when you have to wait for 5min to get that x amount of metals and dirt.Now let's go back to the fun parts. 1. Quite emersive selection of frames which involves different playsyles also you can combine skills from basic with advanced frames of same type.2. OMG jetpack. fun to use especially if you're like me and use it constantly to climb mountains and then...3. ...use glider pads to glide around like a baws.4. nice graphics really nicely done world and different settings from beaches, mountains, forests and deserts.5. Random events that happen across the map and some give quite a bit of experience (especially tornadoes)Soo overall I'd give the game about 8/10 grade since it's not perfect there are some issues and it's not next-gen either but overall the fun I had in the game for past couple of days beats all the flaws. It's especialyl fun when you play it with friends and just mess around.			"

												It sucked in beta two years ago, and it sucks now. Nothing has changed. Performance is a joke for a game that looks like a PS2 game, controls are decent, combat is fine if not basic, controls are good tbh, story is a throw away, environemts are littered with adverts for in game item that cost real money. Now back onto performance, for a game that looks this bad graphically it should run a million times better than it does with everything maxed out 1080p Ultra settings I get lowest of 38fps in starting town, and highest of 190fps... that is a massive jump. Even using vsync does not help as the game still has random loading sectons where you can tell its buffering the next area and the fps goes nuts. I have the lastest drivers and updates for my system and my system is no sloutch with an i7 4770K @ 4.5GHz and a 3GB HD7970 1150/1650 and 16GB 1866MHz RAM. I can max out Crysis 3, Metro LL, even ESO and still get smooth playable frame rates in those games that look ten times better than this game.Overall, download it and try for your self, it is free afterall but I bet you will uninstall it after an hour. PS/ I sunk 16 hours into the BETA 2 years ago and I sunk 1.5 hours into this release on steam.... ITS INDENTICAL!!!			"

												It's a good game that has had a troubled development history, in part because of particular member of management who is no longer with the company. The game itself is fun and is evolving. However, if you are looking for another WoW with well-defined objectives and quests, this is not your game. There certainly are things that can be goals to work toward, but how you approach the game is up to you. You are not funneled down the same path as everyone else.			"

												I really enjoyed this game when I first played, and I decided to try to get back into it recently. I had no idea of the recent changes and was looking forward to picking back up with my character. What I encountered instead was a wreck. I instantly was informed that due to certain changes it was necessary to migrate my character a bit. Fair enough I thought, lets see what they've done to mitigate any losses. Instead, I started going through heaps of technical errors, UI glitches and a generally buggy experience. Then I discovered the mess that was left of my character. All my items were either gone, made useless, or replaced with rubbish alternatives, and to top it all off my characters level had almost halved without explanation and the game insisted that I start from the tutorial again, effectively destroying my progress.Even still I thought hey, I'll give it a chance. I used to enjoy this game, and thats rare for me with MMOs. Made a support request to see if anything could be done, never received a reply. Instead all I'm left with is an unstable game where I'll be lucky if it runs smoothly for a single battle, where I'll be lucky if my inventory doesn't randomly decide not to work, where the ingame objectives/events/quests (Whatever you want to call them) frequently bug out and don't let you either start or finish, where my log-in screen still insists Im a level 0 and where Im woefully unprepared for the content I'm supposedly the 'correct level for' due to only having gear either way over my level from where my character should have been or way underleveled from my 'consolation prize'.A great shame.

												I played the game in the beginning ( beta) upon the release the game went quiet real fast. The land you walk/fly/glide/drive around in felt really empty. in higher stages. However i gave this game 3 chances again but none of my friends ever returned to the game when it left beta.  It is a pretty looking game but the community has been taken over by mostly non english chat. Missions get boring because it is always the same old story. You grind to the max leven and then use a new suit. I play the game when im really bored. Some people will be able to have a blast for hours and hours but for the gamer that is looking for a futuristic free shooter i advice other games above this one. The game has a lot of potential but devolopers not interested in the gaming community. I recommend the game but that is mostly because i dont want to give up on this game yetUpsides: nice graphics, lot of potential, a lot of different classes/characters, fun if you are already bored and want to fly around and kil some monsters after you place a thumperDownsides: boring, crappy online community, heavy grinding, pretty empty maps (unless you place a thumper), the same mission over and over, devs made a lot of promises they failed to keep.

												now i have played this game far greater then just 13 hours on steam since i played during OBT when there wasn't really much content at all.that being said, back in the OBT the des atleast listened to the community and actually tried fixing things and one of the big issues i had with the game back then and even still right now, was the fact that you are able to have access to all BattleFames in the game. however in order to use them you need to have a special type of currency to unlock them.that to me was a big waste of time grinding since you werent able to switch things up to make it not so bad or beable to traverse area's easier if your having a hard time progressing if you like to play games like this by yourself.Now, if you were to come to me all that time ago and ask if this game was worth playing i would of given you a recommendation, but not now, not at all, in fact if you ask me now, im will and am going to tell you to put FireFall on your blacklist of games to stay away from.The reasons I would never recommend this game to anyone now are due to the Devs not listening to the community as well as any other issues which are listed below:Every major/minor update ends up knocking the graphics for the game up so that even low proformence computers cant even play anymore.i know very well about this issue since i used to play on a low end computer at 60Fps and now there are so many visual bugs let alone blooming graphics options that remove all of the visual content except for the HUD which is the only thing that stays, and has never been hotfixed even to this day since it started 2years ago.there is still an audio bug that persists that has been there since the CBT that was never fixed as well, which will show up 90% of the time during combat, and then there is the Stutter FPS issue that happens with the Visual bug tht has been there for 2 years and not fixed either.but here is the thing, even if none of these issues happen to you, your going to be seeing a game that has a player base the has decreased by about 43% give or take, because of all the technical problems, or the increased graphics, or the nerfs or buf with something....... and then after all of that and if you still want to play if nothing is going wrong, then the last thing about this game that really gets on my nerves is the fact that FireFall went from a fun Game back in the Beta's with a thriving community helping eachother  out with questing, and the enviromental objectives, to a heavy Cash shop Oriented F2P game that is mostly centered around PvP instead of just having fun.......Honestly with all of the issues that this game has had and the fact that the exisiting player base would rather slaughter each other in a battleground arena and not have fun in the enviromental world and make new friends all the time is what has made me and so many other players stop playing a game that was such a delightful concept.Not only is firefall not worth even trying, it dosen't even deserve any mention for awards let alone any awards even if it did get any			"

												I downloaded the game and it installed fine. But after starting the game it asked me to either register or sign in like normally. But when i tried to register for the game I was unable to actually finish it. It just wouldnt let me continue with the registration. I when to the site and register but again, after putting in my information it says that the game is unable to log in. That's all it said. I don't know if this is common issue or if its just me, but keep in mind this issue that I had while considering this game.			"

												Don't bother playing this game. It's riddled with bugs that makes the game unplayable. The devs also haven't been great with informing the players on when or what's going on with the bug fixes. This is one of those games that could have been awesome but instead turned out to be a ♥♥♥♥♥torm. Please save your time and money for something greater than this pos in it's current state.			"

												When Firefall initially came out it had great potential to be something. Now. Its just a huge pile of nothing. The devs need to NOT follow such companies like Microblows to have users beta test their code. The players that are interested in the game are clearly frustrated with EVERYTHING being broken. Do not waste your time with this game until there is some stability in basic game mechanics. Will try again next weekend to see if anything improves (not bloody likely). Dev team should start looking for other jobs, like McDonald's or BurgerKing.			"

												Firefall is nothing short of a beautiful mix between the FPS and MMORPG genres.Given a choice of 5 basic Battleframes (Assault, Engineer, Recon, Biotech, Dreadnaught), you are then dropped into a beautifully-designed post-apocalyptic Earth. As you progress throughout the world in-game, you will then take on all sorts of quests, ranging from high priority missions from the Accord High Command to menial tasks for random NPCs. Most of the missions might seem like your standard cookie-cutter ""Kill X creatures"" or ""Go to Point Y"" quests but don't let it fool you. Every quest is voice-acted and comes with a good storyline (especially those quest chains) to back it up. Upon reaching the current level cap of 40, you are then given 10 Pilot Tokens to further unlock ""specialized"" versions of the various basic Battleframes at no cost at all. For example, the HMG-toting (Heavy Machine Gun) Dreadnaught is the standard Heavy Battleframe with the right balance between offense and defense. There are additional variants of the Heavy Battleframes such as the heavily-fortified, PHMG-wielding (Plasma Heavy Machine Gun) walking fortress that is the Mammoth, or the slightly-less armored but extremely deadly Rhino Battlemech that packs a punch with his HLMG (Heavy Laser Machine Gun). Each Battleframe has a distinctive feel to it and one of Firefall's great qualities is the ability to switch Battleframes with utmost ease, ensuring that a character is able to play the various classes without the need to create a new character.Weapons and skills are what makes the classes and Firefall cuts no corners over here. Various weapons (primary and secondary) and skill modules can further be complemented by attaching weapon-ability and skill-ability modules tothem. Feel that your rare PHMG (Plasma Heavy Machine Gun) needs a higher rate of fire and magazine size? Feel free to choose from a wide range of Rate of Fire and Extended Magazine modules. Feel that your Shield Wall skill needs to last longer and have a shorter cooldown timer? Attach the modules that will increases your skill's rechange timer and skill duration. The list does indeed go on and on.Dynamic Events are also another one of Firefall's best areas. As you go about your daily life in-game, don't be surprised if a Melding Tornado (some kind of Tornado-looking portal that brings forth hostile NPCs) pops up nearby. Before you know it, you and many other players will be at the frontlines of the battle, trying to stem the tide of enemies coming at you while attempting to destroy the Tornado at the same time. Oh and that is only one of the many dynamic events. Enemy-led invasions of key installations (watchtowers) or even direct assaults on cities are also to be expected at random!Crafting is also present in this game, with acquired resources being used to craft a wide range of items such as Weapons, Battleframe Cores, Skill Modules, Enhancement Modules for your skills/weapons. Due to the fact that one character is able to put on many Battleframes, there certainly isn't a need for multiple characters. As a result, you will be able to craft every single thing there is to craft. That's right - EVERY SINGLE THING!The game uses 2 main forms of currency (Crystite and Credits) as well as 1 premium currency (Red Beans). Crystite is what you get as quest rewards, loot and the like and is used for repairing Battleframes, Crafting and purchasing items from NPCs. You are given the option to convert Crystite to Credits at the ratio of 25 Crystite : 1 Credit (capped at 25,000 Crystite or 1,000 Credits daily). Credits are the currency used on the marketplace in-game for trading and buying items from your fellow players. Red Beans are the premium currency which can be bought with Credits or real-world money and can be used to purchase items from the micro-transaction store.With a beautifully-rendered world, good solid gameplay, wide range of weapons and customization options, Firefall is no doubt one of the games I have enjoyed to date. It brings about the best of both the FPS and MMORPG worlds into one wonderful package. It being Free-To-Play is simply the icing on an extremely tasty cake.			"

Back then there were about 10 different types of resources you could get with thumpers, only 4 are left, of which only 2 are accessible until about lvl 25.Also, there were much more 'hard' events on map, like chosen warships, town sieges, etc., instead, now you only see watchtowers being captured from time to time and thats it. Boring.There was a really cool event with pushing melding front back for a limited amount of time, where is it now?There was more content and action in beta then in 'finished' game.			"

												It's alright but suffers from an intense lack of variety after level 8 (of 40) in each class you get your final ability and the rest of the game is spent doing the same thing over and over and over again. The end game raids are chaotic but the classes are all too independent and theres very little incentive to actually work together the ""instances"" are even worse there are only a few and theyre almost identical to the rest of the game. Theres little variety in environments and I'm not sure why the second area(of three) is supposedly in brazil when its clearly designed as a depiction of the American West, Overall the emphasis on gunplay and movement enhances the early game experience but by the late game starts feeling more repetitive than any other MMO combat model I've played(theres a reason most shooters are only a few hours long and rely heavily on prescripted events). In the end its alright but as with most MMOs unless you turn it into a social affair youll run out of enthusiasm for it long before the developers intended for you to. In the end I'll recommend it Just because its free though I wouldnt advise spending any money on it.			"

												For a free-to-play shooter, Firefall isn't honestly that bad. So far I've been impressed and have been more into playing this than Advanced Warfare (I got both at the same time). The game is open world and full of things to do, giving the player hours of enjoyment. One thing that I love about the game is aesthetics, which most games (especially in the triple A industry) don't have. The colors green and blue are quite common. It's nice for some producers to understand that we don't all want maps or overworlds that are obliterated. A large undevastated world awaits people. I wouldn't say it'll make your jaw drop, but you'll notice some other colors in the world.The combat is a little wobbly with the game lagging or freezing for a brief moment. However, as long as your internet is decent and your computer can run the game semi-well then you shouldn't have an issue. Now, I mentioned AW for one reason. Both of these games involve vertical gameplay somewhat. AW you have the extra jump, and in this game you have a jumpjet (I call them jetpacks). It makes it fun when you need to avoid an enemy, so you jump around him like a queer fairy lighting him or them up. The combat is interesting, but quickly turns into a grind, as most mission involve you going to a location to kill something or escort, or rescue. But all of them involve you killing something.As for the pay system, it's overpriced. After a while I decided to look into some outfits. I picked out the Bandit eye goggles and the straw hat. 240 Red Bean total, or to put it in easy to understand term, $25. No, not going to happen. You can earn virtually everything in-game by grinding it, but it'll take some time.Overall it's a good game. 7/10 "

												Been playing this game since 2012. It has gone through many changes, all for the good i believe. It is now on steam and you can purchase early access pack which is definetely worth it. All beta users are already entered into the early access. The game comes out on July 29th. Fantastic MMOFPS that offers 3rd person view and has rpg elements. Vast world full of dynamic content and exploration. Would recommend it to anybody no matter what. Its been a favorite game for me for 3 years now and i cant be happier that its finally on steam.

												Played the beta last year and quit because how boring and repetitive it was. Saw it was on Steam and decided to give it another shot. Seems in the year they changed a bunch of stuff but ultimately i still think its an absolute bore to play and way too damn repetitive. One would think being open world would make it fun, it doesnt. There is just no real clear sense of direction. Your running back and forth in each level range hub taking and completing quests from a job board. Also lets not forget to mention you have to level each frame (class) from 1-40 separately. EACH frame. Even the premium frames and i believe theres a total of 16 different frames. Now i know most peoples response to this is ""You have to level each class itself in other MMO's."" Well yes, thats true, but most often the quest line is different for each class, or at least parts of the questlines are different. Ultimately i just dont feel the game is worth investing any time or money into. Your better off looking elsewhere.			"

												I have spent a lot of time in the (long) Beta of Firefall before the official launch and have enjoyed the game always even though it has changed a great deal. The Red5 developers are good at listeing to feed back and fixing bugs - so please use the Firefall forums and in-game bug reporting to give your feedback and report bugs.Even though Firefall is now officially (July 15 2014) no longer Beta it still will be always getting better and Red5 will always be looking for your input I am sure.This is one of my favorite games. It has very low technical demands to run (my current system is from 2006 and still runs it fine), and the community of players is very supportive and helpful. Game play is great with lots of frenzied action and informal group play. You don't have to join an Army to have fun playing with others, and the dynamic randomly generated events give things to do for solo and group players both. There are things for you do to solo, and just as much if not a lot more to do with others.It's free - so try it out!			"

												This game has a lot of potential to be a great game, but it falls flat in many ways. For starters, from what i have seen the only way to unlock the character classes outside the basic few requires the premium currency, which there appears to be no way to earn in game, locking you out of over 10 different classes. Quests have you trek for stupidly long distances on foot, then take almost a minute to load the next objective for you after you get there (and the next objective is a mile away). The ""random"" encounters and events are very predictable and can be camped all day for an easy grind. Enemy movement seems very buggy, as they'll sometimes slide around at high speed, and other times walk normally. Weapons feel bad to use, just generic hitscan pew pew rifles and such. The game does look decent however (as long as you don't go off the beaten path, then you'll be greeted by low res textures that would've been disgusting even in the 90s), and the resource gathering and crafting are fairly enjoyable, but not enough to make up for the game's shortcomings. 3/10, such a shame.

												At the time of writing this my counter says I am at about 47 hours. However I have been playing this game since beta in about 2012. So when writing this review I want you to know that I have had some time with this game.For those of you that don't know, Firefall is an MMORPG/FPS with optional 3rd person view. (Nice to have both honestly.) In terms of look and feel its kinda like Halo and Crackdown had a baby then sent it to WoW School. You may read that last sentence and say ""but...I...how..."" Just trust me on this. A lot of gameplay will feel familiar and natural. Much of the mechanics will seem very familiar as well if you have ever played an MMO like WoW. One unique aspect is that each ""class"" is a wearable suit (called battleframe). Some are meant for getting up close and minigunning your enemies to pieces, others are more like snipers, picking off enemies from afar, still others are more utility like and meant for enhancing yourself or your team. Each frame levels up like a class would, but you don't have to roll another character to be a different ""class"". You simply change your frame. I like it because it means you don't have to roll alt characters and no need to worry about rebuilding rep or doing a bunch of pre reqs all over again. It's still your character that the people know and trust, you just changed your outfit. This may not apeal to people that are big into RP (something I do enjoy) but it's great when you don't have to grind everything all over again.So what else about this game? Well, If you've made it this far, lets jump into the pros and cons. Pros:- This game looks great! The art style is unique but awesome!- Combat takes skill, but isn't overcomplicated- Customization. While fairly limited, you don't usually feel like you look like everyone else.- There is always something to do! I mean this! Always something on your map that's relatively close. Usually it involves shooting things- It's not terribly grindy. Rarely was I sitting there going ""please just ping already....""- Free to play. Yep you don't even have to buy the base game, you can just download and give it a whirl!- Gun play with badassery. Yes you shoot things a lot. But you also get abilities that make each frame feel and play differently- Player base. The community has been really fun and friendly. It helps that the game isn't designed to be able to cast blame, but people genuinely want to work together to accomplish bigger things.- Its genuinely fun. It's not deep thinking fun. But run around with friends saving the world fun.Cons- It's small. They do a good job of making it feel big, and they have just added more content areas, but its sill kinda small.- Slightly glitchy. Overall, the game is really well polished, but occasionally there will be a glitch messes up your interface or send you trying to figure out a mission location for a half hour.- Free to Play. Yes, I said this as a pro, and its true.But you know why its bad. I will say it's definetly not pay to win, but that sweet paint job you want...$$$- Build timers. The crafting system is fairly in depth IMO, but its not instant unless you spend $$. Don't spend time building or researching at lower levels (you'll level too fast) and always try and keep something in the oven.- Limited starting frames. There are 5 base frames, all of which are viable, IMO. But you have to level up to get tokens in order to unlock more. Unless of course....$$$In summary, this really is a good, fun game that I feel like is starting to find it's stride. It's fun enough that it keeps pulling me back and I have a blast. Yes you have to throw down cash for certain things, but its a ""free"" game. And if you enjoy it you should be spending some money to support the game, especially if you are getting novelty items to go along with it. (BTW, if you do decide to pay, I recommend buying a DLC pack because you usually get more bang for your buck.) Hope to see you in game!TL;DRIt's a fun game that looks great and feels well polished and definetly unique. Its F2P but its not Pay to win. Good times to be had!			"

												Do you like Global Agenda? Borderlands? FPS? TPS? This is the game for you. You can play either in First person or Third, and both play smoothly.  The gameplay is wonderfull, its not overly hard like Global Agenda, but you will share your fair part in death.  The graphics play smoothly on any settings, yet on worst settings the game still looks... good, suprisingly, the paid for currency does not, I repeat DOES NOT, run this game, if you want the paid for currency, you can trade the normal currency in game to other players for it, most of the marketplace it completely run by the players, it is honestly a great game. Plenty of gameplay, open world, shoot ♥♥♥♥, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, randomly occuring missions that only take about 2-mins to complete but still reward you hansomly for it, and the leveling system... its sexy as hell, you can choose one of 5 main specilizations, Dreadnaught, Assault, Recon, Robotics, and Biotech, once you reach level 40 with one of these, you unlock the next teir class within that specilization, with an average of 3-4 different classes within each specilization.  The crafting system is complex, but simple at the same time, simply melt down some scrap gear, research some new gear, craft some new gear, and vwolia, it takes some time but thats all really, the drops in the game are pretty well ballanced, the gear for any class works well, no one class is better than another, only sad thing is, there is not a Melee based class/specilization, im looking forward to the game getting one... Among all these things the game does have some problems... the gameplay feels quite repetitive after some time, leveling a fame aside from the first one you chose is no fun what so ever, the story seems quite linear so far, hostiles are boring and reused, limited areas to explore, ect ect, past all of this it does it quite a long road ahead of it, it could get quite better. honestly go play the game yourself, but all in all i quite like the game, i hope it does improve though...  6.5/10			"

												I am an alpha supporter and founder purchaser of this game, I have played this game straight from the main site itself hence why there is only 72 odd hours on steam. I have poured thousands of hours into this game. I am directly comparing the game now to what it was in the past. I love this game and cannot believe this has happened.The game is technically ""free to play"" but because of recent changes I cannot recommend it for anyone. Because of shifts in management and terrible desicions on implimentation of game mechanics, Firefall has changed wildly from what it used to be. Massive server wipes have claimed maps, items, abilities, and characters.Audio files over most of the game have been corrupted or completely wiped, this means sound effects are either gone or rarely work. Npcs were previously professionally voice acted, that is all gone now, and the few times things are voiced now it is done badly.Server lag is now rampant, along with huge numbers of glitches, and disconecting. Crafting was removed and the market as a result has been almost wiped out.Items, abilities, and frames players had were removed without compensation.Update: All the stuff above is still a large problem but some fixes have been introduced, the most noticable being the character models don't look like rag dolls anymore.I am still going to error on not recommending this for the time being because not enough has been fixed.FINAL UPDATE: IT IS OFFICIAL THE GAME HAS BEEN ♥♥♥♥♥ TO DEATH BY THE SUITS. THIS GAME IS NOW DEAD FOR REAL!!! DO NOT WASTE ANY TIME WITH GAME CAUSE ITS ♥♥♥♥ AND THERE IS NOW NO ONE LEFT WORKING ON IT!The only good reviews for this game are from when it was in beta and BEFORE the company was sold to souless ♥♥♥♥s in suits.The developers and administraters have all left to work on the game that this was SUPPOSED to be. So everyone forget about this game and go here to show your support for people who are actually trying to make a game for the PLAYERS and not just a money press for all the loyal fans.https://forums.emberthegame.com/- "

												I played this for countless hours during the Beta, in which it wasnt available on steam. But it was still very fun and had alot of content coming in (and out) all the time. But to the points, or the pros and cons.Pros:-amazing campaign-Many new and old areas to explore from the beta-more content coming!-really nice graphics for a F2P-Fun community that is helpful and nice.-massive seamless areas! -random missions that appear out of nowhere.-alot of different classes and branches of those classes to get into (you can also go between any class at any time!!!Cons:-can be a bit empty and boring if your nto looking for something to do-some of us Beta players are stuck in the level 1-5 areas at start and we are levels 14-40-if you venture too far you probably will be decimated.But with all of that in mind, i'd give it a rating of 8.5/10. It is enjoyable but i miss some of the beta features. but oh well, its out and its great!!			"

												Don't mind what its say about the top line reviews. This game is reborned until the last patch. Stabilized, good run in every way. New Eden is beatiful. I like to ride around the beach or desert area. (motorcycle is best part of this game :D). OST also good for fight or explore. Combat system well thinked and balanced. Story is interesting even main line or just little side quests.(HALO/WOW/Battlefront/Hellgate London mixed up nostalgic) I hope get more attention lately ... this game is deserved. "

												Pros: The combat still has an intuitive vibe to it still -meaning- the gameplay predominatly plays like an fps before anything else, creating a Tribes feel to it. It also has much more exploration due to larger content increases.Cons: The mechanics such as crafting are really simplified to the point where the only harvested minerals you recieve from crafting from lvl1-20 are basically raw earth, iron, tungston and crystite. There is a lot of traveling around which would disencourage lower leveled players; however there is a transit system.This iteration of the game is really casual; however, it still makes unique differences to clasical MMORPGS mechanics such as combat and travel. It lacks in complexity, making it easier to learn, but leaves the player empty because progression is slow and learning stops at a certain level of play. I would still recommend this game solely for it's combat. ie: jet boots mixed with gunplay. It makes the grind somewhat bearable at least to level 40 for one frame.			"

												I have been playing Firefall since october 2012, and it has come a long way. It is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time, i highly recommend it! The community is very friendly and Red 5 studios one of the most caring studios i have ever seen. The game is very fun, there is alot to do in the game now compared to closed beta and open beta. If there was one thing i would wish to be added to the game, then it's to get arena pvp back because that was fun. i have tried open world pvp a little but not enough to know if i love it or not.

												This game, so far is very fun to play.  Your skill will dictate your progress and rewards.  Perhaps, your rewards more than your progress.  Sometimes, the two are inter-connected.  It's possible to be in the same place as another player experiencing the same objective.  Yet, because you didn't contribute as much to the battle, your experience will be lower. You'll recieve no reward.  In some cases you may not get anything.  This feature ends the idea of someone being carried by the team -""Riding on the shoulders of others.""You decide your level of involvement.  That being said, I can understand one's desire to level up to the max as swiftly as plausible.  Don't do that.  Take your time.  It's an open world game with much to do.  There's no reason to do everything as fast as possible.  You have to get your videogame foreplay on - Yeah, I said it!The game has bugs up the wazooo.  This is true.  What I've experienced are clipping into a rock and having myself auto suicide - not cool bro.  The other problems are weird interface bugs mostly tied to selecting items in a stats screen -Sometimes nothing works, WTF man?!When a game is fun you can tolerate a few bugs.  It remains to be seen of they will be fixed.  I hope that they are. I like the crafting system in the game. I also like how that system makes it feasible to make almost everything you have the option to purchase either via real money or in-game currency.  You don't have to pay to play or pay dominate the world. You can purchase a VIP membership that boosts your XP and other features but the game also gives you a free daily boost for 1 hour so that's sugoi.I hope that the world gets bigger and better because I really like it.  Did I mention that I really like the day and night cycles.  Somethings the atmosphere is very pretty.  Firefall is a very beatiful game.  Sometimes the view and the lighting can give, ""FarCry"" a run for it's money.  But then the character models in this game through me off a bit.  They look like poser models to me.  It's not that bad but it leaves me with a little, meh in my mind.   I know that a game like this is very challenging to make and maintain.  They did a good job despite some internal tumoil at the company.  As a designer, I know that this business is not a walk in the park.  It's hard work and you want to keep it fun.  If it's not, then what's the point of it all?  Money as creative impetus never lasts and it looks like they had fun making many parts of this game.Red5, you guys gotta get back to basics and have fun.  It's the only way that the world you have created will continue to florish.  It's paramount to make it the game that you want and hold on to it.  You can't be everything to everyone.  You can be everything to yourselves.			"

												The future:  MMORPGFPSRTS.  ""Firefall"" is superior to ""Planetside 2"" & ""Guild Wars 2,"" combined.  Gameplay is as fun as ""Team Fortress 2,"" providing ample classes & modifications for further customization.  Thus far jobs & craft feel balanced.  100+ hours closed beta not on STEAM, level 20 Engineer, whilst giving all the other models a try.  I quit when they removed pvp.  Now I'm back & having fun again.  Most importantly, the controls *feel* right progressing into flight with jet propulsion, hang gliders, vehicles, etc..  It's beautiful.  It's dangerous.  It's a rewarding adventure.  Awesome.			"

												I've been playing this game since beta, on and off for about two years now. I was impressed initially with the team-based pvp, but the pve game got a lot more fleshed out as they went. I love to play now and visually, this game is gorgeous. I am holding out that they are still working on some things because their end-game content and I personally think crafting needs a little attention.

												This game has come such a long way in such a small amount of time- Red 5 has taken on adversity head on and triumphed. They have attempted many different things in their beta before setting in stone what they were finally going to do with Firefall, and the result of this approach has paid off.This game is the most addictive game I've played in years. And I'm likely going to play it for years to come.There's so much to do in the game- there's open world missions that just spawn in front of you, there is also a job board, there are instanced raids and quests, there are mini-encounters. There is open world PVP. Bikes to race with. Gliders. Did I mention jetpacks? With 16 battleframes to choose from, and more on the way, and the ability to customize each to your liking, there are unlimited ways to play the game, catering to a vast array of playstyles. I could say so much more, but really- just try it out. You have nothing to lose. The game is free.			"

												Great game! Visually stunning, this  world is HUGE. You only need 1 toon and can choose from any class you like, dont like the class you chose? No prob just goto a battleframe machine and choose another, whatever lvl you hit previously is saved and you start off at lvl 1 again. There are main missions that activate at certain lvls but most times you can just do whatever you like. Missions from a job board for extra benefits or just roam around helping people.One thing i like in this game that i've seen in no other is the reward system. If you happen upon a person or group doing a mission or event and help out, you still get part of the reward and loot even if not in a group with them.Real money ingame is in red beans but there is ingame credits that you can get via selling stuff on the market or exchanging crystite for credits on the market exchange. Crystite you get from mission rewards or from killing mobs and even crafting things. Anything you can buy with real money ingame you can get with credits. This isnt pay to win, real money just makes things faster (i'm a patient person) This game is so addictive its hard to break away. It has a ton of ingame achievements, way more than in Skyrim or Borderlands 2. Explore the world.Free to download and play, try Firefall today!			"

												I've been playing this game for 2 years and 4 months and it came a long way. I can only pick a few games which developers have been so forth coming, talkative and able to listen to a community like ours (during beta). I could only name another few games that i've been involved in where we were so close to the developers, and they made it a point to roll with the community in terms of feedback and gave their interpretation to that feedback in a subsequent update.So you know about firefall right ? You can simply visit the store page for more information, but from what I've seen I can make a few  good points of this game.Progressing:You have about 16 battleframes to choose from. You can choose only a few if you're picky about your game style (as a support or, healer, sniper or tank), or you can choose to level up many of these frames and join in on the massive world in battles with the game style which you think is right for the specific battle at hand.Customizing,You can customize how you look ingame, (in the 24th century you can even change your sex, allong with the rest of the usual suspects, body/hair color, battleframe color, some logo's etc....Crafting,It's completely OPTIONAL!. You'll be able to just play because firefall is foremost a shooter first!. You'll earn new rewards as you just shoot away and do quests/missions. But if you want to specialize in certain craftmanships you can do it and make your awesome weapon, to use for yourself or to sell on the market!MarketFirefall has a market where - if you don't want to craft, or if you want to earn some money - you can rely on to get supplied. Dynamic content:You can literally wander in this vast world and do ares jobs/missions, then as you are doing your duties for the Accord, you stumble upon other dynamic adventures that you'll have to solve such as crashed objects that arrouse wildlife around it, coy transportation raiders, people being trapped, criminals on the run for the Accord and much much more.Global events, invasionsAnd if that's not enough, there are organized massive events in this game which take place from time to time and invite everyone to contribute to the global war against te... umm I mean the chosen!.In Firefall, you participate at your own level, sometimes in a squad, sometimes solo, sometimes in a hefty fight against a boss that will make your neck stiff. These titans will be for the hardest of the hardest (or so Nostromo says.. well at least I think he says that)You can travel the world on foot inbetween missions, or benefit from gliders and vehicles to soar high above the sky when you go on your adventure. Everything is possible. Now don't become chosen jawbones!			"

												This game man is really great. Here's what my opinions are.1) Don't complain if the games feels the same type of mission all over again, ALL GAMES are like that including REAL LIFE.2) The borderlands game franchise feels right in this game, which is a plus.3)Open world, lots of places to go through out all countries all areas. It's how you progress that lets you explore.4)Slow lvl system so that no one can just burst through levels, they actually gotta craft, get better gear, team up to complete missions.5) By judging at this game as a closed beta tester, I say there's lots of new contents/DLCs the devs can do.6) Cool customizations, guns, rides and also the texture of the world itself.7) my personal favourite, it makes you immerse into FireFall universe.Here's the cons1) Some gears can be purchase so those who spent on real $$ have the better chance of Solo-ing or PVP2) The Quest board is a little bit slow on loading the next objective, a minor complain but still need to improve on that.3) It wouldn't hurt if there's cinematics after certain levels you have gone up to. It makes the game more attractive, more fun, and you will feel like you're doing something like SWTOR. They have each cinematics after each mission completed, which is why the story line is darn good. I just hope FireFall will take that as a consideration.DO I recommend this game? I say YES, this is BY far the second or THE BEST Shooter MMO besides Defiance of course.You shoot monsters, bandits all sorts of Aliens that screwing you. It's a war here, just like Borderlands, Defiance ect. Also it takes place in the future on earth and you need to defend it.			"

												This game has so many bugs, and so many shortcomings. It's also the most fun I've had in an MMO. I don't really even know how to describe this game. It's had a crazy long open beta, a lot of bad press, and an incredibly rough development. It still manages to be a unique diamond in the rough. I bet it will have a ton of bugs when it comes out on the 29th, but give it some time. This game is amazing despite adversity, and I have a feeling it's going to keep on getting better.			"

												What made Firefall amazing was its uniqueness compaired to other mmo's out there. I am sorry to say that invision of firefall has been lost to the past. The game use to be a sandbox shooter, with interesting crafting, decent story, and a incentive to work as a group.The crafting system was complex and one of the reasons the game was unique. Depending on the quality and type of materials used, would change the quality and even the proformance of the item. It also had tons of unique resources to back up the crafting and a neat way to get those resources. That neat way was ""thumping"", that involved calling down a enormous mining drone called a ""thumper"", and protecting it while it mined. There where even clan thumpers that need 5 or more players to protect.For content there were missions all over the map and random spawning events. Through out the day there would be large events that would pull hundreds of players in to complete. Unlike most mmo's there was no ""quest system"", you leveled by just contributing in events, thumping, and missions. For story there was instanced dungeons that you would party up to complete.The classes and weapons in the game where also cool and unique. Most of them still are with some minor edits.Now to the game in its current state.The ""sandbox"" do what you want leveling system they had is gone. Replaced by a extremely bad questings system that is still has major bugs. Many players getting stuck at level 9 do to a bug.Crafting and resources have been completely removed.  Though there are still thumpers for mining there are no longer resources in the ground. Crafting is just gone, replace by a looting and reputation system.On top of all that, most if not all of the original dev team have either left or been fired. I have played over 600 hours in the game and still love this game. But in its current state that seams to only get worse by the update, I do not recommend anyone play this game. For anyone that remembers what the game once was, there is a project call Ember being made by Crixa one of the original devs. That is trying to make a game with the vision that firefall once was. If you care to see that game please show him some support.			"

												Once upon a time, long long ago....Sounds nice and familiar right? Not so with Firefall. This game is a far cry from what it was supposed to be. For all you veterans that go back to .6 days or earlier, I salute you and call you my digital brothers. .7 and .8 beta was the absolute prime of this game between the horizontal progression, thumping for materials (S3 that 999 copper!!) and the significant depth and customization of the crafting. Allllll....all of it gone. Listen folks, I stll enjoy the game because the story is fun and the world is still the same. Pick it up, play it through once and pretty much put it away for good. So may bugs in a ""lauched"" game. Butchered the lore. I was able to adjus to a level system and at first even got over the removal of thumping and resources. But the destruction of the crafting system, the audio never matching up to the cinematics, the laaaaaaa...a.aa...g....gggg. Oh and the fact it barely sees 200 poeple on the server...(s?) anymore shows how The9 has put this game in the ground. So long awesome gaming memories.Thank you for the hundreds of hours and great friends I was able to find online that I still game with today. I was one of the original Commander pack backers of this game and played it before it ever saw Steam. It 'was' worth it all. Now time to move on.I don't care about the hate I am going to get I full support Kern and Ember. Bring back the glory days of a successful open world shooter mmo.			"

												I played this heaps in its Beta - before it was available on Steam.  It WAS a great game with a unique way of avoinding the typical MMO levelling process, and create the type of character that suited your play style.  Now its a typical MMO that fences you in to areas that match your character level.  Anything outside those areas are either too easy or too hard to kill.The game never really got the AI for the enemies to work correctly or with much variety.  Ie.  Shoot one in the face and it makes no difference than shooting them in a leg.The ""team"" responsible for this game's new direction have truly killed any fun that this game gave me.			"

Oh man i remember when this game got full support from the guys at the youtube channel called Extra Credits, simply showing how great the ideas were from a game developer point of view.I also remember the hype from seeing such cool looking concept arts of people thumping, fighting world bosses, driving insanely cool vehicles, doing stuff that actualy affected the WORLD MAP which was 99% open (well, actualy those 99% would translate on about 1% of how big the world was suposed to be).As witch doctor would say, ""it's about to pop"".

												I played this heaps in its Beta - before it was available on Steam.  It WAS a great game with a unique way of avoinding the typical MMO levelling process, and create the type of character that suited your play style.  Now its a typical MMO that fences you in to areas that match your character level.  Anything outside those areas are either too easy or too hard to kill.The game never really got the AI for the enemies to work correctly or with much variety.  Ie.  Shoot one in the face and it makes no difference than shooting them in a leg.The ""team"" responsible for this game's new direction have truly killed any fun that this game gave me.			"

												Once they got rid of the 5v5 PvP lobbies, the game became utter garbage.  Their excuse was to ""Focus on the PvE elements of the game"" and that they would eventually revisit PvP.  They did honor their word by introducing the PvP zone -- unfortunately it is and always has been utter trash to play.  There is nothing fun or rewarding about it.  This game will probably never be as good as it was when they had the team deathmatch games you could queue into -- they were fun, the game was surprisingly well balanced, and it was very competitive.  Could have had an enormous community surrounding it with all of the good they did with that particular portion of the game.  Unfortunately the PvE could never be good enough to replace what they've thrown away, so I suspect this game will just wallow in obscurity for the remainder of its life.There was so much potential early on...

It has been going downhill since the Steam release...I played this game since it was in the beta. (Had to get a new account though bc I forgot the user data and such :') Back then it was absolutely phenomenal - the community was one of the nicest and most helpful out there, every other update brought something new and even things like crafting and such were handled really nicely (Yeah, back then the crafting stuff wasn't disabled yet :I)Whenever you'd call down a thumper and somebody else happened to come by, they'd ask you if you need help and if denied, would just go on their way. Now, thumping is pretty much useless anyways because they removed 90% of the minerals available through it. Now, you either get ignored (bc it's useless), or some f**kers come along even if you tell them to beat it.It feels like every time you fire up the game now something stops working - from not really dramatic things like your camo, excuse me, Warpaint being the wrong color to actually game-breaking things like quests not starting or NPCs not spawning/ escort missions that won't register you finishing them etc.By now the game is kind of a hot mess and it's a shame really. I'm aware that R5 went through some financial trouble and ended up being bought up by the same Chinese company that has the WoW license over there (ask the Chinese WoW players how they feel about them) and that even before that, there just weren't a lot of devs left to even be able to patch out all of the bugs and glitches.I'm really saddened to see the game go in this state of affairs, since I thoroughly enjoyed the Beta and even here and there when it would work, I had fun playing the ""Steam/Public-Release"".But right now I'm not even sure if they're going to leave the game in limbo and just shut down the servers at some point or if they're going through with ""making it a mobile/console game"" like they explained in Red5's last ""News/Update"" post on the game's site. I've been told that until they figured out the legal stuff, the servers will remain online, kind of like in limbo. One of Red5's laid off employees (By the name of Robin) is the only one that's offering support for the now drastically cut down player base, and there are only one ""shard"" per game region left (which are all hosted from California).I re-downloaded this game to spend some more time in this world that I had such fond memories of, before they possibly shut down the servers for good. So right now, I can only recommend this game to long-time, passionate players (like the majority of people left) that just want to enjoy the remaining time this game will be accessible at all.			"

												So many of you probably have heard of this sob story from every other reviewer but I am going to tell my story anyhow.I played this game since it went f2p in 2014, back then it was fun, fast paced and gave a sense of freedom that not many mmo's have delievered on. But since then it has gone down hill: the developers were fired, a new company that almost screwed over WOW is now in charge and the game has been left in a state which is frankly appauling. I gave this game up when this began to happen, I have fond memories of this game and I will continue to like this game as it was, not as what it has become.As for anyone who is looking for a good F2P MMO I unfortunately have to say that in that market most games are dead or dying. Firefall is just another game that was screwed over by buissness and greed, it falls into place with other games like Wildstar and Archage.If you want a good MMO, go sub to WOW, I have been playing it for a while and with legion it is great to get involved and join the great community.Hope this was helpful and I do feel sorry for anyone who missed out on this game back in its glory days.

												ALMOST the perfect FPSMMO. The cel-shaded approach to this class-based shooter makes the game bloom with color and awe as you fight through a world where randomized events are constantly popping up. This game has everything, crafting, class-mechanic-diversity, dungeons, and random events. It's just one of those games you log into and suddenly it's 8 hours later. it's not perfect, there's some bugs and glitches that can be made more irritating by the lag, and if you stay too long in one place the randomized events can start to blend together as your brain zones out, but for a free to play this is worth every second you're in the mood to give to it! Here's a short little review I made for it over at Digital.Flash.Fire	  in case you wanted to take a look at it before you dive in!

I loved Firefall. I really, truly, did.But after years of changes, it's not the game it was.I have a lot of time in this game, a lot of memories from playing it. I leveled every frame to 40, kitted them all out. Crafted my own gear, got a full custom prefixed loadout on my Rhino, got supremely lucky and netted a pair of Celestial Wings. I met some really amazing people in Firefall, had a great time hanging out with my army in teamspeak.I joined when the game first came up on Steam, summer of 2012, after following the game since the first concept art appeard on the internet. The world was beautiful, the art and design bold and striking. The community was friendly and strong. The sounds were amazing. The distant pounding of a thumper, the crisp report of an assault rifle, the whine and hum of jetpacks. Movement was free and unconstrained. Jetpacks opened up a thousand possibilities for combat and exploration, gliders made for amazing screenshots and travel unlike anything else I'd seen.I played heavily for a year or so, then left once I'd reached endgame and the content had run out. I'd done all of the instances countless times, farmed Bane, Kana, WF, Miru when it came out, ground HC campaign tokens.I came back, years later, to a game which bore little resemblance to the one I'd left. More reminiscent of a Nexon MMO than the vibrant world I remembered, I didn't find any of the magic that pulled me into the game left. Countless changes had rendered hours of effort worthless, the community was virtually nonexistant. The game was more grind-oriented than I'd ever seen it. Most of the things that made the game stand out were gone or had been rendered irrelevant. Players who I'd run raids with had been offline for months. I played for a few hours here and there but it was pointless.I sincerely wish things had gone differently. This game remains one of my favorites. I may have joined after the golden age of the beta was over, but I still got a good bask in the sunset. Now, with the game seemingly dying, with devs being laid off and rumors of an impending server shutdowns looming large, there is little or no reason to start playing.This review is less of a review, more of a eulogy. There was a lot to love about Firefall. While it was up it was easy to stand back and hope for updates, roll my eyes at the changes. Now that Firefall is coming to an end, I have realized that I will miss it greatly when it leaves us for good.Goodbye, Red5. Goodbye, Firefall. "

												I have over 1200 hours and some $ in the game. What can I say, I'm addicted. If you like a FPS and MMO then this is the game for you. The game is exciting and a grind all at the same time. The best fun is running with a squad or platoon to take on the HC missions.

												In it's present state, this game is a terrible shame. So much is broken it would be difficult to list. literally, the bugs change from one login to the next. Right now, there is an entire building whose walls are 100% translucent. Quests are broken at numerous places, some of them just plain don't work.I gave them a month just to see if what I suspected was true, and several of the ""bugs"" are dark design patterns that go away once you subscribe.I really wish this game was run by competent executives, because it is not.

												This game is riddled with bugs.The current devs pulled content from the game, locking playable areas to a very limited 2 zones.They then rereleased an area as ""reworked"". Nothing works. Missions dont work, mobs tend to reset randomly, npcs spawn inside the terrain, and land objectives do as well.It is nearly impossible to progress in the game without doing the pvp arenas, which yield a small portion of your needed exp, because doing missions is impossible.

												If you're looking for a new Shooter, a new RPG or a new MMO, I urge you to give this game a go... it's FREE so you have nothing to lose!I haven't been captivated by a game for such a long period of time since LoL. Like, LoL, this is a AAA quality FREE TO PLAY game. This game is funded through micro transactions in the form of cosmetic items for your character and small boosts to resources and experience. To be clear, it is by NO means pay to win.The up coming changes/updates to this game will take this to the next level. In addition, having the game on Steam will give New Eden (the world) a much needed transfusion of new players.Firefall has a fantastic community that has helped shape the game and it will show!

												The reason I'm down voting this game is that I constantly keep getting disconnected from the server and it's only ever in two places throughout the game - At the very start when I click ""enter mission"" or at the very end when I'm talking to the POI to finish the mission off. It really annoys me when it happens at the end. For some reason I keep all my rewards and gear from the ""finished"" mission, yet I have to do it again because the disconnection happened before it registered that I actually completed it :/I'm kinda disappointed. The gameplay and art style is something I would happily play for a good haul. If they ever fix said issues, I will gladly not move from my chair for a few months.			"

There might be some fun to be had in the instances they offer.  Maybe there would be the slightest hint of a challenge there. The problem is you can't get into the instances.  They say your squad does not meet the requirements.. ok.. but what are the requirements? They never tell you.  Maybe they don't exist?  The devs removed PvP stating that it was too challenging for the player base.  This game is in alpha at best.  Don't waste your time.			"

												FREE TO PLAY done RIGHT!Most people talk about the grind of the game... yes, there is a grind. Name one MMO that does not have a grind of some fashion... go ahead... I'll wait... That's right, you can't! So while this game has a grind, it's a LOT more satisifying because of the gameplay itself. The fast paced, skill based shooter mechanics are wonderful and help keep the game entertaining. The people that complain about the ""grind to unlock advanced battleframes""... they are doing it wrong. Simple as that. While you can spend money to unlock them, or level up to Level 40 with each of the battleframes... you can also buy them off the Auction House with credits you earn in-game. ""BUT THAT IS A GRIND!"" ... not really! You get a mineral called Crystite that you can directly exchange for Credits. By the time you reach level 15, you can EASILY have enough credits to buy an advanced battleframe. Look under the ""Unlocks"" tab, they are typically 4-6k credits. At level 22, I have 18k credits. Sell what you dont need.... convert to credits... DONE! In half a day of playing, I have unlocked 4 advanced battleframes. You can also use Credits to buy ANYTHING that you could spend cash on. DO NOT LET PEOPLE FOOL YOU because they didnt see the information right in front of their eyes.Yes, questing consists of going to a Job Board, accepting a quest, and turning it back in. This can feel grindy, but remember... name an MMO that doesnt do this? The difference is that you also have world events going on almost 100% of the time. So jump in and help defend or attack a location. You don't even have to be there for the full encounter... just kill a few things and you will get FULL credit for completion.  Leveling is incredibly fast if you get into the habit of actually looking at what is going on in the world around you.The customization options in this game are AMAZING! You can freely switch the way you look, your battleframe's colors/patterns, your cosmetic gear, etc... at any of the ""New You"" stations or Battle Garage (located in every quest hub, city, and outpost. They are everywhere!You can spend money... or you can simply look at what the game has to offer... You can buy ANYTHING and EVERYTHING with in-game credits. You can sell EVERYTHING. And everytime you complete a Job Board quest, you get a token to take to a slot machine for bonus prizes... some of which are worth quite a bit!I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone. This is game isn't perfect and it is not for everyone... but if you like fast paced shooters with an amazing open world and the ability to jump in and out of encounters, plus being rewarded for helping other players... THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! "

												Don't get it Pros____-Ok gameplay-Fun classes -Decent amount of customizationCons____-Boring loot and enemies-slow progression-trying to cash in on players (Turning into pay to win)-Takes years to travel the map (Pay to fix that)-Boring quests-Boring enemies-No skill gap just stats -No fun bosses just the same enemies with higher levels-Really easy to get burnt out on the game (Get bored) Don't waste your time because you wont last any longer than I did if you have ever played a decent game in your entire life. Generally a game you will forget about and move on while regretting every second you spent on it.Verdict: Do yourself a favor and don't get this game			"

												I played this game heavily back in 2014, come back today, (04/01/2017) and the game is broken, although that may be to kind. It was a fun game back then that i put hours into, now its nothing, story breaks completely a few missions in, i've found chosen incurrsions that show on the map, but theres nothing actually at the location, the game seems to have a lot of connectivity issues now, and apparently the devs just abandoned it thankfully the original guys want to make a new game called Embers which is the ""spiritual succesor"" to firefall if they do, lets hope it can bring back those good ole days, and not resemble anything close to this mess. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody, not even for if you're curious, save yourself some time, and hard drive space			"

												This review is 2 hours into game.What I dislike about most of modern day MMO is that getting past starting area is not as easy/fun as in WOW. I wish more games would take the approach in a way that atleast when I look at areas specially the newbie zones they be bit easy to traverse through - I kept on flying to timbaktu trying to get to the marker that my quest showed. Same reason i never liked WILDSTAR too the starting zones were just too confusing to my taste - ofcourse you are suppose to read the wall of text that follows the quest but most of us don't do that. I never really cared about lores or story really. The games should ease in player and then throw them into more complex terrains to traverse through later on.Maybe i just don't like steampunk/sci fi lores. Also early zones there is vast unexplored sea area but don't think you can go into deep waters.On flip side - gliding is fun till it lasts. Jetpacks is fun. Sniping was fun but you don't kill anything one shot even if they are well within your level range.And from looks of it this looks like Pay-2-Win or atleast make your life easy scenario - which is most of MMO these days. This doesn't appeal to me much. But I would like to say this is probably the better version of FPS/MMO genere out there. The review will be updated as I try it more.			"

												2 Years ago this was a decent game, now it is nothing but a big collection of bugs and crashes.My new Firefall experienceAfter logging in 4 times before it actually let me into the game i noticed that it had deleted all my stuff and my charecters, bit of a pain but whatever its not a terribly big deal.Get through the tutorial and start doing the startup missions, the ones that are required before you can do the open world aspect of the game; only the last part of the first begginer mission has a bad script. So me and the other 6 newbies that were there to do the mission just sit around trying to enter the mission area over and over again, then finally something different happens! The game flips out and logs 2 of us out of the game completely.Later i learned that they had removed the crafting system, they made 'thumping' obselete and 90% of the stuff that made the game unique had been removed. Oh and they made the 20 man 20 minute raids that used to be really poular absolutely worthless.It almost feels like they were trying to make the game fail.			"

												This game was Okay (7/10) at best prior to the 1.6 Razors Edge Update. But now, holy ♥♥♥♥.... I don't even know how to describe how badly Red5 screwed the pooch on this one. I've been gaming my entire life and never have I ever seen a company take a bigger backward step in development. I honestly wanted this game to be good, and I wanted to support future content so I spent some coin to increase my inventory space and the like. The 1.6 Razors Edge Update comes out and BOOM! No more inventory expansions that I paid money for. Tried to contact customer support but the log-in info that I haven't changed is apparently incorrect for their support and the password reset doesn't appear to work as I've done it three times in the past 48 hours. That's just an example of how bad this game has become, please, even though it's free to play stay the hell away from this terrible game and the even worse Red 5 Studios.			"

												For right now I cant recomend the game.  Now This game is alot of fun looks ok and is one of the better f2p mmos out there or i should say it could be one of the best.  Thats if the game wasent plagued with so many bloody bugs.  Myself friends and others ive seen in game have had multiple problems with broken quests quest objectives taking 5 or more mins to upload countless times ive or others have had to reload the game to move on to the next quest objective.  Problems with puting items up on the auction house etc I could go on for a long long long time about the bugs.  Basicaly easyest thing to say is this has to be the bugiest mmo ive ever played.  Now like I said at the start it is a lot of fun when you arent plagued by the bugs so if the devs ever wake up and start fixing alot of these problems it can and will be one if not the best f2p mmos out there.

												I personally have enjoyed the game since I first got it, the game can get really beautiful when the sun starts casting rays around mountains and large formations, the depth of field (in my opinion) made it look even better, and if you don't like it you can configure it in your settings. While the game does start to feel repetitive after a while I did enjoy cooperating and teaming up with some players in the game.

												Been playing the Firefall beta for just about 3 years now, and it has certainly come a long way! When the closed beta first began, there was little more than instanced PvP on a single map, and Red 5 has slowly but surely fleshed out a MASSIVE and incredibly detailed game world full of activities and adventure.This is not your average shooter, nor is it your average MMO - but rather a truly sandbox world in which you are free to explore and tackle any activity you desire, whether that is completing missions from an ARES Job Board, roaming the world in search of wandering encounters, harvesting minerals while fighting off huge waves of enemies via the process of ""Thumping"", tackling campaign missions which help tell the story of the world around you, or jumping into a squad with friends and participating in some high level open-world PvP.Starting with the default 5 battleframe archetypes, you will gain access to advanced frames over time which fill more specialized roles. Your character can jump into any of your unlocked battleframes at any time, allowing you to change your playstyle to suit your mood or desired activity. You will level each battleframe individually (similar to leveling a character in a traditional MMO), finding, purchasing, or crafting gear along the way.There are 5 man instances (complete with a ""hardcore"" mode for high level characters), 20 man end-game raids, and as previously mentioned, a massive open-world PvP zone to explore.For fans of first-person or third-person shooters and action games, I highly recommend checking out the world of New Eden. It can be a bit daunting figuring out what to do at the start, but stick with it, and join an Army early on, so you always have people to play with. You'll be having a blast in no time!Good luck Ares 3-5.			"

												Started playing this game February last year or so (1.3 build) great game, loved it, but this new build ruined all the primary aspects of why i loved playing the game (except the scenery). The scenery is AMAZING, but the battleframes are junk compared to what they were, dont even care about the damage aspect of it, its what they did to the abilities and modules. If i was a new player and 1.6 was my first build to play, then it wouldnt have such an impact other than reading a flooded chat lobby of everyone complaining about how messed up everything is now. 3 major impacts that really ruined what the game was is leading me to not want to play because the way the game was in 1.3 was what i wanted the game to be in terms of abilities/weapons etc. Sure there were some glitches, and some overpowered weapons/abilities/perks, but instead of ballancing that stuff, they trashed everything in a ""throw it up in the air"" manner. The new method in equiping your battleframe is great how they itemized sections of the frame, the upgrades to the terrain are most excellent, but the mutillation of abilities just makes everything feel week and limited. All the time and effort put into learning, gathering, crafting etc, wasnt properly addressed in the compensation package they offered. All of the modules previously mounted on weapons and abilities are gone now, and salvaging what was left over doesnt cover replacing what was there before. I understand with a new build, there are going to be glitches and bugs etc, but playing the game over to get a far shadow of what was, is really hard to get behind and into.....If you are a ""new"" player and never played 1.3... GO FOR IT, mute the chat box, and blast away!!! If youre a 1.3 fan, then by all means get your feet wet, but if rhino, bastion or firecat were your top frames, then you decide. Not a fan at all			"

												Horrendously underrated. FireFall is an addictive MMOFPS with a mixure of elements from Borderlands, Sanctum 2, an a little bit of Section 8, and while it doesn't deliver on the best aspect of each one, the way it meshes together is really great, and adds for a fun experience. The way people get together whenever a mission pops up, while not original (I heard Guild Wars 2 has a similar mechanic), is a blast, which raises it above other F2P MMOs, and the gun combat is engaging and satisfying. Progression feels genuine, and more often than not, FireFall does NOT feel like a free to play game, though there are times when it does lose that illusion, such as a store window popping up for ""red beans"" and cosmetic items.

												For those of you out there looking for a god MMOFPS this is not for you. This might as well be WoW with guns. Firefall is extremely grindy as it has moving from Point A to Point B doing mediocre, pointless quests. In the game your supposed to be a baddass soldier defending the last of humanity against an insurmountable enemy called The Chosen. And for atleast the tutorial part of the game it shows this pretty well. But immediately after the tutorial is over you become nothing but an errand boy. In a fact many missions simply have you passing letters or info to different NPCs, yep thats right. And in all the time i've played this game besides the tutorial I never once fought The Chosen not a single time didnt even see them on the map. And all the NPCs have stereo typical accents and extremely shallow personalities and you dont care about any of them. And like every other typical free-to-play it tries to ♥♥♥♥♥ out money by punishing those whose dont buy the deluxe version or buy ""Red Beans"" the ingame shop currency. For example if I wanted to get one of the Advanced Battleframes as they call it would have to either grind for dozens if not hundreds of hours doing repeated boring combat (It mostly consists of killing gangsters or bugs that is it) and quests all the while listening to completely forggetable NPCs. OR I could buy the battleframe for a  low price of 9.99$! The crafting system is mediocre at best and adds even another level of grinding onto it with you having to collect many various resources and components by either killing enemies or defend mobile mining equipment. Also even once you have all the ingredient you have to refine them which if you happen to have alot can take to upwards of an hour to do so. Then theres the research tree which is literally completely horizontal and can take literally days sometimes for higher tier stuff. Now the world while large and can be at times interesting is HORRIBLY textured unless your on the highest settings. But most of the time your to busy to notice anything about it as your constantly being shot at by enemies. And since the world is so large its hard to get from location to location. Each location you go to is usually on the other side of the map and there is no easy way to get there unless you take one of the ships you have to wait for. Which is pointless if your doing a quest as those have you 99% of the time running as far out into the forest to locations you've already been to. Now the weapon and abilities are probably the best aspect of the game as many of them can be quite satisfying at times. But the only reliable way to get them is through the god awful crafting and research system. I dont recommend this game to anyone you are far better off using your time to play something else. And as a person who played the beta for dozens of hours it pains me to say this game could've been something and those who also played will know what im talking about. But this game as it stands now is nothing but typical MMO that fell in line like most of the rest.			"

												I downloaded this game with good hopes, and when I finally started playing it, I lost all hope. This game is 8GB of glitches and bugs.     Most of the quests are simply walking from Point A to Point B, then killing either 5 People with spikes on thier heads and arms who were chosen for something, or killing 30 Crab-Bug things that spawn with different abilities such as the power to commit suicide and slow you down for all of 3 seconds, and usually there is a group of about 5 to 10 Able-Bodied soldiers with Guns and Armor more powerful than yours that are sitting there acting like a civillian and the quest says ""HELP them kill 30 Crab-Bug things"" yet if they do ever decide to move thier arms up to the gun that is mysteriously floating infront of them and KILL SOMETHING, IT DOESN'T COUNT TOWARDS THE QUEST THEREFORE IT ISN'T HELPING AT ALL! Half the time when you have to kill a large amount of things they barely spawn and when they do the soldiers decide to move thier arms up to the mysteriously floating gun infront of them and kill it before you do and then you don't get to make ANY progress towards the quest and it will take about 10 minutes just for the Crab-Bugs to respawn and then they kill them again and basically from there on it's basically the same thing over and over until you get enough kills to finish the quest, and then it's back to Point A (usually on the other side of whatever town your closest to) and then you get barely any EXP and it takes about 20 more quests like that to get to the next level. And that's just the questing system.    The main reason I even slightly wanted this game was because I heard my friends talking about Motorcycles and Hang Gliding and doing this thing called ""Thumping"" where they have to defend some sort of mining rig while waves of mobs are thrown at them. Hang Gliding was probably the best part of the game in my opinion, Except for when you even slightly look up your thrown at the ground and your hang glider gets destroyed. You can't even get a Motorcycle until level 25 or apparently if you buy some DLC then you can have it from the start, along with an infinite use Rainbow Hang Gliding Pad. Also, you can't hang glide unless you step on some sort of magic pad on the ground that gives you a hang glider. Did I mention it takes a couple hours of questing to level up?    Another problem I have with this game is the NPC's. The Soldiers will wander around dangerous areas and act like civillians, and the civillians will walk around safe areas acting like they are holding a gun whenever they aren't and acting like a soldier.    And also, the character customization is awesome! (No it's not) Everything is free! (No it's not) And everything totally doesn't require some form of VIP currency! (Yes it does)    I think you should take my advice and NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! IT IS NOT WORTH IT! IT IS VERY GLITCHY AND BUGGY! Unless they take a Hot Iron to the game and Iron out all the bugs, I'm never downloading it again.			"

												Firefall is a shooter FPS, or TPS if you so choose, MMO. I apparently only played two hours (and really, those hours felt a lot longer than that!), but that short time was enough to convince me that Firefall wasn’t the game for me. The overall quality isn’t that great, graphically the game isn’t impressive, the voice acting is atrocious, combat is basic, missions are repetitive and boring. Why bother then?My first gripe with Firefall falls on the graphics, and perhaps even more on the aesthetics. First off, the game isn’t that beautiful. It really isn’t. It might resemble Borderlands, but that’s just from far away. What really annoyed me was the character design, like World of Warcraft meets Gears of War or something, but with way uglier faces. Seriously, some of the guards in town barely have something resembling a human face.Trying to get into the mood of game is made further impossible by the horrendous voice acting. In the first mission, the tutorial mission, planes crash and pilots say something like “going down!”, etc. in the most bored tone possible. It’s right out of a MST3K or Riff Trax show, but while it might be fun for a short while, it will become cringe worthy since the plot of the missions comes in the form of audible conversations.Combat is completely uninteresting: there are enemies, shoot them. The problem is even more apparent when you have to deal with it during the missions. Go from point A to point B, fight monsters. Then fight another wave of monsters. And then a few other waves of the same exact monsters again. Rinse and repeat. How is this supposed to hold my attention? It’s not like there is any difficulty to it too!On a positive note, you can switch character classes easily, but each needs to be levelled up separately. Jet packs and glider wings are a nice way to get around but the world isn’t beautiful enough to go off exploring. It’s functional, nothing more.If some people find Borderlands boring, then Firefall must put them in a coma. And if you don’t find Borderlands boring, then continue playing it, because there is nothing to see here.			"

												Played this game alot during it's closed and open beta, and I've gotta say they've changed alot of stuff since then. Alot of the changes are pretty nice too.  The beta was a glitchy, buggy, repetitve(thou still could/can be), and kinda boring due to not having any content in the game to be involved with).  Since my few hours or so playing on the steam release I do gotta say....thank god no more half pants battle thongs on my bastion battleframe chick! lol (you beta guys know what i'm talking about). Anyway, here's my pro's and con's so far for new players interested in Firefall...PROS:-Beautiful graphics and not too tolling on mid-grade computers-Action based combat system (no point and click)-Rewarding Dynamic Events-Simple crafting system (All depends on the person, some people like more complex crafting, I just find this one easy to learn and use.) (CRAFTABLE MOTORCYCLE AT LEVEL 25, AFTER DOING BOARD MISSION IN DREDGE CALLED ""In the Wheelhouse"" *hint hint*)-Guild Wars 2 style market system (trade in-game currency for cash-shop currency system)-Storyline/Personal mission progression added to the game since beta ( looks like they might develop more story later on)-Voice Acting for every mission and dynamic events (note: some of it is a bit amateur, but hey...i've heard worse in dubbed anime)-Leaching from squad thumpers don't hurt the thumper owner now-NO pay to win cash shop grabs; this one is an important one i look at when hopping into a free to play mmorpg. I'm a heavy pvper and the first thing i look at is, is the guy with the fatter wallet gonna kick my ♥♥♥?  This game avoids that 100%, everything in the cash shop is all cosmetic or getting cooler looking  and faster moving mounts and gliders and VIP boosts which just helps speed up leveling and crafting processes.-NO restrictions on free to play usersCONS:-Server stability could be a little better (we'll probly see some fixes for that soon; this could be due to busy servers)   exampes:  -occasional long loading time for missions  -occasional rubber banding -Gets repetitive at times-They are still working on balancing issues between battleframes for pvp-Farm heavy when focusing on crafting-Currency exchange: Red Beans(cash shop currency) can be bought with Credits(Marketplace currency) at a minimum of 100 Credits (Which doesn't bother me personally, but could have some more freedom on that depending on the playerbase economy)-3d modeling on characters could be better aswell as some of the cosmetic customization-Limited content compared to other mmo's (more content in the future i hope)-Able to unlock another battleframe only by getting a battleframe to level 40, using red beans, or buying the battleframe off the marketplace for a few thousand creditsThis is now my final review, now that i've put a good amount of time playing the released game.  I really enjoy this game personally and see much potential for it to develop into a bigger more grand mmo.  Keep in mind that this Pro's and Con's list was made for new players that haven't played beta. There are many things I miss from beta that I personally wish were still in the game, but who knows, maybe they'll add some stuff back in later. Anyway...I highly recomment this game, it's great for what it is. Especially if you're looking for a free to play game that doesn't restrict you heavily unless you got a fat wallet.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and please rate the review as you see fit.

												This game could have been a open world sandbox skill based shooter with Massive PVE battles, skillfull PVP, and amazing story. Then 0.5 happen an the skill aspect began to fate away, and then hackers began over running the PVP. Then they added 15 frames removing the ability to customize your frames, and adding a grindy unenojable progession system. Then the game just turned into a stupid AOE spamming party with 2 seconds CD on abilities that would last 6-10 seconds. Lasty we have this a game with feature that are all poorly designed, very grindy, boring instances, unbalanced PVP that full of hackers, and with zero sandbox elements because of the new leveling system forcing players to stay in area that fit there level an following the dull mission board story line. My best time playing this game was when they first added the chosen war system which made chosen come out of the melding, and take over watchtowers an towns. I would be heading to a town after gather materials thumbing an as i was heading back i would see a massive chosen platton just walk out of the melding, and starting capturing watchtower. Now chosen invasion are scripted events that happen ever so an so hours an weather you win them or not they don't affect anything. An the gameplay so boring, and easy now i can solo a Squad 3 thumber with max level enemies. When they first added thumber soloing a personal thumber was brutal most people could barely fill it to 50%, Now enemies would be lucky if the health of a squad 3 thumber that being defend by one player falls under 75%.Overall if you really want to enjoy this game beg the developers to reset the game to 0.4 or 0.5 (if you can stand the stupid poorly designed Tech tree progession) I personal liked 0.5 the most the tech tree was stupid, but the gameplay was great.

												Played this game during Alpha, Beta, I'm a proud Founder of it and still playing on release.  This game is not for everyone, if you played and loved such game like - Global Agenda... this game is for you.Pros:- Huge world to explore- Sandbox game which have lots to do- Random Jobs, Job board, Instance missions, Raid of 20 peoples and Open world PVP- Solo or Group Thumping anywere you want in allowed area.- Easy Crafting system, research and Refining your goods for mats and money- Marketplace to sell your mats/Gear- Very Fast paste gameplay, very addicting- Free to Play!!Cons:- Vertical Progression, you need to level each frame up from lev 1-40- When higher level, you will have to be in higher level areas... you can still help a freind as you will be dropped to a lower level in those area, but you gain near 0 exp per kill but still get some for missions.- lots of grinding and repeatition of the same missions to reach Lev 40 on a frameThis game took a long time to get release, now it's only a matter of time and patience to see if the dev will continue giving us new content.Thanks,-Fkid- "

												To start these off I played since the 2nd wave of beta, I am a VET of this game. It does and was always suppose to play like a MMO Borderlands. But reading some of the other comments some people do not feel the same way, so Im giving my views on the key issues people are talking about below. I hope you all atleast try the game and judge it yourself not what I or some one else says.Well I played more then some of these most helpful reviews. I will be honest and will be fair I played sicne the 2nd beta wave. Since then I played 5 differnt games called firefall all were great some were better but this lastest one isnt bad. I like the levels give the game some direction (Some people may not like direction but it helps the most of us out imo). I love the new crafting system anyone seen the old one would of died trying to figure it out, sure some of the things have long research or build times just like ESO so log on put some thing on the cooker go to work come back bam its done! Yo umay want to plan ahead with the crafting system which some may see as a draw back but you dont have to afk  smelting like other mmos such as WoW. The class system, I have most of the classes but I do prefer the odler way of getting classes, but now you max a character then get a new one or farm one out with credits (In game currency) which isnt easy but isnt hard either after you do it amny time it may get old but take it slow enjoy the game dont rush it.You get a free Bike if you do the right quest I had seen compalints about it but if there giving them away (Mid/late game) dont complain about them selling to those who ""want"" it early game since they have a decent taxi systemj early game making bike not a need but a want. When you ""need"" a bike is when you get the quest for it. I enjoy the game so I told them to shut up and take my money but every one is differnt its worth a try.Hope you enjoyed mt review and I hope to see you al lin the world too!			"

												To the surprise of everyone who has ever previously heard about this game, what's left of Red 5 studios actually managed to turn this trainwreck around and make it into a good and complete game less then 8 months after the schitzophrenic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a CEO, Mark Kern, who was almost singlehandedly personally responsible for the game not making any development progress in 3 years of beta, was fired.Firefall now has coherent and consistant design, along with a truly massive increase in content. It's like a mashup of Borderlands and Planetside. Definitely worth playing, it's free after all.			"

												Been playing this game since closed beta, and like all closed beta things change. The game play is very addictive, and if you got money to drop, id say buy an advance frame (about 10dollars) once you figure out what basic frame you like. And go from there.This is a true FREE2PLAY game. You do not need to spend any money if you do not want to. But it helps the game thrive, if you do. Everything in the game can be bought off the market, including the RedBeans, (Real Money Currency). The leveling system is like most MMO minus you only have one character, and use battleframes which hold the levels on each frame.The crafting system is coming along, i would assume it will still being tweak after the 29th, but once you figure out salvaging, and research points, you will be crafting in no time.Firefall feels like a true living world, and a game. If you tried it during beta, i'd recommend you give it another shot. "

												Has gone though quite the evolution and is pretty fun. Lovely open world exploration. Free to play but with some pay incentive options. Doesn't try and nickle and dime you by price locking features. I would recommend taking a look at it if you're into the Sci-Fi genre and are looking for a different MMO to try.Also I hear one of their concept artists is pretty sexy. ;3c			"

												UPDATE:  Skip to the end for impressions on the new War in the Amazon content and faction changes.I'm coming up on 400 hours of gameplay in this fellow, so I suppose I should write a review of some sort.   Much has already been written about Firefall, and while I recommend the game to anyone looking for an action MMO, I almost feel like anything I say would hardly encapsulate the game because it is always changing and shifting (with a major endgame area to be debuted in the next few weeks after I write this).I suppose what most people want to know when reading user comments on this game is: is it actually free to  play or is it ""Freemium"" nonsense where the game is basically unplayable past a certain point without investing lots of money?  Well, I can definitely attest: this game really and truly is free to play.  There is no content behind paywalls and while real money can, in theory, buy you better in-game equipment and such, everything in the game can be obtained, in some manner, through gameplay.   Now, I won't lie....paying for the VIP membership is probably the smart course for a player who enjoys the game, but the game is not unplayable without it.  People who spend lots of real money for in-game currency to buy stuff off the player market will have an advantage in PvP, I won't lie, but as PvP is an entirely seperate part of the game, the PvE kinda benefits from having some people with purchased items.  Having said all that, here's my brief pros/cons rundown:Pros:-Interesting variations in gameplay and playstyle based on the class you choose.-The perk system allows interesting synergies between different classes since the different classes can actually share most of the perks that you earn from leveling.-The game only uses ONE character who has access to all of the class ""Frames"", which makes sharing equipment easier and helps with leveling frames that are around the same level.-The singleplayer ""jobs"" actually bother to try telling a coherent story about the setting and background of the game.-A healthy amount of open world content that gives players a break from just doing jobs to level their frames.-Once you complete major milestones in the game once (like unlocking new areas etc.) the stuff unlocks for your successive frames, so you have more freedom and options with your lower level frames as you get further into the game.-Large-scale open world events allow for fun, co-op play with other players without being too exclusionary for lower level or newer players (although there are some basic level limits on certain things).-The ability to ""thump"" (mine for your own crafting resources) adds an interesting, self-initiated activity to the game.-Players share exp and loot for open world events in a very fair manner and no one player can either take all the rewards or prevent other players from getting their rewards either.Cons:-The game balance, in terms of overall difficulty, is problematic at times and is always being tinkered with.  (as I write this, major updates to how combat functions are being planned probably to be implimented in the next month or two)-A fairly good chunk of the usual bugs and glitches that large, open world MMOs have.  Some are generally fixed fairly fast, while others have been around for ages without hope of being fixed any time soon.-Getting around the world can be awkward and slow even with vehicles and gliders and other assistance.  One entire section of the game (Sertao, the world for characters lvl 25-35) has no means of quick travel at all except to go back to the exit/entrance travel points.  -The ""advanced"" frames are sometimes very superior to the normal, free, counterparts, making the base frames a little on the weak or disadvantaged side.-The major server events do not happen with anywhere near enough frequency, in my opinion.  All major events at this point only occur once an hour which can sometimes make areas of the game very barren of content depending on the time of day.-Special open world content rated for single players is not even remotely able to be finished by solo players, and often requires several people.-The in-game crafting system, while very useful and functional for character up to about level 30-32 becomes so insanely grindy and impractical in the later game that there is almost no point in using it to supply characters above lvl 32 or so.-Some of the instances and special missions have serious issues with what kind of loot they reward.  This is slowly being improved, but right now it is often not worth the time it takes to do some of the more advanced, end-game instances and such.Like any MMO, there are players who take a lot of things about this way too seriously and will often have a negative effect on the overall community, but anyone who just wants to have fun taking out some bad guys and maybe joining some large-scale events will find a lot to like here.  Just be aware that a lot of content and features have been added to the game over a relatively short period of time, so things are always being tweaked and modified.  The community, in general, has been very positive and the strong focus on PvE means that most players understand the benefits of helping out each other.  If, however, you are looking for PvP, Firefall might not satisfy you much.  While the game has an entire world set aside for PvP, it suffers from a few major problems; mostly balance and the fact that not many people play in those areas.  PvP will probably undergo major changes as well in the coming months, but right now I cannot reccomend Firefall for people who want the PvP aspect as a strong element of the game.Damn...it's almost impossible to really get into everything in this game except to say: just give it a try for a bit and see what you think.  The community is usually pretty helpful and I always try my best to help out newer players.  There is also a strong ""mentor"" system in the game where players get appointed as mentors.  A few of the mentors are jerks, but they get weeded out pretty fast.Oh, and one more thing...the game is very playable with an Xbox controller (support for which is built-in) but you will have to fiddle with it to get it where you want it.  There are a lot of hot keys in the game and it's not possible to operate the entire game witn a controller, but the bulk of the game (running around and shooting things) can be done very well with a controller.UPDATED STUFF:  So, not long after I wrote this, Red 5 did indeed add the ""War in the Amazon"" content and a new faction system, which changes some aspects of my review.The Amazon is a new region of the game geared solely towards high-level, end-game characters (the game says it's only for level 40 players, but I think level 37+ could probably handle themselves OK)  It's difficult to describe the region if you are not already familiar with the game, but to summarize it, it's basically just a place for lvl 40 characters to go nuts because there's nearly constantly combat.  It's a lot of fun, but as usual, one of the downsides is that the rewards are not that great and you need a lot of people to take over the region.   The new faction system is amazing and gets rid of so much of the grind.  Instead of having to slowly earn faction currency to buy things, you now just permanently earn reputation and can buy things with crystite (which is the standard currency) when you reach the appropriate faction level.  No more spending days of your life just trying to buy some high level abilities or weapons.			"

												Firefall. A name that means bugger all, yet is still easily insulted. Firefall is an FPSMMORPG and maybe some other letters of the alphabet with lyrics within songs that suspiciously remind of you of ♥♥♥♥. What kind? ♥♥♥♥ed if I knew, the blue kind that comes out of Aranhas. The crab-like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s within this game. You could even add RTS genre if you were commanding the monsters against the worthless human scum-- Which sounds like a much better game.Anyway, Firefall is of a genre that even when abbreviated is longer than its actual full name. But at least games no longer have fifty seven digits after them, or enough colons to make a hard drive dry heave into the jet-blasters.Oh, right, Firefall. The story starts after everything interesting happened, where the terrans, no not those ones, discover a space rock, made a ship from it because they suddenly know what space rock does, And then smashed it into the planet for plot! Well, that's my guess at least. They don't really explain why the ship crashes into the earth. Either way you were hired to use gun on bandit. Possibly smash it in the face- which is actually a more viable strategy than the guns that might as well fire BB'S. Unless you're the assault where the BB's shatter. Though, there aren't really that many bandits, it's mostly the wildlife because that's suddenly more dangerous than human with gun.Actually, everyone whinges about these space f*cks that invade earth or whatever, but you never see them until about 10 hours in, or perhaps the story quests that you only have within the first area. But who cares about the story? Well, Me. The sole patrionist of Single player. Though the story is fun, I guess. But again, it's only in the first area, so there's nothing to interest you after the first area.Too many negatives! I need to put my smiley mask on and dance around this pile of ♥♥♥♥ pretending to look I know what I'm doing, I mean until I find a good spot, like looking for carrot within vomi- I can't use that analogy because that's not hard to fin- OH I FOUND ONE! The class system is probably the best part of the game. There are five classes, 11 more that you can unlock either by dinging to level 40 with one class or using micro <Dry heave> micro transactions. ""But wait!"" I hear you say. ""I thought you were going to talk about the good parts?"" Oh, ♥♥♥♥, right. Well, you can change class whenever you find a station. You essentially change clothes, but whatever ♥♥♥♥ing reason you forget all your old skills and abilities or whatever. You do keep all your crafting <dry heave> stuff. What is it with MMO's - Wait, with ANY game now days that includes crafting. You keep all your weapons too. Though for some stupid ♥♥♥♥offing reason you have limited inventory space eventhough you have to keep everything for every single class ever. And to finish the game 100% you have to play the game about 16 timesI've managed this long without mentioning Navi- I mean the Goddess- I mean cu- Oh f*ck it, Aero. It's your decision on whatever you call her. Perhaps a French/Russian Navi who likes reminding you how what a ""great job"" you did ""taking out that bandit camp"". F*ck off Navi, I was hiding in the corner sucking my thumb because I was an engineer who was only good for hiding behind his turret, and demanding it to do all the work.Though if you've ever played the game, you would be yelling at me that it is pretty. The game is split into three sections, Coral forest, Desert, volcano. You can already see where this is going, can't you? The game starts out beautiful, and then suddenly Brown. Brown everywhere! Like you mixed all your colours together and threw them against the monitor. I actually quite enjoyed Firefall in Coral forest. It had the story mission, beautiful areas, fun missions and you didn't want to hang every character you met.You then get to the second area which is a pain in my ♥♥♥♥ to navigate. You get a vehicle at the start of the area, which is nice, but what the f*ck is that going to do when the rest of the game mostly has canyons? There are also consumable glider pads which make navigation that much more fun from higher areas, but I swear the canyons were designed to be big enough for you to not be able to fly over. It is as if they do not want you to get to your destination. One town genuinely has been walled off so there's only one way in.So previously the game was in all the colours of the rainbow, which enjoyed dancing across the room, jumping into your eyes then f*cking your ear lobe. You then enter desert land, lava land with so much brown you would confuse it with a modern FPS. OH WAIT-- "

												The name is accurate now, for it fell, and it is most certainly burning.Ignore my hours, as I actually have played this game off-steam.Firefall is a game that has been plagued with bad decisions for some time now. Almost as long as it's been losing players, in fact. Slowly, but steadily, the game shifted from amazing me with its quality, to instead amazing me with just how terrible the devs could prove themselves to be. It's kind of like most shows on TV these days, with the only exception being that you don't come in with the expectation of it being terrible from the get-go.With the most recent update, the game finally stopped clinging onto mixed-quality limbo and dropped into the flaming pit of no return, screaming in agony with Electronic Arts, Activision, Ubisoft, Aeria Games, Nexon, and Perfect World Entertainment. Purchased by a Chinese company, Firefall was pressured into pushing out an update that wasn't even ready, and my goodness was it ever not ready. ""The update that killed Firefall"" as the community calls it, has essentially taken what little good there was left in the game and thrown it out the window. Or rather, that's what I would say, except they actually did that quite some time ago, so really what's going on here is they dragged the game back in, decided it wasn't dead enough, so they then drove a knife through its heart and threw it from the roof instead of the window, then finally ran out there with a hammer and hit it once, just to be sure. In one single update, this has gone from a good free to play title with a few flaws to ""how not to run an F2P 101"".No quality remains. You can salvage more from the debris of a nuclear apocalypse than you can from this game. The only thing between this game and death is the server being shut down. If you are a new player debating whether or not to play this game, I STRONGLY recommend you decide against it, for all you will be doing is wasting your bandwidth, harddrive space, and time. There are many other F2P games out there, and at this point, almost all of them are better than this.Even if you much prefer tormenting yourself with repetitive gameplay, bad design choices, and bugs, you'd still be better served with the latest CoD title instead. Because this game is so bad now, that even if you were - for some reason - wanting to play a game that was bad, you'd still feel that this was too terrible for you.			"

												A thin, empty, boring, and pointless game of go-there-kill-that in which the only goal seems to be progression for progression's sake; hit the next battleframe level and research the next weapon level, always for miniscule, uninteresting stat increases. I played across four different areas and reached level 11, and I think that's giving it more than a fair shake before declaring it DOA and uninstalling.There's a fairly solid platform here for a game, but right now that's all it is.  Let me know if they implement a reason to care.			"

												I can't get over how clean this game is. Everything seems incredibly accessible, tightly packed and gorgeous. A few UI hiccups and the normal MMO bugs like odd mob spawning and lag seem to be worked around so it's not too bad.I played a bit of closed beta so I'm glad to see this game finally released, I'll update my review after I get a few more levels and hours!*Edit* 17 hours in and I'm addicted. I've been craving an MMO and FF far exceeded my expectations. I wish it was a bit more FPS than MMO but I can't complain. For a f2p, this game is tight. Better than most current MMO's.*57 Hours Edit* Well I'm almost level cap and I'm excited to play a new class tomorrow for the actual launch. I'm thinking engineer but I want to hit 40 to get a pilot token and unlock Dragonfly.I'm upset there's hardly any low level pvp, and I'll give a new edit after I hit cap and kill other people. I'm excited, but almost 60 hours in and I'm almost level cap with the 25% bonus experience, I'm very sure that there's not enough choices when it comes to grinding to get to cap level without VIP status. So while I want to say it'd be an extra 20 hours of grinding, it's even worse than that, because there's hardly enough missions after level 20 to get to the next level appropriate zone even with the Exp Boost. You'll probably end up running around, looking for ARES missions, crashed lgvs/thumpers and tornados.Unless you just want to Thump all day with people. It's a damn good thing that's actually fun to do.			"

												Pretty good game. Not for the lone wolf-type players. (usually). Seems to be, a little lack-luster in the concept-area (post-public-patch that is), but the ideas and concepts that are present prove quite satisfying. Me being terrible at everything FPS, this game is rough for me. Though some call this an ""RPGFPS,"" I would simply say it's an FPS with a decent story. Character customization is simple, but enjoyable. Not much -more- effort other than the option -to- customize your character is apparent at the moment. (a.k.a. no customizing hair under a particular hat you like, no customizing your ""undersuit"" that goes under your Battleframe). Not deeply customizeable, yet as I said, the options available have been of amiable satisfaction to me. Enough to enjoy the game.In all sincerity, do NOT approach this game as a die-hard FPS. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. This game was not INTENDED to be a die-hard FPS. For those of you that have those split-second reaction-speeds and superior reaction times, this game might be a bit of a breeze for you.Most importantly, this game is STRONGLY based on community. Something I LOVE about this game. It's the only real reason I can/come back to, this game. Alot of good players on this game that enjoy both investing themselves, as much as helping others.My rating on a scale of 1-to-5?2. (maybe 2.5)Most definitely worth playing. Maybe even worth a couple of bucks to buy some fun in-game material.(This rating is opinion-based, and comes strongly from the stand-point of an RPG player. Not an FPS player).			"

												It gave me a great first impression. Yes, you will see lots of bugs/glicthes and those texture loadings and even some places that can make you stuck for no reason. I certainly think they will fix it soon. Pretty large world and varieties of missions. But one thing is that the vehicles don't have many types. I think it only consists of a ranger and a bike. Neverthless the negativity I like this game. It will grow better if the developers focus on adding more content and fixing the game.			"

												Firefall... It's a mix of 'whoa' and 'eeh' kind of game. I can't quite describe it with precise word, but that's how I feel. I, for one, quite liking the lore. They even have timeline tree and a comic series to give you insight why the world you are in is a FUBAR.- The gameplay isn't really bad. It's like what you expected. Guns, someone died, loot.- The currency system is well thought out, you can't be a poor guy, because currencies are interchangable.- The quests... It's uuh... pile of mess, to put it kindly. I hate that random events on the street.- The leveling system. After you go to the top level (40), you can replay all that mission from level 1 with new frame. Nuh-uh. NOPE. NO ♥♥♥♥ING WAY I'll retrace myself from the first quest. It's not called grinding, it's called a chore, almost slavery.The reason I still give it thumbs up because I (maybe you) really enjoyed the first half of the journey. After level 25, the novelty is gone.			"

												Firefall is the MMO worth playing. It is free to play. You do not have to pay to win, but I would advise a player to at least  buy a glider and bike for traveling purposes. While you can get both without having to pay, it is worth the early investment for time.  I use the glider probably as much or more than the bike. The advanced frames (classes)are unlocked by maxing your level on the regular ones, or you can buy a new frame with the in-game currency. Most real money expenses come from cosmetics an short xp buffs. You don't need them to do well. The classes are all useful in one way or another. The ""Thumping"" in the game is very enjoyable. Thumping is a way of mining, which is basically a ""Protect this drill and kill everything that tries to eat it"" game. There are invasions where the enemy Chosen will try to take over a city. There are real consequences if you let them do that (no access to quests/vendors in the area until it is retaken). The storyline is also worth looking into; it will enrich the traveling and questing experience.			"

												If you have ever played Global Agenda then you must try this. Firefall is everything and more we wanted from GA. and for the rest of you which have not played GA. if you like OPEN world freedom, in this game the sky is the limit. FPS or TPS shooter with a very sound and improving dynamics of gameplay. Crafting/ Refining/ Research... it has it all. open world instancing and an open party system make aiding a player rewarding not for just them but you get a portion of the turn in as well. even though you werent there from the start... you get a lil thank you for your aid. it is free to play once it launches on the 29th. I have been in game since closed beta and i can say it has come a very long way. Red5 does, for sure, know what there doing and listened to there comunity. please check this game out.			"

												Not interested in a full review? Well here you go: This game is awesome, one of the best developers (if not the best). Can't see any pay-to-win either. Is pretty grindy, but hey, it's an MMO. Just try it.I've been in beta for nearly 2 years. This game was in beta for an eternity, because Red 5 actually wanted to release a good game, not like many others today, releasing half-finished/broken games.Nearly every game system/mechanic has been overhauled a dozen times, which, in my oppinion, shows, that they really want to find the best systems for this game.The developers really listen to the community and are overall just awesome.The game itself has awesome graphics, has a customizable UI and allows UI addons.The story itself seems solid so far, but further episodes are not out yet. Most of the missions are replayable instances which are actually really fun. They also feature hardcore modes with all enemies at the maximum level.The level cap is set at 40, though there are 16 frames (which are kind of like classes) that all have to be levelled individually. To earn experience you either do the mission instances, ARES Jobs/mission which are comparable to repeatable quests in many MMORPGs, do open world events or thump. I'd recommend getting some friends in, since higher quality thumpers (for better resources) and high level ARES Jobs are pretty hard.What is thumping? It's basically mining. You call down a thumper which attracts enemies and has to be defended by you. Once it's full you recall it and get resources, which are used for crafting.Crafting is one of the major aspects in this game. It's one of the ways to acquire better gear. You can also rely on drops, but it will probably take quite some time to find, what you're looking for.The areas are vastly different, you will encounter pretty much everything from frozen to desert, with according enemies.If you're ever bored, just go around and explore the world.The nice thing is: You can go nearly everywhere on the map, no matter the level. You will probably be dying a lot in the high level areas, but it's not all about levels... if you are good at the game, you can also handle high level enemies. It's skill-dependent up to a certain degree.The movement is also very unique in Firefall. You can walk and run, of course, but there are also Light and Medium Ground Vehicles to transport you faster. You have jumpjets, which are like jetpacks. You have enough energy to go about 3 seconds into the air, but it quickly recharges. This system allows for advanced movement. Another way to move around the world are ""gliders"", which will launch you a few meters in the air and give you temporary wings, allowing you to glide through the air. If you want to go from one major town to another, you can also use the Dropships, which are free. Just enter them and wait to arrive at your destination. You can also directly teleport, but that (at least right now) costs a ridiculous amount of money.There are 5 different types of frames, each with 3 (one with 4) different frames.-Assault, which is focused on mobility and damage. The primary damage is a type of plasma cannon, firing a ball of energy, which explodes on impact.-Biotech, the healer/poison class, has different primary weapons, depeding on the frame you choose-Dreadnaught. Tanky Machine gun dudes. One of the frames has many different weapons, from shotguns over SMGs to Assault Rifles.-Engineer, which has a short ranged laser/tesla gun. Supported by his own placed turrets. Can also deploy health/ammo stations, making him a supportive guy.-Recon. Sniper. Depeding on the frame, you can have an auto-sniper or charge rifle.But just because the Biotech for example can heal, that doesn't mean that you don't deal damage, every frame can also survive alone, if the player has some skill, but grouping up is of course more effective.If you like supporting others but are afraid that you can't play alone - don't be afraid, you can. Also, you can always group up with some random people around the world.Each frame type has the ""basic"" frame and 2 or 3 advanced versions. Once you hit level 40, you can unlock another frame. The advanced frames have some advantages, making them mandatory, if you wanna go all out on Firefall, but if you just want to play it casually, you don't have to do it - the advanced frames are not even 1.5x stronger than the basic ones.As I just said, if you wanna go all out, you'll have to use the advanced ones, because levelling frames will unlock new perks. Perks are passive abilites which you can equip. Perks cost a certain amount of points, depeding on their tier. You have a limited amount of points which depends on your level, so you have to choose the perks that fit your playstyle/frame best.Each frame also has 3 skills plus one HKM. The skills are only limited by cooldown and cover nearly everything. Place turrets, heal teammates, poison enemies, burn them, shoot stuff at them, get more defense, etc.HKMs are kind of like ultimates. They have to charge up (by doing damage) and deal massive damage or provide a massive buff.The game has a marketplace, where you can buy and sell cosmetics, pets (which have no effect), gear and even Red Beans (real-money currency)! Some people may argue, that it's pay to win, because you can buy good gear with real money, but it can also be obtained by playing the game and as stated before, gear/level isn't everything. You also need skill.Also the launcher is quite notable - it uses none (in the Steam version)! It actually updates itself via the Steam-update-system! There are not many MMOs out there which do that...There is also Open World PvP, but I haven't tried it yet. If requested, I will add few lines about that. The ""problem"" with it is, that it's not really balanced, so people of level 40 will have a major advantage over low level players, making open world PvP a type of endgame content.Raid bosses are also available at level 40, but since I'm not at that level yet, I can't review those.Overall an exceptional game, with many unique mechanics.The early levels may be kind of boring, but for me it got more fun, the higher level I got.Now for the bad things. The ARES Jobs are all pretty similar and repetitive, consisting of much running around and can be pretty tough at higher levels, if done solo. Also there are some bugs, but I haven't encountered anything game breaking yet.If you dislike repetitive questing/grinding* until you reach the level cap, don't like dynamic events or different/unique gameplay Firefall is most likely not the game for you.*There are many ways to earn experience, but the most consistent and thus fastest for most players are the repetitive ARES Jobs, or instances which will probably get boring if you do them over and overWanna know how fast you can reach the level cap? 50-90 hours, depending on skill, playstyle, solo/group, boosts and such stuff. But after reaching the level cap you still need the perfect gear, of course... and levelling the other 15 frames.The first ten levels will take probably 5 hours10-20 my guess is 10-20 hours20-30 I'd estimate around 20-30 hours30-40 will need 40 or more hoursThese times are assuming that you're new and don't have boosts or anything.P.S: It's probably even faster now, since they increased the spawn rate of dynamic events and rewards for ARES Jobs.If you have newbish questions about the game, there are many guides on Steam. The official forums have some nice information as well (you might also want to visit them to get some addons). And finally there are ""mentors"" ingame, people who volunteered to help by answering questions. You can spot them by the green leaf in front of their name.Anything I forgot? Want more details on something? Let me know!			"

Firefall is uniquely brilliant, and some of the most fun I've had in a shooter.The game is free. Totally free! It supports itself through sales of cosmetics in various forms and convenience, almost all of which can also be acquired with in-game currency on the marketplace. There is no Pay2Win here at all!It's a beautiful world to explore and you will love the sheer amount of mobility you have. There are dropships, ground vehicles, gliders and jetboots/packs to cover all of your terrain traversal needs!I cannot recommend this game highly enough!			"

Check out Em-8ER if you want to see the spiritual successor to the game when it was good.This was the best game I have ever played in beta stages, solid 10/10.  My girlfriend even loved it(what a blessing)!!!Then the patches happened.  They removed the best working parts of the game and changed the progression system in favor of lazy people.  Now, I can honestly say that the first timer Unity games that are released on here are a better choice.Sure it is free to play, but it is currently a waste of your time.

												This is a fantastic MMO. I love it. Rather than telling you about abstract qualities however, I'll just give an example of play. So this is what happened to me. I began in a richly detailed and populated city wearing a BattleFrame. I moved over to a terminal and got a mission from the local post-apocalyptic authority to help find a lost girl. I moved over to a glider-pad, was launched into the air and with a sonic-boom was projected forward with wings extended. I glided (under my own direction) down to a ridgeline before arriving at a bug-infested canyon. I proceeded to blast and grenade my way to gory victory by engaging in both horizontal and vertical combat before my ‘operator’ told me to start looking inside the bugs for the girl’s genetic material. Awesome. With no genetic material found (she had not been eaten), I was directed over the hill in search of her SIN ID. That was went I came across another player managing a Thumper (basically a piece of mining equipment). She was holding off scores of bandits trying to steal her stuff. Back to back we fought, dropping goons all around us while exchanging instructions and words of encouragement. Achievement and experience were flashing before us as we looted the looters. Nothing was stolen or claimed and everything was fair. Finally, with a cinematic boost, the Thumper launched into the air and I was rewarded. She thanked me before I continued my mission. I found the lost girl, finally, who had simply run away from home. As the mission was random (or at least I think it was) she happened to be in the middle of a nest. The ground erupted around us and the fighting began, as I struggled to save her. Turns out a convoy was being attacked nearby too so the result was a three-way firefight that got even more complicated when a team of three other players turned up. The gun-play was amazing and everyone had a great time fighting off the staggering number of critters that were involved. That was when I returned to base and began crafting. Let’s just say that the fun continued long after this.The graphics are amazing, the quests are dynamic, the gameplay is solid and the community is supportive. Seriously, buy this game now.     "

Second the bugs in game are really annoying and the worst one is that at the entery point of your first mission with the name of EVERYTHING IS SHADOW you can not enter it because when you activate the console you return to your place instaead of the lab or what ever and I asked from other players and thei games is bugged too. so it is not my problem only.

												What to say about this... First of all, I am... Sad, truly and deeply sad. I was one of the first 500 in the game, and was a commander tier backer. The 100 dollar tier.I would play this nearly every day before it was even on steam, for many hours. It kept me entertained, kept me coming back... Then, the money nation attacked, of course. Capitalism is a tool for improvement, but when you care too much about the money, and not enough about your product, it becomes the bringer of ruin. The Chosen have won here, men. Humanity has fallen, and our battleframes are all broken. Godspeed you magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. In retrospect, I had a hell of a lot of fun with this, it was new and interesting when things were still actively being developed, of course. The game had... So, so much promise. So very much promise that it could be something absolutely wonderful, and for a time... It was. Now, however? It's gone. May we find a brighter future for humanity.Commander MalachiteMG signing off.

												I've been in Firefall for a while. Been interested in it since the infamous presentation at 2011 PAX. Not too long after that, I got in Closed Beta in one of first invitation waves.The game really had potential. Unfortunately, throughout 2012 and 2013 there were some catastrophically bad decisions that were implemented in game. I've completely lost interest in it, so I took a break in 2013 and rarely would check up on it.I've tried it again now that its officialy out, and I've gotta say: I'm amazed. They have completely turned the game around. It finally feels good, the design and mechanics make sense and are fun. It finally feels like it did over 2 years ago, and it feels good.Firefall is definitely one of best F2P games out there at this moment.			"

												to be honest its had some funny/interesting features in design and early it was even fun.but generally, game, both universe and approach to development and some of technical decisions are just smoldering pile of ... as business/customer relationships.i was tried it from time to time in each generations of development but generally most developers and sofware engineers apparently had no clue what are they doing, but art, landscape are quite good and characters, sometimes(can't say same about ""RPG elements"" of, say skills, crafting, thruming, guilds/factions, etc).so my verdict was: unless you Extremely curious(some gamers was. including mine) - don't waste you time, either you are gamer or investor.

												I started Firefall up for the first time and accidentally spent 6 hours on it. At the lower levels levelling up isn't too much of a grind, especially if you end up wading into a few fights above your level. The game looks good, the environment is interesting and makes you want to explore a bit and so far the 'jobs' or objectives I've been doing have been holding my attention. You get a bit of backstory about the world you're in with most of the jobs, which is nice. You pick up knowledge about the world you're in as you go along.Fighting the chosen (the bad guys) can feel a little overwhelming and frustrating as, if there aren't many players around you can get swamped pretty quickly, but the other players seem happy to get stuck in when they see another player in need, whether is't with a swarm of critters or a platoon of chosen. Decent bit of fun for no cost. Also, you can dance.			"

												sadly i fell in love with this game when i started playing before 1.6 update.it was awesome that i had 5 battleframes to play (all we get is one charecter before 1.6), so i played how i wanted with my friends.missions had random spawn points, you could take the same mission and do it in diferent places.you had to level a battleframe to max to get point for a premium battleframe.it was fun to fight the brontodon king, it was hard to kill and as a world boss it was needed many players to kill it.soo many other good things like crafting, thumpers and events.all is gone now, no more joy to start the game, a bug in the remake of the game made me get all premium frames with out any work, the brontodon king is weak and predictable,and no one fears it any more, i would die 20 times during BK now it looks like he does'nt wanna kill you.crafting is gone, thumper only gives money and helps to load an world event that is too easy to even care.missions are not random anymore, are more linear and boring... why would i keep playing firefall? no more level up to get frames, level up to get stronger? i dont even know my char anymore, firefall was alive, now its just a zombie...

												I beta tested this years ago and it was marvelous. I quit this game 6-8 months ago due to the endgame missions not launching and not being able to grab endgame gear. I just booted this game up again today and I leared that the biggest army in the game which was one I was a part of, quit. No players online from the Army. Only a few players in the zone chat who said the dev's were all let go and the game since I last got online has been abandoned. This was one of the best free MMO games I have ever played and it all went downhill so fast. I don't think they will ever get this game up and running again. Sad days.			"

But now, now the developers have destroyed everything that had made the game great. This abomination of what once was a great game is barely even a shadow of its former self, it would be more correct to call it a mockery. Unless the developers attempt to fix this peice of garbage, this game should be forgotten.I used to love it, now they ruined it.			"

												So, I've played almost 500 hours of this game, and while I liked the idea behind it, the steps that they're taking are going to be the killing-blows on this game. Basically, the devs are aware that the game is a shambling shadow of what it was and what it could have been, but instead of fixing that, they put old bandaids on a rupturing dam. Their 'fixes' don't fix anything. It looks to me, like the people who are ""programming"" this game don't know how to program at all. The original guy in charge of this was booted, and it's been butchered since... So I'm gonna leave this here as a result...https://www.change.org/p/crixa-labs-make-ember-a-spiritual-successor-to-firefallThey need to just let this ♥♥♥♥ing die so someone with some capability and a desire to see this ♥♥♥♥♥how saved can take over.

												What to say about this... First of all, I am... Sad, truly and deeply sad. I was one of the first 500 in the game, and was a commander tier backer. The 100 dollar tier.I would play this nearly every day before it was even on steam, for many hours. It kept me entertained, kept me coming back... Then, the money nation attacked, of course. Capitalism is a tool for improvement, but when you care too much about the money, and not enough about your product, it becomes the bringer of ruin. The Chosen have won here, men. Humanity has fallen, and our battleframes are all broken. Godspeed you magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. In retrospect, I had a hell of a lot of fun with this, it was new and interesting when things were still actively being developed, of course. The game had... So, so much promise. So very much promise that it could be something absolutely wonderful, and for a time... It was. Now, however? It's gone. May we find a brighter future for humanity.Commander MalachiteMG signing off. For the last time.			"

												You know, I haven't played this for too terribly long but here is a first impressions. It is similar to Desiny and Defiance combined. This game has a lot of potential. Thay being said, most of it is just that, potential. You can't go underwater which is disappointing, it feels like there isn't enough loot at all, even trash loot to scavenge or sell, and I don't even think you can just sell it but the salvaging system helps that. Also, you have to build or pay for a one use vehicle that disappears. Considering the distances you travel, it'd be better if it stayed with you. It did a lot of things right though.There is a decent crafting system from what I can tell, the salvaging system seems legit, being able to mine resources is awesome, decent gunplay and adding jetpacks (even if they are lacking) and having such a huge world. Now if only it was filled more with creatures that just roam around.In conclusion, i'd try it, but i wouldn't blame anyone for not liking it			"

												I played this game back in Alpha and Beta.   To be completely honest i did not find it entertaining fully understanding that it was still being developed.  After a few months of some patches and fixes i got back into it, to see how things were.  It had got a little bit better.  I found myself with nothing to do, this was in early 2014.  So I waited practically a year now and decided to give it a whirl again.  I knew there had been many major updates and over hauls.  From then till now.Then.  I couldnt play it.  Idea was great the game played great, but lacked content and drive.Now.  I cant stop playing.  in the last two weeks just launching from steam i put in 80 hours and loving it.  Thats is not including the non steam hours i put into it.Take backs.Too many complaints about the crafting and resource system made them simplify things.   Major Bummer in my opinion.  The old crafting system was Very Complex and had a strong learning curve.  That particular feature was great.Too many babies that didnt want to put in the effort made them simplify it.  8 year olds can craft now.  In the beginning there were loads of kids playing.  Im talking whiney, moany, suckin on the teets babies.  The Matureaty level for the players was UGH.  Not even joking.  Hated it.But ill tell you what.  Since all the changes Us older folk have been able to appreciate the progress that this game has gone through.  It is very playable and entertaiing now.  All i can simply say is try it.  Its free to play, and if you dont like it you dont have to play it.  put in about 20 hours or so  get a feel for it.  Then make ur decision.			"

												So Last time I posted a positive review.  You can see it here http://pastebin.com/Apz8Myfd but now I am doing a huge 180 based on highly opinionated reasons.I've played since closed beta and have trudged through the hell that everyone has talked about with optimism.  I can still play the game as is how I have been doing it (which is the wrong way) but that is beside the point.  With the recent sacking of the original developers--multiple times--enough is enough.There is no real point to compare a game from beta to present, especially one that has gone through major changes as much as this one has.  One before official launch, and I can't count the in between because I refuse to do so, and the Devil's Edge update...all fundementally erasing previous gamestyles to the point of re-learning the game.Yes the Beta was great, I'm a huge Tribes 2 fan....that is why I played in the beta.  Over the course of the years, the game became less skill and more easy-to-button-spam kill--which is why with the last recent update I went ""screw this, I'm just gonna use the melee weapons they gave us--ps...it was fun to do that.That melee only challenge is still something I can do in this game as is...as a pet project.The truth of the matter is what has happened.  Red5 may have a controversal history that even I don't know much about--nor really care--but the recent event of them all getting sacked is the final straw for me.  I will be optimistic for Red5, but the publishers and multiple developers that keep forcing them to make a game they didn't want has to stop.  This ALMOST happened with my favourite game (Guns of Icarus Online), so I happen to kinda understand the hell developers have with the game and publishers who just want money...Sorry FireFall, you were a great concept, but it's time to finish your grave.

												Note:  I have played this game far more than my steam hours show ( I am surprised it shows any at all since I rarely launch through steam).This game is a flawed and incomplete masterpiece.This is a third person shooter / online rpg that does a great job at making interesting classes, an incredible job of creating a world that feels ""alive"", and an exceptionally fair f2p model.  You will want to play through the areas again and again with your lower levelled classes, as they are all enjoyable.  The world is overflowing with events, and though standard questing has been added it can be ignored in favor of endless events (thank goodness, because the questing kinda stinks).  I have never felt pressured to spend money, though I have (once, on a good deal for a respawnable glider).  All classes can be unlocked by levelling your other classes, and the in game currency can be exchanged for the premium currency.The game is beautiful, bringing a vibrant outlined look with a sci fi setting that somehow feels right.  Inspirations from the Tribes series are seen in the jetpacks, the art design, and the class design.  The music is similarly beautiful, particularly the ambient synth tracks and the mournful piano melody.  Sound brings the same excellence in quality, though occassional bugs have me hearing an object producing static instead of the intended effect.For the problems, though, which do exist;- the game continues to have bugs.  It is a large game, so it is to be expected, but I feel like they should be worked on some more.- the game used to have very limited content.  This has since been expanded with more events, more zones, the main storyline, and the quest system... but the storyline and quest system kind of stink.  As such you will likely find yourself focusing on doing the event missions over and over, and even though the missions are random and will have different enemies and objectives, they will take place in the same locations.- the grind.  With one of the (many) revamps of the game mechanics, the focus was changed from crafting focus to levelling focus.  To get the most out of your frame, you will need to level up several frames.  Right now it seems to me like the perks you get for levelling frames are not so powerful as to force you to level them all, but are still coming off as rewarding.  Others may feel differently.- slow updates.  The game does not seem to have enough people working on it to pump out updates at the pace of.. pretty much any other game.  I assume this is because of their overly generous f2p model, which basically lets people have the game without spending a cent.  Maybe I will stop being part of the problem and spend a little more on it.- finally, it must be said that the developers of this game have completely revamped the game many times.  Now that they consider the game ""released"" I do think it is less likely that we will see another complete rework of the game, but it is worth noting that there have been some extreme changes several times since the game became playable.To wrap it up, this is an amazing game that I think must be played.  It is the type of game that you fall in love with and then end up resenting for not being as incredible as it could have been.  Just do not forget that it is still pretty incredible even with the shortfalls it has.  If you ever thought Tribes would make a good PvE game, or thought that a shooter could make a good MMO, you need to try this game.  If you just like co op, you should try this game.  If you like open worlds with tons of events, you should try this game.  Really, give it a shot already, the whole thing is free.			"

UPDATEAs of November 29th, 2016, Firefall's FIRST mission and every mission up to level 34, has been offline for OVER 60 days!The business practices in the last month by the parent company, The9, have been deceptive, deceitful, and, as far as the Rhode Island Attorney General's office is concerned, is illegal.  Widely known and in news sites everywhere, Red5 employees have all been laid off as of July, minus 2 employees, who no longer reside in the USA but hold the title of Red5 employee's for deceptive purposes, explained later..  The company still operates the game while allowing unknowing customers to purchase Red Beans, who are in fact not receiving what they purchased, with NO form of support because the support section of there website has been offline for quite some time, and of course Valve wont step in.  The website has no recent information or any information stating the details of the games future as a PC game here on Steam or any public news about the Red Bean/Support section issue.  For the last week and a half, the games server has been on and off many times a day and so have the websites operated by Red5/The9.  These issues expand to users not being able to activate missions or field jobs and is not operational minus being able to walk around the maps.  While all these issues have been occuring, the supposed Red5 employees have been coming onto the game and the forum telling players they are ""fixing"" things yet its obvious nothing has been done and things have only gotten worse. The game was removed from Steam recently but had returned 4-5 days later.  This should NOT have happened unless who ever is managing the game contacted Valve, which is an extremely deceitful move in itself.  This game should be removed with no chance whatsoever to return here on Steam. I began playing 4 months ago here on Steam and moved to there client version with over 100 hours.  I am not angry or biased in anyway.  I am concerned for anyone else who decides to decide to play this game and learns it isnt playable.			"

												 I started in the Closed beta years ago. Before It was put on steam i had hundreds of hours into this with a big group of friends and I. That is until the directors attacked. Used to be actual free roam going where you want when you want. Now it's level based... They took a game that was perfect and we loved it. It's all I ever played. Then they just ♥♥♥♥ all over it. Making it the same as every other action MMO out there. It has nothing special anymore. Most of us old firefall players will be moving to Em8er. They accept your firefall founder status there.			"

												TL;DR: Firefall was once a great great game, still have some great 3d combat mechanics with the jetpacks and dinamic fights, but since the launch been suffering and right now is slowly dying with a incomplete story and no dev team working on it.Played this game a lot during the beta, awesome, wasn't really a story wasn't a problem, it was pretty awesome and dinamic combat mechanics, crafting and resources mechanics too (""thumping"" or using giantic drill to mine the ground after resources and defend that machinary till the ""thumping"" end was one of the main mechanics and really fun to do, while rewarding too as you would use those resources to craft new better gear), the game was just incredible to play with friends no matter how simple some aspects would be.It wad a really really long beta (years), with more than a few changes since the start, right on the launch a lot of the game was changed a LOT, more like modern MMORPG, same cenario and story based on it, not bad, but pretty diferent and weird to play after being used to the old way, went away for a long time and about 2-3 years after tried again for missing the dinamic combat and the fun of thumping. I went back and played for a few months before getting bored and dropign it.The combat is still pretty fun, dinamic and awesome, and the storyline isn't great but it's good enough (for while it last, somewere on the way to the end at mid of the last map avaible now, the story mission just stop and leave you hanging with a lot of just presented and unanswer questions around), mostly sad the crafting is gone right now, with a promisse of getting back maybe in the future, but leaving getting gear limited to doing the side repetable (random) missions and daily stuff, what also made thumping pretty useless except for getting fast exp, as right now it only give money instead of resources. So around the end the game become just grind for gear and level other classes running around doing ""dinamic events"" like stuff or repetable missions, the only real endgame being 2 or 3 raids and time to time some big event that as far as I've seen and hear from other people playing for longer usualy break and stop happening for weeks till the devs fix it.As a side short info about the dev studio, Red 5 was once a great studio with great ideas, the beta went between hell and heaven cause their old kinda crazy (not in a good way) lead, but they someway worked hard to make things work and the game be great. As I could dig later when I started playing again, somewere between that moment and now almost all of the original staff were fired or leaved Red 5, and last year all Red 5 dev team was been fired with no one being on it since.

												TL;DR and Pros and Cons at bottom.Firefall is an interesting and diverse take on the FPSMMO genre of games, allowing a player to take on many different roles, and exploring team dynamics in a way very few other games have mastered. Each squad member will find themselves useful and needed at one point or another because of something that only they can do, and that's one of the things that makes Firefall a beautifully executed game. However, it's certainly not without it's faults. There are several instances where the game will become a long stretch of repetitive mission grinding, or thumping for resources. It can be excruciatingly annoying when you have to grind just to level up your character, doing missions that are essentially 'go here, press e, go there, kill these guys, etc.' The game does redeem itself however. Some of these missions you find at ARES job boards actually have fairly interesting stories and characters interwoven into them, making the repetitveness worth it. For example, a job at Sunken Harbor had me laughing quite a bit at a character known as the Meddler. Her personality was so over-the-top ridiculous, that it was hard to NOT love her. In addition to the job boards, the game builds upon the story through campaign missions which can be played at any time, so long as you meet the minimum level requirements. Some of these campaign missions will have you traveling into dangerous territory in order to save a crashed dropship pilot. Others will have you escorting a cart carrying broken equipment. Even more will pit you against seemingly endless waves of enemies as you desperately try to keep your foothold in their territory. That's what makes Firefall beautiful. It's an incredible experience, and I highly recommend you jump into this enthralling universe.TL;DR // PROS AND CONS:Firefall is a very different take on the FPSMMO genre of games, and is well worth your time.PROS:Massive worldGreat graphicsPlethora of random eventsDiverse classes allowing for incredible team dynamicsTons of weaponsPlayer-driven economy system via the in-game MarketplaceOtherwise, ridiculously funCONS:Can be extremely grindyMissions found on Job Boards tend to be repetitiveSomewhat steep learning curveOVERALL RATING: 9.5/10			"

Kills grant virtually no experience and loot so there's no reason to ever get into fights unless it's needed for one of the incredibly boring random job board quests.Oh yeah and you can't try out perks (passives) without equipping them, which occupies perk points.

												Firefall has fallen into the category of games that... Bring me back to what the word ""Fun"" means. Many modern titles try to push quest lines, and stuff like that. Firefall has a decent questline, but it isn't what truly brings me towards it. It's the sheer amount of random, silly, dumb, stupid, but amazing things you can do with your time. It's both entertaining as a system to work with, through jobs, events, and thumping. When I'm not doing that, I'm trying to explore, and climb the tallest structure near me. The best game in my opinion, is the game in which you are so unrestricted in your choices, that you can play your own games within the game. The last game I've played that was this entertaining was Halo 3. Some people might look at me as if I were crazy for saying that, but Halo 3 in it's day, you didn't have to play the game as the game itself. Matchmaking was mediocre at best, and the storyline was short. But the Foundry, the Custom Games options, and the fact you and a couple of friends could do what you set your hearts out to on your own, made it worth every weekend night I spent making memories.Firefall gives me that precise feeling, all over again. It's a great game. I hope whoever reads this review will give it a try, and if they do, don't try to play it as though it were a conventional quest-driven MMO. It isn't. It's whatever you, and a couple of your buddies want to make it be.5/5			"

												I really want to reccomend this game, but I simply can't. At first it felt like this awesome new MMO, with all sorts of pretty areas to explore, cool designs on the character models and intresting weapons to use. But after that, you get to the gameplay, which I can only describe as boring. Basic ""run over here and kill 10 enemies"" quests over and over again without variation. Walking to the quest areas is chore itself. They arent simply a couple feet away from the safe area, the quest areas are generally 500 to 1000ft away! With the only mobility being the glider at the safe area, you still gotta walk all the way back! Very little fun to be had with this game.But it's not a pay to win game, i'll give it that.			"

												I initially played Firefall because I was intrigued by its premise...but I was unfortunately unamused by the execution.  Standard gameplay largely consists of being tasked to go to a place, shoot at things, then go to other places to shoot at things until you return to the place you started.  Often these tasks consist of multiple jaunts of 400+ meters of travel and all this running quickly becomes dull even with the jetpack your character is supplied with (The jets are primarily for upward mobility rather than lateral movement).  While there do exist ways to expedite the time involved in travel by way of gliders and temporary vehicles (With, as I understand it, permanent vehicles available at level 25?  Apologies if I'm wrong in this regard as I was unable to keep motivated to play to that point).I personally experienced combat as the Engineer frame and was rather unimpressed with it overall.  The frame's primary weapon is a dual purpose beam weapon that can damage enemies or repair friendly structures, but I found myself having to expend 60% or more of my weapon's ammunition on targets on a fairly consistent basis in spite of receiving weapon upgrades at a fairly decent pace.  This was made more unfortunate by the fact that you can only carry a maximum of four full reloads for your primary weapon and this led to me mainly using my secondary weapon.  The engineer frame starts out with a shotgun as a secondary and I just found the weapon outright appalling.  I found that I had to pretty much be point blank and dead center on a target to deal a worthwhile amount of damage to any enemy.  Later I switched to using an SMG as a secondary weapon.  It had better accuracy at range but I quickly found myself having to reload its 65 round magazine multiple times to deal with enemies of equal level using an SMG that was of my level.  The saving grace to these secondary weapons is that your ammunition for them is infinite...but in practice they seem to be rather weak in utility.I can't speak for later game but the game rather quickly lost my interest early in, and if a game cannot hold interest through the early stages that speaks of a considerable flaw with it as a whole.  As it stands now I cannot recommend that you spend a considerable amount of time playing Firefall, though if you simply have some time to kill and space on your hard drive you could do far worse.If nothing else, give the game a few months to get on its feet before making any real investments on it.

												Very, Very buggy. Glitches that sometimes prevent you from advancing further in the mission, major graphical glitches and Pay 2 Win. The community can be helpful at times but it is extremely fanboyish, even if you point out a bug they instantly turn hostileCrafting is complex and a pain, by the time you get the needed supplies for a item you have researched (crafting is in 4 stages, collecting raw materials, Refining, Researching Then Manufacturing said item) you have already passed the level where it becomes useful.The Marketplace is also overly complex and not helpful, there is no tutorial to help you for it and it goes something like this; To sell an item you need to create a sell order for said item so someone can pick the order up and purchase the item for credits (the player currency) or you could fill in a buy order where the person who wants to buy something puts in a order for someone selling to fill it (no one ever creates legitimate buy orders that is not spam like 500 of 1 item for 1 credit)There is no fast way to travel early in game unless you want to spend some money IRL to buy a permenant vehicle so the only way you can travel without reaching level 25 (which takes roughly 30 hours of pure gameplay for a new player) or using 1 use, bad vehicles which you have a chance to get from slot machines is to buy one of the games packages for XX amount of 'Red Beans' which is a currency you buy with real money to purchase just about anything, even advanced versions of the default classes for 100 beans each, which of course, is a rip off.You can convert Crystite (a material you get from refining, killing, doing missions etc etc but you use for crafting) into credits for 1:25 which is only useful to use in end game when you are making too much Crystite or have no use for it as you have researched everything you need. However there is a conversion max you can do each day (i believe it is 1000 however im not sure) and the same you can do for Red Beans however it is much more credits to convert for a single Red Bean.You can buy 'pilots licenses' from the marketplace which gives you access to the advanced classes that you can purchase with credits however it costs roughly 2000 credits for a single license on average as they do fluctuate which adds up to roughly 50,000 Crystite!Please note this review is not complete and I did not have sufficent time to complete it all in one sitting, I will add more to it in further detail at a later date			"

												Played it for a few hours and it definitely didn't have anything to keep you playing. Levels don't matter, you need to make enough currency (which is extremely slow to get, even at low levels) or do it the quick way with real money to get different armors which mean different skills. I saw probably about 10 different people in that time which isn't great considering the game just launched. There's no reason to play with others that I saw in the early levels.			"

												Equally as grindy as Borderlands II, with even more time spent running around empty spaces. I hope you like unskippable cutscenes and tutorials. Kills grant virtually no experience and loot so there's no reason to ever get into fights unless it's needed for one of the incredibly boring random job board quests.Oh yeah and you can't try out perks (passives) without equipping them, which occupies perk points.

												Fun yet boring...The game is setup pretty well at first glance. Good environment, good background story, nice praphics and a very good soundtrack. And when you start playing for your first couple of hours the game feels very good as well and seems to be a lto ot fun. That is until you've played a while, have hit level 15 or so and see the repeting of missions starting.Firefall uses 'Job Board's to give you missions. Sadly the number of different missions is pretty limited. This results in missions starting to repeat themself, though not literally, but you will see the same kind of objective on new places and an other sugarcoat around it.Skills and progression is an issue as well. You only have 4 skills and at level 8 you alreayd have them all. At that point you'll only be working on upgrading the skills itself. Either through research & crafting or by grinding vouchers to buy them from NPCs. Research & crafting really takes forever, while vouchers drop you back in the repeatative mission grind.On a positive note, the cash shop is not Pay2Win. There are no game breaking items in there, and you can obtain the cash shop currency (Red Beans) from in-game grinding. With that, cash shop items are tradeble, and you can find almost everything from it on the auction house.			"

												I have played Firefall Since first day of open beta. Saw alot of changes, good and bad ones. But recently i decided to check on release and i was totally dissapointed. So, if you liked complex old crafting system and good rewarding thumping in pockets - then move along. Nothing for you there. So here's my impression and feedback.- Game became alot more friendly to new players, also alot more easier- Crafting got simplified as maximum as possible. You don't need to worry abough energy, weight and stats. You just craft pre-defined items every time.- Thumping now can be done blindfolded. Resource veins is a total mess - there is a huge lack of resource quantity. So thumping is a pain now really.- Battlframes. Have levels now - takes ages to grind. Gear got simplified as well. No more servos, jumpjets and platings. Just core and weapons. Also repair pools are gone and now gear is permanent and can't broke. You can repair it as much as you like. Right now you just grind the best gear and that's it.Missions. New field missions are just the same as ARES just another name. Slight imprivement tho - voiced dialogs and some kind of a story. Still boring.- Currency and Market. Biggest con for me. New currency been added - credits. Once per 24 hours you can exchange 25k CY for 1k credits. Now you need credits for everything. Prices are rediclous. White metal and purple metal costs the same. Very frustrating to use. Crystite became almost useless.Again - just my opiniion and impressions as old player. Right now alot of things are broken\not working as intended\missing or w\e. Some changes are just weird\stupid. Honestly after i played for a bit i just feel that i don't have any desire to log in back. I know things most likely gonna change. I loved this game, really. And i don't want to bash it but this just plain redicilous.You still feel free to try.			"

												Well everything you do in this game is pick a quest, run for 15 minutes, kill something and then run again for another 15 minutes. Also game is now very buggy, so repeating quests, because something stopped working as it should is on daily basis. Only way of to short the travel time, the LGV, that is awarded from quest In The Wheelhouse, also available AFTER you get on level 25, is currently broken and its not working, so no speed up for you. Also, taken from theirs website """"In the Wheelhouse"" - not receiving a blueprint -> We are currently investigating this"" posted on Jul 15. So their are investigating it to todays day (20 days so far). The dynamic events are boring after time aswell, because its always ""Do the same thing in different location."" I really dont recommend this game, because its fun maybe like for firsth few hours before you get bored.			"

												This game used to be fun, circa 2014.  Now, it's just a mess of a game that has gone in a very strange direction.  It's almost like the Devs can see the inevitable sinking and are just purposely blowing the ballast on it so that it goes under and they can move on to other projects that much faster.The newest overhaul just didn't make any sense.  I logged in after not having played for awhile and was completely lost.  Where did my lvl 40 frames go?  Where were my resources?  What is happening?Play it because it's free, but I wouldn't spend money on it.  Firefall is the Titanic, and the latest major update was the iceberg.  It's taking on water fast.			"

												Firefall has fallen into the category of games that... Bring me back to what the word ""Fun"" means. Many modern titles try to push quest lines, and stuff like that. Firefall has a decent questline, but it isn't what truly brings me towards it. It's the sheer amount of random, silly, dumb, stupid, but amazing things you can do with your time. It's both entertaining as a system to work with, through jobs, events, and thumping. When I'm not doing that, I'm trying to explore, and climb the tallest structure near me. The best game in my opinion, is the game in which you are so unrestricted in your choices, that you can play your own games within the game. The last game I've played that was this entertaining was Halo 3. Some people might look at me as if I were crazy for saying that, but Halo 3 in it's day, you didn't have to play the game as the game itself. Matchmaking was mediocre at best, and the storyline was short. But the Foundry, the Custom Games options, and the fact you and a couple of friends could do what you set your hearts out to on your own, made it worth every weekend night I spent making memories.Firefall gives me that precise feeling, all over again. It's a great game. I hope whoever reads this review will give it a try, and if they do, don't try to play it as though it were a conventional quest-driven MMO. It isn't. It's whatever you, and a couple of your buddies want to make it be.5/5			"

												Im not to far into the game yet, not even lvl 20. However this game seems pretty freak'n awsome...First off im really glad to see an mmo move in a fresh new direction, i'm also glad to see the shooter genre being worked with in a new light. These two very popular game catagories havent seemed to chage much at all since mmos like Guild Wars 2 and the more recent Tera Rising which unfortunatly lacks a little depth. Even less evoulution has come from FPS (first person shooters) and 3PS (third person shooters). I have yet to play Destiny so i cannot comment on how it may have changed the shooter genre, but i have played a wonderfull 3ps mmo called Global agenda and let me tell you, was that game fun. Global agneda died out quite awhile ago it seems, even with rumor for a remake. But from what i have experienced so far, Firefall gives a very similar feeling to Global Agenda.To be honest i was first sceptical of the MMOFPS Firefall. The screen shots depicted bulky looking character models and an impression of just another delevoper failing to reimagine the mmo genre -I was wrong. It started on a night like most, I was dwindling on steam browsing for a new mmo to play, because for some reason i just couldent get back into playing WoW. I decided, hey what have i got to lose by atleast trying this new game? ahhh but first let me check youtube. And wow nothing but beople complaining aobut things like the inability to pick up multiple quests and finish them all at once and even more so about how long the game took to get out of beta. Sifting through all the hate i realized that DIFFERENT is exactly what i was looking fore. I have come to absolutly love that i can only do one quest or ""job"" at a time in Firefall it makes the game feel more real and immersive for me. Each Job has new and unique fully voiced dialog with multiple characters and a suprisingly intricate story depth (per mission, or town set of missions). However there arent too many to do per town, city, station, or whatever you like to call it, this is totaly OK! because there are things happening all over the map, that in most cases can be joined at any time without the need to group or even started on your own to take on the challenge of soloing the game. Oh, and might i add all of these random occuring events are also fully voiced and do a good job at making you feel like you are a high tech, bad ♥♥♥ space cowboy.All in all what i mean to say is i like the direction this game is going. Fire fall gives all the feelings of both an mmo and a console game, the artwork and graphics are beautifle while not needing immense power to support them, and the questing/ PVE of this MMOFPS  has kept me entertained more than any other MMORPG with the exeptions of GW2 and WoW wich i rarely play either of the two any more. As far as PVP goes i am reluctant to say i can not yet report, i can say however, i cant wait to hit lvl 40 and run off into that open world, no rules, anything goes pvp island i have heared about.P.S. Could someone please explain to me how this game is completely free? im entirely baffeld at how such a nice game requires no money to play. I understand Firefall uses a type of micropayment like LoL's methods, but LoL has a very lage user base buying things like skins and wards. Firefall doesent seem to have an extencive list of really cool stuff to buy. "

												I always find it funny when people say ""all you do is shoot stuff"" and give it a bad review, ITS A SHOOTING GAME WHAT DO YOU EXPECT!!! they obviously did not play it long enough to experence the great squad system the massive world battles/events IE:Giant monsters (Brontadon King aka: BK)Massive buildings being overrun and need liberatingWatchtower takeoversMelding TornadosSpecial Monsters you have to find and kill5 massive areasGiant end game bossesThumping for itemsthe list goes on.................. I found Firefall to be a great new fresh approach to the MMO/FPS titles, I have over 270 hours in the game and have not spent £1 so far I have 5 level 40 battleframes all with good to decent gear, the game is a grind sure but thats the point of MMO's right? coampred to other MMO's this game throws exp at you, try playing FFXI FFIV WOW or Rift and see how much of a grind they are ,you get NO exp loss when you die only damage to your battleframe that you can repair in 20 seconds, you can get to level 10 in about 1 hour on any of the basic frames with no need to spend any real money ingame unless you want to ""support"" the devs (something I have yet to do/decide) great ingame community, looks amazing,plays really well,great crafting system and perks, massive world events and varied terrains with lots of places to explore and easy map leveling system to follow for the beginner there is NOTHING hidden behind ingame pay walls to stop you from getting to the top level of 40 and end game content.You can get the Redbeans for free by converting crystite into credits and then credits into redbeans(crystite is dropped by all mobs in game)Currently:25.000 of crystite gives you 1000 credits109 credits gives you 1 redbeanIf you play for long enough (say a couple of hours a day, like I do) after 3 weeks you will have enough redbeans to buy some decent in game items faster bikes, re-usable jump pads, battleframe colors ect all for free.

Of course, there were side and story missions, which I chose to partake in.Cut to a couple years later, a slightly more cooler me, browsing the Steam Free to Play section. It has been long since the Age of Firefall, when I played almost every day. I had moved on, mostly because I didn't have anyone that I knew personally to play with.Then, while browsing, my heart soars, tears well, as I have just stumbled on to Firefall(again). My boredom meter dropped instantly down to -100, and I began downloading the game through Steam. I grab my besterest friend and slammed him into the bandwagon, and then we were offered a few blessed years of happiness and prosperity(I almost said peace, but then again  someone  had to be on the end of our guns).Then... at our peak, we were slaughtered. Update 1.5 had just released, and so had the demons. The changes were acceptable at first. Ninja swords as melee weapons? SURE! Portable health packs? WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ NOT? However, in this case the bad outweighed the good. Bugs, new, complex systems(that were NOT user-friendly), the revocation of our most loved battleframes, only to be tempted by XP or a new frame, and all around generic MMO trash surrounded us. They beat us down to a pulp, chewed us up and spit us out. Now the Age of Fire has long been extinguished, and Firefall is now nothing but a conduit for nothing but evil and bland MMO elements.  There is salvation, fortunately, because where there is evil, there are heroes are willing to combat it!  https://www.change.org/p/crixa-labs-make-ember-a-spiritual-successor-to-firefall?recruiter=562901777 BEFORE I FORGET,  This hero  used #MakeFirefallGreatAgain in their review and I literally could not finish this without using it so thanks for that, uh, also I stole the link from his review, so again, yea thanks bro(its a noble cause though)  "

												Got this game back in closed beta and bought one of the founders packs long before it got added to steam. Then, I would have recommended it, now, it got utterly destroyed by asians. No, im not racist towards asians, but god they cant make MMO's for ♥♥♥♥. The original company, RED5, sold it and now its your stereotypical asian style mmo complete with grinding the same repetitive missions, once you hit the level cap of 45, you get a new level system with no cap. The got rid of the awesome crafting system to put in the whole ""chance upgrading"" thing that you have to buy things off the cash shop to increase its success rate. I come back after 6 months and now it has those stupid ♥♥♥ chests you get as a reward and you have to by the key to open in from the cash shop. This game screams ""♥♥♥♥ asian cash grab MMO"" now. Its free to play and the story (thats change like 6 times) is fun to go through, the world looks awesome and the sounds are great so i dont thing you;d lose anything playing if you dont have anything else to do, just dont spend money on it or try to sink alot of time into it.

												I have fond memories of this game in the past, and returning after an extended absence I could not control excited me greatly. Little did I realize that I was setting myself up for an equally massive letdown.1. My character class is now effectively worthless in PVE after a blatantly unfair patch.2. A lot of my items were replaced with vastly inferior gear.3. The crafting system is offline.4. The servers are very unstable.5. Character classes I was eligible to unlock thanks to a previous purchase are now locked.6. Support is impossible to contact due to website downtime and website errors.7. I can't even file a bug crash without getting a fatal error on the bug reporter app that pops up after a crash.8. A lot of content was cut instead of fixed and it shows.9. Many achievements are now completely impossible to obtain.Just don't bother. I'll be forced to remove the game from my library in the end. I'd rather lose this game quickly then suffer hoping that it will be repaired and rebalanced. For a player who actually paid for some of the content in the past that is now missing, this leaves a rancid taste in my mouth and I must now brush my teeth an additional time for the night.			"

												Firefall was a very interesting exo-suit wearing, angel-wing deploying class based MMO shooter in an open world. The plan was to have dynamic events like ""intrusions"" change how much of the world was accessible through player particiation. It wasn't particular P2W. After resetting progression and crafting four times, changing the stance on PvP about as much, people got tired of waiting for the actual content. The dev team got canned and the population has dwindled to barely anything. There's no more development for Firefall.			"

												I played the game in beta, but I took a long break, and only recently came back to play it on release. I never got too attached to a specific build of the game, but I did play enough hours to wrap my head around it.On paper, it sounds like a good idea. Marry shooter mechanics with some MMO questing and skill progression, and you'll have people coming in droves!In practice, it's got some shooter chops to form the foundation of a game. Each basic class gets a different kind of primary weapon, and your choice of secondary gives you a bit more room to play with. But the MMO half of the experience is so threadbare, and feels so soulless, that I was always aware I was grinding. Grinding for weapons, grinding for gear, grinding for cosmetic unlocks, grinding for a blue version of the EXACT SAME green item I already had!And I had enough. I never did hit high level content on the release build (got to about level 20 with my subclass frame), but what I played was such a sucking void in my time spent that I couldn't help but put the mouse down at the end of a session and ask myself...""WHY? Why did I just do that for two hours?""Some people might consider games in general (and grind-heavy MMOs in particular) to be nothing more than a time sink. But  in other cases, there's something to maintain a player's interest, whether it's the world, the lore, the art, or even a player class that just hits all the right buttons in your brain.Ultimately, with Firefall, you get all of the illusion of MMO progression, and none of the distinctiveness and originality that you might get in an actual MMO. And frankly, if you're at that point, wouldn't you rather just be playing a plain shooter?			"

												           5 Thing About Fire-Fall that are obviously annoying or1.This game gets VERY repeditive, all you do is go out and kill things, escort people, gather supplies, fight off enemies while protecting a point, trying to find missing people, and pest controll.2. Your parter that calls you boss all the time and has an odd mixed accent that you can never tell where she got it from, just from her talking all the time on every mission gets mildly annoying and repeditive, half the time i swear they took words she said and put them into a sentence then make it sound like she actually said that through editing.3. ALL and i mean ALL of the boy npc are based off the same base modle, it is painfully obvious.4. For the first 15 or so levels all you fight are ahrenas, sculvers, hissers, giant flying bugs, and bandits. The bandits seem to be over powered compaired to the normal sculvers and ahrenas, at the lower level mission to kill black forest gang members they can kill you very easily without having to put up a fight.5. Now this one might not be as bad as i may put it out to be but Free to Play MY ♥♥♥. As you progress you see other players with cool colors and armor and vehicles, but to get that you need what Red 5tm calls red beans witch is in game premium curency to buy things with, like a Rocket powered motor-cycle that costs 175 red beans witch equaits to roughly 25 dollars (USD). Now for the armor color, The colors and patterns are pretty cool not gonna lie, but you only get 3 free base color cobonations when you start the game they include, a completely white suit, brown with green accents, and a lvery light blue with different shades of that same blue all over it. Now your wondering about other colors and patterns, well they all cost up to 50-75 red beans that roughly equaits to 10-15 dollors (USD) each. They also have head gear, hiar/facial hair , classes, weapns and armor, all at rediciously high prices EXAMPLE. head gear 50-100red beans (depending) , hair/facial hair red beans 50-75 (depending) , classes 200-300---> 45-60(USD) red beans (depending), weapons and armor 75-100 red beans.This hopfully shows that the cool things you see in game all come at a price you probably wont be willing to pay.         I respect your own opinions about this game, but i stand by the fact that it is a very kill, kill ,grind ,grind, uniform sloppily put together type of game and you would need to put a ♥♥♥♥ ton of time and effort into the game to get to your overall goals or get very far.

												The good: this game had (and perhaps still has) potential.  The gameplay is intended to be fluid and fairly rapidly-paced.  The questing (other than campaign quests) is fairly 'lite' on the story and I enjoyed the possibility of 'leveling' the same character in different roles in a way that made sense.  Red 5s stance on cheating is delightfully straighforward.  There are plentiful simple semi-randomized quests with middling rewards.The bad:  There were several quests I could not finish due to bugs.  There was a quest with a node in 'deep water' (think damage zones) which, once you used, you took damage until you died (which then teleported me two zones away to a different respawn point).  There were two quests that sat at ""loading next waypoint"" (or the equivalent, I forget the exact wording) the quest wouldn't progress, and relogging cleared the quest from your active quests.  Finally, as Acidule mentioned in his review, the tuning for enemy advancement is rather awkward.  You usually fight packs of 3-12 mooks at a time, and a large pack of equal-level ones will kill you.  I feel like if their net code was better, this would be less of an issue.  (I run off broadband with sub 15ms ping and 90/25 mb bandwidth so there is no shortage on my end).  A further point brought up in another review is the decidedly monetized feel for a lot of what I would consider fairly basic things.  Inventory isn't an issue at relatively low level (although with all the different crafting materiels I could see it becoming one) but purchasing more slots requires use of the cash currency.  As do most of the permanent travel options.  I wouldn't have expected the vehicles to be such a big issue, however there is *SO MUCH RUNNING* needed that I can only feel they are trying to perform the same ""2nd-class citizen"" action that has ruined the appeal of so many other F2P games.  There is a big difference between ""freemium"" games where you get either cosmetic or minor benefits and ones that feel 'gated' by the payment requirements.Bottom line, if this game was still listed as being in beta, I could be much more forgiving of the flaws and bugs.  I may give it another shot in a few weeks or months to see if there are any improvements or fixes... Then again, with all the various MMOs and other F2P games to play, I might not.			"

												As a beta tester , I like the game better now . Though I wish they brought back the huge amount of resources but the game is more polished and overall looks better . 1. Ares Jobs are far better then a huge amount of repeat missions which the game used to throw at you in beta . You can choose when to begin and when to abandon . The good news is Ares Missions are still around but in a smaller number.2. The levelling system is much easier in my opinion to figure out . Now exp directly levels you up and as you go up the ranks your base damage and health will increase independantly from your loadout .Now for the bad1. Advance frames are hard to get now compared to beta . You either have to get to level 40 or bargain over them on the market .2 . Cystite / ingame currenccy is hard to get now . Salvaging seems like the best bet but in beta you could convert resources into cystite . I hope they bring this back .Overall great game with a few marketing / ingame currency problems but in no way is it pay2win .			"

												A solid game with its up and downs. It went through a developer hell (you can research if you want to know) to arrive at its current state.You are an ARES agent equpped with a battleframe. There are 5 classes of frames each with 2-3 advanced subclasses. Assault, Dreadnaught, Engineer, Recon & Biotech are the basic ones available right away. To unlock an advanced sub-class frame you need to level any already unlocked frame to 40. Alternatively, you can just buy a pilot license with cash or purchase one off the player market. The latter method involves a decent amount of grinding as in-game currency is harder to come by than usual.The game game certainly has its charm - the colourful world, a few interesting personalities, fresh combat. But all of that is balanced out by the monotony of grind once the initial novelty passes, the somewhat boring crafting system and a rudimentary player economy.While the release version is quite OK there are some things that turned to worse since closed beta. The game's resource and crafting system went through many iterations, some more in-depth than the others. At present you can only boost any one base stat of your frame with mutually exclusive 'cores'. I see this as a huge step back as before you were able to boost most stats by crafting better battleframe components. Jumpjets allowed you to have a better, faster boost, plating gave you armour and health/regen, servos were responsible for run/sprint speed and jump height and so on. Weapon and other gear crafting has gone through some dramatic changes as well. As the game is right now, crafting anything except the highest tier gear is pointless as you'd have to grind for resources and, chances are, you'll sooner get an item drop comparable to the one you're looking to craft.If you want a few hours of fun the game will deliver, but beyond that it turns into a grind-fest to get to end-game of which there is very little. Keep an eye out for future content updates. Hopefully, those will improve and expand Firefall.			"

												Just want to point out I've been playing since 2012 and steam hours are just from the steam client.Whatever you do don't use the steam client. For some reason it is filled with more bugs than the client from the actual website.Firefall wise, this game is pretty awesome. I feel bad for the new players though because you only get to choose one battleframe and you can't change unless you pay money or get it to level 40.  In the beta you started out with all the accord frames and had to unlock the others.Gameplay wise it is fun, you can switch between first person and third person, glide around, grind resources, quest, craft, get pets, and play different classes. The crafting system is intense and requires you to ""thump"" for resources.Thumping is basically an auto mine feature where you guard the thumping device from constant waves of enemies that get harder and harder the longer you ""thump"" or mine for resources. This is what you will be doing for a really big portion of the game. The only downside to this is that it can get really redundant and boring. Just take a break and do something else and go back to it!You can also join other players in thumping and recieve a portion of the resources they are thumping. The bigger the thumper the harder it will be to defend it. It doesn't take away from what the owner of the thumper recieves so dont be afraid to hop in and help. Free xp and resources! Can't complain.The red beans are the cash shop of the game. Pretty well balanced in my opinion, I think the battleframes are a little pricey at around 15 dollars per frame. Each frame cost 100 beans (or get a frame to level 40). 50 bucks will get you 4 frames (450 red beans) because you get bonus beans for buying in bulk so obviously the more beans you buy the cheaper the frame.  If thats all you buy then basically you have bought yourself a game anyways so do your research and pick 4 frames to love. Or just get frames to level 40 and unlock them yourself.All in all it is fully free to play, no pay to win, fun, and DON'T GET THE STEAM CLIENT! GET IT FROM THE FIREFALL WEBSTSITE!			"

												Probably one of the funnest MMOs I've evere played. It's got a great combat system, great menus, great communities, and isn't that hard on your computer. I've played about 10 hours of the game, but I came across one big bug where I couldn't interact with any terminals. However, reloading the game fixed it. this game has a 9.89/10 from me!			"

												This game is pretty good. I will have the CONS & PROS in detail.I'll try to update this when I can. For now it'll be recommended to try.PROS-Storyline is pretty good if you pay attention to it. (Though I haven't for various reasons)-The world is amazingly set up. The world is by far, the most unique world I've seen in any game.-Questing is actually fairly good. You don't have to stay in the same area that long if you don't wish too. (That I've experienced)-You can create an Army (Clan/Guild).-Graphics are amazing. (Usually I don't look at the games graphics, but I must compliment this one.)-You can actually move & resize some of the interface components. -You can customize the character camera and more. (Moving the 3rd Person FOV.)-Can switch from 3rd Person to First Person at anytime.CONS-Limited character customization. (Though I'm sure they're working on it, but for now this will stay in the cons.)-Grinding can become repetitive. (But it is fairly interesting because of the setting.)-Armies don't have much for customization. (Ranks, Permissions, Etc. I do suppose they may be working on this but for now it'll stay in the cons.)-Is computer intensive at times.-Graphics glitch out when using ALT + TAB. (Best to run in windowed if you plan to multitask otherwise everything will turn black.)-Interface needs some work. (Primarily more options to customize. (Can't resize/move Minimap, or the Main Bar.)			"

												Hi-Just wanted to throw in my two cents.  If you like Borderlands or other FPSs, this is well worth a try.  It's truly free-to-play; you can play this indefinitely without paying a cent- you will not reach a point that you have to cough up money for.  Leveling will take you a bit longer without buying VIP membership (which boosts XP and some other things), but it's not all that big of a deal.  I have friends that have played for over 100 hours without buying anything.  Plus, you can buy the vast majority of items with in-game money if you want to put the time in.The big draw for this is the fun of leveling different classes, and developing gear.  There is more end-game stuff to do than in Borderlands, for instance.  Don't get me wrong... the BL franchise is my favorite by far, but you reach a point where you have everything and have done everything.  I found that in FF, there is always something to do, if you adjust yourself to wanting to do it.  If you can find a few buddies or join a squad/ army, the possibilities increase.  The MMO feature allows you to meet new players, if you want to, and go from there.I've read the negative reviews, and most of them seem to come from disappointed beta players.  I came to the game just after official release, so I can't really speak to what is was like and what may or may not have changed.  There is a grinding aspect to the leveling, but more so because there are 16 frames to level up, if you want.  However, it's no more grindy than BL, with the increasing level caps and having to repeat Vault Hunter modes several times.So, I'd strongly recommend giving this a try.  I continue to be surprised that more people haven't tried it, but I suspect it's because of suspicion about the MMO feature.  I felt the same way, but I gave it a try.  What game have you played that you can play for a year or more and still find fun things to do in it?GraniteHead1			"

												As you can see I've not played much Firefall. Why then am I writing a review? And why would I not recommend it? After my 5th attempt the Tutorial continues to bug out, not just for me but everyone who was in the tutorial with me based on the chat. It gets you about 30 yards from the starting point then throws up an invisable wall and no one can progress beyond it no matter what people tried. Relogging caused it to reset the tutorial (including upskippable intro) and the bug continued. Highly annoying as the game looks promising beyond the tutorial, but in it's current state and with my current experience I CANNOT recommend this game to anyone as there isn't even a game to recommend with that bug in the way.

												I read a bunch of reviews saying this game was pretty bad with the new update it got. I decided to give it the benefit of doubt. Worst mistake ever. I don't have much time into this gaame because it's pretty much unplayable. There's a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of bugs that just slow down my game to a slide show and there's an unholy amount of lag (may be my fault). When I started the first mission I somehow got stuck in a floor. All in all, this is a terrible game that needs to be fixed.			"

												It´s a promising fresh game. It feels a bit like Borderlands and Fallen Earth in one. Good Grafix.Pretty grindy at present, but fun to play with friends. Even tho the game seem to have been around for a long time, it seems that the dev´s are close to the community and constantlychanging things. PvP has been taken out to be revamped and re- introduced.World Events used to be a lot more present in the game. "

YouTube™ Video: Firefall - part 1 (first impressions)

			This game is Firefall by Red5 Studio. Enjoy. I also posted my review on steam. You can read it here - http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanovichZ1/recommended/227700		

I didn’t really know anything about this game before today. So I wasn’t sure what to expect. When it said FPS MMO I thought maybe that would mean it’s sort of like Planetside. But it’s not like that, so far it feels like a cross between WOW and borderlands. Gameplay is primarily PVE. I’ve pretty much only played solo so far. I mainly found myself taking one quest, travelling to a location, killing a set number of hostile aliens, picking up an item and returning to the quest giver. Unfortunately for me after having played WOW and borderlands before it felt very ‘been there, done that’. Especially with having to travel by foot to objectives, why would I want simulate walking? But it still feels better than what I remember WOW being like which is the main MMORPG that I’ve played. I really wanted to just to get stuck into some team PVE instances or PVP matches. I did participate in what I think was a matchmade coop PVE instance. But I didn’t have a lot of time to look at that today which sucks, because it actually started to get interested once I reached that. There is supposed to be PVP as well but I didn’t have a chance to experience that today. After a little bit of research I found how you’re supposed to add yourself to the queue for that but it didn’t work for me. And I haven’t found any information about when you are able to do that. I can only assume that I need to progress further in order to unlock PVP matchmaking. One feature that I did like in this was the jetpack ability, that’s a cool if limited way to move around.Initially I felt that the graphics were actually below what I expected. I felt maybe the textures weren’t that detailed. I really got sense that the game is geared towards being able to support action on a large scale i.e. large scale battles with a large amount of players. But actually after playing it for a while I felt that the graphics aren’t bad at all. The cutscenes and dialogue in the beginning I didn’t really pay a lot of attention to because I really just wanted to get stuck into the game. So I can’t really say much about the lore and the storyWhat are you getting with this game. It’s sort of a Borderlands like experience that costs nothing. If you really like MMORPG games this might be right for you. At this stage I don’t know how restricted you are in the long run as non-paying player. But hopefully you are not put at an extreme disadvantage if you don’t invest money into the game. I would have liked to have just been able to engage in PVP combat right from start. If I get around to it I want to do more on PVE instances and PVP matches in this game hopefully do a let’s play on it/add more to my review. That’s all I have to say about this game for today.Click here for my YouTube gaming channel			"

												As a beta tester , I like the game better now . Though I wish they brought back the huge amount of resources but the game is more polished and overall looks better . 1. Ares Jobs are far better then a huge amount of repeat missions which the game used to throw at you in beta . You can choose when to begin and when to abandon . The good news is Ares Missions are still around but in a smaller number.2. The levelling system is much easier in my opinion to figure out . Now exp directly levels you up and as you go up the ranks your base damage and health will increase independantly from your loadout .Now for the bad1. Advance frames are hard to get now compared to beta . You either have to get to level 40 or bargain over them on the market .2 . Cystite / ingame currenccy is hard to get now . Salvaging seems like the best bet but in beta you could convert resources into cystite . I hope they bring this back .Overall great game with a few marketing / ingame currency problems but in no way is it pay2win .			"

												In short: Customize your frames, craft your own weapons and burn arachnas.+ 10 points for jetpacks, controls are very intuitive and fun.Been playing this for almost 3 years. Perfect for casual play. There's some grind as in any game of this kind but the difference is FF's grind is not mindless.The world is dynamic, events pop around all the time, there's always something to do and the devs are pumping more content regularly.It has bugs, and the servers are wonky occasionally. A little bit of patience and /rui seems to be enough for most problems. There are some addons on curse and on the official forums.The community is mostly mature and helpful. Don't hesitate to ask for help in /zone chat.The Lore is very interesting, there's an official comic on FFs site.I suggest this game to anyone who wants to enjoy some action in good company but can't invest too much time.

												Very good, fun game. I've heard a lot of criticism about it, and frankly, I don't see it. Here are some of the major problems people have with the game.1. Transportation is only available after level 25 - While true, what you have to realise is that that is level 25 on one class. There are a total of 16 classes, meaning that level 25 is relatively early in the game. In addition, I've only been playing Firefall for 36 hours, at this point, and I have leveled one class to level 23, another to 15, and the other three basic ones to 6/7. So, it doesn't actually take that long to progress anyway.2. Pay to win - This is absolutely not true. Because of the way the currency system works, you can convert in-game currency to Red Beans, which is the paid-for currency. Therefore, it is possible to earn any item you want just by playing the game. Yes, it will take time and effort, but the alternative is for everything to simply be given to the player, negating all semblance of progression. Not to mention the fact that most of the things that you buy with Red Beans are vanity items anyway.3. No variations on weapons - I put this claim down to people not playing the game long enough. While yes, each class has only one type of weapon that they can use, they do vary somewhat. For example, the Assault's weapon is a plasma cannon, with an alt-fire of a shotgun-style blast. Around level 18 or so, I found blueprints for a version that spits fire instead - it keeps the feel of the Assault's weapon, but with a slightly different twist. In addition, I am now level 23 on the Assault, and I haven't found a replacement, so it's definitely paid off.4. No variation on abilities - This is basically the same problem as the above, but I didn't want to write too much in one section. I've heard some people complain that at level 8 (when you unlock your 4th ability), you don't get anything new. This is far from the case. You unlock new abilities at level 15 and 23, which means that you will need to switch out abilities and try new things. The amount of levelling between these abilities is such that it gives you a chance to try the new abilities and playstyles, without letting the game stagnate too much.These are the 4 things I've found to be the most common 'downsides' to the game, and personally, I don't think they stand up. My belief is that people who complain about this game do not understand what the game is about. Firefall is *not* a normal FPS. It is a MMO, first and foremost, which is why I do not understand why people complaining about having to work for their rewards. I do not claim to know everything about MMOs, but Firefall doesn't feel particularly grindy to me. Personally, I think people judge Firefall as an FPS first, when it is an MMO. The majority of people that I have seen bad reviews from have judged the game around level 8-12, without giving the game a chance to show it's diversity.Obviously, this game will not be everyone's favourite, but it is for me. Also, for people who say that the game has become worse since beta, I played this game during beta, and it was too complicated for my taste. Firefall is currently in a much more enjoyable state.

												I...I've always wanted this game to be good, the cinematic trailers, the hype, and you played the game for the first time in closed beta, you thought to yourself man this game world is amazing, you can fly around, you can explore everywhere if you try hard enough. The only thing limiting you to seeing more of this world is the giant purple wall of melding.  Back in beta this melding is what controlled server populations as well as explorable game world. It'd slowly creep closer and closer if players couldnt hold back the hordes of chosen, and then that server instance would eventually die to the melding.  This was the game i was introduced to. this beautiful world to explore and see and ignore all the player gameplay because ""hey its still beta they are still tweaking things, who cares if voice acting and model animations are incredibly robotic, combat is repatative unless you play assault, range means nothing when quests have scripted ambushes so theres no real reason to play the recon advanced classes.  engineer classes have this weird dinner plate thing with lack luster weapon models and lack luster weapons that could easily just be tertiary weapons.  I dont even use the Tesla, i have my engineers using two secondary weapons (an assault rifle and the RPG) because the tesla is just flat out lame.  Maybe if it had a cone of effect or somthing that didnt just make it a shiny looking assault rifle.  But again, tangents. All these tangents are the built up frustrations of one player,  Red 5 has kept looking at the big stuff, new maps, new monsters. but they have constantly overlooked the little details that really flush out a game.  the bones are there but it has no muscle.  Combat in general is pretty boring unless you are fighting random mobs out in the world, because then you can use your own combat playstyle to the best of your ability (but assault is pretty much the best combat experience in the game currently), Game models are great looking normally, but some animations are just...unnatural.  quests are still served best cold and alone, with no one acknoledging them.  then theres the fortress system, it wouldve been somthing like Wildstar's, but we don't know if they even remember talking about it.basically, we are all waiting for a bigger company to buy the game and use it as a quick cash bull, maybe revitalise the game world as we grit our teeth through never ending grind of producer run gaming industry.

It'd slowly creep closer and closer if players couldnt hold back the hordes of chosen, and then that server instance would eventually die to the melding.  This was the game i was introduced to. this beautiful world to explore and see and ignore all the player gameplay because ""hey its still beta they are still tweaking things, who cares if voice acting and model animations are incredibly robotic, combat is repatative unless you play assault, range means nothing when quests have scripted ambushes so theres no real reason to play the recon advanced classes.  engineer classes have this weird dinner plate thing with lack luster weapon models and lack luster weapons that could easily just be tertiary weapons.  I dont even use the Tesla, i have my engineers using two secondary weapons (an assault rifle and the RPG) because the tesla is just flat out lame.  Maybe if it had a cone of effect or somthing that didnt just make it a shiny looking assault rifle.  But again, tangents. All these tangents are the built up frustrations of one player,  Red 5 has kept looking at the big stuff, new maps, new monsters. but they have constantly overlooked the little details that really flush out a game.  the bones are there but it has no muscle.  Combat in general is pretty boring unless you are fighting random mobs out in the world, because then you can use your own combat playstyle to the best of your ability (but assault is pretty much the best combat experience in the game currently), Game models are great looking normally, but some animations are just...unnatural.  quests are still served best cold and alone, with no one acknoledging them.  then theres the fortress system, it wouldve been somthing like Wildstar's, but we don't know if they even remember talking about it.basically, we are all waiting for a bigger company to buy the game and use it as a quick cash bull, maybe revitalise the game world as we grit our teeth through never ending grind of producer run gaming industry.

												A really really good concept, but really really poorly executed. There are a few hours of enjoyment to be gained from the starting missions, but when the world opens up, the game just drops off.For starters, the world is waaaaaaay too big. I'd understand the size were it bursting with content, but only tiny little pockets of the world are inhabited. The gap between the quests and quest  hubs is another huge turn-off. How am I supposed to be excited about doing quests when I've had to walk 20 minutes to get to the indicator, killed 10 enemies, and and still have to slog through another 20-minute walk to turn it in. Transportation is another real problem. The game expects you to bear with its grind for 25 levels for you to aquire transportation. Cash store items and temporary vehicles exist, but cash store costs cash, and the temp vehicles are so few and far between that no matter when you use it, it feels like a waste.On a positive note, the vehicles(s9?) feel pretty darn good, and are the only area that this game has gotten right.Looking at this game from a shooter standpoint, you call tell by both combat and visual appearance that this game wants quite badly to be borderlands. However, it manages neither the appearance, nor the feel of its role model. Looking at it from an mmo standpoint, it is standard FTP faire. In fact, if you peel away the claptrap mask, it is literally every boring grind of a freemmo out there.  The quests are stale and repetiive. ""Gather X x's"" ""kill X x's"" ""walk to X"". There's really not too much to keep players around after drawing them in. I imagine that only longterm players of friends of the devs would drop money into this game. After all, the only motivation we have to spend cash is to save time (buying a vehicle), which could just as easily be accoplished by uninstalling the game. So, no, don't play it, unless you're really into grinding or quite bored.Either way, it's free, so the only thing you have to lose is your time.			"

												In short: Customize your frames, craft your own weapons and burn arachnas.+ 10 points for jetpacks, controls are very intuitive and fun.Been playing this for almost 3 years. Perfect for casual play. There's some grind as in any game of this kind but the difference is FF's grind is not mindless.The world is dynamic, events pop around all the time, there's always something to do and the devs are pumping more content regularly.It has bugs, and the servers are wonky occasionally. A little bit of patience and /rui seems to be enough for most problems. There are some addons on curse and on the official forums.The community is mostly mature and helpful. Don't hesitate to ask for help in /zone chat.The Lore is very interesting, there's an official comic on FFs site.I suggest this game to anyone who wants to enjoy some action in good company but can't invest too much time.

												I have 4 frames (o characters) at max lvl. So i can say, they are doing it wrong. Every patch break more things than the last one. Only 1 instance in ALL THE GAME, and the loot is 1 crap of item to roll for a team of 5. Every patch is more unbalanced. Classes are totally broken. Patch after patch it get worse. They broke the crafting system, now is like in almost the games useless until lvl 40. But at lvl 40 to craft something you need to extermintate the life in the whole planet in a crazy grinding rampage.Leveling is now boring and repetitive as hell. And the best of all, the game is only 3 zones and not too big i must say. 3 zones. After more than one year playing i can say. That is still a beta in really bad shape, without course.			"

												The game is fun for some hours at the beginning but once you've done a couple of missions, jobs, and things like that the game gets incredibly repetitive. In order to unlock missions (that's basically the story of the game) you have to reach a certain level, and in order to level up you of course need xp, and the only way to get it is either a couple of side events, jobs or thumping, and that's it. The jobs get extremely repetitive, it always sends you LONG distances to the waypoint, and once you reach the waypoint there's little to no things to do, you either kill things, defend something by killing waves of things or it's an escort mission where you have to travel a whole kilometer and defend the person you're escorting to a certain waypoint by killing things. And there is little enemy variety. Once you're done with 1 objective you get another, take a guess what you need to do in the next objective... That's right! Kill things that are miles away. Once you reach level 25 you get a LGV ( motorbike ) recipe which helps you get to places faster, but that doesn't solve the problem that for EVERY SINGLE JOB you need to kill things AND NOTHING ELSE. In the game there are about 4-5 classes and each class branches about in about 2-3 different styles of the class, for example you have the basic Recon class with a mid-long range assault rifle, and the class branches out to a recon class with a long range bolt action rifle ( Nighthawk ) but in order to unlock a different class apart from the basics you need to max out any class to level 40 which as you may have guessed already, takes a craplot of grindingMy final verdict for the game would be 4/10			"

												So, another free MMO is on the market and why should you even try this one?You can view Firefall as a bledn of Planetside 2, Borderlands and a bit of Global Agenda.As such its a lot more of a shooter than your basic MMO, which if you like shooters is REALLY GOOD!Althow it is an MMO it doesnt feel like it, it feels like you're actualy playing your standard co-op game.And it mostly does that through the excellent voice acted missions that you get through a Job board.Now, the missions may not always include you doing something very different every time, but the game makes you care about what you are doing. Are you helping a mother find her son? Are you helping some civilans getting food?The game atleast says what you're doing and that can instantaniously makes you care. And the voice acted bits aren't shoved down your throat like in The old Republic, they are just some messages that you recive and they dont hinder your gameplay.But unlike in the old Republic, your character is silent and doesn't talk at all (they do even joke about it).But let us talk more about the combat. As i said, the game feels more of a co-op game, and even in combat that is clearly visible. Your main source of dispercing damage is your GUN! That means that combat is more Borderlands-esk and even the enemy variety is closely similar to that of Borderlands. But you also have 4 abilities, 3 that you use and have a cool down and the forth ability charges through combat.But besides your regular missions Firefall is also structured to have a more dynamic feel to it. You will find your fellow players gathering resources and some side-mission, which you can ither start yourself or help your fellow soldiers in the field.The gathering of the resources is especialy fun, since it is more of a team oriented thing and you and your friends are besacly just mowing down bugs and enemys as they come coming towards you.There is also a crafting sistem, which works like your usuall crafting sistem with some twists (i have never seen a lot of the crafting sistems in other MMOs). Firstly you need to research what you want to make, and then actualy make it. Fearly basic, but the hard part is actualy juggeling your resources/money.I have mixed feeling on the business model. The devs sure need to make money and i belive they might have actualy been able to get a functioning sistem into their game that is not really pay to win. In game, you can buy red bean coins with real money, that in turn allow you to buy special items from the Red Bean store. Most of these items are luxurious, like a bike (you can make one yourself for free to) and some other cosmetic items. The only problem i have is that the giant gameplay changing item, the one that allows you to play different classes (battleframes) is (for me) kinda costly, since you can pay 10€ just for another run in the game with some different abilities. But its not as bad as it sounds right now. You can actualy earn those Red Bean coins ingame, for free! You can excange your basic money, to credits (which are used for the marketplace) and then those into Red Bean coins. Sure the excange isn't exactly linear, but you can earn the Bean coins without spendint a dime. How ever, the time it takes you to aquire even an usable amount of Bean coins, so it is still very harsh, but hey, you can speed things up with spending money and supporting the devs.In short, Firefall is in my opinion one of the finest MMOs and if you liked Borderlands, Planetside 2 or Global Agenda, you should give this one a look. The begining few levels might be boring, but after you get into the game a bit it just takes off and unlike some MMOs that have you just spaming some abilities you can actualy have tons of fun here!

500+ Hours invested into the Alpha/Beta/Pre-Steam releases.+ Fun with friends. - Feels like a slow monotonous grind without company.+ Pay-to-Progress, not to-win. - Have to grind for days to trade enough in-game currency for even the cheapest cash store items and boosts.+ Multiple classes and varying abilities and play styles. - A few of the secondary classes are exactly like their base classes apart from one or two abilities.+ Dungeon instances are well paced, challenging, and very rewarding. - The end game ""raid"" content is lackluster.The removal of PvP Arenas in beta was when I stopped supporting Firefall 100%, those were the most fun out of all of the content being tested.I give FIrefall a strong 3.5 out of 5 - in it's current state.

												It's a good concept and all.......but it gets very boring very fast.Not enough diversity in what you need to do.  And I can most definitely see heavy influence from another crappy game (I won't give it's name) which was a TPS and went F2P.And my opinion on crafting......useless.  Can't keep up to date with much useful.  Crafter items need way better stats or unique bonuses.The game starts looking okay when you see the price......but it just is way too boring.Maybe within a few months the devs will flesh out it's direction to something better.

												I was in the beta for this and it really had hopes burning high. It has some really interesting ideas to it and if one is a diehard fan of third-person shooters you might like it but it is dogged by problems.I rate F2P model as fair, there is no content that affects gameplay that cannot be acquired in a reasonable amount of time without paying and there are purely aesthetic items can be bought with real money alone, though the appearance of characters can become a little generic I don't see this as a problem.The game is buggy though, possibly more so from the beta days as it's virtually unplayable. Missions stopped updating in my mission journal, one stuck at loading next waypoint, the tutorial mission bugged out and remain in my journal with the last objective even though I completed it the day before.The server was very laggy, at the last login it was continually beeping with a server lag warning and other players were getting this same message. Even outside of these warnings, lag was a constant companion.I don't recommend this game.			"

												Firefall is one of my favorite MMOs.  If you like the feel of an open world environment (like most MMOs) and like third or first person shooters I recommend you give Firefall a try.My fav features:Movement.  Just getting around in the game is very fun.  Motorcycles, gliders, jump pads and personal jetpacks!Dynamic quest system.  Repeating a quest does NOT mean you will go to the same location(s).Open world content.  Imagine you are fighting some aliens for a quest and more (aliens, bandits, critters, etc) show up unexpectedly, due to random public content/events.  Time to react or die.  You have to think on your feet and be aware of your surroundings.Crafted gear is useful!  A large percentage of the gear I use was crafted by my character.One character, multiple battleframes (classes).  This means that your inventory and crafting is tied to your character, NOT your class.  So your battleframes level independently, but that cool level 20 submachine gun of doom you crafted for your main battleframe is usable by the battleframe you have reserved for playing with your group of friends (once you get that battleframe to lvl 20)Free to play which means it should be easy to get your friends to try it.You can buy things with actual money, but it's just cosmetic, quality of life, and fun items.  NO Pay to Win.It's very common to be knocked down and have a complete stranger come by to revive you.Playing with a group is fun.What I don't like:Software bugs.  Not a ton, but they are there.  Note:  vendor support is responsive.Lot's of good changes coming in an update soon (maybe in January).  Check out this video for a summary (and some laughs):  video link "

												Fun open world MMOFPS. Beautiful environments, great graphics, fun gameplay. Couldn't ask for more from a game. Especially a free one. If you played in beta absolutely give this game another chance, I understand that most games don't change very drastically from beta to launch, but this game is the exception. When I played in closed beta there was basically no content. You started out crafting and thats all you did the entire time. Guard your thumper. They've changed it COMPLETELY. They've added dynamic events constantly goin on in the open world, a massive open world PvP map, tons and tons of quests and probably a ton of stuff I don't even know about. It takes a lot to impress me these days when it comes to MMO's but Firefall has definitely done it.			"

These animations are great, I've seen like 2000 or so playing people just on Steam.So far I can say that this is really really awesome and I'm looking forward to see what's coming next. "

(there is 1v1 duels though)Acheivements - Some Acheivements are impossible or very difficult to completeHelp - Except from the offical routes, there is little to know play to get help.My Opinion:It is a great game and easy for me and my friends to play and isnt a game you have to commit hours in a row to complete, it can be a bit repetitive but i enjoyed my experience.Overall:FireFall is a good game and worth trying considering it is free to play and if you do like it, it is a game that will continue to deliver.

												Fighting for Thump Dump, for almost half an hour. Bonding together with over 40 players to try and stop an overwhelming invasion, more and more enemy reinforcements showing up while we barely manage to contain  the heavy cannons from firing. And just about 2 minutes before the onslaught ends, they break through and destroy the SIN connection. commander shouting ""Get the hell outa there we have Melding incoming"", as a Blue wall of Death approaches what's left of our squadron. Turn around and boost for are lives , and the sounds of the game stop. It's just the beaten defenders, fleeing in a hail of bullets.Never has a defeat felt so awesome. We were beaten for the day, but some of us would live to fight another. Comrades falling left and right, with no time to save them. And yet we knew we would come back for payback. it was absolutely beautiful.			"

Think Quake 3, combine with Tribes and throw in progression and fast-paced combat that can have you engaging a single mission over the space of kilometres.Now throw in open-world PvP, eSports, raids, open-world global events bringing together hundreds of players and you've got Firefall.

												I think that it verges on fraud that this game is still listed on Steam. A year or two ago it was a great game, but the publisher laid off the entire dev team and there is no support or on going development for this game. DO NOT buy any of the DLC for it. As I understand it you can't level a character past 10 because the quest line you need to progress has been broken for months.The only reason it's still up is to try soak money from people for a busted product.

												At first myself and a friend enjoyed this game, it felt a little like borderlands in it's aproach to fps. Then they moved servers. Ever since then this game has been unplayable for us, and we have a stupid fast internet connection (65mb/s), but the lag is completely unbearable. This game cannot stabilize for anything, the latency is horrid and you can't do anything without it taking 2-3 seconds for the character to do it. For an MMO that's bad but for an fps that's a fatal flaw. The game was marginal when it worked well, after the server move it is worthless. I'm really sad about that as I have been looking for an fpsmmo. What a let down. Don't waste your time.			"

												Effectively dead. Zero support, the 1st mission zone-in button has beee broken for 6+ months (after maybe the 6th account progression reset). The dynamic scaling texture/LoD system is broken, making it look worse than it did 2+ years ago.The servers go have gone down multiple times without warning, most recently for for 2+ weeks (dec 2016) with not a single comment from whoever is left of the PR/dev/publisher teams. A great concept. Open world third person shooterplayer versus dynamic AI invasions and calling down ""thumper"" mining rigs for resources used to craft and repair gear). Ruined by whatever happened since it his public alpha, 3-4 total progression overhauls, cutting of seemingly complete gameplay mechanics and the introduction of MMO/RPG style level-gated content where previously the core difficulty came from enemy mix and respawn/event frequency.

												I was a open/closed beta test player for this a lot of years ago, and it was interesting, fun, and demanded a lot of your time. (Cant Recall which, Never checked the profile for a long time.) When you ventured outskirts, there were generators that were able to expand the zone from the death zone BUT temporarily. It demanded teamwork and patience to move about, but also intense because you couldnt stay in a zone for a long time. Mining was profitable on those places as well but when that timer hits zero, you better haul ♥♥♥ back to the main area. Hell, there were defense events that get everyone SCREWED OVER when that deadly globe expands fast to the location or town you were trying to protect.  That I remember truly. It was intense as I constantly did that with a few more people. I loved that immersion.After a few years of that, on my absence I came back yet again, but the normal version. It was weird, It changed its mainframe system so something about Skill points and Gears. That was odd. I played a few more but stuck on the first major locale since I was just bored and wasting time, doing Tower re-takes, missions and you name it. Then I took a break again and decided to check again. R&D was screwed. You cant use them since they were broken. I noticed a few trying use Thumpers to mine, but since that was broken, What would BE THE MEANING OF R&D? Its just a waste of space on invetory and a system that was good to invest in.I did a few missions and said ""Eh."" but never gave me that same taste again. I wonder if it's just wore me out or I'm not into this sort of thing, but If I wasnt, I wouldnt participate and play that early. I'm really sorry for something such fun to play solo and with friends, became rather down, I'm sure other's reviews can explain better than I am.  "

												Note: Steam achievements are rather annoying, unlocked several achievements at once due to being a previous player before steam version came out (only after one achievement was unlocked that i did not have and then all achievements previously unlocked have unlocked)Been a player since the Closed beta, they have seriously come a long way and some of it is not for the better of the game...They have revamped the resources almost 4 different times in the game, changed up the Crafting three seperate times, changed up leveling the frames twice, and changed PVP/PVE functions about twice as well (PVP more than PVE).The game is heavily based around skill of the player with a hint of luck with the gear related, so long as you keep moving you generally will survive most conflicts against the Chosen and the creatures of the world. There is a very diverse variaty of Weapons and Frames to choose from ranging from the classic Archtypes as followsAssault: General class has abilities that can be both used for close combat and long range, your basic build types but branches out into some more exclusive types for Heavier damage or crowd controlDreadnaught: Heavy Class, your massive brick wall that can just take everything and everyone at once and still keep on going, has rapid fire weapons and shield type abilities, branches off into classes that can create shields, become walking armories, or just straight up bullet spitter.Recon: Long range support type class, does have some close combat capabilities but eventually branches out into a long range support class that can be utterly devistating to anything, can cloak itself with certain abilities and even create havoc against the enemy targets by making them attack clones or other enemy troops. Branches off into Heavier sniper type frames armed with Bolt action rifles or charged energy riflesMedic: Healer class, starts off very slow and rather hard to level unless you have some friends but after a while it can branch off to become a very self sufficient frame. Can revive faster than any other class and has abilities to poison and even set some traps if players know what they are doing. Branches off to become a strong healing frame or a more offensive DPS frameEngineer: The Supporter class, can create anything and everything that has a gun attached to it really, can create support turrets, landmines, knockback weapons, and stations that give ammo/health/armor and boosters for damage. Can branch off into a stronger defensive class with more turrets and supportive drops, or an offensive buffer that can boost friendlies weapons and use a railgun.Overall there are quite a few combinations in the end, the game is fun and players who have been around enjoy it and oddly enough still come back to see what else is new with the game...8.5 out of 10 "

												At least this game is free-to-play. Otherwise I would have wasted some good money.Okay, so it's TRIED to be individual, and to ""fix"" things that are wrong with MMOs. Well, trying is fine in alpha and such, but now? It just doesn't cut it. Upon first entering the game, you enter a tutorial to teach you about the game's basics. That's all well and good, and tutorials aren't meant to be absolutely amazing and show the game at its best, but they should show you a taster of the game and encourage you to indulge more time into it. However, this isn't the case. Graphics are poor, textures are just splotchy and undefined. This is slightly less on your gun, but even so, the background and scenery is not fantastic. Looking past this, I endevour to listen to the awkward narration informing me about the classes. Slightly generic classes, yet they look fun to play, especially the one called ""Assault"" where you have a rifle and jetpack-thing. The jetpack proved to be the only fun part.You're thrown into some shooting and you need to defend certain locations from enemies, which is standard for tutorial, and I accepted it. So I was shooting away, along with various other people, and the first thing I noticed was that there was no satisfaction for me. I was shooting these aliens or whatever, and they gave no response. The only thing you notice is their helath dereasing, but then you're not sure whether it's you doing that, or other players. There's no change when shot, they just keep coming at you until they're dead. Now that's a fantastic part of all shooters, the satisfaction of eliminating your targets in the game, and receiving a reaction, whereas you may not be able to do the same thing ""irl"".So this, along with other reasons, discouraged me and drained the fun out of the experience. The tutorial kind of sucked. Which made me not want to play any more of the game. Well I tried to play more, but upon finishing the tutorial and loading up the next mission, the game crashed and shut down. Zero motivation to load it up again, zero motivation to play it again.Try it, as it's free and might be your cup of tea, but I wasnt satisfied with FireFall.			"

												This game failed to keep me interested. The initial story cutscene was alright, but after that I was thrust into a world where I had no idea what I was doing. Mind, I was using a controller... but any other shooter game where I've connected a controller, console or otherwise, the controls have all been the same. Firefall completely changed the majority of those controls, and I had no idea what I was doing half the time.On top of that, I didn't even need to do anything. In the first mission, I was just standing at the spawn point trying to figure out the options menu while everyone else murdered all the NPC enemies. I closed the options menu when I heard that the first objective had been cleared, because I wanted to actually contribute. But I felt like I wasn't; there were no less than 20 people shooting with me, so it felt like anything I was doing was pointless.Yes, this is a biased review because I played Destiny just a couple of weeks ago. I'm buying Destiny and deleting Firefall. I would suggest the same for everyone else.			"

												The game itself is great. There are pretty nice encounters and dungeons with fine voice acting that i liked. Bosses are fun to kill and PvP is also enjoyable.. Shooting MMO is something kinda new and this one is from the better ones... BUT... The loot policy in this game is TOTALY wrong. Imagine 10 hours raid in WoW with nothing but green drops. Yes, thats Firefall. They try to slow down players progression that much, that is unacceptable. The fact that shooting game isn't for relaxing (like WoW mainly is), it makes raiding more fun, but you also feel more tired after an hour raid for example... And if you find totaly nothing (No DKP / token system) from that raid.. i really mean NOTHING.. you are pretty disappointed and you feel like you wasted your hour. Every single patch they do follows this loot policy... like a week ago they added a new patch with new dungeon. It was fun to play, again.. i enjoyed it. The dungeon run took me around 40 minutes with other players and guess what i got from the last boss as only reward? Green item. Thats it, 40 minutes wasted, i don't want to do that again.Raid timers reset at wednesday, people usually login just to do time-locked raids (where you have like 10% to get 1 purple item, which is the biggest chance you get in this game) but today, there was like 10 people wanting to raid in the whole EU server. After the last patch, where devs promised ""changes to loot system"" but players still got screwed, most of them just left the game...The game is dead, no playerbase and im leaving too. Great game killed by series of bad decisions and horrible loot system.			"

												I´ve been playing this game quite a few month now, since I bought a founder pack in the very beginnig. And I must say its the best MMO in a long time. Even so they changed alot in the process and you gotta start over a couple of times, I´m quite satisfied with the state its in right now.Its rare in any MMO for having so much opportunities. All the Battleframes for example. Even if you dont wanna spend any money on the game you got 5 frames to start with and once you leveld em up you can unlock even more frames.And if you get bored by one frame (which doesnt happen if you choose the right one for you), you can just switch to another frame.You got alot of quests, missions, weapons, skills, areas and pvp just to name a few things.The game takes quite some time to explore and find all the features in the game, but seriously who wants to finish an MMO in one week? :)You dont even have to spend money to level up faster, coz with a group you´re allways leveling up no matter if you got the xp boost or not.All the new missions are fun too and the worldmap is alot bigger then in the beginning. The game isnt as complex anymore with all the diffrent resources gone, which some people like and some hate, but its easier to understand if you´re new to the game.So all in all the game is awesome and was definitely worth the 100$ for the founders pack and I´m spending another 100$ for the Digital Deluxe Edition coz in my opinion I had alot of fun in this game and will have in the future:)Try it out, if you like it support the game^^			"

												I've played this game since Open Beta and absolutely loved it. Made some really good ingame friends too. The community was awesome. If you needed help with a mission you just had to ask in chat.I'm not going to repeat what happened with the game. I think there's a number of posts that that say it better then me.I still have hope for the game (in terms that someone will buy the IP from the9 and do a roll back) but as it stands it's not even worthy of standing in the shadows of it's former glory.Final thoughts - We will always love you Firefall but we just don't recoginse you any longer and for that we're sorry.

												To summarize what's written below: Developers are working on porting this game to other platforms and I would strongly suggest to wait until it is done. With the way the game looks now I think the game will shut down before that happens.So my experience with this game is a little mixed. I tried this game when it first launched for a few days and I thought it was good. There were lots of players, monsters and random battle events (I didn't know why they were taking place, but they were fun). I didn't play it at the time because at the time I had 6 other games on the queue and I got pulled in by 1 of them. Now  I came back to try it and it changed a bit in terms of gameplay (not a bad change in my eyes), but it degraded significantly as an MMO: Some stuff got removed/disabled. I don't want to list it all, but take my word for it: It was there and now it's not. Few bugs (minor bugs; most of the time gameplay doesn't suffer) At least low to mid level areas are empty: No players and almost no events. I feel like I'm running in an empty map most of the time. Developers are working on porting this game to PS4 and ""mobile"" platforms. To me that means that until the PS4 (and other) versions are made the game will be frozen and playerbase will keep decreasing. "

It does this whenever you move out of where it thinks you need to be.It's horrible.  When it decides to have bugs, it will be bugs that own't let you play.  You'll have menus taken away from you, quests will be removed from your menu part-way through them.Friend and I had to remake characters just to get to level 10.Kill this game with fire, report it until it is dead.

												I have spent a decent amount of time in the Firefall universe and from that I can say Firefall is a great game thats addictive for a long period of time. There is no need to use real life money, most of the items you can buy are cosmetic, vehicles and advanced frames(classes). Once you hit level 40 you can purchase an advanced battleframe for free. The more max levels you have you get a 10% exp increase that stacks for your battleframes that arent level 40. Sadly the late game isn't really that good yet so you will end up doing repetitive level grinding with different battleframes. Over all I would give Firefall 7/10			"

												Used to be an excellent, fast-paced MMOFPS. But as time has gone on, most of the enjoyable elements have been stripped out and replaced with extremely simplified and bland systems, while the fast pace has been slowed to a crawl (Most likely to facilitate the paid-purchase Vehicles and Gliders). Performance and stability has gotten progressively worse as well.Some examples of what to expect from modern Firefall:-Lengthy cooldowns on all abilities and usable items. Previously, abilities could be given deployment charges, so that they could be used multiple times before recharge. This is gone.-Alt Fires have been removed from all weapons in favour of Iron Sights. Including the flamethrower. A Flamethrower. With Iron Sights.-Buildings sometimes fail to load entirely after a death and respawn. Previously an extremely rare issue, now more frequent.			"

The game itself is very beautiful and has a special kind of Sandbox and MMO feel to it.I personally find it good and will keep playing it. but with some breaks because it gets very frustrating sometimes.Entirely up to you if you wanna put up with it, but try it out maybe you can live with it to experience the game ! :)Rate 8/10			"

												Firefall is the action MMO that I have been looking for.  It has the skill-based shooter action that satisfies my trigger finger, along with the adventure of exploring a vast open world that keeps things from getting boring.  There is always something going on somewhere to help out with, whether you are on a specific job or just wandering around.  By the way, compared with some of the other depressing post-apocalyptic worlds that I have played in games like Defiance, the Firefall world is actually pretty.  I'd be playing it right now, if it wasn't installing a big update!			"

												Okay, so this is a rough one for me. I've been TRYING to figure out how to write a short review for this game for quite some time, and I think I've got it figured out.This game has come MILES from where it started in some good ways (like simplifying gear / crafting), and in some bad ways (like simplifying gear / crafting). Let me explain that briefly: There used to be a BAJILLION resources, seriously look it up, and it was completely silly. They managed to trim it down to base resources, and it was certainly (unless you have some form of crazy you agree) a vast improvement. The problem is, this game with a complete dumbing down of the gear system. You used to be able to deeply customize your frames (jump jets - armor - energy - speed) all kinds of stuff, and it was pretty cool (though a bit rough to keep up with in crafting). The new version basically lets you equip a ""core"" that modifies energy, jumping, etc. and then lets you equip ability modules, and guns, that's it. I know, I know, it's way more simple, but in a strange way, it also killed some of the MMO feeling to the game.The story is ... well ... there now, which is another huge step up. The voice-over missions are a nice touch, and the expanded zones hare pretty sweet as well (though it's a bit sparse in terms of content).Now, for people that don't give a crap about what the game used to be in contrast, here's the quick and dirty list:GOOD:The game is easy on the eyes, has character for days, controls are tight, combat is fun, guns feel good, kills are gratifying (even after your millionth one).BAD:Getting around sucks, which means you are going to buy a vehicle from the cash shop rather you want to or not (unless something has changed in my off time in which case I'll edit this), Thumping for resources doesn't feel as meaningful as it should, crafting is a bit shallow, no reason for alts / re-rolls at all (possibly a good feature), world (though huge) still doesn't feel very fleshed out, and it's oddly demanding on system resources for a fairly old game (poor optimization).Should you play it?Yeah, sure, why the hell not? As a FTP title, it's fine. Install it, run through a few hours, worst case scenario you don't like it, and you uninstall it. If you have a few buddies to play the game with, it's a pretty good time (I don't much care for it solo but maybe that's more your bag). There you have it.			"

												Firefall is a great MMORPG for it being Free to Play. Unlike most F2Ps, it doesn't act like a Pay to Win, rather Pay for convenience and cosmetics. It has an excellent crafting system, but it takes a while for the items to be completed. You can, however, pay 1 Red Bean, which is the game's paid currency, to instantly complete the crafting process. You aren't required to pay for Red Beans, however. With using the game's common currency, Crystite, you can obtain Credits, and convert those credits into Red Beans. You can obtain nearly everything in this game without spending anything, which I would like to see in more games. I didn't think this game would've changed much from the Beta, but it turns out that this game finally made it's way out of development hell. Replayable missions, great combat mechanics, fun dynamic events, good loot system, beautiful open-world, this game is really good and I think people should at least try it as it is Free to Play.

												I played this when it was first playable, about 2yrs ago or something and it wasn't fun... but it was in Alpha.I played it today and was very IMPRESSED.  I've been playing MMOs for about 10yrs and Firefall reminds me of one of my favorites, Global Agenda.  I'm tired of tab-targeting like in WoW and SWTOR.  I now prefer games like World of Tanks and Naval Action where you have to aim.  Firefall does that as well.  Graphics are good, if you like the Borderland look.  Gameplay is smooth and I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of other players.  Fun game and killing bugs makes me feel like I've entered Starship Troopers!Definately recommend this game.			"

My friends list is empty, the areas a vacant and going back to the lower areas would be nice to do so if there where players to play with. Because of the hype when this first came out it was full and across several servers, now it's been merged down to one and I'm lucky to see 100 people across different shards. If this was 2 years ago, I'd be more optimistic. I always try to keep this frame of mind when playing any game, especially ones that's from a smaller developer. The changes to the game in the latest patch killed the game. The 1.4 version of the game was vastly superior. Since it's free, have a look at the environments. They're awesome and have presence.

												I'm giving this game a qualified recommendation (read full review for clarification) that could just as well be a not recommended rating given how you look at my review.The game as it exists now is pretty good and you're not likely to find any other MMORPG shooter that has character build diversity in the form of Battle Frames instead of classes that this one has.  There was a lack of content at launch for the Americas and Europe but they've added a lot of content since then.  As a free to play game I can safely recommend it but I should note several caveats in doing so.This is really still a game in beta development at this point despite the fact that it was launched as finished product in the Americas and Europe.  This is pretty much undeniable as they have already gone through several small iterations of changes in core game mechanics such as the perk system, the module system used to customize player gear, an overhaul of the crafting system and changes in group loot distribution mechanics.The real launch is probably going to be the launch of the game in China at which point they are going to implement a gigantic block of changes that are going to substantively change core game mechanics such as weapon characteristics such as rate of fire, recoil and unique characteristics for some such as overheating for the Plasma Canon for the Assault Battle Frames, removal of a core aspect of the modules (power rating which scales damage up), and a complete redesign of the crafting system, scaling of mob damage and many other things.What this means is that the game you are going to be playing if you choose to play this game now instead of waiting until the end of the year will not be what the game is going to be with the China launch.  That also means that your gear will most likely be devalued with those changes which some players may want to avoid because that is a significant loss of investment of a player's time.  There has already been mention of item migration (the exchange of current in game items for new ones) for the crafting system but historically item migration in this game has meant inventory nerf.Therefore while I can recommend the game to play as a free to play game, I cannot recommend you invest any actual money in this game until there is a clear vision of what the game is after the China launch and, if you believe you would be frustrated seeing all or many of the fruits of your in game labor getting nerfed, I would advise you to hold off playing the game until then as well.One final note, the state of PvP in this game is pretty bad and probably as low as you're likely to find in any game.  The PvP comprises of duels and open world pvp in a region called Broken Peninsula, but the open world PvP has been shut down by the devs as a failure even though players can still engage in PvP there without the rewards system.  Arena PvP is going to be part of the China release version but currently no one has any idea what that will be like.			"

												Okay, so this is a rough one for me. I've been TRYING to figure out how to write a short review for this game for quite some time, and I think I've got it figured out.This game has come MILES from where it started in some good ways (like simplifying gear / crafting), and in some bad ways (like simplifying gear / crafting). Let me explain that briefly: There used to be a BAJILLION resources, seriously look it up, and it was completely silly. They managed to trim it down to base resources, and it was certainly (unless you have some form of crazy you agree) a vast improvement. The problem is, this game with a complete dumbing down of the gear system. You used to be able to deeply customize your frames (jump jets - armor - energy - speed) all kinds of stuff, and it was pretty cool (though a bit rough to keep up with in crafting). The new version basically lets you equip a ""core"" that modifies energy, jumping, etc. and then lets you equip ability modules, and guns, that's it. I know, I know, it's way more simple, but in a strange way, it also killed some of the MMO feeling to the game.The story is ... well ... there now, which is another huge step up. The voice-over missions are a nice touch, and the expanded zones hare pretty sweet as well (though it's a bit sparse in terms of content).Now, for people that don't give a crap about what the game used to be in contrast, here's the quick and dirty list:GOOD:The game is easy on the eyes, has character for days, controls are tight, combat is fun, guns feel good, kills are gratifying (even after your millionth one).BAD:Getting around sucks, which means you are going to buy a vehicle from the cash shop rather you want to or not (unless something has changed in my off time in which case I'll edit this), Thumping for resources doesn't feel as meaningful as it should, crafting is a bit shallow, no reason for alts / re-rolls at all (possibly a good feature), world (though huge) still doesn't feel very fleshed out, and it's oddly demanding on system resources for a fairly old game (poor optimization).Should you play it?Yeah, sure, why the hell not? As a FTP title, it's fine. Install it, run through a few hours, worst case scenario you don't like it, and you uninstall it. If you have a few buddies to play the game with, it's a pretty good time (I don't much care for it solo but maybe that's more your bag). There you have it.			"

												I haven't played this game in a while, but I think I should say, that I played when it was in Beta, when everything was simple. It was what WoW/GW/GW2 had to offer, but syfy, simple to get a grasp of, AND f2p. But I had noticed that when I did play this again, that everything was a bit more difficult to understand, and get the grasp of.  I noticed, if you were a vet and had higher rigs (Even beginning rigs) for the most part, combat was easy. I remeber the Choosen normally was taking watch towers left and right. Players had to constantly take them back; and taking them back wasn't all that easy. But when I played I could basically 1 man take a tower back with engineer.And for it being easy, almost all the events(Bosses, raids,etc.) were extremely easy to complete, you only had a bunch of people there to just get some quick and easy loot. But when I started playing this in 2014, everything about it was a bit challengeing and I think thats what most people liked, was that it wasn't easy to do everything, then that one patch came or something and then anyone; Experienced, or new could be able to 1 man any event or enemy. So, I wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone, if it was back when it was in beta I would've def reccomended this to anyone who asked about this, but now I don't think anyone should play this game till they do something about it and try to bring it back to the way it was back in beta.

												Firefall is a great MMORPG for it being Free to Play. Unlike most F2Ps, it doesn't act like a Pay to Win, rather Pay for convenience and cosmetics. It has an excellent crafting system, but it takes a while for the items to be completed. You can, however, pay 1 Red Bean, which is the game's paid currency, to instantly complete the crafting process. You aren't required to pay for Red Beans, however. With using the game's common currency, Crystite, you can obtain Credits, and convert those credits into Red Beans. You can obtain nearly everything in this game without spending anything, which I would like to see in more games. I didn't think this game would've changed much from the Beta, but it turns out that this game finally made it's way out of development hell. Replayable missions, great combat mechanics, fun dynamic events, good loot system, beautiful open-world, this game is really good and I think people should at least try it as it is Free to Play.

												This game is alright, I enjoy it. There are great things about it. You can have multiple classes and switch at any civilized area. You have the jump packs, and the Gliders which allow for long distance ""flying"". There are Bikes, Mining (Thumping), and you can do it all in a Squad with your friends. It's also truly Free to Play. You don;t need to spend any real money unless you want to be a VIP player. Or you devote hours are quests and convert what you get into Red Beans (VIP currency). I wouldn't recommend doing that though, my friend spent several hours trying to get enough stuff and only got 28 Red Beans which is practically nothing.There are issues I have with it. There's VERY little campaign, as in you get a campaign mission every few levels. The missions are pretty straight forward, you go somewhere, shoot some people, and then go back to where you started. I also believe the game was supposed to be originally PvP, but I've only seen that in some much higher level areas. Which brings up another problem: the maps, while very large, are few. There are around 6 different maps (I can't remeber I can't bother to check).The game has potenial to be something great, its just not there yet. You could play it, you could not, but I've enjoyed it somefar. Though I admit, playing alone is boring as Hell.			"

												I have spent a decent amount of time in the Firefall universe and from that I can say Firefall is a great game thats addictive for a long period of time. There is no need to use real life money, most of the items you can buy are cosmetic, vehicles and advanced frames(classes). Once you hit level 40 you can purchase an advanced battleframe for free. The more max levels you have you get a 10% exp increase that stacks for your battleframes that arent level 40. Sadly the late game isn't really that good yet so you will end up doing repetitive level grinding with different battleframes. Over all I would give Firefall 7/10			"

												This game has an awesome ""mass effect"" feel with the combination of 3rd person fire fights along with skill and power usage. I think the system for crafting is very adaptive and balanced considering the amount of advantage to be gained from a crafted weapon. The only complaint i have is that you have to get a frame to a max level before unlockign the next frame, this will force someone to play for months on a frame they dont like before getting the one they like. I hear rumur they will be fixing this and i hope its true. Either way the game was good enough to spend some money on.			"

												Used to be an excellent, fast-paced MMOFPS. But as time has gone on, most of the enjoyable elements have been stripped out and replaced with extremely simplified and bland systems, while the fast pace has been slowed to a crawl (Most likely to facilitate the paid-purchase Vehicles and Gliders). Performance and stability has gotten progressively worse as well.Some examples of what to expect from modern Firefall:-Lengthy cooldowns on all abilities and usable items. Previously, abilities could be given deployment charges, so that they could be used multiple times before recharge. This is gone.-Alt Fires have been removed from all weapons in favour of Iron Sights. Including the flamethrower. A Flamethrower. With Iron Sights.-Buildings sometimes fail to load entirely after a death and respawn. Previously an extremely rare issue, now more frequent.			"

												Firefall is surprisingly good. It is very similar to the Boderlands titles or the Oblivion MMO.  I have checked out a lot of MMOs and this one is a real gem. Best of all, even though it is free-to-play, it is not pay-to-win. If you want to put in the time grinding research and materials, you can craft all sorts of super-powerful weapons and mods. But, crafting them will be quite the grind indeed. High-level purple gear with purple mods in every equipment slot does not come easy, but you do not have to sink one single penny in to get them.  PvP is a bit of a disappointment:  huge sandboxes where you need a large squad of friends to survive for long....solo players are just sniper fodder or gang-attack fodder. But the PvE game comes highly recommended.  I liked it so much I felt motivated to write this, my first review.			"

												Although not groundbreaking in it's field of Indie and MMO RPGs, Firefall does have many great advantages to it and has a set uniqueness that is well worth the download. As a whole the game keeps the player involved and gives them a set goal that looms throughout the game while still maintaining the importance of side goals and missions. Besides this the graphics maintain a great quality throughout the game even on the lowest settings. It is worth noting that the game does have a slight ""pay to win"" feel at first, but with effort most if not all of the things that can be defined as ""important"" can be earned with time and not money. All this coupled with it's well written missions and stellar player interaction makes it a must have in most gamers' libraries.9/10Well worth the ""nothing"" it costsWould recommend to most players interested in MMO RPGs and Indie type games			"

												JAN 2016 update:So after a year of no updates, they have completely changed the game again. Up until December 2015 it was actually looking promising. Then they decided to ♥♥♥♥ up everything again, because apparently the devs can't go more than 6 months without changing everything. They removed all the weapon alt-fire modes just to slap on ADS on everything and turned down the run speed so the game is slow as hell. All the passive perks that made the frames different were removed because they were too confusing? What the ♥♥♥♥ Red 5?  Firefall was a promising massive open world shooter with arena PvP, now it is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crafting/economy based MMORPG with no PvP. Another game killed by its developers. It seems they fixed most of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! No more gear breaking permanently, crafting and resources have been simplified, and although it not Arena PvP there is Open World PvP in the game now.Biggest issue right now that I see is inventory slots. I had 700+ items in my inventory since the last time I played last summer/fall. The item cap is at 155, so the first hour or so I was just salvaging junk to get under the cap so my character could move, and I spent all the Red Beans (ingame currency) I had left on buying item slots to get up to 235. Having the cap start at 200 and go up by 25 at same prices would be better.  "

												This game failed to keep me interested. The initial story cutscene was alright, but after that I was thrust into a world where I had no idea what I was doing. Mind, I was using a controller... but any other shooter game where I've connected a controller, console or otherwise, the controls have all been the same. Firefall completely changed the majority of those controls, and I had no idea what I was doing half the time.On top of that, I didn't even need to do anything. In the first mission, I was just standing at the spawn point trying to figure out the options menu while everyone else murdered all the NPC enemies. I closed the options menu when I heard that the first objective had been cleared, because I wanted to actually contribute. But I felt like I wasn't; there were no less than 20 people shooting with me, so it felt like anything I was doing was pointless.Yes, this is a biased review because I played Destiny just a couple of weeks ago. I'm buying Destiny and deleting Firefall. I would suggest the same for everyone else.			"

												Overall a good game, worth a try. An interesting mix of FPS/TPS and MMORPG.Pros:+ Decent voice acting.+ Good variety of classes/Battleframes to choose. You get 5 basic Battleframes, that you can change at any time to suit your playstyle and additional 11 Battleframes, that you can unlock later.+ Very large maps, with a lot of quests and dynamic quests that apear randomly. (world bosses, invasions, etc.)+ Good gunplay combined with the skills of the Battleframe.Cons:- Quests are very similar to each other, for example: go to point A, kill some dudes or scan some trash, then go to point B, then kill some more dudes or scan some more trash, then go back to the questgiver. The Only quests that stand out are some story missions and dungeons/ instances.- Leveling up Battleframes takes a long time.- Large amount of bugs and glitches, which range from graphical bugs, sound bugs and even some nasty gameplay bugs. Restarting the game helps with most of these bugs, but still it's not great.			"

												Note: Steam achievements are rather annoying, unlocked several achievements at once due to being a previous player before steam version came out (only after one achievement was unlocked that i did not have and then all achievements previously unlocked have unlocked)Been a player since the Closed beta, they have seriously come a long way and some of it is not for the better of the game...They have revamped the resources almost 4 different times in the game, changed up the Crafting three seperate times, changed up leveling the frames twice, and changed PVP/PVE functions about twice as well (PVP more than PVE).The game is heavily based around skill of the player with a hint of luck with the gear related, so long as you keep moving you generally will survive most conflicts against the Chosen and the creatures of the world. There is a very diverse variaty of Weapons and Frames to choose from ranging from the classic Archtypes as followsAssault: General class has abilities that can be both used for close combat and long range, your basic build types but branches out into some more exclusive types for Heavier damage or crowd controlDreadnaught: Heavy Class, your massive brick wall that can just take everything and everyone at once and still keep on going, has rapid fire weapons and shield type abilities, branches off into classes that can create shields, become walking armories, or just straight up bullet spitter.Recon: Long range support type class, does have some close combat capabilities but eventually branches out into a long range support class that can be utterly devistating to anything, can cloak itself with certain abilities and even create havoc against the enemy targets by making them attack clones or other enemy troops. Branches off into Heavier sniper type frames armed with Bolt action rifles or charged energy riflesMedic: Healer class, starts off very slow and rather hard to level unless you have some friends but after a while it can branch off to become a very self sufficient frame. Can revive faster than any other class and has abilities to poison and even set some traps if players know what they are doing. Branches off to become a strong healing frame or a more offensive DPS frameEngineer: The Supporter class, can create anything and everything that has a gun attached to it really, can create support turrets, landmines, knockback weapons, and stations that give ammo/health/armor and boosters for damage. Can branch off into a stronger defensive class with more turrets and supportive drops, or an offensive buffer that can boost friendlies weapons and use a railgun.Overall there are quite a few combinations in the end, the game is fun and players who have been around enjoy it and oddly enough still come back to see what else is new with the game...8.5 out of 10 "

The only thing left of it are the character models and the setting. Also don't bother to submit a ticket if you run into a problem, no developers are left to answer you.

												It's an open world sci-fi shooter with all kinds of creatures to slay and leveling your class up. once you level up your health improves. there are more than 1 class as well, I personally enjoy the assault most but also like sniping, so there is something for everyone. If you like open world and you like shooting, and MMO games, this is the kind of game you want, and it's free as well, who wouldn't try that at least? very good game a lot of potential that I am excited to unlock on my journey which has only just begun, fantasy sci-fi shooter MMO, that's what I want to call it. definitely try it out if you get a chance and build your own opinion of the game :)			"

												Firefall is surprisingly good. It is very similar to the Boderlands titles or the Oblivion MMO.  I have checked out a lot of MMOs and this one is a real gem. Best of all, even though it is free-to-play, it is not pay-to-win. If you want to put in the time grinding research and materials, you can craft all sorts of super-powerful weapons and mods. But, crafting them will be quite the grind indeed. High-level purple gear with purple mods in every equipment slot does not come easy, but you do not have to sink one single penny in to get them.  PvP is a bit of a disappointment:  huge sandboxes where you need a large squad of friends to survive for long....solo players are just sniper fodder or gang-attack fodder. But the PvE game comes highly recommended.  I liked it so much I felt motivated to write this, my first review.			"

												before this was a Steam game - i had almost 300 hours in this game. i am a founder. i bought (real $) into this game back when it was an idea. i followed it. i wanted it to succeed. and, to a point, it has. as someone who knows what is missing, and have seen it in the past, i feel this game lacks that. (namely Arena PvP and JETBALL, the Tech Tree, and meaningful professions) but that is all in the past (bitter as i am) taking the game alone, how it is now, is totally a different game. and not in a bad way. just different. all change has good and sour notes. ill start with the bad, only so i can end on the good..bad:still no real PvP worth doing. the 'open world PVP' is basically 'he who has the biggest gun wins' and no real skill curve.the player market is useless. no reason to sell, and because of that, nothing to buy there. it feels like its a solo expiernce. re-grinding out the higher frames (Firecat, Mamoth, Arsinal, .....) feels like too much as you need to do the grind first just to unlock them. there should be alternatives to griding for advanced battle frames. (flat progression was better in the past..)most fight feel too easy. i can bullet sponge most of it and not feel really challanged. i remember a time when the Chosen whould DESTROY you if they found you alone. they where scary. now - a few good hits with my thermal cannon - Dead. and they dont hit very hard any more. the same could be said for the PvE mobs like the Tienkin or the roaming animals.the good:the combat is VERY fluid. the controls play well for the game type. it mixes MMO/fantacy gameplay well with FPS speed and hip-shooting so well its REALLY hard not to have a lot of fun.the squad system has gotten better, and it makes playing in groups with friends or strangers much more fun.the research tree gives a valid reason to sink time into progressing your frames and getting more gear. my only complaint here is that we should specialize. make it meaningful that i maxed out something, so i could sell it on the market and make credits. or else i could do it all myself, and avoid the market all together (that is the corrent meta)im missing some points, but in the end, the game is still fun. i still like the game (though not the same as i used to) if i didnt complain, it whould mean i didnt like it, and didnt care. i only get mad because i do care ,adn i want this game to be successful.

												The game itself is great. There are pretty nice encounters and dungeons with fine voice acting that i liked. Bosses are fun to kill and PvP is also enjoyable.. Shooting MMO is something kinda new and this one is from the better ones... BUT... The loot policy in this game is TOTALY wrong. Imagine 10 hours raid in WoW with nothing but green drops. Yes, thats Firefall. They try to slow down players progression that much, that is unacceptable. The fact that shooting game isn't for relaxing (like WoW mainly is), it makes raiding more fun, but you also feel more tired after an hour raid for example... And if you find totaly nothing (No DKP / token system) from that raid.. i really mean NOTHING.. you are pretty disappointed and you feel like you wasted your hour. Every single patch they do follows this loot policy... like a week ago they added a new patch with new dungeon. It was fun to play, again.. i enjoyed it. The dungeon run took me around 40 minutes with other players and guess what i got from the last boss as only reward? Green item. Thats it, 40 minutes wasted, i don't want to do that again.Raid timers reset at wednesday, people usually login just to do time-locked raids (where you have like 10% to get 1 purple item, which is the biggest chance you get in this game) but today, there was like 10 people wanting to raid in the whole EU server. After the last patch, where devs promised ""changes to loot system"" but players still got screwed, most of them just left the game...The game is dead, no playerbase and im leaving too. Great game killed by series of bad decisions and horrible loot system.			"

												I have a dream that one day the devs at Red5 will pull their heads out of their colons and realize they had an amazing open world MMO with a major fanbase and growing interest in the title. Now that they've stripped almost everything that made Firefall different from all the other boring oversimplied futuristic MMOs out there, I have a hard time recommending it. Now its okay, midly above mediocre when it's working and not lagging or crashing to desktop.Red5 chose conformity over diversity.			"

												Why do I reccommend this game?-Great visuals-Fun exploration-Nice class customization and freedom to swap between them.-Battling for territory against NPC's (Even though it may be a small feature)-varying scales of battles with NPC's during events, may require you to work together with others-Great game to play while listening to podcasts.What I (and you might also) dislike about this game:-Repetitive missions-Needs to give more incentive to us players so that we will WANT to max out our reputation with other factions and complete repetitive missions and events.OVERALL, its a nice game that I would play while listening to a podcast or at a time where I just feel the need to get a quick game in to blow off some steam after a bad day. If you plan on dedicating a good amount of your time, and money, to this game I suggest joining up with an ""Army"" and making a few friends that you can run around and have fun with ingame as it seems that this is the type of game that can quickly turn into a boring chore.I SUGGEST the developers look at updating the game with things such as adding more diverse missions and events, maybe even player specific events, perhaps have more interaction between the player and the various factions to give more incentive to gaining their trust, or even allow the player to choose to gain the trust of the more evil factions. Anything to get rid of the repetitivenness currently plagueing the game, lest it divulge into a themepark MMO.If I had to score this game, I would give it a 5/10. It's your average Free to Play MMORPG.			"

												This game feels in every way like an upgrade to Global Agenda, which could be good or bad depending on your thoughts about GA.  People who do not know any better will liken Firefall to Borderlands or Team Fortress 2, but this is really inaccurate since the design of those two games is so basic by comparison.The world is open and explorable via jetpack, which speaks to the kind of player that I am since I absolutely love the exploration aspect of big games.  The combat is repetitive at times superficially, since that is how FPS games work (even though I play mostly in third person), but it never seems to get stale to me since you have variety in how you level.  You only need to create one character since you switch classes as needed, like in Final Fantasy XIV:  A Realm Reborn, which is a feature that I wish more developers using a class system in game would implement.  The crafting system is deep and useful at pretty much all levels, mounts are available immediately because of the size of the world, and the world itself feels quite dynamic, even in towns.  A cash shop does exist, but it is not pay-to-win at all since it provides only vanity items or other items / unlocks which you could earn naturally through the game, either by buying with credits or completing requisite criteria.  The contentious unlock from what I have seen is advanced classes (an engineer can become a bastion, for example), which you would normally unlock by levelling a core class to level 40.  However you obtain it, you still start that advanced class at level one like everyone else, though.Some obvious faults which you notice within a few hours of playing:-You are let loose into the world immediately, and if you do not adhere to the loose tutorial to learn fundamentals, you may very well feel like there is just so much going on with so little explanation.  Because the world allows you to stray from the tutorial, you probably will, and you will miss out on very important mechanic information as a result if this happens.  I ended up going back with a higher-level character to do it just to learn some basics which I missed.-This huge world is divided into also huge sections.  There does not seem to be quick travelling by default from within one large zone.  If you expect a hearthstone or something similar from other MMOs, you do not start with it; there is also no guidance on how to come across one from in-game tutorials.  It does exist, but it is not a right.-There is an inconsistency with many in-game models and their dialogue picture counterparts, where the models end up looking nothing like who is supposed to be speaking to you over your communication unit.-You may run into an endless ""loading next objective"" wall when doing job board missions.  Sometimes it resolves itself in five minutes or so, sometimes it does not.  Exiting the client has not resolved it for me before, so I have found that in this instance, go do other world events in the mean time.  Maybe it will resolve itself.  Since most of the game's story comes from job boards, you may see why this is a problem if you wish to follow the story.-Some objectives for world events do not update properly on your screen.  This is most commonly seen with crashed thumpers, where it consistently says that it is 0 / 5 parts needed to repair, no matter how many parts are brought to it.  That event does correctly end when five parts are brought to it, but the progress never shows.  Reloading the UI does not fix this.-Some on-screen effects, such as poison, may also never go away.  This includes the audio to accompany the effect, even when you are not afflicted by the condition.  Reloading the UI also does not fix this.-Load screens can take ages, and this is solely on the developer's end.  No loading in huge areas once you get in, but the loading TO get in can be 5+ minutes at times, sometimes less, since the loading appears to depend on the servers.-No player name filtering...I would prefer not to see idiots named SACK420 and xxTotalxDarknessxx in my game.-Other bugs exist, and from what I understand, the devs are not quick about addressing them.Oh, and the game is 100% free; you are by no means required to pay anything for the full experience unlike other ""freemium"" games.  This is, to me, the best free-to-play game right now.  It has full voice acting, visuals similar to Sanctum 2, much to see and do, and no entry fee.  The option to give money to the game in support of future content is unobtrusive if you do not care to pay, while such a fee is simultaneously low enough per month to be comparable to any other big MMO's subscription if you do want to contribute.  Just as how I would like to see more class-based games use Firefall's design in being able to switch classes as needed, I also would like to see more subscription-based games having 100% of the content available for free with perks for subscribing which do not skew the game so much in their favour just for paying money.tl;dr There is much content for zero dollars for RPG or FPS enthusiasts.

												Not a well-made game. PROS1. There are jetpacksNuff said.2. The intro present a pretty interesting game (but the excitement dies off when the game starts)The cinematics present a very exciting and cool game, where you get to play cool Battle Frames. However, in order to advance fast, you will see micro-transactions all over the shops, which kills the excitement.CONS1. Some bugs, Monsters follow you almost everywhere. You can lure them until the bases to be killed. Certain quests don't end even after you kill all the monsters. Lag time in between quest objectives, where quests objectives update very slowly.2. Game is emptyPlayer interaction is few and far between. The low server population numbers make the game feel like a solo RPG.3. Low long-distance mobility, Despite the use of jet packs in the game, tranversing over long distances only comes in 2 forms. Buying a bike or gliding over long distances. If you glide, you have to find specific glider points on the map, which tend to be in bases or craft and call in a 1-time glider launcher. The problem with the glider is that it constantly descends and you can only fly a certain distance(~300-500m). If the waypoint you are flying to is 1000m away, you have to trudge along the rest of the journey. If the next way point has no glider point, you'll have to run the whole way.4. Lack of contentThere are only 3 raids available at level 40 which is the level cap. More will be available as the game updates.5. The game is nowhere like the cinematicGameplay differs really far from advertising. Major fail in expectation. "

			Firefall Commander's LGVs are out, and I decided to take mine on a slow leisurely test drive. Does the LGV make my ♥♥♥ look big? =___=		

PS: you dont have the ""drop down your bike here and after that you can hop on"" blue thingy anymore! you now spawn it right under your 477, like in other games! :)			"

												I love this game! If you like pve, pvp, FPS, MMOs, or jetpacks, you should check out this game. Its fun, addicting, and it never gets old. With 5 different classes and 11 more (as I write this, at least) advanced classes, Firefall will have you coming back more times than Star Wars fans pick on Jar Jar. Its epic, its fun, and I can't get enough!			"

												I played this game in closed beta, it was not bad, but the bugs and server problems killed it for me. Now after the launch the game changed a lot. New zones, a lot of improvements in crafting, leveling and in the storyline. They added the currency exchange so now you can change in game currency for tokens and you can buy every cash shop items without paying. The GM team is nice, they answer to bug reports. We have every second week and weekends some live events and with next big patch they will going to add a new end-game zone in the game.			"
