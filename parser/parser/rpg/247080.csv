												I've been playing this game obsessively for a couple months now, and still can't get enough of it.  Learning the patterns of all the enemies is one of the most satisfying things I've ever done in any game.  When you start out, you're just fumbling around, faceplanting into enemies and getting torn apart.  If you practice enough, though, you'll be able to take on any situation without suffering so much as a scratch.  Every part of the game is very doable with the default equipment, so you're never just screwed because the right items didn't drop for you.  The weapons and spells that you can find all work differently and cause you to change your method of attack, but they're all pretty balanced.  There are a ton of different weapons types with their own unique advantages and drawbacks, rather than traditional ""tiers"" of weapons (1 damage, 2 damage, 3 damage, etc.)  And there's an instant replay feature upon death, where you can look and see what you could have done differently to save yourself (there's always SOMETHING).  This is quite possibly the most well-balanced game I've ever played, and I adore it.  Pick this game up right now if you can.Edit: If you have any doubts, just look at how many hours I've logged on it ;)Edited again, after launch day: Early access is over!  The game is complete and it's AMAZING.  I cannot believe how much better the game has gotten with time!  The final area and extra bosses have been added, and they really went all-out with the monster designs for the last zone.  And suddenly there are two entire new soundtracks to choose from?  Yes, please!  I cannot tell you how happy I am with how the final product came out.  I still play this all the time :)			"

												Hard as balls, fantastic music, great gameplay, and a great premise in the story.  It also has the side benefit of being completely unique, nothing else like it out there at the moment.A game I keep cursing at, rage quiting, and yet keep coming back to.  Truly rewarding, as the game gets better as you get better.Can't recommend it enough.			"

Early Access Review
""Kick! Punch! It's all in the mind.""These words were spoken by the great Tamanegi Sensei (better known as Chop Chop Master Onion) over 15 years ago when music-based games were first making a name, and they ring even truer today as the rhythm genre takes an evolutionary step into the dungeon crawling arena.NecroDancer is the holy matrimony between addictive rhythm game grooviness and challenging roguelike complexity, and I'll be damned if it doesn't hit the spot. It's amazing that a concept this unique took as long as it did to come to fruition, but it's been more than worth the wait.Not only is the concept unique but it's done right, something we hardly ever see when a new mechanic or gimmick is introduced to the gaming world for the first time. We see so many ""new"" ideas that are merely just a melting pot of previously established genres. Lo and behold, these developers have obviously set out to refine and perfect their concoction of varied gameplay elements on their first attempt and that is highly admirable. Necrodancer stands not only as a magnificently well-realized combination of genres but as a completely new experience of it's own and the start of what is hopefully a new trend of taking fun and risky chances in game development.The in-game music is dark, fantastic and quite danceable itself lending to the blissful feeling of hitting each beat of the song with perfect timing. The precision of the music-based movement has lead lots of early adopters of the game to swear by playing with DDR dancepads which apparently add a lot to the fun and engaging nature of exploring the Crypt. This shows a serious level of dedication from the rhythm game community and has already garnered enough attention to spawn it's own design of custom NecroDancer dancepads[necrodancer.com].And if you somehow are crazy enough to get tired of renowned composer Danny Baranowsky's heavy electronic horror jams, the game features an intuitive beat detection function for usage of songs from your own library. The detection of beats in your songs is generally spot on, and makes trying and discovering those perfect tunes for the game infinitely explorable and replayable for audiophiles in the same way games like Audiosurf and Beat Hazard Ultra provide endless entertainment. Even for those songs that might be a bit too fast or slow for manageable NecroDancing, there's a feature to alter the speed of in-game beats to give more accessibility for a wider range of genres. No form of music shall go undanced in the heart of these Crypts.There are four main floors to the game with three levels and a boss-type enemy each, but beating any single one of them won't be an easy task. You will retry many times being forced to scour every diamond, buy up all the upgrades, and loot your way through multiple plays before you succeed, but what makes this so much more of a pleasure to replay than any other games which borrow rogue elements is the musical nature of the game. NecroDancer replaces the repetitive and stale turn-based combat of traditional roguelikes with the fun and engaging audio interaction of the best rhythm games made to date.With a touch of the strategic approach of traditional tactics games, the enemies each have a very distinct pattern to their movements and attacks that the player must learn through multiple failures and awareness. Starting out you encounter the easier monsters such as slimes that move passively back and forth as well as skeletons that follow behind in a predictable way that is easy to counter. Protecting the exit of each floor are the harder and more complex mini-bosses, ranging from hulking Minotaurs that charge towards you in a straight path or determined Dragons that you must outsmart and keep just out of harm's way in order to retain your doomed life just a little longer.Throughout your journeys into the crypt you'll have two different forms of currency, first being gold coins that you can spend within the levels at merchants on equipment and items to help you on your current run. Second, and most importantly are the much harder to find Diamonds which are the only thing that carry over into the lobby after death, allowing you to purchase upgrades to the gear and loot you come across during your runs. This adds an insanely addictive level of persistence in the same way that the character growth in Rogue Legacy or shortcut system of Spelunky do.The shops you purchase these upgrades from won't be made available to you that easily, however, as each of the different merchants and trainers you need will be imprisoned and strewn about the various dungeons forcing you to dance deeper and deeper to rescue the people you will rely on in the future. The game is hard and you'll die many times, but the deeper you go the more you discover, and the more you discover the easier your respective trips will become. This adds a ridiculous amount of replayability and persistence to an already engaging and genre defying new formula.Here I am hopping and slashing away to the beat of Castlevania's 'Vampire Killer', and I come across a Blood Whip. Things could not be more perfect. Necrodancer isn't just a gimmick, it's the start of something beautiful, it's a new kind of entertainment that can be enjoyed from the hardecore-est of dungeon delving roguelite aficionados to the most casual of rhythm game fans, but there is one thing that all of these demographics must have in common; a dedication to the sound of music.

Crypt of the NecroDancer is quietly genius.It's exactly what you would imagine a game to be like if you were told it's a roguelike, but in real time, with the turns lasting as long as the beat of a soundtrack — because they are, in fact, set to a soundtrack. This kind of ""X meets Y"" high concept game (roguelike meets rhythm game, in this case) is easy to think up, but not as easy to turn into a good game, if the failed examples littering Steam are any indication. NecroDancer not only works, but works well — it's an astounding feat of game design, and it's likely you won't even notice that while you're playing because it just feels natural.This is one of the few roguelikes that deserves the description ""easy to pick up, hard to master"", as most roguelikes are not even all that easy to pick up. NecroDancer has a tutorial that lasts all of 90 seconds, and contains everything you need to get started. Getting through the first set of levels will take a little more time, but can still be done in an hour or two. But make no mistake, the difficulty ramps up over a total of four zones (each with three levels and a boss level, for a total of 16 levels). And if you think that's the end of it, you're wrong — there's a separate story mode to play through all the zones in sequence rather than separately, and to unlock all the characters (each with their own gimmicks that change the way you play) you have to complete the game multiple times. This is a true roguelike in that the peak difficulty is insane and completing the game with every character is a challenge restricted to only a handful of demigods, but it's also a true roguelike in that it's fair and rewards strategic play and perseverance. And all that to a great beat!I haven't even completed the third zone yet and I can already tell it will be many hours more before I chip my teeth on the really difficult parts, but I felt like I needed to get this review out before the current sale is over, even if my experience is incomplete. This game is almost certainly worth it at full price if you're into roguelikes, but at sale price it's a no-brainer. If it looks like anything you might like, buy it. Even if you can't make your way through it, you'll still get your money's worth for the time you're playing it.			"

												I've played this game for last 4 months of its Early Access. It already looked very promising and awesome. With the release it took me only a few hours of playtime to confirm everything I was ready to write about.This is a rogue-like rhythm dungeon crawler, as you've probably read on the store page. The genre is quite unique - its gameplay is a blend of turn-based combat but it's constrained by the boundaries of the ""beats"" of the music of the level (unlike a lot of rhythm games it's very forgiving on beat accuracy and there's a reason for that: it's quite action-packed, so when you have a few skeletons, fiery dogs and a dragon converging on you - you can't really follow the beats within 20% margin what is usual for rhythm games).First things first: this is a rhythm game and its soundtrack wirtten by Danny Baranowsky is just pure essence of awesomeness. Randomly generated levels are extremely well done. When I say extremely I mean it. This game doesn't have unbeatable generations. It may be easier or harder, but it's a fair rogue-like, if you die - it's your fault. It's not like rogue's tale when you can be killed on first turn the moment you spawn. So you won't really be stomped by something you can't beat.With the release the game has been augmented with some kind of plot which makes it a bit more beautiful than a rogue-like w/o a plot. Also this game even during Early Access didn't have any gamebreaking bugs. In 80h I never had a single crash or anything else that'd ruin my gaming experience, since technically this is kind of a day1 for this game - it's exremely polished, which is a good example what Early Access system should be used for and how.With cutscenes you are being rewarded with when you complete ""zones"" with different characters, with easier and harder characters themselves, with a big variety of items, leaderboards, daily challenges - delivering beatdowns to the beat in this game is guaranteed to be one your best rogue-like experiences ever.

Early Access Review
								SO MUCH FUN.I've spent far too much time in a single night playing this game. It's unfinished right now, still having some placeholder art and more things being added, but the core is there and it's a blast.There are two main components to the game - rhythm and pattern recognition. You'll need both to survive this game. The first is simple, just stay on the beat and you'll be fine. The second is the trickier one and more important one in my opinion. Each enemy has a defined movement and attack pattern, and you need to slip in at the right time and attack when you won't be hurt. Sometimes it's easy, like with slims that only move up and down, or skeletons who raise their hands before attacking.Sometimes, it's trickier. Mushroom people who throw out AoE attacks. Dragons who move every second turn, or bats who I have yet to figure out the pattern for. Of course, if you get bit by a bat, it's likely not such a big deal, but missing the dragon could get you clawed or charred, a one turn death.There's no ""gotcha!"" kills to this roguelike, though plenty of dying to do as things get frantic and you fail to keep up, misjudge the enemy attack pattern, and suddenly find yourself cornered, and you'll do more than a little dying as you learn the patterns of some of the more dangerous enemies.Rarely frustraing, lots of fun, occasionally repetitive due to the single assigned song per level - hopefully this increases. The rest is headed in the exact right direction.			"

Early Access Review
								Over the past several months, I've had the pleasure of testing an alpha of Crypt of the NecroDancer[necrodancer.com], a retro styled rhythm based roguelike.A what?Crypt of the NecroDancer is a procedural dungeon crawler where the player and enemies movie on the beats of the game's music tracks. That may sound like an eclectic mix, but it works. It works really well.You play as Cadence, a firey young woman who, against the better judgement of her elders, descends into the NecoDancer's crypt in search of answers. The intro cinematic shows Cadence prone, her head against a blood smeared rock whilst her narration says, ""I don't know how I survived that fall.""Cadence is resurrected by the NecroDancer, who makes her heart beat to the rhythm of his music. Armed only with what she learned about the undead from her uncle Eli and the equipment she discovers along the way, Cadence must descent farther to find her answers and hopefully free her heart in the process.Inspired in part by Spelunky, developer Ryan Clark has pointed out that they've tried to create something more accessible than typical roguelike, focusing on making the player feel like any deaths are their own fault rather than the game being unforgiving. To help convey this, each enemy has its own behaviours which players can anticipate and respond to after learning their movement patterns. For example, skeletons move on every second beat, whilst ghosts move on every beat, but only when the player is facing away from them. The game's complexity is emergent and comes from the combinations of enemies which make each encounter feel unique and challenging. Each of the game's four zones is populated with its own enemy types, which become more varied as the game progresses.As you play, Cadence comes across many weapons and items, each with their own behaviours that lend themselves towards different styles of gameplay. The properties of each item seems to be something you're expected to learn as you play, discovering that a broadsword will let you hit enemies on any of the three adjacent tiles, or that a karati gi will enable Cadence to move past traps without setting them off.In addition to buying and finding items whilst playing, the game's lobby features a number of shopkeepers from whom items which impact on the game can be brought. Some items will be permanent buffs, such as health increases, whilst others will be more subtle like giving a particular weapon the chance to spawn in a chest within the game. Items from these shopkeepers are purchased with diamonds rather than the gold you buy items with in-game, and provide a way for players to feel a sense of progression as they complete the game's zones.Rather than progressing onto the next zone when completing one, you are returned to the lobby area to find a staircase leading down to the next zone unlocked. In this ""normal"" mode, players are encouraged to explore and master each zone before moving onto Crypt of the NecroDancer's Hardcore and Daily Challenge modes which allow players to forego any items bought from the lobby shoopkeepers and play through the entire game with one life.Beyond Hardcore mode and Daily Challenge mode, the game also offers some additional challenges and characters for varied gameplay.The game ships with an absolutely rocking soundtrack from Danny Baranowsky (Canabalt, Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac and Drifter, amongst others), but also features the ability to load custom tracks.Currently, testers run a utility which generates beat definition files that the game uses to track whether your movements are done in time with the music. A Linux build of the utility isn't yet available, and there's some path/case issues which haven't been resolved yet, but the developers seem to be attentive and I expect these to be resolved soon. Eventually this functionality will be built into the game, but for now, there's a little bit of manual handling.The game also offers game pad and dance mat support (if that's exciting, you can keep an eye out for some NecroDancer themed dance mats[necrodancer.com]) in addition to keybaord controls. I found that I had to configure custom bindings for my Logitech F310 gamepad and a ""Dance UK"" dance mat (which overrides the keyboard bindings), but after doing that, both were usable.Crypt of the NecroDancer feels rich with atmosphere. Small things, like the subtle screen shake when striking a successful blow, or the shopkeeper's voice as he sings along to whatever music is currently playing really show the kind of attention to detail that is going into this game, and I find myself eager to see what each update brings.Crypt of the NecroDancer will be launching on Steam Early Access on July the 30th (which is just over a week away right now).There's no solid release date at this point, but it's expected to be released this year. You can find a few bits and pieces on the Brace Yourself Games dev blog[blog.braceyourselfgames.com] (recently, they've been showing off some enemy art) and Ryan is quite active on the Brace Yourself Games forum[braceyourselfgames.com].I've been streaming the game a couple of times a week on HitBox[www.hitbox.tv]. People are welcome to subscribe and watch the game in action when I play.			"

Crypt of the NecrodancerDeveloper: Brace Yourself GamesPublisher: Brace Yourself Games, Klei Entertainment	Introduction==========Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rhythm rogue-like dungeon crawler. You navigate your character through randomly generated dungeons divided into zones, while avoiding traps, defeating enemies, and collecting treasure, weapons, and armor. The game encourages you to move to the beat of the tracks played in each zone, offering you a coin multiplayer as long as you stick to moving with the beat. The longer you stay in rhythm with the beat, the higher your multiplayer goes. The multiplier affects how many coins you earn from defeating enemies, as well as providing boosts to some of the items you find. So it's really in your best interests to try and keep a good rhythm going as you explore!Gameplay==========As said above, you move your character in-time with the beat of the song being played on each floor. The starter character, Cadence, has the perk of having an assistive tool at the bottom of the screen, which helps you to time your button presses with the beat. The game is divided into 4 zones, each consisting of a few floors and a boss floor. Each floor has a different tune playing, which in turn has a different beat that allows you to move at a certain pace. Some floors have a slower beat, some have a faster beat. Also important to note are how monsters move with the beat. Certain monster types have specific patterns, and learning these patterns will help you greatly in navigating the dungeon safely. Some move every beat, some move every other beat. If you happen to move onto a square at the same time as a monster, you take damage, which further emphasizes how important it is to learn monster movements.You are also able to utilize several tools, including a shovel, bombs, and various charms that have different effects. Also scattered about are shrines, which offer several different effects depending on it's type. Some are positive effects, while others are negative. Smart use of every tool at your disposal is crucial to survival. One tool I really like to utilize are bombs, as they have several exploratory and combat uses. The shovel is used to dig through walls, which can lead to lots of hidden rooms with secret items! Some walls cannot be dug if your shovel isn't good enough, and there are several tiers of shovels, as well as weapons and armor. Gold, Blood, Titanium, and Obsidian are a few examples, each providing different modifiers for the items. The game also features a level editor, with which you can create and upload your own dungeons to the Steam Workshop for others to play and enjoy. The only downside is that you need to clear Zone 4 with a character to unlock it initially. It's also a bit odd in that it's very difficult to use until you learn how to navigate the menus and how to place items. Despite this, it's a powerful tool that works. One thing I'd like for them to add in the level editor is the ability to have specific enemies drop specific items when defeated...such as keys!Graphics==========Boasting a pixel art style, everything is surprisingly detailed. The sprites are amazingly rich and colorful, and often times you are able to tell where monsters will move and what they are about to do, as well as spot secrets hidden in the walls...like the glinting tip of a diamond in a stone pillar! Such small details are what make this game great. Armor also shows up on your character, so it's easy to tell what they are wearing. Some weapons have battle animations, such as the whips, but most you don't actually see the weapon. Instead, you see a sort of ""slash"" animation depending on the weapon type. Needless to say, these are minor graphical grievances that are more than made up for by the rest of the game's details. Traps are easy to spot, and items laying around are easily identified as well.Sound and Music==========The music of this game is where the game shines. Catchy tunes accompany every zone and floor, offering a variety of beats and toe-tapping goodness. Danny Baranowsky is the one responsible for most of the songs in the game, and he has done a fantastic job in really giving this game life. Sound effects are basic and they work, signalling damage, movement, and enemy presence. There really isn't much to say here, other than the soundtarck is amazing. You can check it out or buy it here[dbsoundworks.bandcamp.com]. It's 100% worth a listen, and even a buy if you like it! There is even an extended soundtrack available for you to further customize each zone. The game also allows you to use your own MP3's in-game for endless fun.Performance==========This isn't really a very-demanding game, so most people should have no issues running it. If you have any doubts, make sure to check the minimum and recommended specs for the game on the Store Page. During my playtime I did not run into any bugs or glitches. I expected to run into at least 1 bug during my several playthroughs, but surprisingly not a single one appeared. Bravo! There are options for several resolutions, as well as Windowed and Fullscreen modes.Final Thoughts==========Crypt of the Necrodancer is a worthy additional to the library of anyone who is a fan of rogue-likes, music-based games, dungeons crawlers, or people who just love fun unique games. There hasn't been a game like this before, so it's worth diving into if you are looking for a new experience. Gameplay Demo==========

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelike rhythm game, developed by Brace Yourself Games. Releasing in April 2015 on Steam and then later released on PS4 and Vita in February 2016. NecroDancer is a really unique gaming experience. Every action you take must be in line with the beat of the soundtrack. This includes moving and attacking the enemies. The reward for hitting the beat each time is getting a higher coin multiplier, failing to hit the beat resets your multiplier. Not hitting the beat does not deal any damage to your character, it is just a pain as sometimes your multiplier can often be the thing between successfully completing a level and not. There are a handful of different enemies in the game, which you can learn their pattern of movements if you pay close attention. They all have a predefined path which you should learn to do damage to them or avoid them completely. Throughout the dungeons, you will find loot; these can be weapons, armour, and useable items such as bombs or potions. The coins you earn can also be used in the dungeon’s shops to let you purchase upgrades on the fly.  The game also has a central hub; this is where you can purchase upgrades that will stay active throughout your play through, such as unlocking an extra chest to spawn on each level for example. One of the ways in which the game forces you to keep moving, is the hidden time limit on each level. Once the song ends you will be forced to move onto the next zone, which may result in you missing out on the reward of more coins or upgrades. I think this is a nice addition as it stops people from using a slow and methodical method and force you to keep up with the tempo and beat of the song. Graphically, NecroDancer uses the 8bit pixel theme very well. It looks really pretty and very vibrant with colours the majority of the time. The UI is clean and clear with all of the relevant information, especially the Heartbeat sensor at the bottom, which after an hour or two, you won’t need to pay any attention to as you will be so in tune with the soundtracks that you can move on your own. Of course a game that revolves around rhythm needs a half decent soundtrack, NecroDancer certainly delivers there thankfully. With some original music composed by Danny Baranowsky.As with most roguelike games, the more you play the easier they get. Since NecroDancer requires more skill than anything else, this is more so the case than ever before. Once you get the beat down, you can conquer pretty much anything the game throws at you. Throw in a few permanent upgrades and you really won’t have any problems. The game has a handful of really unique boss fights too. The end one is probably the most memorable of them all though as it adds some very unique game play mechanics in which I thoroughly enjoyed. All of the levels and stages across the game are randomly generated, so you will never run into the same dungeon layout twice. This of course adds to the replay ability of the game already; but NecroDancer doesn’t stop there. In the main game hub, you will also have access to a daily challenge, in which every player who plays the challenge will face the same map, and your aim is to get the best score possible at the end. This definitely makes the game have plenty of longevity and gives you a reason to load the game up every few days to take part in this daily event even after finishing the story mode.  The main story took me seven hours to complete which I think is a decent amount of time; where you will get the most content is from re-running the stages unlocking new characters, playing the daily challenges and working your way up the leader boards. I really wanted to play the game using a controller, but I couldn’t get my 360 pad to work sadly. Whilst the keyboard controls are fine, I feel the controller would have been that little bit better to use. Everything else works as intended in the game. A neat little feature is that you can import your own music collection to the game too, having you match the beat of your favourite tunes! Crypt of the NecroDancer is an absolute god send a roguelike game. The originality of the gameplay is something which every other developer should take note of. The gorgeous pixel graphics art style is really well done too. This game just screams of character and pure fun. I cannot recommend this game enough for roguelike fans, and fans of the indie scene. I urge everyone to pick this game up for the low price of £10,99. It will not disappoint.

												Keep in mind that I've been dreaming of a proper top-down rhythm game for years. Quite a lot of what I have to say is based on the fact that I think with a bit of work this game could have potentially been my favorite game of all time.It's excellent concept, straight-to-the-point presentation, great use of color, more than functional randomization, a very nice shrine mechanic, the ability to dig through walls, fully functional and easy to to understand beat counter, some interesting boss fights, speed/scorerun support and a huge number of different ways to play the game all do a very good job of distracting the player from realizing that the core rhythm/roguelike concept is actually used in quite a uniform and unimaginative way.The way the game works is that you have a beat counter that multiplies your gold the more you move and attack in accordance with the beat. This is a really interesting mechanic and doesn't require any outside knowledge or athleticism to get good with (like some dancepad games do) but it's actual implementation leaves me thinking it was not realized properly. First off, the only punishment that you get for missing a beat with Cadence (the standard character) is that you cannot move for about a half-second and you lose your gold multiplier. This is ok, I suppose (certainly instant death on missed beat would be far too cruel, though there's a character for exactly that purpose) but it doesn't really hinder you in anyway. The most blatant example of how little the beat mechanic matters are the Blademaster enemies in Zone 4, which parry your attacks on reaction and then lunge forward,  then becoming vulnerable. If you are constantly moving along with the beat these ""range-proof"" enemies can group up with time and become a real nuisance, but if you stand still killing them is almost effortless. You can bait out their parry, step backward, and then strike immediately to kill them.  Of course, you can do this along with the beat if your footing is good enough, but doing it without beat sync completely removes any risk in this case.The amount of enemies and gold in Zone 4 is excessive, to say the least, so even if you were to walk around with a gold multiplier of 1.0 you would have more than enough gold for the shops.Second, absolutely none of the levels seem to have been designed with the rhythm mechanic in mind, behind the simple concept of allowing the player to dig through walls if they get trapped behind a wall. All four zones are fairly entertaining, but really, none of them would be out of place in a pure roguelike. The source of difficulty in all four zones comes not from keeping the beat or engaging a ""dance routine"" with specific enemy, but something totally irrelevant to rhythm. Zone 1 is difficult because the areas are cramped, Zone 2 is difficult because the areas are too wide open and the enemies are nimble, Zone 3 is difficult because of the ice/fire hazards, Zone 4 is difficult because it forces the player to edge along walls which are full of traps. Zone 4 is the only zone where I would actually say the player is free to engage in rythmic pattern without beng forced to go along a very distinct path, which is overshadowed by the zone's overwhelming number of brutal enemies and traps.Lastly--and this is runnng FAR against the grain here, I have not found a single person besides me that has this opinion: the music isn't actually that good. As far as it's intended purpose goes, anyway. Surpisingly, few of the tracks are particularly fast or even energetic. This leads to a lot of levels where, if you even care about the beat at all, you are stuck moving at a clumsy and slow rate. There is only one track in the game that has players move more than once per beat, and only one track in the game which has rests--both of which are the same track, King Konga. King Konga is by far the best boss in the game because he is not only the only boss which has irregular rhythm elements, but the only boss where your accordance with the rhythm actually matters. Death Metal has one of the fastest tracks in the game but it ends up being practically meaningless because the boss is so easy you could beat him without stepping in time even once.All in all this is quite a fun game but not really the ultimate rhythm/action hybrid I've been waiting for. Ironically the people I would reccomend this game most to are people that have don't have much interest in roguelikes or rhythm games, but like the ""idea"" of both. If there's some sort of update to the degree of randomization I think the game would be a tremendous platform for fangames--without actually touching the level editor, I actually think I could make levels far more interesting than some of the less fortunate randomizations I've seen. Some sort of compilation of levels made by hundreds of modders would be excellent.			"

								As a fan of both rhythm games and dungeon crawlers, I find Crypt of the NecroDancer as quite the diamond in the rough.  The rhythm component adds a dimension of gameplay that I find captivating.  It helps that the soundtrack rocks even if it is a bit synth-ey.Pros:* Replayability.  LOTS of replayability.* Challenge.  You MUST be able to think and plan quickly.* Soundtrack.  It rocks on its own, but the ability to use your own MP3s is brilliant.* Local co-op.  Player 1 uses the arrow keys, player 2 uses WASD. (I look forward to trying this mode.)Cons:* Challenge.  This game gets difficult quickly and can easily frustrate.* Graphics.  The graphics are pixel art.  Very well made pixel art, but it is a deterrent for some.			"

								I absolutely love this game: from the way the skeletons dance to the singing shopkeeper and amazing soundtrack! I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. I was hooked on this from the first moment I saw it, and 120+ hours later I'm still playing. If the rhythm aspect of it worries you, don't worry - the way the game is set up, the beat detection is forgiving and there is even a mode where rhythm is *not* a factor. This game is, as someone put it, ""easy to pick up but difficult to master."" You can learn how the game works fairly quickly, it takes a bit of time to get through all the Zones normally and unlock the items - but wait, there's more!! - there is a Daily Challenge, speedrun mode, Hardcore mode (requiring you to play through all levels with no upgrades and get to the last level without dying), and other challenge modes (Aria: 1 hit or miss a beat and you die; Bolt: everything is 2x speed). There is a huge amount of replay value, as the dungeon maps in this are randomly-generated and there is a wide variety of items (weapons, equipment, items, etc.) with a variety of effects. It's a different playthrough every single time. If that wasn't enough, you can even put your own MP3s into the game and play by just about any track you want, as long as it has a beat. I can't say enough good things about this game; if you are thinking about picking it up, you will not regret it! :)			"

												I'm so excited to finally be able to review this game post-launch!I pre-ordered Crypt of the NecroDancer back in 2013 when they started allowing people to do so, and I've been playing the alpha since it became available in April of 2014.It's a rhythm-based roguelike with some small measure of cross-play achievements (you unlock things as you progress in the game for future playthroughs in other modes), and while all items start identified (i.e., you always know what a scroll or weapon is, unlike a 'true' roguelike), their placements and whether or not they even show up is randomized.The dungeon randomization is great, and you can specify specific seeds if you want to share levels with other players or work on one specific layout, but where the game really shines -- and its purpose, really -- is the music.You can only move, attack, use items, cast spells, and anything else *on the beat*. Monsters also move on the beat, and they move in routinely predictable patterns so that over time you learn how to anticipate them and counter them, and in fact some monsters require you to learn these patterns and match the beat in order to even damage them. The skill cap is pretty high, the amount of replayability is immense (there are 9 playable characters and a 10th 'challenge' character, all of whom greatly alter the gameplay in different and interesting ways), and there's even a 'beatless' character that allows you to play the game like a traditional roguelike (monsters move when you do, and you're not forced to stick to the rhythm). And if you want a real challenge, you can even play on a dancepad...As someone who has been playing roguelikes ever since actually growing up playing Rogue, and who used to religiously follow rec.games.roguelike, I am so delighted to see an injection of 'newness' into the genre like NecroDancer. It's sorely needed, and while I doubt we'll ever see it emulated, I hope it inspires another developer to merge *their* love of two genres into something as incredibly engaging, challenging, and outright *fun* as this. I am so happy for Brace Yourself Games, and I'm so incredibly excited that this game has finally surfaced for others to experience and play. It's VERY good.			"

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelite game based on the ""bump to kill"" mechanic. Games based on it (e.g. Desktop Dungeons) are usually turn-based, focusing on the strategy and effective enemy killing. But necrodancing is different, everything is done in microturns - All actions (both yours and enemies's) have to be correlating with the soundtrack's rhythm. Each beat is a single action for every character.That makes the game pretty hard, especially in later levels - but it's definitely a pro for the game since I'm talking about roguelite game. This genre only deserves hard but fair difficulty. You have to deal with the press that requires you to feel the rhythm and remember specific dances of your enemies; you need to train proper dodges for each enemy and keep yourself concentrated (and if you don't, you'll can consider yourself dead in less than a minute).As I already mentioned, all attacking is done just by moving to enemy's place in the grid (to ""bump"" them). If you do that at the beat the enemy's ready to fight, you lose your health instead and you have to quickly reconsider your (necro)dancing. There are many pickups through all levels, you can find both melee or ranged weapons, spells, armor pieces, or other passive and consumable items. There're also two resources: Gold, used to buy items for your current run, and diamonds, which are used to unlock more items for your runs (in the game's menu). You might be scared about the controls for dancing, but they actually couldn't be more simple. All you need is arrow keys (or a dance pad), since you can only move in basic four directions on a grid. All spell casts and item uses are done by combinations of those keys, e.g. arrow up + arrow right to cast a fire spell.All levels have procedurally generated groups of enemies and rooms, that's nothing unique for roguelites, but I am really happy for secrets in Crypt of the NecroDancer. In most roguelite games I've played, secrets were mostly placed somewhere in level's corners but this game does something completely different - secrets are always somewhere near the level's center, that means you don't have to explore borders in each level to get an advantage. On the other hand, secrets can have many deadly enemies and traps, you have to be wary. Also, you can dig through all walls in every level (besides the border blocks), making your own way through the level!Talking about graphics, there's nothing to criticize. I love the precise pixelart design with sweet animation the game has! Since it's all about dancing, seeing every NPC to dance with the rhythm is truly satisfying. Soundtrack is amazingly well made, each level has its own song that has even more variations: There is a shopkeeper in every level, and when you'll be near him, you'll hear him sing to the current song. Also, there's a level that perfectly uses genre variations for a song - in hot parts full of lava you'll hear heavy metal, and in icy parts you'll hear electronic version of the same song. In the later levels (zone 4) the soundtrack isn't that good (for being more on the hard electronic genre, so it may be just my personal issue) and it's hard to move with the rhythm of the song properly. Considering everything about the game, I think it's rather another feature to bring the difficulty even higher near the end of the game.Conclusion:Crypt of the NecroDancer comes with an unique idea for a roguelike game; to change casual turn-based strategy into rhythm driven game. This change may seem small, but it makes the game distinct, harder and much more entertaining! The game also have a lot of replayability for all achievements (which are hard to unlock), so don't expect getting just few hours of gameplay from it if you want to get everything. Add great pixelart graphics and perfect soundtrack (mandatory for a rhythm game) and there's nothing to stop me from recommending it to you. It's great! Now let me go ""necrodance"" a bit more, I haven't got enough yet.			"

								Crypt is a dungeon crawler, but with a twist. That twist being moving to the beat of awesome electronic music by the amazing Danny Brananowsky (Who also worked on Binding of Issac's and Super Meat Boy's music, so have high expectations.)...No literally, you MOVE to the beat. So do the monsters. That's what I like about this game, you got to keep with the rhythm of the game while you're simultaniously exploring the cave and seeing what you can get. It's two genres I couldn't think be combined, but it works beautifully. You have entities like health, and item slots for armor and weapon and magic, etc. However, the whole gameplay is composed of moving around to the soundtrack. It's exciting keeping your mind on two things at once, and mastering it in the end. Enemies all have their own movement patterns according to the music, so you're not the only one that has to deal with the beat. I must admit it's very exhilirating to learn every little bit of enemy movement, and gracefully going through the dungeon with the head bopping tunes in your head.However, if you wanna add your own music to the mix, you can! Any MP3 file you have can be implimented in the game. Experiment, and see what you get.Overall, this game is tons of fun, and is looking to be one of my favorite indie games out there. I'm not even that big a fan of dungeon crawlers, but I'm a sucker for rhythm games. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a good, repetitive time.			"

Keep moving in sync with the music, employing a slew of really varied and clever items - all sorts of swords, armors, bombs and accessories, not to mention powerful spells.

								I've been holding off on getting this game, because of the Early Access issues.But it was on my wishlist and a friend gifted it to me.I'm very glad they did!  I've sunk... just over 7 hours into it the last couple of days.  I'm not great at rhythm, but it is very forgiving (don't spam directions and you will be fine).All you need is the arrow keys, I don't think I've used anything else (well, WASD for multiplayer).the music is great, the sprites are cute and easy to differentiate.  Each enemy has a different pattern you have to learn.  RNG dungeons, with Rogue-like difficulty.  You find/buy different hardware in the dungeons, but those reset; note there are some permabuffs you can buy outside of the dungeon with gems.  No microtransaction busslhit though, those are all bought with stuff found in-game.Multiple characters to use with different attributes (one you don't need to have a beat to use), daily challenge, hardcore run mode... lots of stuff to do.  I keep replaying the first three dungeon types (because I can't beat the third one, derp!).Anyways... yes.  This game is in a good state, most other devs would have officially released it by now.

And if you have no taste in great music, simply use your own stuff.The game is easy to learn but freaking hard to master, using only 4 keys.

Early Access Review
								Originally posted on KaboomShark. I was almost instantly intrigued by Crypt of the NecroDancer. It’s a roguelike that’s played to the rhythm of whatever song is currently playing in the level. Being a fan of dungeon crawlers in general, this rather ingenious spin on the genre got me interested. On the bottom of the screen is a heart with animated bars getting closer and closer. It’s like a simpler Guitar Hero; jump to the beat of the heart to keep your coin multiplier from depleting. If you’re attacked, you’ll lost the multiplier. Aside from things trying to kill you, traps in the environment will also try to ruin this multiplier. If you fall in a puddle your multiplier will be lost. Spike traps will injure you, trapdoors will send you to different areas in the level, sometimes surrounded by monsters, other times you are greeted by a singing merchant who will sell you armor, food to heal, weapons, anything useful. You’ll earn money by killing monsters such as skeletons, bats, ghosts, even monkeys.You start every playthrough with a dagger, shovel, and a bomb. Chests will drop larger blades, crossbows, armor, and more items once you’ve unlocked them with diamonds. Diamonds are scattered throughout the map, sometimes hidden in walls that can be dug up using a shovel. Items found in chests can also be purchased from the aforementioned singing merchant.Levels are divided into four zones. At the end of every zone, there will be a mini-boss (often a dragon) that needs to be killed in order for the stairs to the next level to unlock. However, if you wait around in a level for too long, the song that’s playing will end and you’ll be dropped to the next level. This is similar to the ghost that is sent after you in Spelunky when you’ve spent a long time in one level. Or like the music that’s used to cut actors off during their acceptance speeches when they’re boring. Whatever floats your boat. I mean, the game allows you to use your own MP3 files, so you could totally kill monsters to the Oscars’ “get off the stage” music.Characters can sometimes be found locked in cages. If you haven’t found the key in a chest prior, there’s a good chance the merchant will have one on sale. Once these characters are unlocked, a new room will unlock in the lobby. These rooms contain practice courses and shops. You can use the diamonds you collected in your last playthrough to purchase upgrades and new items that will show up in chests. Also in the lobby is where you’ll find the entrances to zones, different game modes like Hardcore or an easier mode with fewer enemies, local co-op, character select, and more. Unlockable characters carry different abilities, such as Bard, who can move freely and not to the rhythm of a song. He’s a great character to use to take a break from the rhythm-based combat of Cadence, the story’s frontliner. Though there isn’t much of a story; it’s all set up in the opening cutscene, featuring Cadence falling into a dungeon and being taken over by the NecroDancer. Which would explain why she’s tasked to move to the beat of a song.The VerdictThere isn’t much I could dislike about this game. I would totally understand your feelings if you dislike dungeon crawlers; it’s a love it or hate it situation. Crypt of the NecroDancer is available now for $14.99 on Steam. It can be played with a controller, keyboard, and even a DDR pad. If you dislike the genre, it’s likely you’ll dislike this rhythmic take on it. If you’re like me and enjoy roguelikes that put your persistence to the test, chances are you’ll enjoy it, maybe even love it. Hell I’m already addicted.			"

								Every move is on the beat, every move is a tiny puzzle!  You gotta know each enemy's pattern, know where they will move next beat, and make lighting quick decisions in order to survive.  This game gets bonus points for solving the traditional turn-based roguelike conundrum of how to implement local multiplayer.  Co-op FTW!So many game modes, but I play this game everyday for the procedurally generated daily challenges.  So addictive!			"

								In life, there are a few times when an experience is so powerful that it fills us with an overwhelming sense of sorrow to imagine all of the people who, through no fault of their own, just by being born in the wrong era, or in the wrong place, or to the wrong parents, will never have the privilege of being part of that experience. I have felt this way a handful of times in my life, and about half of those times were while playing Crypt of the Necrodancer.			"

Early Access Review
								Crypt of the NecroDancer is the most unique and replayable rogue-like I've ever played. For years, people have been mixing rogue-like with many different genres. 2D platformers, Real-time strategy, dungeon-crawling, there's been all kinds of hybrids. But this mixture really blows the rest away. A rogue-like, with rhythm? At first, it might sound ridiculous. It might sound like it would never work. But, Brace Yourself Games made it work. And boy, did they make it work. Think of Crypt as a Mystery Dungeon game. A turn-based over the head dungeon crawler. That is basically what it is. The turns are every beat in the music, and both you and the enemies move each beat. The soundtrack was specifically made to have an easy to keep beat, and the visuals at the bottom of the screen guide you as well. If you've had any kind of experience with rhythm, from playing Osu on insane to tapping your foot to your favorite song, you should have no problem easing yourself in. Don't let that make you think the game is easy, though. The rhythm is just the tip of the iceberg. Learning how the enemies move and attack is what really makes this game lovingly abuse you like other rogue-likes.So, I'm sure there's a couple of people reading this who just can't keep a beat. Hey, I'm not judging. I'm sure you have your reasons. But, if that is the case, good news! There is a character unlocked from the beginning that doesn't use the rhythm mechanic. Everything just moves when you do, and you can experience everything the game has to offer with that character. So, really, if you're a fan of the rogue-like genre, there is no reason not to give this game a try.+ Nicely done pixel art, characters are colorful and easy to identify+ Tons of unique items and enemies that keep every run fresh+ There's a boss that's literally a chess board+ Rhythm is a simple and fun mechanic, not an annoying gimmick+ Special character unlocked from the start for those who can't keep a beat+ Very active devs, big updates come out every few weeks+++ An amazing soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky, composer for Super Meat Boy and the original Binding of Isaac+ Add in your own MP3s if you're a weirdo who doesn't like the soundtrack+/- Simple, four button controls. Activating items usually means pressing two buttons at once, which can be a bit weird sometimes. These controls can be changed in the options, however.- Bit of a high learning curve. Playing individual zones with upgrades is far easier than playing through the entire game starting with only three hearts and a dagger.- Still in early access. You'll probably find some minor bugs, (nothing gamebreaking) some items/characters are still being added, and the final level is yet to be released.Overall, Crypt of the NecroDancer in an amazing game and I recommend that you buy it. Yeah, yeah, it's in Early Access, but the game is already enjoyable. I mean, just look at my play time. If Early Access really bothers you THAT much, then just wait. They're planning on getting the game out sometime in the next few months.			"

IntroductionThe Crypt of the NecroDancer is a very unique addition to the genre of rogue-like games. Never before a game like this has been seen in the gaming industry which combines the elements of a dungeon crawler and rhythm-based gameplay that is produced with such quality and immersiveness.GameplayIn this game, you are forced to move to the beat of the soundtracks (except for one character) where the tempo of each beat is shown by the meter on the bottom part of the screen and will vary depending on the track being played. Violating this rule will reduce your multiplier to the lowest set value (though the permanent upgrade addition will still persist), and is also the same if you were to take damage. Players are able to build this up by landing successful hits to an enemy and is kept level by staying on the beat.After every session on any mode (either by clearing the zone or by dying), the items and coins you gained will be removed and reset back to your default equipment except for ""diamonds"", which is used for certain upgrades/locks/unlocks to various NPCs in the game lobby.  The game modes are basically divided into two, separate zones and all-zones mode. The only difference with either mode is that the upgrades that you have bought are only present on separate zones and that the player is required to play through zone 1 to 4 on all-zones mode for it to be cleared.The Pros
Excellent Audio - As a rhythm game, the audio should be flawless and on-spot to the theme as it is the genre's main attribute, and this is a perfect example to it. The soundtracks may vary depending on the stage the player is in or by the character they are using (which are remixed tracks of the original version, for example, playing as Aria will play the metal version of the tracks).Large Array of Playable Characters and Game Modes - This standard element of every session-based game is also present, in which it gives longevity and versatility to the game play. These new characters can be unlocked by clearing zones, and each and everyone of them have their own perks as well as rules and restrictions (aside from the default unlocked characters) to follow. Violating these rules will result in immediate death if you don't have an item that could save you.   High Replay Value - A sign of a great game is that it will always have you longing for another round even if you failed miserably or even rage-quitted. May it be from the satisfaction of clearing a difficult zone or unlocking achievements or revisiting your favorite tracks, a game with a high replay value makes the money you spent on it worthwhile.Steam Integration - From the very helpful Steam Cloud feature up to the Steamworks' additional mods that you can add, this is great for those people who wants to spice the game up more and modify it to match their taste.The Cons
Repetitive Audio - Given the nature of rogue-likes, you will die and restart the levels more than you would like to and this means that you will be forced the hear the soundtracks of each floor again and again. Supposedly, this is only minus if the soundtracks of the game are bad (which is not the case in here), but still I would like to cover all bases for those who are interested in buying the game.Immense Difficulty Levels - By no means that this is a BAD thing, BUT if you are a casual player who enjoys more of a relaxing game play or just aren't good at playing the game or has bad body coordination, then this game MIGHT not be for you (though it doesn't mean that you shouldn't give it a try). Honestly, I am bad at this game that I could only clear levels with Bard (which is easy-mode) and barely with the other characters.Final ThoughtsThis game is the fruit of undeniable passion and love of the developers, and indeed is a masterpiece of its own genre to be said at the very least. Also, if you are a fan of games with great soundtracks, you won't make a mistake buying this!

								I'll likely update this review as I go, but I want to post my first thoughts about the game: AWESOME!It's done right in every way that you can think about mixing a rhythm and rogue-like game. Using your own songs adds a lot to the already great gameplay. It's not easy, but you learn about enemy patterns pretty quickly and unlocking more loot makes it much easier. Already a really interesting and fun to play game and it's still in alpha.Fully recommended to support it by buying it now :)			"

The good+Amazing gameplay concept: a real-time combat dungeon crawler ruled by music beats+Superb soundtrack. Danny Baranowsky produces yet another gem - you might find yourself head bobbing +Great artistic direction - all monsters are easily identifiable, readable, and just plain nice to look at. Bosses' designs are musical themed, which is a nice touch+Numerous playable characters with diferent playstyles. Several of the unlockables play quite differently from the main character, which adds to both gameplay variety and replay value+Superbly balanced difficulty. It's entirely possible to play the game without picking any items nor taking damage, and the game does not feel draggy while at it there's even a character built around these characteristics. +Practice modes, and beginner help. These are small details but they are quite handy and they make the game better+Really cheap considering it's replay valueThe bad-The game itself feels lighthearted and fun, while in contrast the cutscenes try to add a dramatic storyline. They seem like an afterthought (you can disable them - that's a +!)-Some inconsistencies at the highest difficultiesThe bottom lineA finely crafted rhythm-based dungeon crawler with great soundtrack, uncommon gameplay and good challenge and replay value			"

												This is the most impressive rogue-like I have ever played.  CoND beautifully integrates tile based combat with music.  Each turn lasts for a beat of the current level's song, leading to fun, fast paced action.  Even during early access it felt like a complete game, and the full release is a masterpiece.The controls are easy and straighforward, requiring only the arrow keys to play.  The graphics are simple but well made.  The music is great.  The soundtrack was composed by Danny B, and each song is edited masterfully into the game.  CoND lets you use your own music for the levels, but I have never done it because I love the core soundtrack so much.  Despite hearing the songs hundreds of times, I never get tired of them.The various weapons and equipment provide a wide variety of play styles and item interactions.  The enemies are well designed, each with varying movement and attack mechanics.  The boss fights are unique and wonderful experiences.  Each one is musically themed, and the varying musical styles reinforces the awesomeness of the game's music.There is a very large amount of content and replayability.  Between items, enemies, and floor layouts, there is a lot of variation between runs.  There are high score and fastest time leaderboards which are very competitive, and people frequently race the game live.  CoND can be very difficult at first because you have to learn each weapon's mechanics and each enemy's attack patterns, but there are many tutorial and training mechanisms built into the game.  Practicing is well worth the time, and mastering the game is very rewarding.I recommend this game to anyone.  It is an absolute must play if you like rogue-likes or music based games.			"

												By far my favorite Early Access title thus far. Crypt of the Necrodancer (CotN) should be given a ton of credit for pitching a title that perfectly melds rouge-lites and rhythm-based gameplay.The main mechanic revolves around moving and attacking to the beat of the music and failing to even miss one beat results in a multiplier reset, which altogether works very well. CotN also deserves points in the style department; enemies dance, the floor lights up when the multiplier is up, and the shopkeeper sings along during the high points of the songs. Even though the game retains many rogue-like tropes, it truly separates itself from others with the way it was designed. Music is absolutely stellar (composer of the original Super Meat Boy). Controls are intuitive (you only need the four-directional arrows!).Like in Rogue Legacy, you can unlock equipment after each subsequent run if you have enough crystals (which you can find after each level). The lobby serves as a way to access this content. Here you can also find individual monster training rooms and various other modes like Hardcore or Daily Challenges. For the price, it's definitely worthy of the admission. If you're either a fan of rhythm or rogue-like games, this is without a doubt a must-have.			"

												Arguably the best rhythm game of the decade. This game is incredibly hard, but the difficulty comes from the pace it demands you make decisions, not from complicated mechanics. As a result, it's nearly always your fault when you die, and there's a huge amount of room for you to get better.Once you beat the game, you can replay it with other characters, which have different gameplay styles which requires you to remaster the game with their play style.And, of course, it has great music, which is mandatory for an excellent rhythm game. And it comes in several remixed flavors, which keeps it from getting stale.			"

												There are some games where you think to yourself ""I could have thought of that"" and other games where you think ""Wow, why didn't I think of that?"".  Crypt of the NecroDancer is none of those.  I don't think anyone would have thought to put a rogue-like rpg into a rhythm based game.  But it works, oh does it work so wonderfully well.The first level you will be trying your damndest to get a rhythm going but once you spend enough time you will be slashing up enemies while setting up others for a nicely timed fireball blast from afar.  And all the while it feels so satisfying when you progress.The controls are near flawless as well.  As you die multiple times, over and over and over, you never feel the need to blame the game for being cheap or unresponsive control but instead you know its your fault.  I always felt this was a sign of a great designed game, such as in Rogue Legacy or Super Meat boy.Don't even wait for this game to go on sale, buy it and, hell, buy it for a friend.  It's that good.			"

												Everything about this game is just perfection. Two Genres that would never have worked together, and yet it does, and beautifully at that. For a game like this, the music will play a huge part of the quality of the game, and I think Danny B really outdid himself with this. I just can't stop listening to the soundtrack, and then on top of that, we now have 2 alternative albums to listen to!Gameplay is equally fantastic. Every enemy has their own movements to the beat. And it's down to you to figure out how to beat each enemy. Every Zone has a different set of enemies, and the difficulty increases nicely with each zone. The bosses are some of the most clever and innovative bosses I have ever seen in a game. They fit so well with the game, and they still function in fun and unique ways. I mean one of the bosses is basically an entire chess set! Best part is, every single piece moves just like they do in real chess. This game is definitely a contender to be a GOTY for me. It's addictive, it's fun, and the fact you have the choice to have your own music, the mod support, the variety of characters and the ease of changing soundtracks just shows how much effort and detail these guys have put in to the game. I just can't recommend this enough. Take note all you aspiring devs, this is Early Access done right.			"

												This entire game is just a pure joy to play, over and over and over again.  Even incomplete, the available game is extremely satisfying to go for increasingly flawless runs with the beautiful music and very fair randomization.  Even if you have a ""poor"" run (being a ""roguelike"") it's all dependent on your skill, as there is absolutely no guaranteed damage done to your character - the only time you may get hurt if is you make a wrong move.The enemies are varied enough, the random generation is -usually- never rediculous, the item choices are unique and feel very meaningful and dramatic, you can set your own difficulty with different characters (from the no-rhythm-required Bard to the insanely hardcore Aria that is limited to the starting dagger and half a heart and losing rhythm kills you instantly), your own music can be uploaded and danced to, the pixelated aesthetic is very well-done and doesn't come off as tacky...Worth every dollar, and I even got it on sale.  I'd pay full price for this, easily.  Also, as a warning, the songs are -extremely- infectious and I will find myself humming a random song throughout the day and I often wake up each day with one of the songs running through my head.EDIT:  Just wanted to say the release version of this game is beyond legendary.  The 4th zone absolutely blew my mind, some of the music got noticably polished up, the cutscenes are cool, there's actually a damn transition between levels now, the escape menu got a border... there's a lot of love in this game and I appreciate every ounce of it.

Early Access Review
								My god, this game is great. You would never expect a rhythm-dungeon crawler combo to ever work, but boy does it. I like to put games into two categories: Games with ""Behind the scenes"" devs, who make a great game but stay in the background; and active devs, who update their game frequently, respond to reviews, etc. Necrodancer falls into the second category. The premise of this game is a dungeon crawler roguelike where you move to the beat. All enemies move to the beat of the Danny B. music (who also wrote music for Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac), and learning the enemy patterns (which include moving every beat, or moving up and down every other beat) is vital to your survival. You find items to improve your survivability in shops and chests, with items including rings that add effects or better weapons like longswords. You start with a dagger, which you want to try to replace as fast as possible, because it sucks for combat. All weapons also come in better qualities, like blood, which heals you for a half heart after you kill 10 enemies, or titanium which does 2 damage as opposed to the one damage most weapons do. The game has three bosses, which each come with their own great song and are actually quite challenging. Necrodancer is being updated VERY frequently, and it's really a blast, even in early access.This game has freaking singing shopkeepers. Just buy it. PS: Check out one of the boss songs here "

												There are quite a few things to like about Crypt of the NecroDancer, and there's no question that it is the result of having an interesting crazy idea and running with it - and I love seeing game writers taking risks and doing crazy interesting stuff.But.  This just doesn't work for me.  I'm probably not really the target audience - I have never gotten into the rhythm/dance games at all, and am now probably a bit old and just not generally able to slip into the ""zone"" when playing.Playing the game 'properly', with the beat (not as Bard) is frequently just too chaotic and confusing - particularly when starting out with this constant time pressure (not just the urgency of keeping to the beat, but also knowing there's only a limited amount of time until the song ends and you get forcibly moved on).  I frequently couldn't work out what items were - reading the text was problematic at times, and if I'd picked something up that I didn't already know I found it quite difficult to work out what I had picked up and what to do with it.Playing as Bard (not the default for a Newbie, and I understand why because it doesn't really represent the 'core experience' of the game) sort of solved a lot of this - the time pressure is removed so you can spend as long as you need to look at items and play around with them and learn the enemy behaviour.  But playing as Bard is just dull for the most part.  Removing that core mechanic does drain the game of any particular interest.  I thought it would make sense to play as Bard enough to learn what I needed to learn and then go back in with the beat to enjoy the game, but frankly it just didn't hold enough appeal to do this.The music is great.  The graphics are ok.  The roguelike stuff is ok, although the upgrade system is a bit thin, a bit poorly implemented and a bit ... I don't know, just patchy.  Not enough richness to make it feel worth crawling through the dungeon again and again like a good dungeon crawler does.And there are bugs.  Playing on Windows it just dumped me out of the game every other hour or so.  Not such a big deal, but not great.  And a few possibly deliberate gameplay choices that seem like bugs - the mimics that reveal themselves when you stand next to them, but are still counted as ""fail"" moves to attack until you take a step and get them to move off their square.  It's sitting right there pulsating, I know I need to kill it, but you just fail me for swinging at it?  Minor, but annoying nonetheless.I think there are people who will enjoy this, but it frustrated me too often for too little reward and too little motivation to keep playing.			"

												As strange as overview of this game sounds, it is actually one of the best games in 3 categories: Roguelike, Rhythm Games and games that were in Early Access.Pros:Even with typical roguelike RNG involved, every battle is winnable. It can be walk in the park, or run on a thin edge of a blade, but still, there's always a way to win.Every playthrough is different in terms of enemies you meet, map and items.Most of the items have both good and bad side - what saves you in one situation can lead you to death in another.Soundtrack - if you know Danny, there's nothing else to add, all of his works are brilliant, and this one isn't an exception.Characters - each of them is actually unique, and will totally change the way you play.Rhythm - you don't actually need to always follow it(with SOME secretly secret exception), but following the rhythm is rewarded in many different ways.Cons:Some characters are incredibly hard(think Blue Baby/Lost from BoI:Rebirth), but you knew it wasn't an easy game,right?Learning enemies movesets is necessary for winning, and takes trial and error. Luckily, you can unlock special training grounds that let you kill them until you are sure you mastered all the ways of eliminating them.Overall, the game is fantastic. Strongly recommended for people who are even barely interested in music games or roguelikes.			"

								Dont let the Early Access tag scare you. Game has a great amount of content to keep you occupied right now and with hardcore mode, which you can liken to doing a full run in Spelunky without taking shortcuts, will keep you satiated for a good long time. A few high points that are worth mentioning, you can play with your own music tracks, the controls are fully rebindable, the game is all about skill which makes it very satisfying to pull off combos properly, there is no gear checks or artificial barriers to gameplay. SImply put if you are able to perfectly execute it, you can go through the entire game with the weakest weapon without any problems.			"

								I loved this game! It's really challenging, but not to the point of frustration. The graphics are beautiful with vibrant colors, and the soundtrack is so great that I didn't even wanted to change to my own songs to play (which is one of the features of the game).It can be a little bit unfair sometimes, though. There were times where I would appear in a level already surrounded by enemies with no room to fight them. Maybe it's common in rogue-like games, I'm not really used to the genre, but I think maybe there would be some more room since defeating enemies depend on the space you have to make the moves. Is not something that disturbs the game experience, though, and it gave me some more hours trying to finish the dungeons.I really recommend it!			"

In fact, even a rouge-like lover might not like this due to it's vastly different playstyle.The biggest turnoff that could ruin one's enjoyment is that the game is largely trial and error. There is almost zero chance of recovering from a mistake in a boss fight and this will end your run. While common in rougelikes, the bosses in this game are unforgiving. Any new enemy you encounter is and will (probably) kill you. It is nigh impossible to complete the game without knowing how to deal with them.Fortunately, there is a practice dungeon that allows you to figure out how to deal with these obstacles. That said, (your experience) how frustrating this game gets depend whether or not you choose and have the patience to use this feature.Spend an hour or two practising against all mini-boss/bosses should you get this game. There are other minor qualms about the game but overall, it was a great experience and the design of certain enemies are ingenious.Note: There is a character (Bard) that would make the game much easier due to the removal of time pressure imposed by the rhythms and changes the game into a turn-based strategic one but the point above stands firm. Because this removes a core element of the game (the rhythimic pressure), it becomes just another rouge adventure and you will not be playing the same game that is advertised.The game itself is fairly short and is broken into four (4x4) zones and there is a notable difficulty spike in the latter zones. The approach to beating each level is vastly different. The upside? You are allowed to skip zones after beating them once.Zone 1 and 2 allows you to take things slow. -Kiting-Zone 3 forces you to manage and balance the different skill sets the enemies have and take the pre-emptive strike before you are swarmed. (Bad RNG can happen in this zone so be prepared for frustration.)Zone 4 requires fast planning and twitchy reflexes.-------------TL:DR-------------Shuffle and boogie to da beat like your bootie in da heat dancing cha-cha  in the crypt. And here we go! Forward backward rock-step, side together side rock-step~ ConclusionGreat game, not for everyone. If you have twitchy reflexes, patience practising, like strategy (more so chess as opposed to RTS) and rouge-like games, this is the game for you!Otherwise, grab the game on sale for a taste of this unique masochistic hybrid.

								Awesome rhythm based game with colorful levels and enemies with its own challenges and obstacles. Been playing and loving this game since the pre-order alpha release back in late April and the love is still going strong as new content is being added. Hope to play to the rhythm of my playlists in this game soon.Expect to die quite a bit/a lot because the dance moves of the enemies are just so... enchanting~ (haha!) Just beware of glass.Also the people of Brace Yourself Games are all very swell people. So that's always a plus for me. xD			"

								Do not be fooled or alarmed by the Early-Access tag. This game is worth getting as it is. The developers dish out updates constantly, even if it's just a little bug fix.Crypt of the NecroDancer combines Rogue-Like Elements with Rythm-Based gameplay to make up for one hell of a game. It's an 'easy to learn, hard to master' type of game that promises many hours of entertainment. The game consists as of this moment of 3 Zones (with 3 floors or levels each), a Hardcore Mode (in which you have to beat all 3 zones in a row), a Level Editor, 5 playable characters (each of which has a different trait!) and even a Steam-Workshop for User-Created content. The music is simply amazing (as expected of Danny B.). And the best part: You can play to your own music!Like in every good Rogue-Like game, every run is randomized, but thanks to the way the game is played, even a hardcore run can be completed with the most basic equipment if you have enough practice. A run usually doesn't take that long, so it's good for a bit of fun in between as much as it is to play the game to death. Just give your brain a moment of rest from time to time.What are you still reading this for?! Get in there and start to deliver some beatdowns to the beat!			"

												Basically, this game is a pretty standard dungeon crawler - you open doors, buy or find items, genociding all on your way to save your father. The only major difference is - you doing it in rhythm.And all the sudden it's not so easy anymore. You need to always move (and keep moving in rhythm, because this time the world won't wait for you to stand and think), which make this a hella lot more dynamic game that any other crawlers. While you move, you need to analyse you opponents to catch them when they can't attack you. And when there are more, than 3 different enemies after your rebellious teenager proantagonist's behinds - thats when your brain thingy is starting to work like it's a math exam.The design is great, the stylistics are creative and really using the theme of music (even if it's leading to the most obnoxious pun-born creatures), and the music...Well, you can't make a game about music without a good music? And Danny Baranowsky definitely did his best here. It's versatile and complements the overall atmosphere of the levels. Yeah, some of the music is more dull than the other (I'm not a big fan of 2 stage, for example), but when it kicks ♥♥♥ - it kicks it really hard. Definitely go check it out, even if you not going to buy the game. You just might find something you like. At least this is how I found out about this game and what caused me to buy it.The only real downside is - there are not that much replayability, at least for me. It has a lot of characters with different playstyles, some of which require as much time to beat the game, as the main campaing itself, but the varity of rougelike elements within the game is not that big. Sooo... be aware? Also the story is kinda cheesy, but it's not the game about telling a good story.And so you have it - it's a fast, engaging and pretty hard game, where you throw out all you dungeon crawlers knowlege and dance around the mecriant, trying to deside, do you want that glass spear or not.

												Solid rhythm game. I was surprised by how difficult it was. There's 10 different playable characters, each with his/her own unique play style, so the replay value is huge. I never even came close to beating the game with the advanced characters like Aria (dies is one hit from enemy + dies with one missed beat) but the satsifaction I got from beating the game with the intermediate characters was huge. Buyer beware, very addicting.			"

								Crypt Of The NecroDancer is my ultimately favorite rogue-like. You have to move to the beat while killing various enemies which can be very hard. If you make one stupid mistake, then you are screwed. The good thing is, ALL the deaths are YOUR fault-I still haven't had any crashes whatsoever. This game is infinitely replayable, with daily challenges and hardcore mode. This game does NOT hold your hand, you will be fighting and fighting for days to complete just zone 1. There is basically no tutorial but to figure out the patterns of the enemies you can unlock the ( I don't remember who he is called ). I rate this game 8/8 because it's great			"

												Wow all I can say is Wow...Crypt of the Necrodancer is one of those gems where you can tell the guys and gals creating this had tons of fun, with original gameplay, an amazing soundtrack ( if you don't like a dance mix, then put in your own MP3's) and bright colourful graphics that give this game flair. This game is not easy, especially in the beginning, but it intergrates rouge-lite mechanics and an upgrade system that never feels overpowered, when a player dies, you know its your own fault the player must learn the patterns to enemies to be able to succeed and cannot rely on items, for those crazy enough there is a hardcore mode in which the player cannot use any of the upgrades they obtained in running through the game. This is one of the finest games i've played all year and will most likely continue to be one of my favourites of rythem based and rouge based			"

Early Access Review
								NecroDancer is an instant classic, and one of few games where Early Access is ABSOLUTELY worth it. The game is addicting and pretty much complete, and the updates keep coming hard and fast, bringing more and more variety and fun to the table.The gameplay feels complete, looks, sounds and feels great and is immediately addicting. Replayability is available aplenty via custom music, roguelike-characteristic difficulty, replays, leaderboards (for gold score and speedrun time, respectively), unlockables and a hardcore mode with optional seeds input.The only missing feature is a zone; there's 3 zones à 3 levels right now, which are plenty to bite your nails out already. Other than that, all that's left to be added are simply optional bonuses; more variety and options, of which there already exist a lot. This is legitimately the only Early Access game I can recommend and say ""get this right now"". The amazing music won't let you go for a while, you'll find yourself doing other stuff to the NecroDancer beat... that's how addictive it is.			"

								Before I say anything else, I'd like to point you towards this 7-minute review of Crypt of the NecroDancer on my channel. It condenses everything you need to know into what I hope is a very concise and informative video, so do give it a quick view if you're thinking of buying the game.

			Crypt of the NecroDancer Website: http://necrodancer.com/ ~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~ Welcome to OddyC's series of 7-minute reviews, where he attempts with all his might to condense everything he knows...		

For those to whom it appeals, rest assured that Crypt of the NecroDancer is something unique, beautiful and hilarious. I've never found such a good substitute for sleep in all my life. It's made me laugh many times since I bought it, and it's more than lived up to my expectations. It's a seriously great game that seems confident in its own abilities and rightly so.Studying and countering the attack patterns of each enemy you encounter is unbelievably rewarding. For most people, you'll start the game throwing yourself into a roomful of monsters and watching with fascination as you get utterly demolished. But the game relies on its own addictive nature to keep you playing, because the more you play, and the more you die, the more you learn how to stay alive for the next time.Rather than just repeating what I say in the video, I urge you to watch it and leave you with these remarks in summary:There is very little in this game that is not a reason to buy it. The gameplay, the variation, the creativity, the music - oh, god, the music - all of it is just astoundingly well-done.The game doesn't feel like it's in Early Access. Aside from the couple of features not yet programmed in, such as the full selection of characters to play as, everything is as polished as you'd hope the finished game would be.Despite dying more times than I care to count, I have yet to feel frustrated with the game. And I can get quite easily frustrated with games that kill me a lot. But with NecroDancer, I'm only ever frustrated with myself, for not quite moving fast enough, or panicking at a crucial moment. In a world of unfair gaming experiences, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a beacon of light that invites to you blame yourself, rather than the game!Yes, the game is challenging. Despite having played it long enough to know the attack patterns of most monsters in the game, the monsters frequently - shockingly often, in fact - get the better of me. It's not just a matter of learning the game. Thanks to the fast-paced rhythm aspect, it's instead a matter of calling upon your knowledge at a moment's notice, and staying calm even at the sight of a minotaur charging towards you, or a red dragon preparing to unleash fiery chaos upon you in the next half a second.The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a game.There is simply nothing to criticise - at least, nothing apart from the most minor issues, such as monsters occasionally getting in each other's ways and forcing each other to remain stationary until you kill them. But that rarely happens, and it's certainly nothing even close to a game-breaking issue - it's just a quirk of the game. And seeing as it's still in Early Access, I'm surprised that's the only one I can think of!Closing remarks: Crypt of the NecroDancer is amazing. One of the most flawless games I've ever played. If it appeals to you then buy it. You will not be disappointed, I guarantee it. "

Early Access Review
[early access - review]As an avid musician and part time gamer, Crypt of the NecroDancer was a ""have to"" buy for me. The idea of incorporating music as the mode for a metronomic gameplay system was intriguing. After finally getting this loaded up, I thought for sure that I had an advantage in this game given that I've honed my own internal metronome for nearly a quarter century and my gaming skills for nearly 3 decades but little did I know that this game puts a whole new meaning into the expression ""beat down."" To elaborate on that further frankly, I got beat down to the down beat.With NecroDancer, it takes more than just timing and gaming experience to survive, as this is a calculated, quick-witted, speed chess match and really is not a game you are going to get far in if you are distracted or not all in to it. The sound track is great and is one of the biggest reasons (for me anyways) to play this game. Being that I am a musician, my rig is setup with an audio controller and studio monitors, so that I can pump out some decibels and at high volumes this game sounds even better! If you don't have a decent sound setup, a good pair of headphones is crucial. The sound track has a wide range musical styles from the trancey-technoish electronic, chillin mellow reggae-ish, flowing hip hop beats, beatnik jazzy swing, to the grinding heavy metal; all of which is synthesized and composed sequencing. This is understandable considering the game play is tempo driven, though from a musicians point of view, some music wasn't meant to be synthesized and even though musically it is written well, the metal doesn't feel right. A minor gripe. Regardless, every style has a lot of energy with a beat that really delivers the tempo when playing. My last gripe, though petty, I think a little more could be done with the sound effects during gameplay to incorporate them into the music a little cleaner, being that attacks and movement must be done on beat. It is still early access, so we'll see.   There are 2 things that bothered me about this game. One I can look past and most people do not mind the uncontemporized 8-bit graphics but I'm hoping there is a little bit more updating to set it aside from the rest (again, early access). My other issue I had was perplexing and that was the controls. After calibrating to compensate for the latencies, I went to the options to personalize my joystick controls. The devs offer a lot of options in this screen, which is nice, but they have controls labeled 'Combo: Up + Down', 'Combo: Left + Right', 'Combo: Up + left', etc... that you assign to a button. What? This was confusing at first. Well, turns out that these are for using items and using some menu functions. It gives the controls an additional method by using both the movement combinations as well as assigning it to a button. This gives a huge advantage for using a keyboard over a joystick. I also found that when using the keyboard, it was much easier to keep the timing, as though it felt more ""instrumenty' than the joystick. My last gripe about the controls is that they are not actually ""full controller supported"" as stated on the store page. Stick 2 on my 360 controller could not be assigned controls during setup. Oh well, I like the keyboard more for this game anyways! The gameplay is simple. Using the directionals, you move and attack on beat. The enemies will too, though they all do not move the same manner or count and as I mentioned earlier, this really makes it more of a speed chess match. If you are in the wrong square, miss a beat, or move incorrectly, it could mean game over. This adds a whole new dimension of difficult and for those of you that cannot keep a beat there are additional modes, like turn based, so even the musically challenged can enjoy this game. There are a lot of power ups and items available, though at the moment doesn't exactly feel ""rouge-like"" just yet but I'm sure that'll change. There are also a multitude of in game mutations that ramp the difficulty level up significantly. Even without them, this game is hard, which should appeal to anyone who likes a challenge in gaming.*Also note: do not expect a huge amount of content out of the box, at this stage in early access there are few levels offered in Crypt of the NecroDancer. At the moment 4 levels consisting of 3 stages and a boss level. (I'll update this review as the developers do... can't get enough of this game) There is also a daily challenge, though I'm not sure why these resources are not allocated to coding, sprites, music, sound, etc... OverviewGameplay: Music Driven Rogue-Like.
Graphics: 8-bit. They are okay but would like to see them a little more contemporized.
Sound: Sound Track is Phenomenal (by gaming standards)! Sound effects are good but again, I'd like to hear them mixed in on tempo with the music, making them one and the same.
Controls: Great with a keyboard. Though, as of now it’s a little disappointing with a controller but still decent. 
Replayability: Yes. The addition of seeding gives this game a ton of potential. 
Overall: 8/10 – Though it is nothing to scoff at, once new features, updates, and fixes are implemented; I'm sure this rating will be much higher in Crypt of the NecroDancer's fully released state. 
The element of music and gameplay make this a great game and one that I truly enjoy. I recommend this to everyone and is a must buy for anyone who likes musically driven games.			"

												This game is exactly what it says it is, a mash between the roguelike genre and rhythm games. But it is more than that. The first guideline is fairness : It is one of the only fair roguelikes. When you die, you will be able to watch the replay of your last few moves so you can understand what killed you and why. I have played this game for almost 100 hours, and never have I felt like my death was unfair. It was always my own fault, so I couldn't blame the game for anything. And that takes the frustration out of the experience. The second one is mastery : while you will have to learn a few patterns and item effects, they are pretty straightforward, and the game has a training room where you can learn at your own pace everything you want to learn. But the real difficulty comes in when you have to adapt to those patterns, dance with the enemies without making a mistake, and when there are multiple enemies, you'll have to keep track of what each of them is doing and adapt to the situation. This would be easy to do if it wasn't for the time restriction : you can't stay here and think, you have to keep moving to the beat. That is why you need mastery : the ability to master the patterns to a point where they become second nature, for you won't have time to think, only react.Put these two wors together, and you get Crypt of the Necrodancer : difficult but fair.You won't need luck or knowledge, you won't need any wiki to remember what every item does, the only thing you'll need is yourself, your brain, your reflexes, your skill. Are you up to the task ? Can you manage to defeat the Necrodancer and escape from the Crypt ? You are the ony one able to answer that question.			"

Crypt of the Necrodancer genre blends rhythm based mechanics with rogue like/lite much more successfully than Limp Bitzkit's attempt at blending rap and rock. Think traditional turn based rogue like/lites but each beat of the game's music is it's own turn. It's a simple, but very well executed catch that adds a lot of flavor to the game. The pixel art is gorgeous, with detailed textures and animations, the up beat electronic music, though seemingly off themed from the game's more fantastical setting, is catchy and works well with the designed mechanics. If you're not a fan of the music (because you are probably insane), you can always play your own music which the game will build stages out of. Crypt of the Necrodancer also comes with a variety of different modes and features for you to explore, including hardcore, training, and a pile of items and upgrades to unlock. Even as an early access (or perhaps, especially because), it feels very complete. Further improvements from this point will feel more like free DLC than the game subsidizing for missing content. Overall, Crypt of the Nectrodancer is a very unique take on the rogue like/lite genre. It executes it's genre blending perfectly, offering easy to understand, but challenging mechanics, catering to the hardcore and beginners.Pros:- Excellent music- Great pixel art- Unique genre blending- Lots of features and promotes replayCons:- Those unfamiliar with rogue-like/lites could find this repetitive- Custom music could use some tweaking			"

												[Minor spoilers about end game gameplay].I had been in the Crypt for almost 20 hours before I first encountered the Necrodancer.I'd like to talk of that experience:The identity of the Dead Ringer revealed, I felt a pang of confusion, only to hear him guide me, and then to realize I had to juggle two heroes terrified me. How many runs had I failed this far? And another boss after what already seemed like an impossible ordeal. It only took me a few moments to realize the new mechanic I had to juggle in the last fight, and it was an amazing surprise which immediately filled the dancer floor with new energy. I spent the first minute of the encounter with the Necrodancer keeping my heroes side by side, getting used to the beat. The easy beginning really affords those fighting Necrodancer for the first time the time they need to get ready. And then, one by one I begin aligning my heroes, triggering bombs to the stage--not too difficult. When the Necrodancer took to the dance floor, indeed was my heart beating at the  120bpm step, in sync with the Necrodancer himself.  I begrudgingly set aside my Obsidian Crossbow and equipped the Golden Lute, determined to do this right. At first, I ran from his reanimated fiends and explosive spells, trying to realign myself and regroup with my ally, but as soon as I understood his rhythm I slided in for a hit. The Necrodancer skips away only losing a single heart from my note, summoning more monsters between us.Black Knights began to flank me on all sides and it's a challenge to keep them off with my ally's Flail. At one point I realize the Golden Lute can only sing its music if Cadence has a empty tile to move to, so being surrounded by shield bearing skeletons on two sides and a wall and ally covering the other two, I struggle to make any movements at all, all while rapidly losing health. For an instant I fear the worst, but in the next beat does my ally bash his Flail fowards, knocking back one skeleton--I immediately pounce on the next beat, allowing my Lute to sound the minions to dust. The fight continues with me piercing again and again with my Lute, bringing the Necrodancer to a third of his health, while monsters continue to scratch my ally and I. In the fight I've lost four of my nine hearts, leaving both my ally and I at one and a half hearts left, and as I continue to hit the Necrodancer do increasingly powerful monsters seem to appear.Eventually, there are too many skeletons in erratic formations I can't easily line up to attack, their pursuit herding me to one side of the dance floor where an Ogre has just joined. I've died many times to Ogres in the fourth zone, but I know the brute, slow, can be defeated if I merely kite around it. However, I worry that in the process, the new ally by my side would then get smashed in the ensuing blow. I move in, hitting him again and again as I circle to his back.It was at that time, checking the hearts of my ally and I, going over the directional combinations to use bombs, switching to my holstered weapon or beating my war drum, as well as predicting the path of the many dancers of the Necrodancer did I make my fatal error. My attention split, I panic and move one tile away from the Ogre, immediately attracting his singularly directed club. My obsidian armor, then powered down and thin as paper from the onslaught of reanimations is cleaved in two, Cadence immediately perishing under the mighty blow. I will now begin talking about my opinion of the game:I spent 20 hours trying to get farther and farther than before.  Being able to dance with the Necrodancer was an incredible experience, despite dying, my body is still flowing with music high. Please try this game. There are very smart design choices evident throughout every aspect. The music, the level design, the enemies and items all progress so well. Timing each act to the length of a song, having enemies which all have simple but broad ranges of dance moves to overcome make them easy to approach but brilliantly challenging in hoards. You feel extremely rewarded for your experienced-earned dexterity the roguelike demands--the game is a fantastic challenge that's never too easy.   A great example is in certain circumstances (secret vendors and trapdoors) do you find yourself in an incredibly confined space with two minibossess and two small minions. The first time you see this your fear and greenness lead to your immediate demise, but after enough of dancing do you begin to, not only feel comfortable with these, but even actively seek them out for the item and gold reward from defeating them.   Once you can beat bosses, your greed begins to demand you defeat them without a single misstep, for the glorious Flawless Victory that rewards your ego as well as giving you an additional chest to bolster your hero. I thought being an indie game this would be a quick fun change of pace but it's so much more. I've only played twenty hours but I don't intend to stop any time soon. It's a game I would recommend to any friend who comes over, it's a game I would play when I have a short break or if I have a few hours. Sometimes it can be tough if you keep dying but the rewards essentially beg you to succeed.  I keep coming back for more Crypt of the Necrodancer! "

Early Access Review
								One of the most unique games I have played in a long time.  As Cadence, you move through dungeons, dig through walls, use spells and items, attack enemies and bosses, all while staying in tune with the music.  You can not do these things if you do not match the music.  The longer you go without messing up, the greater the gold multiplier you have.  Which means more gold to buy an awesome variety of weapons, armor, and other items from the shopkeeper.  You can also find items hidden behind walls and in chests.  There are plenty of different maps, different songs, and different game modes, along with a bunch other special things you will unlock in the game.  There is also a large enemy variety, and each one behaves very differently from the next.  If you die, you are dead.  You start over completely.  This game is awesome, and definitely worth every penny.""They told me I was too young.  They told me I needed more training.  I told them to drop dead.  How ironic...I don't know how I survived that fall.  Something strange must have happened.  My pulse is beating like a drum, but my blood is running cold.  I'm not sure what's going on but I came here with a question, and I'm gonna find the answer if it kills me."" -Cadence			"

												Wow. Just woow! What a great game.Imagine a chess endgame-like gameplay (like working out tempos with your king, you know) with a rougelike setting somewhat drawing from Spelunky, in a RHYTHM game.  BEAT it!There's great educational value to it, no kidding. I just recently covered a rhytmic guitar handbook and the very first exercise there was quite exactly what you practice throughout CotND: record yourself tapping to the metronome, then listen to the recording and ponder how much offbeat you get despite you try hard. As my friend who was a strong jazz drummer used to say: ""Anyone can play any instrument, there's no big deal to it. But it takes a musician to play to the beat.""Oh, and you can import your own music for even more fun...  I want ""Swing Eights"" DLC now! :)			"

												I waited way too long to pick this one up. On one hand, I love rhythm games and was huge into Rock Band's drums back in the day. On the other hand, roguelikes are a bit overdone at this point and even a game with a huge amount of depth can be a turnoff when you play for 30 hours and only see less than 10% of the content, often because RNGesus hates you.I'm going to assume that you enjoy rhythm games if you're considering this one, Crypt of the NecroDancer does three things that roguelikes in general can learn from.The first is that everything is predictable, even when it's random. The majority of enemies follow a strict algorithmic pattern and the better you are at discerning these patterns and reacting to them quickly, the better you will do. Red Bats' random movements are countered by paying attention to what tiles they are on and what tiles you're on. Bosses have reliable strategies that allow them to be taken out with zero damage suffered, even the ones like Death Metal who have aspects of randomness included. Item drops are random, but this matters less as you unlock higher and higher difficulties that are designed to deprive you of gear and demand perfection.The second thing is that the majority of things are unlocked within a relatively short span of play for a roguelike, about 10 hours. Furthermore, competitive modes such as the Daily Challenge and All Zones/Seeded put everyone on a completely level playing field from the start. No system of unlocks that favors 300+ hour players over the new installs, which is frankly a very good thing. It's not just even popular roguelikes, competitive has become a joke across a wide array of genres due to the industry's addiction to progression systems. It's used as an artificial longevity tactic and even though the store page isn't all 100+ hour reviewers, you know those reviewers' time wasn't wasted by grinding either. This trait gives Crypt of the Necrodancer more of an arcade feel, which is appropriate as all zone runs generally last under an hour. (with the world record seeded speedrun being under 2 minutes)The last kudos goes to the fact that you can enable an option (off by default) to make item names/descriptions visible. I love this feature -- a certain other mega-popular roguelike lacks this feature and as a result it feels like a Mediawiki simulator, constantly disrupting the flow of play. There are a few items without descriptions but these are clearly cursed or ""double-edged sword"" type items, so that's fine.Although not tagged as such, it's worth mentioning that this game is very difficult. You have a lot more information to process than other rhythm games, especially as enemies start becoming more numerous. The difficulty spikes drastically once you unlock the final story mode character, who can only survive two hits or missed beats. Needless to say the YouTube rendition of all the cutscenes is very popular as a result, but just looking at the global achievement stats (and the lack of achievers) will tell you that this game isn't messing around. This isn't a huge problem due to customization options being robust enough to suit any difficulty level, though the one thing they got wrong was hiding the ""double time"" character behind the ""gold one-shots you"" character. It's probably justifiable by difficulty scaling, but it's not all that justifiable by locking what many would consider to be the ""fun hard"" character behind ""tedious hard"" one. But this is a small nitpick honestly.There are plenty of ways to customize the game. The options menu supports a wide range of preferences, always important for letting people feel ""in the zone"" in a rhythm game. There's a modding system, though I haven't used it much yet. The song importer is pretty good, and it accurately timed songs that I ripped from my CD's as WMA and then turned into OGG with Audacity. (only mp3 and ogg are supported) Digital purchases will probably fare just as well. PC rips will require manual timing, which works well enough. It also gives you options to play songs at half or double time, which you might want with higher BPM genres like Metal. Necrodancer seems to have a range for where BPM should be, and halves any that exceed that range -- so you'll want to either play your Dragonforce CD as Bolt, or manually set it to 2x speed.One final positive to mention, and also advice for new players -- it's playable with a dance pad, but you probably need to be superhuman to have a chance in the more difficult modes. Keyboard is also supported, and if you're playing on keyboard, remap the spell/item/misc keys right away and disable the default combos. This seems to make the input more responsive...or maybe I expected it to and it just seems more responsive. It's also good to get used to your own layout right away as the inprecision of two key input will eventually end up biting you the more the game demands perfection.All in all, this is an amazing game...and I'll be there on day 1 if an expansion or sequel comes out.

												I was initially turned off by this game because I couldn't keep to the beat and kept dying to the minibosses, but after initially refunding it I picked it up again in the Halloween sale and I'm loving it.Despite the obvious differences in gameplay and graphics, I find myself comparing it favourably to Dark Souls. It's hard but fair - like every roguelike, you'll be dying a lot, but it's usually due to your own mistakes. Every enemy has a pattern (except bats; screw them), and once you learn it you can breeze past enemies that used to mean a speedy end to your run.There's a huge variety of enemies which require varied tactics to beat. The equipment is similarly varied; weapons range from the basic dagger to longswords, whips, crossbows and even the coveted blunderbuss. Magic rings, spells, boots, helmets, torches and armour (randomly dropped from chests and stocked in shops) also contribute to making every run feel unique, as you'd expect from a roguelike. There's a great deal of progression, too - you amass diamonds from repeated runs of levels which allow you to add more types of gear to the item pool. You can also play as a bunch of different characters which are unlocked throughout the game. Each brings a new way to play, although I find the game hard enough without dying instantly when I miss a beat (as happens when you're playing Aria or Coda). I would have liked to see more characters like Eli, who shakes up the gameplay by only being able to use bombs as weapons, rather than insane challenge-run characters that only a tiny percentage of players will even complete a run with.The soundtrack is phenomenal. Made by Danny Baranowsky, of Super Meat Boy and original Binding of Isaac fame, it's undeniably catchy and covers a wide range of genres. Unlike most games, it's actually a significant part of gameplay - the tempo of the music determines how fast you have to move, and one particular boss (King Conga) switches things up by missing every eighth beat.The story is fairly bare-bones - you get a cutscene when you finish one of the four zones with Cadence, Melody and Aria, and that's about it. I don't mind, really - this game is all about the excellent gameplay.I'd highly recommend this game if you enjoy rhythm games or dungeon-crawling roguelikes.			"

 Summary: My 4th best game of 2015, and for good reason. One of the best mashups of genres that I've seen over the last several years, Crypt of the Necrodancer has that addictive quality that will keep you playing the game over and over again, and enjoying every moment of it.  Strong internal game design revolving around the movement, not the rhythm, and yet the rhythm enhances every moment of gameplay. Dancing in between enemies and getting in the first hit while protecting your precious little health does keep you super aware of your surroundings, and enemy pattern movements force you to think outside the box, digging into the environment to escape or just give yourself a breather. A great solid soundtrack that's designed with the gameplay in mind, and yet importing songs works rather nicely too in a majority of cases. Look, I could go on and on about Crypt of the Necrodancer's design, it's smart gameplay, it's hours of re-playability, but I'm just going to get down to the chase. Everyone who even remotely likes roguelike/roguelite elements will have a fantastic time with this game, and those looking for something out of the rhythm genre will find something fresh and new here. Well worth the full price of admission, no questions asked.    Video Review:

 Lists: +: Strong base gameplay that doesn't need the rhythm to succeed, because the base roguelike gameplay works on so many levels. And yet the rhythm enhances things on multiple levels, forcing quick decisions on the part of the player, forcing mistakes for those not ready for what's to come..  Great variety in weapons and characters, forcing different play styles that still all work on basically the same principles, but you may not realize it. The different characters in particular add some clever elements into the game, forcing you to think about things that you may not have before, like using the walls wisely or avoiding enemies rather then confronting them.  Enemy movement patterns are very smartly done, force you to change up your expectations and react to the situation at hand.  Great soundtrack that is designed for the beat to be consistent, so players get adjusted to the game, but hits a variety of genres, and the remixes are something you'll want to put in your collection. Never get old, and I STILL wanna get up and dance at the opening theme. This coming from a person who has two left feet. Visuals work surprisingly, and you never get lost in the smart selection of color scheme versus background. Everything is clear and up front.  After first hating it, like the final duel they set up, as it takes the gameplay more to a completely new place I wasn't expecting. In fact, would love to see a mode entirely centered around it.  Importing songs works in a lot more cases then I thought it would. Good open source library used to detect the base beat, and is able to detect even if those really odd cases. Some good mods out there, even if half of them are only visual. I personally recommend the Mega Man mod. Because ITS THE GOD DAMN MEGA MAN.-: Minor bugs here and there. For example, it'll exit on the second time you go into import song after playing a round with the new one, and can't handle accented letters.In terms of importing songs, The dog song from undertale doesn't work well with it =(. Honestly, I'd love some DLC just for the fact that well, I just want more. Granted, what's there works, but I still love it to this day. Honestly I'm literally coming up with flaws out of nothing. That's how fun this game is. That it took me this long to do a steam review on this game.  "

I've been sucked into this game for hours, intending to sit down for a short play session, only to end up trying again and again to improve my skills, and progress. In the age of depressing, gritty, gaming-realism, this game is ridiculously fun and quirky, and I hope the creators know what a gem of a game they've got here. And the music?

Early Access Review
								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a extremely fun rhythm roguelike with custom music game with difficulty for everyone.The game is still on Early Access so there's not much to say. You can play as various characters, some are easy, some are extremely difficult (i'm looking at you, Aria). The easiest character in the game is Cadence in my opinion. You walk as the hearbeats go, and the enemies move if you don't. If you don't like the whole heartbeats stuff, you can play as Bard and be free of all that crap. Other characters are a variation of Cadence, like not killing enemies or not picking up gold.Right now, there are 3 zones and 4 bosses, Mines, Underground Forest (?), Icy Hot place (???).Not going to spoil any of the bosses, but there's an extremely easy one, easy one, medium one (probably my favorite), and hard as balls one.You pretty much always are carrying a sword and a shovel. You can upgrade it the sword to a broadsword, spear, longsword, whip, and even a bow and arrow which all have glass, obsidian, blood, gold, platinum, etc... variations. Same for the shovel.You will also get Headpieces, Shoes, Armor, Potions, Maps, Scrolls, Food, Magic, and other stuff.One complaint that i have with this game is that it recycles the enemies way too much. Want a example?""Oh look, it's a green smile""""Wow, it's a blue slime""""Watch out, it's a yellow slime!""""Please don't kill me mr. lava slime!""""This is getting repetitive, right ice slime?""And then there are white skeleton, white skeleton with shield, white skeleton with horse, yellow skeleton, yellow skeleton with shield, etc...They are all different but they're pretty much the same thing with different colors/health.8.5/10 "

Early Access Review
								Note: I've only played the alpha build, so some of this may be subject to change.Crypt of the NecroDancer is an incredibly fun take on the Rogue-like genre.At its core, NecroDancer follows the same tenants that most Rogue-likes do. You enter a procedurally generated dungeon with basic equipment and attempt to reach the exit. Along the way you defeat enemies, avoid traps, buy items, and make generally strategic decisions before you take each step.NecroDancer throws an unusual wrench in the works, however. You're no longer allowed to move or attack unless you do so in sync with the rhythm of the current song. Doing well increases the number of coins you get from enemies, and missing a beat resets this bonus. Additionally, if you miss, the enemies essentially get a free turn. No longer can you sit and ponder your next move, you have to keep moving with the song. Additionally, enemies follow a generally fixed pattern and will only manage to deal damage to you if you neglect to keep this pattern in mind.The result is a highly skill-based Rogue-like where decisions need to be made quickly, and mistakes are punished harshly. The game is definitely balanced around this mantra, as it's very possible to win without ever purchasing an upgrade for your character. In order to cater to a variety of player-types, the game includes both a ""standard"" mode and a ""hardcore"" mode. In the standard mode you're able to purchase upgrades that permanently boost your character, and there are essentially checkpoints that allow you to start from later levels. In contrast, ""hardcore"" puts you on the first floor with no upgrades and requires you to clear the game in one go. There are time and score leaderboards for hardcore, along with character unlocks that serve to boost the difficulty even more. The terrifying ""Aria mode"" is unlocked at the end of hardcore, and features a new mechanic where any hit or any failure to match the beat of the song results in immediate death.The end result is a very fun and refreshing game. Even in the alpha build the mechanics feel very polished, the enemies are varied and interesting, and the strategic gameplay is downright engaging. Much like Spelunky, you'll find yourself excited to die repeatedly as you learn to conquer the game's increasingly difficult floors. The less hardcore players will also likely find enjoyment in collecting new upgrades and unlocking new features as they slowly make their way to the end.The music is also incredible, featuring the composer from Super Meat Boy. If you want additional variety or don't like a particular track, you can replace any level's soundtrack with an MP3 of your choosing. I haven't played around with this much yet, but it likely adds a considerable amount of depth to an already deep game.Sadly, the Alpha Build doesn't have the 4th (and final) zone yet. However, if it is anything like what I've seen so far, it will be both devious and incredibly fun to play.If you enjoy Rogue-likes or music games, this is a great purchase.			"

Early Access Review
								Edit: As of December 25, 2014 (Merry Christmas)I really love this game. Danny Baranowsky does a beautiful job at making the music catchy and fit the theme of the levels. The game is incredibly hard, split into 4 zones (4th zone is locked as of the early access). Once you beat one zone (each zone is made up of 3 normal levels and a final boss, all of which are amazing and the music to the bosses are amazing as well) the next zone opens up. I've unlocked Zone 3 and it's nearly impossible for me. I mean, come on, there's a chess boss where the pieces move exactly like in chess, it's absolutely badass.There's a daily challenge much like Spelunky and SpiderMod for Isaac, and I've seen scores of people who have beaten the game, so it IS possible, it's just really hard. Don't let the challenge discourage you from getting it. Enemies have a distinct pattern (except bats, ♥♥♥♥ those guys), and you have to attack the enemy between their attack pattern to hit them unharmed, however if you stay in a square or attempt to move into a square that an enemy moves onto at the same time, you get hit. There is some knowledge you gain only by playing the game, such as attack prioritization. For example, the game prioritizes your attack over all enemies', so if you attack a 1 health enemy that's going to attack you at the same time, your attack is registered first and the enemy dies without you getting hit, but if the enemy has more than 1 health, you get hit because you didn't kill the enemy on that beat.When you get hurt or die it's ALWAYS because you messed up the enemy pattern, I've never felt the game cheated me on damage or death. And don't think the game is trial and error on knowing the enemy patterns, they nearly always have a tell when they're about to attack so you can attack them in between.There are very, very minor bugs in the game, sure a good amount of them are userend, meaning you might mess up thinking how something works and try to use it incorrectly only to have it mess you up (such as learning how the Cat of Nine Tails works, I hate this weapon), but the actual bugs in the game are barely noticeable and the creator does an absolutely fantastic job of updating the game and squashing bugs, he's very very active on the /r/necrodancer subreddit as well as the Brace Yourself Games forums where there's a bug database that you can add to or search through to see if a bug you found has already been seen.The visual style is nice, the pixelated art works fine, the level art is looks good. Most enemies groove out to the music so it's pretty cool.There's also a feature where you can use your own music and the game will process it and determine the beat of the music, so far it's pretty accurate though it does seem to have very minor issues with certain songs. But I really like the original music so I'm probably not going to change it.The more I play this game, the more I'm loving it. I fell in love with the Binding of Isaac and have about 230 hours in it, I can EASILY see myself outplaying that game in this one. Seriously, the music is some of the best I've heard in a game, the gameplay is fresh and the creator is constantly updating and improving the experience. Is it worth $15? ABSOLUTELY. I would not skip a beat even if this game was $30 dollars or even full retail at $60. The replay value is immense and if I get 200 hours in this game, even if the game was prices at $60, I payed $3.33 per hour, and I say that's an amazing deal. What makes this hypothetical even better is the game is FIFTEEN DOLLARS, NOT SIXTY. Come on, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. If the game is on sale (which it is for the Winter Sale), I say with 100% certainty that it is worth your time to buy it.At first I said this game is an 8.5/10. ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥, this gets 10000/10.

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a hardcore roguelike rhythm game. You will die, and die, and die to the beat of the song, and you will come back for more. This is one of few games that I recommend picking up without waiting for it to go on sale. The soundtrack is a bit on the pricey side, but it's Danny Baranowsky, and that name never fails to disappoint.9.9/10 Nothing like dying to a Red Dragon 5 runs in a row with a stiffy.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game has tons of positives. I loved the music, loved the gameplay, loved the overarching theme. The concept is amazing, and initially I thought it was executed well too.The reason why I don't recommend this game is because of the absurd and arbitrary roller coaster of a difficulty curve that this game is.- Playing Cadence was a fun and invigorating challenge. I banged my head a bit trying to beat the boss, but was able to eventually overcome it. The difficulty curve was fair and steady.- Playing Melody was easy - a cakewalk compared to Cadence. I beat all 4 zones in 1-2 tries, no sweat. The difficulty curve was abnormally low here, especially after beating the 4th zone with Cadence.- Then we have Aria... never have I played a videogame that it so unforgiving and punishing.There are several major disagreements I have with this:- The cliff-like difficulty spike: especially going from Melody to Aria, this was a stark negative experience for me.- That this ridiculous difficulty spike is included in the main storyline: This effectively locks out everyone but hardcore players from even the base storyline (Yes I'm saying that if you clear all Aria's zones I consider you a hardcore player!). I have nothing against the existence of Aria's gameplay; I can appreciate the level of difficulty that she offers. But I do take issue that the storyline cannot progress unless you play through all 4 zones with her.- She has no advantages to other characters: Playing Melody was a new and interesting experience because of the lute and having to adjust my strategy to dance around the enemies. Aria doesn't bring anything new to the table; in fact, she takes things off the table.If Aria's gameplay was adjusted to be more reasonable by giving her a unique gameplay advantage, I would not hesitate to recommend this game to everyone I know. There are probably a few hundred ideas out there, and I have several of my own. However, the difficulty curve (i.e. roller coaster) is not something I would want those I know to experience.			"

												Just becuase your game is hard, doesn't mean it's good. Great concept here, total lack of content hidden behind frustrating layers of difficulty.Edit: To clarify since people seem to think I'm ""just doing it wrong"". I love a lot of the ideas in this game... a unique rhythm based dungeon crawler is right up my alley; but when you strip it all back what we have here is a shallow rougelike experience wrapped behind some incredibly charming art / style and a great soundtrack. There are 4 levels and a handful of enemy types, and no matter what the folks in the comments say you're going to die... a lot. The soundtrack is good, which is nice because you're going to be listening to the same 3 songs over and over as you attempt to master the enemy movements. I don't personally recommend it because I found the experience frustrating and unrewarding. Judging by the fact the current store shows the ratings as 98% positive I'm obviously the minority here. There are folks with hundreds of hours sunk into this game, so take my negative opinion with a grain of salt obviously.			"

""Rhythm game plus roguelike"" was the hook that caught me, and then ""I'll never be able to finish this game but it's fun"" became ""how does anyone win as Monk"" became ""okay, but I'll never win as Aria"" … and now I'm hovering on the brink of aspiring to an All Chars run.

TL;DR: Buy this game even if you don't enjoy rougelikesHmmmmmm, where do I even begin with this kind of game? The concept behind this game made this almost an instabuy. A roguelike where the turns are locked to the beats? Yes please. I haven't seen a concept like this before, and I haven't heard about another one if it existed.Unlike traditional roguelikes, there is no leveling system. You don't get ""stronger"" by defeating enemies or bosses. No, instead, you learn from them. Killed by a blue slime? Don't stand above it or below it. Out of 80+ hours of play, I have had zero unfair deaths. I could look at the replay and see exactly where and how I screwed up. You get better after every death.The music in this game is fantastic. Seriously. I have (mostly) had nothing but Necrodancer tunes stuck in my head ever since I started playing. My only complaint is that Jules' soundtrack isn't the best for playing the character it is assigned to. I've had little problems importing music as well, but it isn't 100% perfect. Instead of manually tpping out beats, I just use a program that generates the file for me.Make no mistake, this game is hard. It took me quite some time to clear the first character, and I am still working on the next two main ones. All zones mode is the main one for this game, and most of your character achievements will come from that mode. Play single zones until you're used to the game, then go for all zones. Do you think that being locked to the beat is too hard? Play as the bard. No beats and all the time in the world to make your decisions. Since you'll be dying a lot, it may or may not become repetitive. I haven't gotten bored in the amount of hours I put into it. This game is hard but replayable. Some characters are harder/more annoying than others. Experiment and see who you like best.Like roguelikes? Get this. Like rhythm games? Get this. Want to be challenged? Get this. Want to get angry that you went to an endboss and died? Get. This.9/10			"

 tl;dr: Buy this game NOW if you enjoy dungeon-crawlers and/or roguelikes of any kind, innovation, and kickass music. At its core, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a rouge-like dungeon crawler. However, as you become more invested in the game's unique on-the-beat movement system, you'll begin to realize that NecroDancer is much more than that! Strategy comes into play when dealing with enemies with increasingly complex movement systems, especially when you get the urge to compete for a top spot on the speedrun and gold high school leaderboards in each Daily Challenge. DannyB's soundtrack for this game is fantastic and somehow hasn't gotten boring to me even after hours and hours playing the game. There are now 5 soundtracks to play with, and there's also always the option to enchant the Crypt with your own MP3s with ease! The story is surprisingly deep and well thought out - cutscenes are quick but pack a lot of meaning. They flesh out the lore of the NecroDancer very well, and offer a very satisfying resolution that ties up all loose ends.Brace Yourself Games handled Early Access like champs - there was and still is a huge amount of community involvement, and I've seen many community suggested features be implemented! Crypt of the NecroDancer WELL WELL WELL worth the cost. Buy it NOW if you have any interest! It's easy to pick up, but hard to master!P.S.: for any musicians out there, I can say that this game has definitely improved my rhythm-keeping skills!P.S.S.: In reference to my hours played: it's ok.

												I should stop playing this before I break something.Edit: Okay, time for an actual review. It's also my first, so excuse me if it's a little useless.Crypt of the NecroDancer is built on a fairly simple concept: it's a turn based dungeon crawler, except each turn is restricted to the beat of the music, so if you don't think quickly enough or mistime your move, you miss your turn (and your gold multiplier, which can be crippling with certain items).As you might expect, enemies become tougher as you move through each stage of the game, with their movements becoming more complex as well. You can find new tools and weapons as you progress to give yourself a better chance, but ultimately, you have to learn how each enemy behaves to succeed.There are a total of ten playable characters, two of which are unlocked from the start (one using the  default gameplay and the other allowing you to move off the beat, effectively removing the time pressure). The unlockable characters offer more challenging scenarios such as: Instant gameover if you touch any gold dropped by defeated monsters Instant gameover (yet again) if you miss a single beat or take a single hit Elapsing turns two times faster than usual A ludicrous horror that combines everything above Not being able to deal any damage, and instead having to dodge enemies while going for the exitThere's plenty of replay value thanks to the different characters, and the game also generates daily challenges similar to those from Spelunky: everyone gets one try at the same dungeon each day, and your final score is uploaded to the leaderboard for that day only.You can import your own soundtracks and play along to them, provided you have them stored locally. There's also modding support, which is always nice.			"

What was difficult when I first started is childs' play later. It's a rare game that punishes you for mistakes while teaching you not to make those mistakes again.3.

												The thing is: I really like rythm games but I usually get bored quickly by them because they have nothing more to offer than just doing the same songs over and over again to get a better accuracy score.So here comes Crypt of the NecroDancer taking what I love about rythm games and combining it with another genre I've come to love over the last year: roguelike.There are various permanent options to unlock for your rounds, be it better and differently working weapons, armor, spells or other miscellaneous equipment. You don't just buy equipment to start with though, there are randomly generated chests in each level, you unlock better items to be found in those and/or more spawned chests. Which is an awesome way to keep the procedural feeling alive and not just making the game considerably easy to blast through.Each enemy has a certain pattern and rythm of moving and attacking, so due to the many different types of enemies there's a lot to learn and adapt to, which I love. If you don't quite have rythm in your blood, doing the constant moving to the beat and concentrating on visual patterns at the same time might get frustrating. Don't fret though! The game offers a training mode for both the basic monsters and minibosses - only ones you encountered yet, no spoilers.The music is fantastic and the artstyle just nails the whole serious yet not serious mood of the game. I'm totally in love with Crypt of the NecroDancer! <3			"

			Crypt of the NecroDancer is a hardcore roguelike rhythm PC game. Crypt of the NecroDancer makes you move on the beat to navigate ever changing dungeons. Coming for Steam Early Access.		

I have no idea how I missed Crypt of the NecroDancer for such a long time. What simple, yet AWESOME game. You only need four keys, or your feet if you play on a dance pad. Move at the right time to the right place. It sounds simple but it becomes hardcore with so much going on the screen. With a game that uses rhythm you expect to have a great soundtrack and the game doesn't disappoint there. Ingenious, simple but deep. Fantastic.Pros- Great soundtrack- Simple to pick up, hard to master- In depth item system, a lot of replay valueCons- Because I really can't find anything else, I would like a description on the items before buying them			"

								While the game is still in Beta, what has been completed is worthwhile. Necrodancer is a rhythm, turn-based, roguelike. It can be played with just directional keys, so dancepad friendly.  You move your character  to the beats of Danny Baranowsky (Super Meat Boy, Binding of Isaac) as you make your way through 3 (4 upon release) zones, each containing 3 levels and a boss fight. There are currently 7 playable characters offering various challenges with a variety of weapons and items to utilize. Floors are randomly generated and you can race for better times or complete to get the highest score. The game is challenging, but fair so when you die, it was probably your fault. The game provides a training feature so you can practice against any enemy and hone your strategies. Other features include a daily challenge, seeded runs, and creating your own levels. You can even customize the music that plays as well as mod in game sprites. "

								At its core, Crypt of the NecroDancer consists of one simple premise: move to the rhythm. The action unfolds according to the unholy beat of the Necrodancer - you must move with it, attack with it, dodge the enemy onslaught with it. The literal pulse of Cadence's heart drives a deadly crypt and the twisted monsters within.But underneath it is something more. Dig deeper, and the player uncovers a surprisingly deep gameplay experience, especially for one still in Early Access. Each weapon type sports a unique attack pattern. A cavalcade of items and equipment provides benefits ranging from immediate health recovery to phasing through walls or limiting the number of enemies. Spells can give you an upper hand against the thralls, freezing them in place or blasting them to ashes with a fiery bolt. Shrines, hidden shops, secret enemies, multiple playable characters... they all contribute to an experience unlike most other rhythm games you've played.Crypt of the NecroDancer falls into the ""roguelike"" genre and as such you'll see many of its usual trappings: procedural dungeons, high difficulty, an emphasis on discovery, bombs and consumables, etc. What sets this apart from other similar games, aside from the rhythm aspect, is that luck only plays a minimal factor in your success. Every level and every enemy is balanced in a way that completing a run from start to finish without ever upgrading from the starting dagger is entirely possible, and in fact has been done multiple times. If you're into other roguelike games there is a lot here for you to love and be familiar with. I, for one, never cared much for the genre. Games like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac I've played a few times, but ultimately I grew tired of them. 120+ hours later, Crypt of the NecroDancer has me completely hooked.One of its biggest strengths is its absolutely stellar soundtrack composed by the well-known Danny Baranowsky. It was a smart move to focus the gameplay around this music - it provides just the right atmosphere and you'll find yourself bobbing your head to the beat as you play without even noticing it. One of the other aspects that really drew me in was that the game feels completely fair. You don't need one specific item to get a good run, and you don't need lucky shops or good spawns to make it to the end. Skill and familiarity with the enemies can carry you 99% of the way. Learning enemy behaviors and discovering new items become fun exercises. If you die, you know exactly what mistake you made and learn to avoid that for the next run. You can play with a keyboard, a controller, or even a dance pad, and you can even add your own music into the levels! The game also has a welcoming community and great forums you can visit to seek advice or share your latest victory.There's even still more to come! One more ""zone"" will be added to the game, there will be more boss fights, as well as the possibility for more items, equipment, mechanics, etc. Even in its ""alpha"" state Crypt of the NecroDancer is a deep and rewarding experience, and I personally can't wait to see more!

Early Access Review
								Yep, it's a roguelike played via DDR. Dance pads compatible but not required. It may technically be in Early Access but I'd never know, the game seems pretty complete as is and I keep getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me before I can even clear Zone 2 (there being 4 zones at present).The gameplay is pretty self-explanatory once you've gone through the quick tutorial, but is ever a matter of reflexes and quick thinking to keep yourself in one piece. Enemies are deviously varied to give you all manner of headaches to fight in conjunction with one another. Diamonds acquired through play are spent in the hub to unlock new equipment to appear in chests (as well as some passive upgrades like health). Rooms are available to help you practice fighting against specific enemies and bosses, and one character is available to let you just play the game as a regular turn-based roguelike. There's a local co-op mode of some sort too, hell if I know how that works. Hardcore mode is available for a no-upgrades run, and there's a daily one-shot hardcore challenge available, ala Spelunky.There are a few minor sticking points.1) You can import your own music for any of the levels you like, which is fantastic, except when the automatic beat detection--which, granted, is impressively accurate on the whole--doesn't work quite right and there's no way to attempt a manual fix.2) The game doesn't require you to keep on the beat perfectly, there's a fair leeway in the timing and you can miss beats if you don't mind losing your current cash multiplier (that is, unless you've invoked a risk shrine); this is open to some strategizing with skipping a beat to ready yourself for an enemy, but there's no actual control function for 'skip beat' and so you're left waiting for the input grace period between beats for enemies to make their move, after which it's hard to get right back into the rhythm.3) There's no ""count in"" between levels at all, so to keep your multiplier up you have to start moving again before you've even processed what's immediately around you or what the new rhythm actually is.4) Practice rooms for monsters are great, but having to defeat a monster or boss once during normal play to unlock them seems a bit counterintuitive.Minor gripes. Very solid soundtrack, very solid gameplay. Would probably be a HELL of a party game, with big picture running on a nice TV and a DDR mat set up.			"

								Even if rhythm games aren't your thing this game gets strangely addicting.

Early Access Review
								First off, I have to admit, I fell in love with the opening sequence. It's the perfect blend of music, plot, voice acting and a beat to get me hyped all the hell when I start it up. DROP DEAD!The game is really enjoyable. It's a Roguelike, but it feels less dependent on luck, and more on skill and planning then most others. I don't generally feel like I was screwed too hard when I die; As far as I can see it, you should be able to clear the game without getting hit, or at least close, if you're god-like at pattern recognition.Every enemy has it's own pattern, which, I can't believe the game didn't refer to as it's unique Dance. Maybe it's too corny. As Cadence (oh, there's the corniness. Works, though.) remarks, 'learn that, and they'll never harm you.' (something like that.)I think the one negative I've had in dealing with the game is in using items and spells. It's not impossible, but it takes a good deal getting used to. You only have 4 keys, the 4 directions. To use items, you combine them. Ex, an apple is Up+Left, or whatnot. Keeping your combo going while using them very rarely works out for me in the heat of a battle.But, even then, you can bind those combinations to other keys, if you like. Up+Left could be bound to Ctrl, or Shift, or Left trigger. Yes, it works with gamepads. Personally, I bound XBAY and the Dpad to all directions applicable. If your one hand gets tired, switch to the other! Or, if you have a Left+Right item, it works well using both hands, I find, so it's Left+B instead. Aaaaanyway. Graphics are fine. Gameplay is fun (first level's tempo is a liiitle slow for my taste), and the feeling on beating a boss is rewarding. King Conga and his Zombie Conga Lines (yes) confused the hell out of me the first time, but when you learn it, it's just plain fun.In short, I love installing large screen televisions in doghouses, and Crypt of the NecroDancer is a good game.

1-sentence review:this game is a well crafted rhythm-based roguelike, which is fun and addicting enough, even for a player with average dexterity like myself, which is in addition not especially fan of hardcore roguelikes ; although the game is not without (small) shortcomings.Pros:- Well crafted roguelike, even without the rhythm component- Varied monsters- Relatively varied environments- Training room to beat each enemy individually- Boss fights are not too hard nor too easy- Playing with the Bard character makes the game turn-based (ie: no rhythm anymore), which allowed me to see the final zone ;-)Cons:- Having to play on the rhythm of the music can get really frustrating when it feels too slow- RNG is as usually in a roguelike too important ; getting a good weapon early or late in the run makes all the difference ; sometimes, the spawning point is next of the exit with a big dragon that burns you through walls before you can get an idea of your surroundings, etc... >_<- No difficulty settings, except for the separate easier 1st Zone & the Bard, but it's really not enough (eg: I wish I could have played with some bonus Hearts and more efficient healing from food)- Lacks a bit of content ; I played 12 hours and I feel I got all I could get from the game ; it is totally ok for me as I don't like to spend too much time on the same game, and if you get badly addicted, you probably can play a lot more than thatBonus Notes:- Unlike 99% of the other players, I'm not a big fan of the musics ; they don't hold up to the 80's & 90's scores I still have in mind ; I haven't played the game for 2 days and can't remember a tune right now... >_<   They do their jobs though and are alright.- the extra characters bring different gameplay, but exception of the Bard one, they'll be doable only by the most hardcore fans			"

PROS+It's in early access but you should probably get it, does an excellent job at combining the rythm / dungeon crawler / roguelike genres.+The game isnt easy and requires some practice and time investment to beat all the zones (learning monsters patterns, items, shrines) but all in all its a very rewarding process.+Has Steam Workshop support and a lot of interesting items / equipment you'll have to learn. Also they do daily challenges and the devs donate some money to charities and top players.+Gets you humming to its great OST and moving to the beatThings I would improve-Some improvements to the custom music-to-beats process, using your own songs doesn't always work as expected-Adding some kind of end-game content (After beating zone 3 you are like ""what do I do now""). Yes, you have hardcore mode, but I would add some minor and faster reachable achievements / milestones. Like ""kill X red ragons"" , ""kill 3 enemies with a bomb"", ""kill Conga King with a glass shard"". Maybe even add some more hidden collectibles or trophys which can be viewed in a room in the lobby.-Cloud save would be a nice feature, also multiplayer in the future would be something nice but it's ok as it is, I know it would be too much trouble.VeredictThis game is worth the money, some minor things could be improved, but even if it's in early access the developers are really active and care about the game!

								There's just not enough words in existence to suitably recommend Crypt of the NecroDancer.It's early access, so bugs may be present, but they barely ever bother me.And a rhythm roguelike is combining two genres I like - and Crypt does it very well.

												This game makes me want to dance, too bad when I try I get killed after 5 seconds because I have no rhythm.Anyway, this rogue-like game mixed with a rhythm game is pretty nice, It's your standard rogue-like adventure except you have to move with the music (you can use custom songs but the OST is great too). These kind of games tend to be pretty hard so expect to die constantly, but don't worry, you get to upgrade your character little by little as you play.As of writing this review I haven't finished the game (I'm on Zone 4), but that doesn't matter, I feel like what I paid for the game was worth it.

												I have a lot of good things I can say about this game.Out of every game I played, I can say this one take's the cake for:Most fair game. EVERY time I die, I can think ""man, I know what I did wrong,"" as opposed to other games where you lose and feel cheated.Best difficulty curve. Starting out, I couldn't tap keys to a beat, but I was able to work my way up to fast reactions and even double-speed (a certain character). No matter how long you play this game, you can ALWAYS get better and notice the improvement.The music is FANTASTIC. Danny B's music has such strong composition. It really fits the game, the groove, and does a great job at letting the player 'feel the beat' of the game. The other soundtracks are also great. I'm not a big fan of EDM or Metal, but I still enjoy Jules and A-Rival. Girlfriend also has some great tracks, but I personally am not a fan of Virt.There are so many unique things about this game. This is the first music-based dungeon crawler I've ever seen. The shopkeeper sings! The characters, voices, sounds, they make you feel so good to play. You can compete against other players for fastest times, or highest scores.woopsirantedthisgameisreallygoodbuyit			"

Oh did you know they have necrodancer themed DDR pads? well they do infact they are being sold at the regular price and the devs aren't even taking a cut.Seriously this may sound like i'm joking but you need this game.Edit:this game has multiple modes     Normal mode where unlocks you purcahse with gems (found while playing the game)  and beating a zone brings you to the menu     hardcore mode which means you get none of the upgrades and start with only 2 HP. you must beat all zones to complete it.     Other variants that involve characters that augment the game such as making the game in double time or miss a beat and you die.     Daily challenge like spelunky. A seeded run that you get one chance per day.You are able to use your own music if you so choose but the soundtrack itself is amazing.This game is very difficult but rewarding and it's continually improving.

												This is probably the best roguelike (or roguelite) I've ever played. :-)Why? Let's see...-the theming: it mixes classic dungeon crawling with rhythm (or at least: sets you on a beat), and it maintains that position to the smallest details. From singing shopkeepers to music-themed bosses, it's neither too corny nor not flavourful enough.-as far as variety in procedurally generated levels are concerned, things are pretty decent. There's a good amount of enemy variety and items, and all the systems seem to work together well (will you trade hearts for a better weapon? Will you fight extra monsters for gold to buy better gear? Will you risk stuff for diamonds to easy future runs?).-the whole nine yards: in the lobby, you can practice fighting enemies, there are other characters to chose from, lots of unlocks, and so on. I even had problems finding the actual story mode. ;-)-difficulty: as many roguelikes go, this follows the standard ""extremely hard to complete"" pattern, requiring many playthroughs from your end (reason why the variety is important). However, since enemies move to the beat in predictable patterns, all errors are technically your own fault. Still, even when playing as the bard (I'll get to that), it's pretty hard to actually make a good run.-music: as you should expect, the music is great. And I may be underestimating it when I say that.I've gotta say that Crypt of the Necrodancer feels like it has done its homework on the genre. It's like every plus point I find in spelunky, don't starve or nuclear throne is also somehow included here (though the beat-following is something of its own). The result is a very well polished and fun to play game.As said, the bard deserves special mentioning. Where other characters have slight variations on the main character, the bard doesn't follow the beat. While this makes the game less hard (it's still in no way easy), it does change the entire gameplay. It also removes the only gripe I have with the game: that the constant moving in a beat can get pretty annoying if you just want to backtrack to another part of the dungeon. The bard changes the game so much it's an entirely different game (rather akin to Nova-111, btw). A better one, some might argue, though it misses a bit of the magic that makes the game special.But whatever character you pick, this game has this addiction that when you die you immediately go ""again! again!"". So beware: your social life might suffer because of this game. ;-)			"

												Beatgames (or rhythm games) tend to be very hard at first, but when you practice, you can literally see your improvement. Although this game is not a pure beatgame, it has the full characteristics of one. The concept of two different game genres put into one is incredible, but it is just EPIC when the execution of it is perfect.The soundtrack of this game is simply amazing. I've never really had a taste for electronic music or jazz, but the stuff they put into this game definitely made me change my mind. The way they've designed everything, I think, was so you, the player, could jam to any music that would hit you. Every moving object in the game has an animation that moves to the rhythm of the BPM (beats per minute; determines how fast a song is) of the song, the shopkeepers' singing is just perfect, and the rest of the sound effects (voices, attacks, monsters) flow so astoundingly. Sometimes I play this game just because I want to listen to the soundtrack. Custom music is a plus, and I have not found any errors working with it so far. It has it's own BPM detection that works fine. Randomly generated-ness (well that's rogue-like, isn't it?) makes this game never get old. The story mode is of moderate length, and surprisingly, or at least, for me, I have gotten tied to the characters and I have grown to have sympathy for them! If you don't have a thing for rogue-like games, this will surely change your mind (That's what had happened to me). The pixel art is adorable, and the character concept art for those monsters are.. dark and horrifying. Think you have a slow/old computer and can't run this game? This game ran at 60 fps on mine, so you're fine. (In case you didn't get it, my computer is very bad.)When you first start playing, the thing that you need to remember is to never give up. If you die five times in a row, you should either take a break for a while and come back to the game later or keep playing. You will  see that improvement and it will just feel amazing. You actually feel accomplished about something, which is what very few games are able to do.As for going into more depth about the gameplay, no need for that. It is all for you to discover yourself. But here's something to remember: although the content of this game doesn't seem that abundant, trust me. It was way more stuff than you think. They also have a level editor after you complete the game (or should I say, a fraction of the game [Note what I said to remember]), so you can upload your creations to the Steam Workshop that is connected to the game or just play them alone. Nothing wrong with that.To sum it up, this game deserves every one of those awards that you see to the right. If not, more than that. This review cannot express how much I enjoy this game. It is one of the most unique and unforgettable gaming experiences ever. Get this game if you're looking for something new to enjoy. Highly RecommendedAlso, sorry if I have any grammar/typing errors.

								As of v0.370:That's one crazy mix! Roguelike + rhythm game.How that works? Well, usually in roguelikes enemies move whenever you move.Here they move on beats. And you should to. Quite cool experience, but not an easy one :DAwesome soundtrack, nice graphics, great idea, still needs more content (heck, it's just v0.370, we just need to wait a bit).More details in the video:

												This game combines rhythm and roguelike like fried chicken and waffles. If you haven't experienced them together, you think it's a bizarre combo that won't mesh well. Then you try it and you wonder why you haven't had the two together before. Where has this magical combo been your entire life?Gimmick aside, the game is still beautifully designed. The enemies all have tells and literally have choreographed attacks. Everything gives signs before the action takes place, much like many roguelikes. It's just that this game took that dance and set it to a kickin' soundtrack. You can even practice against enemies without needing to throw yourself into the deep end to figure out their tells. Even the characters are more upbeat and lively than your average roguelike. The little things, like how they greet NPCs (shyly VS boldly VS force of habit) and their surprised reactions to teleportation make them seem less like digital avatars and more like humans. A little detail that adds a lot of magic to the game.[edit] THE STORY. Add the story to another fantastic bit of this game. Only frustrating bit is how hard it is to complete story mode, but hey, it's a roguelike. That's to be expected from the genre.TL;DR - A wonderfully charming game that blends two very different genres in a lovingly-designed piece. I strongly recommend you pick up the game and the soundtrack!			"

Early Access Review
								NecroDancer is a great rhythm-based Rogue-like where you take turns to the beat of the music.  Miss a beat, everything around you takes a turn anyway.  At first it sounds weird to not have all the time in the world to plan a move in an RL, but NecroDancer makes it work with basic patterns to all creatures.  The main challenge is balancing keeping the beat up with putting yourself in a good position to deal with whatever comes at you.  You need either quick decision-making or good muscle memory from repeated plays to deal with complex situations.Unreservedly recommend it once the game is completed.  $15 for early access is alright, but you'll probably have to be interested in the concept beforehand to feel fully happy about your $15.

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a unique take on the Rogue-like genre - in that it also doubles as a rhythm game! Bounce to the beat as you read enemy movements and dispatch them; collect better items, weaponry, or scrolls; and defeat hilarious bosses from a moving chess board to a zombie conga line - and of course there are the final bosses in the game as well.The game features a multitude of different characters you can play with to win the game - starting with the default character and bard with several more unlocked as you go along. Speaking of unlocks, you will unlock new items, weapons, and other npcs that can grant services for you as you proceed through the game.While it is overall quite a neat take on playing rogue-likes, there is certainly something to say about lack of 'game' to play. There are essentially 4 different zones to play it with a multitude of enemies to encounter - but eventually it will quickly come across as same-ish and old hat. There is also a limited amount of items to unlock and eventually you'll unlock everything fairly quickly.This is a game I recommend - though I do encourage getting it at a discounted price.			"

But you don't care because you are a NecroDancer and NecroDancing is all you know now. The soundtrack is killer, the boss fights are clever and well-designed, and the bats will drive you insane.

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is half turn-based dungeon crawler with randomly-generated dungeons. The other half of the game is rhythm: each dungeon floor has a unique music track with a visually emphasized steady beat. Your moves are (ideally) made to that beat. Enemies also move to the beat, so the pace at which things happen is determined by the music. Having a steady rhythm locks the participant into a timeframe in which to act, not unlike speed chess or the rate at which a block lowers in Tetris. By removing the infinite time in which a player could decide which move is most optimal in your traditional turn-based dungeon excursions, the game becomes instead one of relying almost wholly on experience. After a while, experience becomes instinct, leading to creative leaps of strategy made entirely in the moment, in the space between the game’s figurative and literal heartbeats.You play as Cadence, a headstrong delver who - through an unfortunate combination of a terminal fall and an evil NecroDancer stealing her still-beating heart - must now travel down multiple dungeon floors, fighting monsters and finding useful items. You technically don’t have to move to the beat, but not doing so will cause you to lose a vital multiplier that increases how many coins you earn from defeated monsters. The higher the multiplier, the more likely you can afford powerful weapons and items found in dungeon shops. You know when you’re moving to the beat, because the dungeon floor starts pulsing with light, making it your very own little dungeon rave.There is very little randomness to the combat in Crypt of the NecroDancer. Everything behaves according to very set rules. You move into a monster to attack it, different weapons change the shape of your attack. If an enemy moves into a square you were trying to move to, you’ll take damage instead. Certain enemies take advantage of your urge to rush in, waiting a beat before moving, or moving in interesting patterns. Monsters have unique little dance animations, their movement sounds become a part of the melody of what’s happening on the screen. These sounds are often a clue to defeating them. As you delve deeper, the music becomes faster, the monster patterns more complex. The game is ingenious, fun in ways indescribable unless you’re there, in the moment, taken by the rhythm and amazed at how well you’re doing.You can use your own MP3s for the soundtrack, and there’s even a DDR mode for use with a dance pad. The DDR mode makes a game a bit easier so you don’t kill yourself. There’s permanent progression via character upgrades, like a health increase and magic spells, unlocked by collecting diamonds. The music is being provided by the excellent Danny Baranowsky (Super Meat Boy, Canabalt, Binding of Isaac, Desktop Dungeons).			"

												Now that the full release of this game has been out for awhile, I feel compelled to write a review of this game.Crypt of the NecroDancer is a rogue like, rhythm based dungeon crawler that offers a unique challenge and experience, complete with multiple characters that have their own playing style that affects the gameplay greatly. Pros:- Probably the most important aspect of a rhythm game is its music. Crypt does not disappoint in the slightest with its amazing tunes, composed by the one and only Danny Baranowsky as well as awesome remixes by FamilyJules7x and A_Rival.- You can use your own music in the game, and this feature is implemented well. - The game provides a hard but fair style of gameplay, something that is sure to keep people doing runs over and over again.- Each of the characters adds an interesting twist (such as moving in cut time or being able to only use bombs) that provide an additional challenge for players to overcome.- This game has high replayability as no two runs are exactly the same.- A mix of items provides players with multiple ways to beatdown enemies to the beat.- The devs constantly provide updates and work hard to fix any bugs that people encounter along the way.Cons:- It can take awhile to get used to. You're probably not going to be able to get through Zone 1 on your first try. For some people, this may be a turnoff, though, if you're willing to put in the effort, you can really get a lot of enjoyment out of completing a run.- If you're trying to 100% this game... think again. One of the achievements may be impossible to get, which may turn some people away.- Pausing the game and regaining your pace can be rather difficult. While this may not sound like a big deal at first glance, there are some characters who will die if you miss a beat (Aria and Coda).Some people may complain about the price, but you can find some 33% off coupons floating around on Steam. It's not much, but 10 bucks is less than 15. TL;DR: If you like rogue likes, rhythm games, or dungeon crawlers, get this game. This game is an astounding combination of the three that works harmoniously. If the price seems like too much, go get a coupon from groups like Coupon Dumpster and that.			"

												One of the best rhythm games I have ever played. One of the best roguelikes I have ever played. Two of my favorite genres, tasting oh so great together.Crypt of the Necrodancer requires quick thinking, a good sense of rhythm, and a keen strategic and tactical sensibility to win, and those wins are so rewarding. With a rollicking feel, great pixel art, and excellent screen effects, it's easy to get pulled into the action and hard to put down. Possibly the best feature is Danny Baranowsky's amazing soundtrack—you can play with your own music, but I never have; I love the original soundtrack too much!			"

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a very fun game. It's also very challenging. The game is far more difficult than it actually appears to be. Having to first learn how to not look at the beat meter and then learning enemy patterns takes time. I still make awful mistakes a couple hours in.This is an excellent early access game and I'm glad to have a copy of it before the release. Perhaps having a mechanical keyboard would be easier than membrane since it's easier to notice when you press the buttons versus membrane where you just feel the press down.The controller part could use some work I feel, but it's not impossible, you just have to remember which buttons you assigned for what.10/10			"

								I love this game. A lot. Now, take into account what most of the high-rated reviews say, because I agree with them. But what I'm going to touch on is something specific that I find most interesting and perhaps wholly unique about this game. Put simply, it reminds me of chess. In fact, one of the final boss room types is a chess set, which you can see briefly in the trailer, but that's beside the point. All enemies have set actions (or perhaps reactions), and will always make them according to the rhythm and how you move. For instance, the red dragon will move once every two beats toward you unless you are any distance directly to the left or right of him, in which case he will shoot a row of fire. The goblins will run away if you approach them, but pursue if you move away from them.Now, normally, if you had all the time you needed, you could plan out a perfect attack and kill everything without taking damage, but in this game, you have to move with the beat. You have to think quickly if you want to work your way out of a tricky situation. When you die, you feel like it was your mistake and the game had not cheated you, which is generally the case (though there is a small chance of the game generating an absurdly difficult enemy encounter). Even so, due to the random generation, it is possible to find a good weapon or food early on, making giving you an advantage. I always hope for an awesome weapon, but sometimes find myself doing surprisingly well with just a standard dagger. It's action/strategy/cool music-y rhythm/rogue-like at its finest.			"

								Absolutely amazing. I never thought there would ever be a roguelike-rythm game, but here we are, and it's executed in such a way that this will probably end up being my favorite game of the year. The game is played using just arrow keys for movement and item usage, and it works really well.The game appears as a standard roguelike dungeon crawler; you make tactical choices in turn-based style battles, find equipment and try to battle your way through dungeons. The difference is that the game focuses on forcing the player to keep in step with the beat of the song for movement and actions (traditionally what you'd consider to be ""turns""), giving the player a bonus in gold which can be used to buy equipment if done without flaw. Failing to move with the beat will result in a missed action while all the enemies take a turn and losing this bonus.I don't think I've ever played an RPG so easy to get into, yet challenging on many levels. It has a fun plot that works with the premise of the mechanics and the voice acting is actually very good. The music is superb, and if it's not your thing you can use your own music to power the gameplay. I don't even think I have anything I could say needs improving. It supports controllers and even dance pads. There's a slightly less difficult mode meant specifically for playing with dance pads. They already have a character that doesn't need to move in time, turning the game into a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler if you want to get used to the game or want to take a break from the rythm aspects of the game. I mean, they thought of everything and the game is super polished, all that seems to be missing is four characters and the last zone (which I haven't even reached yet). This is seriously a game I wish I had helped made.			"

								Can't stop playing this since I bought it yesterday. Catchy music, interesting enemies/items, randomly generated levels, and some challenging parts! I haven't played too much yet, so this could be in the game somewhere, but one thing I hope gets added is a list of spell/item descriptions. I still don't know what some of the rings do and when I find a new spell scroll I just cast it randomly just to see what it does so I know for the next time I find it.As a forewarning I wouldn't recommend having anyone else near you while you play if you have a mechanical keyboard. Especially if they're trying to sleep.10/10 would get murdered by my girlfriend again.			"

								Holy Jeezus phuuuck, this is an amazing game. I highly recommend getting the soundtrack when purchasing, because if you don't you'll wish you had after playing.A rhythm-game dungeon-crawler rougelike? What about that phrase doesn't spell the word ""awesome?"" Nothing! There are only the movement buttons: they cover moveing, attacks, items, spells, etc. and it works all so well. You can only move on the beat, and that's what makes the game what it is, and what makes it so fun.It's a very well executed take on a unique combination of genres. It is HARD, like Nintendo-hard, which is refreshing. When you think you finally get it, the game will hit you with a curve ball. And then you'll think you got it again, and you've re-learned how it *really* works, but NOPE it's shaken things up again.I'd like to see this ported to consoles, the dev deserves money. Hell, buy it even if you're not going to play it. This was obviously an act of love, and this behaviour should be encouraged.			"

								One of the best games I've played in a long time. It's a mix of Spelunky and Binding of Isaac's zone and random item mechanics, all smushed in with a dungeon crawler and a rhythm game. It's fairly unforgiving but not deathly hard (unless you do hardcore mode or above, but that's expected).It's definitely worth a play if you're a fan of rhythm games or dungeon crawlers regardless. The soundtrack is probably one of the most solid soundtracks I've heard on a game in quite a while, and even after 16 hours I'm still not tired of it and want to keep playing (though trying to resist due to waiting for missing content to be finished).The game's in Early Access but you wouldn't notice it if it weren't for zone 4 being unfinished, so it's definitely in a fun playable state already and the only places it can go is up. There's a lot more content on it's way but there's no harm picking it up now, you'll definitely get your money's worth if you enjoy any of the genres within.			"

												Since this is both a dungeon crawler AND a rhythm game, I've had people ask which one is more prominent. Personally, I would say it plays more like a rhythm game, given almost all mechanics of the game play into that strength. I absolutely love this game myself, and I would definitely reccommend it to anyone who has enjoyed rhythm games in the past, or even those of you with musical talents - keeping the beat will just flow with you. If you like the dungeon crawler aspect but are a bit iffy with rhythm games, I would suggest trying a demo or something to see if it sits right with you. As far as I know, however, this game is a very sound investment. Plus, new DLC came out fairly recently, proving that the game is still expanding, and the devs are still active (neither of which can be said for a lot of games nowadays).			"

												This game is easily my favorite game of 2016.  The soundtrack is amazing which is important since you'll be using the audio cues for movement.  When buying the game, I assumed I would want to play with my own mp3s.  That is absolutely not the case (I cannot stress enough how well crafted the music is).  The four zone bosses are awesome and unique with their own soundtrack that matches their theme.  The difficulty curve is perfect.  Once you start to master a zone, you move to the next zone and are immediately given a healthy dose of humility as the basic enemies brutalize you and it's time to learn brand new enemy patterns all over again.  Because of the diamond upgrade system you don't feel bad for dying and it keeps the items you find in chests less complex until you master them and are ready for shiny new spells/weapons/stuff.  Because the levels are random, they never get boring or predictable.  And here's the real kicker.  Each different character you unlock has a different playstyle which changes how you play the levels completely.  I recently found out that some characters have different remixes of the standard songs too which is amazing.Honestly, I cannot recommend this game enough.  If you enjoy a challange and like dungeon exploration games that require you to think rather than level stats, this game is for you.			"

The music is superb, and if it's not your thing you can use your own music to power the gameplay. I don't even think I have anything I could say needs improving. It supports controllers and even dance pads. There's a slightly less difficult mode meant specifically for playing with dance pads. They already have a character that doesn't need to move in time, turning the game into a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler if you want to get used to the game or want to take a break from the rythm aspects of the game. I mean, they thought of everything and the game is super polished, all that seems to be missing is four characters and the last zone (which I haven't even reached yet). This is seriously a game I wish I had helped made.			"

												I am GoingTo the CryptOF THE NECRODANCER!I did not know what to expect. A Hardcore Rythm based Roguelike? So I watched the trailer and got hooked. Then I got it and I am absolutely amazed.the basic priciple is like a turn based roguelike - when you move the enemies move according to their pattern. You crawl through randomly generated floors, try to find a boss monster, kill it and find the exit to the next floor. But what sets this apart is the rythm component. Because you can only move on a beat of the background music. And every beat makes the enemies move as well.The Pixel art, albeit simple looks amazing. the Music gets you pumped and theres allways something new to discover.the Gameplay and Action itself is tight. As in, you could take it slow, but if you so much as miss a beat, your multiplicator gets reset. Which means less gold and probably less equipment in turn, so you have to keep the rythm, move every beat and make quick decisions. And if the song runs out, the floor is over. the music, Kick ♥♥♥. The way it should be for any rythm based game. But if you dont like it, you can use your own library to fill the floors with life.the geme itself keeps you frustrated enough to make you wanna try again, because every enemy behaves in a certain way and you can train combat against them pretty early on - so if you die its because you got careless.oh, and the shopkeepers voice is divine. Get the Soundtrach edition if you can.10/10[1.0 Update]HO-LY-CRAP! I literally mean, Holy Crap! What they did with this is Divine.I mean before the game was a 10/10 but now. Wow. just Wow.new characters each with their own feel. Bard for easy Mode, other chars for extra challenges (like one that can lay infinite bombs and can kick them a few spaces ahead. Another one can only move in 2 space intervals.The 3 main chars, Aria, Melody and Cadence now have little cutscenes after each Level, Bosses enter with an awesome Intro screen and announcement. the remastered Metal and Electro OST, that will play for Melody and aria are just Eargasmic.If the Early access version was 10/10, this version is a 12/10.I would love to give this two thumbs up, if possible			"

								Been playing roguelikes since... well Rogue and I'm always on the lookout for twists to the genre. By forcing the player to time their next move to the beat, the game not only adds a welcome challenge, but also gives a sense of immersion as everything on the board pulses with the click of the key. I almost felt as though I were orchestrating the entire dungeon's movements as I chose where to go next.The game definitely captures the typical rhythm game's infusion of motion from the screen to the game controller to the player himself. I was tapping away with my foot and humming at times unawares as I got absorbed further into the game. And I'm only about an hour and two zones in at the moment.Which is why calibration is extraordinarily important to this game. While you could manage by with a slight offset in rhythm, the game really benefits from having a tight link to the beat as you progress further and encounter harder enemies. This is especially so when fighting the various level bosses and when you fall into one trap, which teleports you to a special level, in which any mistiming of the beat automatically kills you.Definitely an easy game to pick up immediately and start playing, but also full of challenges along the way to keep you going. Just make sure to calibrate well.			"

												Game is good.Please stop sending me death threats nowYeah okay what do you exect to read here? Everyone is saying this game is good so what can my review bring to the table that is missing from all the glowing praise?I'll tell you.Crypt of the Necrodancer should be hauled up on a pedestal for the whole world (of gaming) to see for one, very simple reason.replays on leaderboard!I could gripe and complain all day but if you play ANY steam game with a leaderboard then their is one thing you will see over and over again and that is hackers and hacked scores.Now I don't hate hackers but when I look at leaderboards I want to know how that person got that score and how I can improve my own gameplay.See, the score itself is the result and while a good result is impressive seeing all the crazy stuff you people get upto is just as good, so if you own this game I urge you to check out some replays.They taught me to blow up the shopkeeper.I wish I had more to say about the game but I would just be mimicking everything that every other review has had to say about the game at this point.Also even when I didn't initially recommend the game, I still stand by the fact that the music is great and the ability to import your own music is also great so that hasn't changed (which is good).If you struggle with the timing system, switch to bard and you can still enjoy the game as a traditional Rogue-Like game. Isn't that neat?I will be watching 'Brace yourself games' very closely because they really went all out in making the game accessible, which is a rarity.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												I picked this up in early access, had a great time and set it aside to see how much better it could get.  Now I've got a rogue-light that's beautifully animated, brutally difficult with a boisterous soundtrack on my hands.  On top of that, Crypt of the Necrodancer has an array of laid back to nail-bitingly hard characters, all sorts of game modes (one of which makes the game easier for players that might want to use an actual dance pad to play, I gotta try that sometime) and even local cooperative play. I can't recommend this game enough.real time action, dictated by the beat of music (except for one character, who causes moves freely)well balanced; if you die and don't know why, you either learned something new or weren't paying attentionthree soundtracks ready to mix'n'matchability to import your own mp3ssteam workshop support, in-game level editor10 unique charactersover a dozen weapon types with different tactical usages, which come in a variety of enchanted variantsloads of items that can have a drastic effect on how you handle situationsa fair host of enemies, each with movement patterns and special variants to keep you on your toes7 bosses to discover and conquer, certain fights vary depending on your distance in-gamefully voiced cutscenes to tell the story of a number of the characterswonderful sprite animation, everybody dances "

												This game seemlessly blends dungeon crawling, rouge-like elements and rhythm-based gameplay together for a very enjoyable experience. If you're a fan o any of these three genres, I highly recomend checking it out! Just be warned, as with most rouge-likes (and rythym games, if you ask me), this game is very difficult. Not a bad thing at all, just know going in that you're in for a challenge.			"

								Initially I had a really negative vibe from this game. I was frustrated because I found the rhythm aspect of the game overwhelmingly difficult, not because it is necessarily, but more likely it’s my lack of ability to time my movements right, and I found it hard to watch the in-game metronome while doing everything else. This is more of a personal problem though, and it doesn’t really reflect on the game.However, I learned that there is another class called bard available from the start of the game. The bard can move freely without the concern of coordinating with the beat, and the monsters move when the player moves; more akin to a traditional roguelike. Playing bard has made the game enjoyable to me, and I look forward to possibly taking on the challenge of playing with the other characters later. The game is well designed, and I’m impressed with the level it’s at for still being in development. The soundtrack is worth noting, it’s really good, and the pixel art is also very nostalgic, and in my opinion, it fits the game perfect. Everything you would expect from a roguelike is there too, but with a spin, and I respect the developers creativity coming up with something so unique. The play style may not be appealing to everyone, but the game will (and should) still be recognised as a good game.Everything considered Crypt of the Necrodancer is a pretty cool game for alpha. I sincerely hope that development continues, and the game is finished. A successful pre-release all to often results in games being abandoned and pretty much just left in their current state.			"

												With 92 hours at the time of this review, I think its finally time I sat down and wrote a good review for this game. This review is going to be in a pro-con format so yah. Review Time! Pros -The story is very well made and interesting, and a good motivator to keep trying to beat the first character (Cadence)-Rhythm and Roguelike mashups that works perfectly-Nice difficulty curve-Lots of variety in runs and characters, so as to not feel repetitive (which it doesn't)-Amazing soundtrack with now 4 different variants (2 of them you can only get through workshop mods)-Every death is your fault, not the games-The gameplay is spot on, with each weapon feeling really fun to play-Local Co-op is very fun to play and is executed well-Amazing community-Practically infinite replayability with all the achievements and things to unlock-Steam Achievements/Steam trading cards-And so much more Neutral -The game is very difficult to get the hang of, considering its very different from other roguelikes (this isn't a bad thing, it's just a thing I thought I'd point out-Some of the characters are pretty difficult (Once again, not a bad thing, just something I thought I would point out.) Cons -Part of the story is unlocked by Aria, who is a VERY difficult character to beat, or even get anywhere with (luckily youtube exists)-Coda-That's it reallyOverall I give this game a 10/10. This game is honestly the best roguelike Ive ever played, with its awesome replayability, cool characters and a very interesting story, and its gameplay is spot onVery much recommend!			"

								There hasn't been a game like this one before, or at least not to my knowledge. There are plenty of games in which the player displays their ability to comprehend music and beat, and there are a fair number of games where the player explores a dungeon, travelling deeper and deeper, growing in strength as their enemies become tougher and tougher, where any misstep will result in a ""game over"" screen and the option to start over from square one. I don't think mixing these kinds of games has ever been done before, and I'm in love with the result!Crypt of the Necrodancer isn't just a groovy music game, nor is it just a dungeon-crawling roguelike - it's both. It's a very demanding game, as it requires quick thinking and decision-making, and throughout the whole experience you will absolutely want to groove in place, getting as deep into those juicy tunes as you can. Play it with a keyboard or a dance mat; you'll have extreme fun no matter which way you play.I have nothing but praise for this game, and it isn't even finished yet. Even when I began playing in advance of the early access hitting steam, I never once felt like my money was misplaced. Even if this game were never finished, it'd still be worth every penny I spent on it.Are you even slightly interested in what this game has to offer? No need to wonder any longer; snag this one and lose yourself in it for a while.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer has very good art direction, an amazing soundtrack and a stunning and innovative new mechanism, which forces you to dance through the dungeon to the beat of the soundtrack.I think the game concept is brilliant and really well executed. The soundtrack is worth buying on its own.However, I did not enjoy the game for much more than an hour.I pretty much have a non-existing feeling for rhythm and as such, the game was quite frustrating for me, as I was not able to make any progress.There is a character available from the start to redemy this, which does not require dancing to the soundtrack, but without it this central mechanism there are many more dungeon crawlers suited for that kind of playstyle.Verdict: Awesome, if you have rhythm, mediocre if you have none!

												Honestly, if you're not already interested by the description ""rhythm dungeon-crawler"" I don't know what else to tell you.I can say every single thing about it stylish as hell, it has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard from any video game in my life, and the two genres blend together shockingly well. It's not a hugely innovative roguelike, you just explore a randomly assembled network of rooms and tunnels full of monsters and gear. And it's not a hugely complex rhythm game either, you just take every step in beat with the music. But putting them together REALLY transforms the experience of both. Having to work out your own ""dance"" to outmaneauver enemies and traps as you come to them makes the rhythm game feel clever and engaging in a way they're usually not. Putting that dance into every little thing makes the busywork of a roguelike feel satisfying and just GOOD in a way I've never felt before.This is one of those mashups that sounds pointless when it's described to you, and after actually trying it, you don't understand why there haven't been games like this since 20 years ago.

								Crypt of the NeroDancer is a very well executed game. The genre is a mix between rhythm and a dungeon crawler in which leaves the game with a new feeling I've never experienced. There is a lot to learn and a lot experience due to the random generation system that it features. The game is another one of those games where you must learn the tricks and rules that the game has laid out for you. Cause of this you feel like it is your fault when you make a mistake, and you will learn from them constantly. Crypt of the NecroDancer features one of the best OSTs I have ever heard, the rhythm and styles of the songs are varied (Note you can also add your own music. This system works quite well I found and it picks up the beat well.) . There are many unlocks (Items, spells, character upgrades, etc.) for it being in an early stage such as it is. This allows for variety in the way you dance your way through dungeons. This game also features unlockable characters that have their own gimmicks which change gameplay. I personally found myself playing as the main protagonist the most, but it is nice to have the option. Another feature in which I like is the ability to face against different mobs and bosses in a controlled environment. This will allow you to learn their patterns and figure out what works best against them. Recently added is the level editor in which allows a player to construct massive complex dungeons. Either that or try out different weapons and scenarios. Overall Crypt of the NecroDancer is a fantastic game in which will more than likely produce more than enough fun and frustration. I'd give this game a 9/10			"

								I can't get over how good the music is in this game. The gameplay itself is really simple, but incredibly difficult to get the hang of though. You need to constantly have a sense of rythmn to bop and tap along to. Once you understand what to do, its then time to worry about the endless items, chess games, conga lines, seemingly unkillable dragons, creepy- yet weirdly funky skellingtons, fake chests, fake walls, hot coals of death, combo-braking ice, rip-off shopkeeper, secret rooms, poisonous mushrooms and massive annoying trolls. Then theres the different playstyles of each character that you can play. Then there's the permadeath hardcore mode to try and master where you have to do all zones and conga-line bosses (God I hate the conga lines), or chessboard bosses in one run.Overall a neat little game worth getting.

												Steam is full of many indie greats. Brilliant, inventively crafted games that spring out of nowhere, and create gameplay formulas so well refined they earn themselves a place within the halls of all the greatest classic.Whether its the addictive simplicity of One Finger Death Punch, the relaxing, almost zen like experience of playingE uro Truck simulator, or the stylish assassinating that makes Mark of the Ninja so great, there are countless titles on this services whose quality is very difficult dispute.Crypt of the Necrodancer is one of those games.The game hits you right from the get go with its gorgeously bright pixel art, which serve far more purpose than simply creating being a retro aesthetic.The sharp, bright visuals bring the levels to life in a way that serves the gameplay perfectly, the vibrantly animated enemies movement (and dancing) to the beat in beautiful detailed fashion. The distinctively detailed enemy sprites don't just look great  - they serve to help you plan your attacks, always allowing you to quickly figure out what is going on, even when the hectic beat of the game's brilliant music threatens to eclipse your hand eye coordination.The bosses especially are a treat, but I don't want to spoil those here. You'll just have to buy the game and discover what they are like for yourself!Don't be at all surprise if you lose track of time playing this game. Progress is undeniably challenging but it has the ""one more go"" feeling down to perfection. The more you play, the more you learn the important strategies needed to beat the dozens of different enemies you encounter, the best items to help you progress, and the endless number of secrets. Then you unlock a new character, and the cycle beings all over again.There is nothing else like this game on the market, and there may never be again. On the surface it is like many rogue-likes, challenging and requiring plenty of time, patient and skill on your behalf, but its rhythmic beat is an addiction that completely changes the way you explore, the way you fight, and the way you win. If you have no sense of rhythm, this is not the game for you.This game deserves you attention.Did I mention Crypt of the Necrodancer's music is amazing? I did? Well, I'm telling you again. The music is amazing. The game is worth it for the music alone.			"

												My first serious review.  This game has changed my opinion so much from the first time I played it I wanted to write this incase I can convince at least one other person who may have had similiar feelings as me when I first played it.I tried playing this game a few times as Cadence when I first got it.It was somewhat fun, although not enough to keep my attention.Then I tried playing as the Bard.  It was fun not having to worry about the beat of music, and instead just learning enemy movement and attack patterns.When you play as the Bard the whole game becomes turn-based.  Each move you make causes the enemies to do one movement.A solid rogue-like.  You basically play over and over until you get familiar with all the enemies, each time you feel yourself getting better and better at this game.I was in zone 2.  Just doing another run, when it hit me.  Even as the Bard I found myself moving to the beat of the music.  I was using my shovel to dig through dirt which added its own sound to the music playing.  I was realizing that some of the movements I was making when fighting a particular enemy was almost like doing dance moves.It hit me.  This game is freaking genius.  Playing through a few times as the Bard is almost a necessity and I wish the game developers would have somehow made it more obvious that this should be a first step.Binding of Isaac used to be my favorite Rogue-Like, now I can say without a doubt this is my new favorite.

												A music game and a unforgiving dungeon crawler with heavy roguelike elements, all in one game. And it's not just a dungeon crawler with music game elements, or a music game with a dungeon crawl attached, it's a near seamless hybrid of both in a way that I never could have thought would work. But it does, so very well.A soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky means it's going to be good, and the tunes go well with the rapid, split-second pace you need to keep in order to stay ahead of the game. I'm not sure if it's extremely difficult or I just plain suck, but I still have yet to get overly far in it and consistently blunder into enemies as I try to stay on time to the beat so as not to lose my combo. It's embarrassing, really. But my own suckitude aside, this is a game that's just so much fun, especially once you start getting into the zone and responding to things before your brain can really process them. It strangely reminds me of Hotline Miami in that sense, but with less ultraviolence and more dancing skeletons. It is also now out of early access, and features a whole campaign, tons of unlockables and player characters with different playstyles, and daily challenges to keep you coming back. I must have rage quit this game a dozen times already but I keep wanting more, and it probably has something to do with those infectious beats. Nothing else is like it, and nothing else could do what it does as well as it does.			"

								You'd never have considered that rhythm games and dungeon crawling go together, but this game makes it work.First off: this isn't a very serious dungeon crawler.  Most levels are small-ish and relatively uninteresting, with just a few rooms full of monsters linked together by various corridors.What makes this work though is that the game is half real time, half turn based.  Based on the music playing for the level, each beat of the music is one turn, and enemies have a fairly mixed movement pattern based on the turns (e.g. one moves towards you every other turn, one moves in 4 directions each turn randomly, etc.).  This means that enemies move whether you move or not, but if you have the rhythm, you can anticipate where they will be and outsmart them.On the easy levels, this is fairly straightforward.  As enemies progress and become more complicated, you also need to develop more complicated patterns, but what you will actually do depends on the minor variations in the level.  This means that unlike other rhythm games, you can't just memorize a button sequence for a particular song.  Instead, it is constantly changing.The soundtrack is top notch, and design is pretty good.  There are plenty interesting enemies, weapons, accessories, spells, traps, etc. that make each replay sufficiently different to be fun.Early Access note:  As of this writing, the game is In EA.  It has 3 zones (12 levels) and 5 characters ready to play, with a planned final zone and another 5 characters.  However, the current maps are plenty playable, plenty fun, and not buggy at all.			"

								Crypt of the Necrodancer is a game with admirable paicing, even allowing players to choose their own pace with differing characters and custom music. Whilst still W.I.P. I have not noticed a single bug so far, that or my sense of immersion to the actual game in terms of the music and the battling of monsters is just that great that I miss those bugs. Either way, the game is looking great, players new to this game will quickly get punished by the games relentless dedication to movement/rythm based fighting, often meaning that anyone who jumps in unprepared will end up dying a lot.What does this say about the game? Maybe for the common, run of the mill gamer it might mean frustrating and unpreventable deaths. But to the dedicated gamer, those who use tutorials or at least have played a rythm game of some kind can grasp that everything requires key timing and a suprisingly large amount of strategy.Do I reccomend this game? Yes. As of this moment its £10.99 ($17.94, €13.85), if you have the money, I fully reccomend buying and trying this game to anyone who is interested in it. More importantly I reccomend it as a backing to this genre of gaming as it is not often you see Rythm based games being produced. I know right now that more and more companies are making music based rythm games, but there needs to be a larger supply of them. With the people who made this game I do hope they make more like this as this genre is genrally underated, undersold and the variety of game titles is just too small.			"

												A great combination of a roguelike and a rhythm game. It borrows elements from games like Speluny and Binding of Isaac - permanent item/character unlocks, a daily challenge, and of course random level generation and permadeath. The rhythm aspect makes it unique - unlike most rhythm games, you don't have to hit a particular button at a particular time, but there is a lot of strategy in getting the timing right to kill enemies and avoid damage - strategy which is enriched by the variety of enemy move/attack patterns and a number of items that affect your own movement and attack. It's all about planning ahead, and thinking fast so you don't lose the beat.			"

												I bought this game on sale and figured I'd get around to playing it eventually. Later that day, I sat down to play a different game, but decided to start Crypt of the NecroDancer up just to check it out.The next thing I knew, two hours had passed and it was time to get ready to leave to go to my in-laws for Christmas. I grabbed my laptop and installed it real quick so I could play it while I was out of town (the system requirements are really low, so it ran just fine).It might be one of the most addictive games I've ever played. I don't know how many times I've told myself, ""Just one more round,"" only to spend another hour with it.It's also very challenging in a Dark Souls kind of way. If you die, it's probably your fault. Instead of becoming frustrated, I only felt encouraged to try again and pay more attention to the movement patters of the enemies.Also, the soundtrack is fantastic. So many of the songs get stuck in my head, which just makes me want to play it more.It's my game of the year for 2015, hands down.			"

												That's just great. It's like playing a 2D Zelda game in a dance club. You're dancing, the monsters are dancing and the shopkeeper is just too good of a singer to let you pass near his shop and not letting you hear his beautiful tenor voice.Learn the rythm of every lvl and the patterns of every monster to truly master this well-thought process of the game, where rythm is everything.Warning : as it is a rogue-like, it's not the kind of game you get to do or get easily. You must first fail to improve your skills as well as the items you'll unlock throughout your runs. Not to be played by the easily frustrated ones.Warning : this game is so much fun and the music is soooo good you'll wanna play even though you're so bad at it.			"

								Do not be deterred by the ""Early Access"" status. This game is currently playable to the extent of addiction. The soundtrack in this dungeon crawler turned rhythm game will have you wanting to dance dance dance--an effect the devs had the foresight to accomodate for with ""DancePad mode,"" a mode specifically designed for USB dancepads (you can play in all other modes using the dancepads; it is just much more challenging because there are more enemies and less powerups from gamestart).

								Driven mad by music.Their twisted souls, bound to the beat!Deliver beatdowns to the beat!I love Dungeons of Dredmor, The Binding of Isaac, etc. The Crypt of the NecroDancer is unique in the way that it adds the 'beat' element to it. Moving to the music as you play with every monster having a specific moveset they dance to themselves. This means you don't really have time to strategize your moves and just have to dance along with it!Sweet as heck.			"

Crypt of the NecroDancer is IncredibleI got this game expecting to have a few hours of fun and then get bored. 20 hours of play time later, this is still not the case.This game is almost therapeutic to me. I have a lot of anxiety issues, and this game is such a great way to get my mind off of things. Just go with the flow and listen to some great music by Danny Baranowsky.Also, the customizability in this game is great. I do a lot of sprite work, so I've already sprited one of my original characters into the game. You can add your own music as well, but I have not explored this feature yet, so I cannot vouch for it.This game is also a great way to get some fun exercise if you have a dance pad. I bought a dance pad just to use it with this game.Even though this game is still in Alpha, I cannot recommend Crypt of the NecroDancer enough. The art style is great, the music is by Danny B so it's amazing by default, and it is fun to play. Get this game. Throw your money at this game. If you like rougelike games and have a good sense of rhythm, you will not regret your purchase.			"

												Picked up on sale.  Another rogue-like game to enjoy.  The idea of movement based on the beat makes this game require some quick thinking.  This, like most rogue-likes the random drop can make or break players like me.  I found myself replaying levels all the time and hoping for certain drops.  Once you unlock some of the characters it allows you a little more freedom to play.  I took the bard out to solve all levels to get an idea of what I was getting into before I started to attempt with the main character.  Fun game for sure and pretty cool when you start to add your own songs into each of the levels.

I love randomly-generated dungeoncrawlers. But there have always been something missing. Yes, the difficult combat, the constantly changing experience, making strategies against specialized enemies, those are all great, but there have always been something missing. Now I know what that is.Good God, that is dancing. W-wouldn't Recettear have been even better if you had to dancefight? Dungeons of Dredmor? Chocobo's Dungeon? Nethack?

tl;dr -> Played this game, now I can't help but bob my head and bounce on my feet whenever I'm walking and hear an EDM beat. 11/10 disco dungeon dance-off simulator.NOTE: You can read my full review here[theroguereviews.com]I was fortunate enough to receive this as my first-ever review copy (yay!). Very, very excited to try this game because I adore the rogue-like genre and enjoy beatmatching when I mix my electronic dance music (EDM) at home. Crypt hit on many of the themes and concepts that I’ve always loved, and I thoroughly enjoyed my gameplay experience. This is easily one of the best staples available in the rogue-like genre.If you like rogue-likes, rhythm mechanics, dungeon crawling, electronic music (Danny Baranowsky’s score), and constantly unlocking new things, then you will really love this game.The aesthetics are great – the amount of detail in the different levels and characters is well-done. The retro, pixel graphics combine with the electronic musical score to provide a very fun, fast-paced experience reminiscent of old-school arcade games (including the high difficulty that usually accompanied them). Danny Baranowsky’s music is critical to the gameplay – since you have to time your movements with the beat – and fits well with the heavy rogue-like elements found in the game. If you are partial to electronic music, then you will enjoy the great soundtrack. If you don’t, however, like EDM and/or Danny’s style, then you can always use your own music (MP3 format). There is a unique track for each level, and you have the option of loading your own playlist for each level. Note, I have a very wide taste in music, so I tried an assortment of genres – EDM tracks work very well with the rhythm mechanics (because of the consistent beats per minute), but Ariana Grande (I love her) songs DO NOT work very well. That being said, Danny’s composition is fantastic, and I don’t mind replaying levels over and over again, listening to the same tracks every time. Another advantage of using EDM tracks in a custom playlist is the length – the levels end in line with the track playing, so EDM’s lengthier (on average) playtime gives you more opportunity to explore the floor. The story involves you falling into a dungeon, your heart being magically tied to an ominous beat that you must dance to.The controls are fairly easy to learn – a tutorial is offered that teaches you the basics of gameplay. I personally prefer using a controller over the keyboard, and I suggest you use that instead. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with rogue-likes and/or rhythm games. Before you start playing, you will have to do a latency test for visual (the heartbeats and beat prompts) and auditory (the actual beat) cues; you can redo the test whenever you want. There is an “easy” mode that you can play, however, I sincerely think you will find a fair challenge playing the regular difficulty. Also, if you want a break from the beatmatching, you can play as a character (Bard) who does not have to move in time with the beat.Difficulty is something this game does very well, especially for a rogue-like. Characters you unlock will usually have harder playing conditions (ex: cannot kill enemies, die when you pick up gold), ramping up the challenge factor. To combat this, you can unlock a character/room that allows you to practice against the different enemies you may encounter – this allows you to recognize their movement/attack patterns and how to best deal with them. A character/room also exists that allows you to train against mini- and regular bosses. I highly recommend you at least check these out once you have them available, especially if you are having difficulty progressing through the levels. There is even a room that provides levels where you can learn advanced tactics, like how to kill the shopkeeper in different ways. I appreciate this approach to difficulty because it provides you with the tools to improve your playstyle, should you so choose.Gameplay involves you moving around a grid-based dungeon floor, most times in synchrony with the beat (unless you are playing as the Bard). Monsters on the floor also move in time with the beat, and they attack based on a chess/checkers-style pattern – if you move onto a tile that a monster was about to move to, you will take damage. Also, if you move into the attack range (varies based on the monster) of a monster, you will take damage if it is ready to attack – they usually have an animation cue (ex: skeletons raise their arms) to let you know an attack is incoming. To take advantage of monster movements (all units have to move each beat, or “turn.”), you can do things like backtrack or hit a wall (which will keep you on the same tile). As you progress through the level, monsters will drop gold. To increase the amount of gold dropped, you will have to build up your gold multiplier by hitting all track beats (when you move/attack) within a small window. Every time you miss a beat or take damage, your multiplier will decrease by an increment. Picking up armor will decrease how much damage you take, but will not affect your multiplier. Gold is used to purchase items from the large variety of stores available. Multipliers are especially effective when paired with multiplier-based equipment (ex: damage dealt is based on your current multiplier).Overall, the game is an immense amount of fun and always a fair, interesting challenge.If you are any bit interested in the rogue-like series or rhythm gameplay, then I implore you to give this game a try. It definitely is one of the best rogue-like titles available today.ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] "

												Last time I wrote a review for this game it was in its early access, alpha 0.44 stage, and now, after its full release, the game just keeps getting better and better.Every time I stop playing I can hear the catchy music playing in my head, especially Melody's (one of the main protagonists) themes.  This music is pure gold, no matter which track I listen to.The levels are procedurally generated, and so are the enemies that go along with them, making game play change each time you load up and play.The large assortment of items and upgrades you can purchase in the game's lobby (for diamonds you find on each level run) is large and diverse, with many different rings, weapons, spells, health upgrades, etc. at your disposal.The player and enemy movement design is flawless, and whenever you start battling you begin this ""dance of death"" with whatever you're fighting. And when you die, and believe me you will (And if you're like me it will be a lot), it was never some random event that happened out of nowhere that killed you, as some rogue-likes are based around, this one is your own mistakes being your downfall, which means less luck is involved and the game is more skill-based, which I truly enjoy.Everything can be defeated with the stock dagger, without armour and without any fancy magic tricks, they're all just luxuries that make fighting your way through the darkest areas of the Crypt simpler.In short, Crypt of the NecroDancer is one of the best indie-games I have ever come across, with its blend of both musical masterpieces and enthralling game play, this is one of my top choices for games focusing around rhythm.Also, the Shopkeeper Sings.

Early Access Review
Unexpectedly Brilliant!I had been browsing Steam for at least an hour, looking for something that might hold my interest for more than a few minutes. By the time this game turned up, I was not very hopeful. The gloomy title conjured up images of a tedious slog through yet another Tolkein knock-off world. The screenshots reminded me of a hundred junk titles that bill themselves as ""retro"" and ""8-bit"" to lure long-time gamers into parting with their money in a quest to recapture good memories from their childhood. The description, touting the unlikely fusion of roguelike and rhythm genres, left me almost certain that this was nothing more than a concept gimmick that would fail to meet even the lowest of expectations.I could not have been more wrong.Crypt of the NecroDancer is the most inspired, refreshing contribution to gaming that I have encountered in years. This game blends the simplest and most predictable mechanics with enough variety to be challenging and so much creativity that even casual players will have a whole lot of goofy fun. I've played countless times over the past few weeks, died in most of them, and found myself smiling anyway, because it was almost always my own fault rather than the result of an impossible situation or bad user interface, and because it's easy to jump right back in.Each creature has a specific pattern of movement with consistent restrictions, and is easily identifiable on sight, so you can usually predict what it will do next. It will always move on the beat of the music. Press one of the four direction buttons, and you'll move, interact with an obstacle, or attack an enemy in that direction. Do it on the beat, or you'll be sorry. Use items from your inventory by pressing two buttons at once. Following these rules, you'll find yourself learning the patterns of movement (or dances) required to subdue each monster and make your way deeper into the dungeon.On top of that solid foundation sits a cast of unique bosses, playable characters with different abilities, unlockable upgrades, training areas, cooperative mode, instant replays, a level editor, gamepad and dance mat support, cross-platform compatibility, a surprisingly good chiptune-style soundtrack, and the ability to import whatever music your dungeon-crawling heart desires.And it's still only an alpha.Outstanding work, Brace Yourself Games. You shattered the preconceptions of this linux-using nethack fan. Now take my money.			"

								A dungeon crawler with a musical twist! A unique game that combines dungeon crawling with music rhythm gaming. The player moves the character with the beat of the music and the same goes for attacking as well. Monsters have their own unique move sets so it is important to take note of the attacking pattern of each monster. All in all a very novel game idea and fun to boot.			"

												Fun, original, and imaginative take on the Gauntlet-styled dungeon-crawler. As you can guess from the trailers (and title), NecroDancer is a brilliant twist on the ""keep-the-beat"" music games such as Guitar Hero, Elite Beat, and Dance Dance. The graphics are nice and clean. Enemies are well-designed. Levels are procedurally generated ala Diablo, but are small enough that you don't ever feel frustrated or lost. The game has a very gradual difficulty curve that starts out easy but can become quite challenging. There are many different characters to unlock with their own playstyles and challenges, including a class that doesn't even have to keep the beat at all, for those of you who would like to just play at your own tempo (or have a poor sense of musical timing.)The highlight of the game is of course the absolutely fantastic soundtrack, but even if you're not a fan of the music itself, you can just set up your own playlist and play along with whatever music you like.I very strongly recommend this game at any price point!

												Crypt of the NecroDancer has ruined my life. I hear its catchy tunes in my head while I eat. I tap out the rhythm of dungeons in my car. And my children keep asking me what that funky song I'm humming all the time is. I can't stop thinking about this game, despite the fact it is deceptively hard and I may never actually get past Zone 3. So let me tell you why you should suffer the same fate.In classic roguelike tradition, Crypt is an adventure through randomly-generated dungeons with randomly-generated loot to find and use on randomly-generated monsters. It's all laid out in a pleasing grid of pixel art, controlled solely with the arrow keys. Special items are used by pressing two directions at once, and attacks are as simple as pushing towards an enemy in range. Unlike other roguelikes, there's no random element to attacks. Everything has a set number of hearts, and if you hit it (or it hits you), you take the prescribed amount of damage. Monsters have set patterns to their attacks, meaning there are really no surprises to combat.The catch here is that everything is set to the music, and you have to move on the beat. Enemies won't wait for your turn, either, because they're jamming to the same rhythm. Miss a beat and you effectively lose your turn. Suddenly this otherwise simple, predictable game becomes one of concentration and quick thinking. You need to be moving or attacking with every beat, and if you're focusing on keeping cadence, you're not focusing on strategy. Fortunately the game is desgined with this in mind, offering a robust tutorial, multiple practice modes, and even a second character unlocked from the start that can ignore the beat. There are four zones to conquer, each three levels and a boss. Beating the previous one unlocks the next, allowing you to skip ahead. You can also collect diamonds to purchase upgrades and new items to add to the random pool.There's a terrible secret behind this welcoming facade, though. All of this is essentially an elaborate, extended tutorial for All Zones mode, which challenges you to beat all four zones in order, starting with the full item pool unlocked but no upgrades to your character. This is the proper roguelike mode for the game, and it is incredibly difficult to get through. Missed beats and damaging mistakes mount up fast enough to make beating individual zones a challenge, and starting essentially from scratch means your strategies have to be second nature. Unless the rhythm is in your blood, mastering Crypt is going to take a lot of time and a lot of practice.Don't let that dissuade you from trying the game, of course. There's plenty to see and do even if you never touch All Zones mode. The many characters to unlock play like entirely different games, and you can access quite a few just by playing the individual zones. As expected from a rhythm-based game, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and is sure to get permanently stuck in your head. Even if you keep getting mauled by mambo'ing skeletons, you're sure to come back for more. I really may never get past Zone 3 but I'm having too much fun to stop now.			"

												This game is pretty fun for a while, until the novelty fades. But as some others have pointed out, it's not just really difficult, it's just flat out unfair at times. After countless deaths, and getting nowhere with certain characters (which you need to finish the game with to unlock others) such as the Monk that DIES when he touches gold, the game just becomes a frustration and it's obvious the insane difficulty is being used to pad the game which has quite a lack of content. There are only four levels (with four stages each) and if you are able to complete the game you can do so in about 30 minutes or less. Now, I could understand the Monk being harmed for touching gold, but dying just for touching it seems a bit ridiculous to me. Then there's Eli, who can kick bombs (of which he has an infinite supply). Sound badass? He's not. That's his only weapon and when you come across the enemies that push you around the map it's almost impossible to kill them without hurting yourself first. To make matters worse, instead of having several completely different sounding songs to play on each level, there are only a few (you need to turn them on by yourself) that are more like remixes. You have the option to add your own music to the game, but no random option for that. This has apparently been in the works for 2 years. Unless you have a lot of patience to lose over and over, playing for hours and accomplishing nothing, I wouldn't recommend this game. Once again, it was fun for a while, but I think I will quit before I break another keyboard.			"

 The ingenious combo of a dungeon crawler and rhythm game. GAMEPLAYIt's a dungeon crawler rhythm game. Your movements are timed to the beat of the song, and you can't just spam movements all the time. It's simple, but is executed so well and so satisfyingly that it's become my favorite dungeon crawler (which isn't saying much as i've only played 2 at the time of this review and only have 9 hours in the other one) Since everything is timed to the beat, you're retreating with the beat. You're killing to the beat. You're flanking to the beat. You are living with the beat. This makes the game incredibly satisfying to play.Enemies play by their own rules also on the beat, which becomes incredibly complicated in the later zones where the screen gets cluttered frequently, with enemies that play by their own rules, or the same rules on different beats. Enemies can in later zones also potentially move diagonally, something you can't do, and even through walls, which never felt fair when you die to those things.There are different character types, all of whom have different styles of play. Some may be incredibly satisfying and fun, others will leave you begging for mercy and crying face down on your keyboard. A very good replay value.SOUNDTRACKKick ♥♥♥. You get 3 different soundtracksDannyB-The creator of the game's original soundtrackA_Rival-The creator of the game's EDM soundtrackFamilyJules7X-The creator of the game's metal soundtrack.As well as custom .mp3 support, which is incredibly satisfying and adds even more replay value. Problem is, the beat detection can be a little off for songs with a large amount going on or different pacings (I'm looking at you, PAYDAY 2 songs)OTHERMod support, as well as a very simple to modify game.CONCLUSIONI was never a really big fan of dungeon crawlers. I always felt that, while they each did their own thing, they were pretty much the same thing in general and gameplay-wise. Crypt of the necrodancer is not ""pretty much the same thing in general and gameplay-wise."" It's a game that takes roots from rhythm games and dungeon crawler games to create it's own thing which is a very satisfying and fun to play game.			"

Early Access Review
								I love games that make sense of old gaming tropes and conventions; in this case, how about the old idea that enemies in roguelikes only move when you do? The answer is, they're just moving to a beat, same as you!This idea has serious gameplay implications as well. Roguelikes were always about positioning and strategy, but let you take as much time as you wanted in between turns. The rhythm nature of this game melds it into an action game with the best of tile turn-based. Fighting enemies is an absolute joy: every time you walk into a room you have to think fast, what enemy do I prioritize and how do I position myself to attack them while keeping myself out of harm from other enemies. There are a few mechanics that really help facilitate this; for one, the control scheme is exclusively arrow keys or WASD, which means that attacking is done by pressing in the direction of an enemy, overriding a movement in that direction. This can play to your advantage or disadvantage depending on your weapon and circumstance, which just increases the layers of things to think about. It also means you can play the game on a dance pad if you want to, with no compromises. The one downside is that using subitems like consumables and spells is done by pressing combinations of those direction keys, which doesn't really feel great and you'll often forget which thing is bound to which button combo. It can screw you up in a frantic moment.The other element really strengthens the rhythm game connection: a multiplier. If you can keep landing enemy kills without straying off beat, you'll earn a coin multiplier, which is cool because coins serves as both currency and as points or high score. What makes it interesting is you lose the multiplier for using a wait command essentially, which means you have to constantly keep moving. This not only changes the tone of the game, but it makes approaching enemies interesting too, as you'll have to find another way to stay in the same spot without losing the multiplier.Then you have different items and weapon types, and what's great is that even though the very basic ""attack up"" weapons will change how you fight enemies, there are a lot of different types that change properties and completely change how you approach combat.Another big mechanic is that each floor is timed, and you'll be sent to the next when time runs out. This is probably an improvement over other roguelikes that give you as much time as you want; at the same time, it along with the multiplier makes the game feel really frantic. While it's a cool feeling you don't really have the chance to learn what an enemy's all about in the middle of a run, you'll have to utilize the in-game beastmaster mode to learn enemy strategies. Same goes with items, you won't have a lot of time to experiment like in something like Binding of Isaac, which makes learning new items with no descriptions even more difficult than in that game. At the same time, it's better than just giving it away with a description.I guess the other big thing is that because you can't move freely, because you are forced to move at the pace the game dictates, the game doesn't give you the same sense of control as something like Binding of Isaac, at least not initially. Initially you'll be a little frustrated that you can't move at your own pace in the lobby, and even when you're having an OP run you're still at the whim of the game's pacing. This feeling diminishes over time; eventually as you master each of the beats you'll get that control you were looking for, it just takes awhile.The game has a really smart progression system early on; basically it splits each of the zones of a full length run into its own adventure, and gives you incentives to play and learn them with the diamond system which gives you permanent upgrades to your character, or new secrets in the runs. It's a really good way to learn the game but the meat and potatoes is still hardcore mode, which takes away all of those permanent upgrades and plays like a true roguelike. My problem right now is that after beating hardcore mode and unlocking the other characters there's very little incentive to continue; the new characters represent a significant jump in difficulty, and while I could dive back into each individual zone with the characters to train there's no in-game unlockables or achievements to be earned right now. I feel kind of done with it until Zone 4 rolls out.It's also not as replayable as something like Binding of Isaac, most of the nuances in the gameplay have to do with combat. There's not as much detail optimization as BoI, aside from a few things like how to find hidden passages without a torch and what to do with excess bombs.The game is ridiculously fully featured for an early access game by the way, with multiple characters, dance pad mode, daily challenge, seeded runs, custom music, and even a co-op mode which is a ton of fun.Oh and the soundtrack is what I play videogames for, I <3 Danny B.tl;dr Combat nuances and music make this game well worth buying in its current state, only problems I have with it right now are lack of progression after unlocking all the characters, less replayability than other roguelikes, and the difficulty with learning new things and feeling in control early on.

												This game is fairly hard a first to get going. Just remember you want the diamonds to buy from the Dungeon master who gives permanent upgrades. You want long distance weapons over more powerful weapons that aren't. So a long sword is better than a wide sword and the spear is a fantastic weapon. The enemies all move in patterns learn the patterns beat the game. Now this game is absolutely great. The replay value is through the roof and the dificoulty progression is very good. And it's great for a quick game here and there. Just learn the pattern by playing the bard first (all the way through).			"

												Very fun, unique concept. Don't bother using your own music, it doesn't add as much as you think its going to. Hits a definite difficulty wall near the end of the game, and its local multiplayer, while fun, is difficult given the unforgiving nature of the game.Recommended because its a really fun and unique roguelike, but don't expect to play more than the ~20 hours its going to take to be done with it. Frustrating at times, but in a good way. If these are the types of games you like its 100% worth it, but if you are new to the genre check out some of the more classic examples first.			"

Every enemy has a pattern that can be learned and exploited. You almost always die in this game because you weren't good enough, not because the game cheated you.

								With only three hours in this game, it's already my third favorite indie game of all time (behind Bastion and To the Moon). An extremely difficult permadeath game, Crypt Of The Necrodancer is one of the few difficult games I have that manages to be difficult, but not ragequit material. Every death feels fair- you died because you have something else to learn about that enemy, or you weren't prepared enough. It's rather frustrating for a little after you're thrown into a new zone to relearn different strategies for the new monsters, but the moment you manage to finally figure out what to do it's a wave of power unlike anything. And then you die to another monster and try again- but you don't care because now you're one step closer. The music is fantastic (though the shopkeeper's voice is slightly annoying) and moving to it becomes very simple because of how well written the music is. I haven't tried with custom music yet, but I'm looking forward to it and continuing to play the game.			"

												I love old style game. I don't know why. I just love that retro old foggy feel to a game. I also love games that push me and challenge me. Almost all games today are designed to be beaten by the youngest of players. But this game really pushed me into my younger arcade gaming days. I love the layout, the feel and the vibe. The soundtrack litterally kicks butt! And it makes the gameplay more intense. Each level and character brings a new challenge and makes me want to push myself. Also a little touch on the co-op. It's fun, and can make the already challenging atmosphere into a greater mountain to climb. So if your looking for a challenge as a gamer and a little homage to the old days then this is the right game for you!			"

								Holy hell this is addicting!Now if you want a new AudioSurf... this is not it. The custom music is a little difficult to delve into, and while it does work, it seems to have a little trouble with tempo changes; you may want to stick to fairly consistent (and definitely pulsing, driving) songs if you use it. Bear in mind that at the time of this review, this is in alpha, and they may well improve the beat recognition.That critique aside, this game is wonderful so far. It offers loads of charm, and actually does a shockingly good job of merging roguelike and rhythm games in a way that makes it feel very much like a quick-paced puzzle game. I highly recommend it to fans of any of those game types and look forward to continued updates!			"

								This is hands down one of the best examples of why Early Access should be a thing. Amongst the piles of early access games that are slow to update, have uncommunicative developers, and don't strives for self-improvement, Crypt of the NecroDancer continues to add more content and build upon itself.And it is ALREADY worth its price.A clever blend of rhythm game and rogue-like, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a fun challenge that urges your every move to be carefully thought out and chosen...in the length of a beat. The music is incredibly catchy, the bosses and characters are charming, the design is delightfully elegant, and the different playstyles made available always keep things fresh. And there's still more characters, zones, and content to come!I've yet to try out the importing of custom music, nor have I used the custom level editor to its fullest potential. But I honestly can't say I'm missing out; I'm still addicted to the game's levels as they are!Do yourself a favor. Buy it. Support the developers.

								Highly recommended.Plays like a full release - though content is still being added and refined all the time.Terribly fun, and perhaps addicting. Don't loose the beat. You have very limtied health, and really the game is not very forgiving. You get hit, and it's a serious thing. Best part is that you have only yourself to blame. Except for red bats. Screw red bats. If you can get someone for local co-op, that's quite fun as well.Since the levels are procedural, and you never really get good enough that you never die, and you can even play your own songs (thought theirs are really good anyway), the games has tons of playability and hours in it. Another good thing is that it doesn't take long to play. It's not like an rpg or something where you'll waste away playing it. 3 minutes of this game feels like 30 minutes of most other games. So sure, you won't waste time playing it, but you also won't waste time playing it.			"

The game has a great range of pickups, gameplay options, different playable characters, etc.  It just feels so well made.Necrodancer has a brilliant soundtrack by Danny Baronowsky, who also did the music for Super Meat Boy.  I'll buy any game with his name on it, no questions asked!  (and the soundtrack too)They've made the game cross-platform for Linux / Mac / Windows.  I do 99% of my gaming on Linux and I really appreciate the Linux support.You can play with keyboard or a controller, or real dance pads.  I've ordered a pair of dance pads to play it the hard way.  I might even get fit.  There's a two-player co-op option, so I can play with my wife or kids and use both the pads.  The game is challenging enough with plenty of variety to keep me playing while I lose some weight necrodancing like a fool!Although this is an early access game, it already has more options and features than most ""full release"" games:  training halls to practice battling different monsters and bosses (if you can pay the entry fee!), a huge variety of pickups and upgrades, hardcode mode, local co-op, daily challenge...  I don't recall another game with so many great options.  The procedural generation gives a great variety of levels, on a par with Spelunky.In short, buy this game already!			"

And then you die to another monster and try again- but you don't care because now you're one step closer. The music is fantastic (though the shopkeeper's voice is slightly annoying) and moving to it becomes very simple because of how well written the music is. I haven't tried with custom music yet, but I'm looking forward to it and continuing to play the game.			"

												I love old style game. I don't know why. I just love that retro old foggy feel to a game. I also love games that push me and challenge me. Almost all games today are designed to be beaten by the youngest of players. But this game really pushed me into my younger arcade gaming days. I love the layout, the feel and the vibe. The soundtrack litterally kicks butt! And it makes the gameplay more intense. Each level and character brings a new challenge and makes me want to push myself. Also a little touch on the co-op. It's fun, and can make the already challenging atmosphere into a greater mountain to climb. So if your looking for a challenge as a gamer and a little homage to the old days then this is the right game for you!			"

Early Access Review
								This is hands down one of the best examples of why Early Access should be a thing. Amongst the piles of early access games that are slow to update, have uncommunicative developers, and don't strives for self-improvement, Crypt of the NecroDancer continues to add more content and build upon itself.And it is ALREADY worth its price.A clever blend of rhythm game and rogue-like, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a fun challenge that urges your every move to be carefully thought out and chosen...in the length of a beat. The music is incredibly catchy, the bosses and characters are charming, the design is delightfully elegant, and the different playstyles made available always keep things fresh. And there's still more characters, zones, and content to come!I've yet to try out the importing of custom music, nor have I used the custom level editor to its fullest potential. But I honestly can't say I'm missing out; I'm still addicted to the game's levels as they are!Do yourself a favor. Buy it. Support the developers. And bide your time until you can confront the NecroDancer in a lethal tango.			"

								What a phenomenal game, I just played it for 40 minutes as of writing this review and I am addicted, I can hear the beat in my ear and it won't go away, GOD HELP MECrypt of the NecroDancer is a must get for any roguelikes fan, if you are not a fan of rougelikes then it depends, but you still gotta try it if the price allows, it is a standard roguelike that follows a gradual upgrade system, you get to slowly expand your library of items by purhasing item upgrades and also permanent hp upgrades and whatnot, what makes this SO special is the twist of music, basically its a game with aweosme music playing in the background and you are required to play by the beat of the music, with every beat you get to perform one action, move, attack, move, attack,move,move,move,move,attack all following the beat of the music,with each enemy having a unique moving pattern, shops and whatnot, this game is beautiful in its very unique and brilliant way, as of right now it is still in early access but it has every right to be full released because right now its just slowly being updated with new stuffs, the gameplay is already 10/10 solid			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is an amazing take on the Dungeon Crawler genre while also putting in a spice of rhythm making the game enjoyable and better to listen to. Every rhythm game needs a decent soundtrack to succeed. Not only did Danny B. (Also known for his music in BoI and Super Meat Boy) fill this quota but Rival (known for his Electro Dubstep type music) and FamilyJules (Creator of several Metal Covers on OSTs.) made this game's soundtrack amazing. Not only that, but the characters are rememberable and make you actually feel for them, giving you different gameplay for each character, which is where Crypt of the Necrodancer gets it's replayability. These are the reasons why I still come back every day to this game. The art looks fresh and actually makes you wanna stop and see how your character moves to the beat of the music. This game also supports Steam Workshop, giving you the ability to play as a jiggling piece of bread if you wanted to. All of this for the decent price of $14.99 makes me believe that ANYONE, whether you enjoy Roguelike Dungeon Crawlers or the Music Lover that listens to game soundtracks in their daily lives can enjoy Crypt of the Necrodancer.

												~~UPDATED FOR FULL RELEASE~~Rhythm-based Rogue-Like Dungeon Crawler. Yes. Please.Everything you do is to the beat of the music, you move to the beat, attack to the beat and die to the beat. And the enemies do too. Every enemies has an attack pattern so if you can feel the beat, you can avoid taking damage, but it's not always that easy when you have a limited amount to time to react (IE. the beat) The music is the first thing you'll notice, composed by the indie game music GOD Danny B. who did the soundtracks for Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy (He's done many other games as well, but those two are the other two that I've played and can personally vouch for the music) so you know that the music in Necrodancer is top-notch...which is good considering that's the prime game mechanic.You'll groove your way through 4 zones, beating monsters, collecting gold, buying items and beating bosses until you reach the final boss which is sometimes different if you play the different characters. All the different characters are truly different and all play very differently and some even have limitations as to what items they can get. All the different characters ensure that you never get bored with the game and always provide a new challenge if you're feeling up for it. Played too much Cadance lately? Switch it up with Melody. Don't like how Melody plays? Try out Eli. Feeling strong with Eli? Now try Dorian. There are 10 different characters to play, including one final, truly insane challenge character that literally nobody has beaten yet so there is always something new to aim for with this game. And even if you can't play some of the harder characters like Aria, Bolt or Monk, you can always lay beatdowns to the beat with all the other characters.			"

You only use four buttons to perform all of the moves in the game - up, down, left, and right, to be precise.

A damn good example of a dungeon crawler roguelikeFun, strongly themed and well-balanced game.Punishing, but still difficult enough.It's more of a real-time-strategy roguelike if you think about it well. Because one move is one beat, so basically you get 1 beat of the song to quickly think your move.There's lots of options and gameplay modes to be chosen, ranging in difficulty and gimmickish gameplay, but they're still all fun.I really like how well designed the tempo is, as in every zone has increasing BPM in higher levels. They really went full meme with how 80%-90% of the stuff is music-based. Cool.9.75/10 if you want scores.A M P L I F I E D - Early Access ReviewDope shiz my dude.Fantastic new mechanics, quite a good bunch of new unlocks, expanded enemy classes, fantastic mechanics, more story which is appreciated, more characters for more replayability, fantastic mechanics, oh, did i say the new mechanics are absolutely fantastic?

This game in my opinion is just amazing in every single way, the enemies, the equipment available, the gameplay, and on and on. The main thing to me which defines this game is its amazing music, made by Danny Baranowski (who also created The Binding of Isaac music, and when I learned of this I was very happy).This game is still in early access, and has amazing potential and in the current state of this game, it is overall just amazing and fun to play. Even if you are not the kind of person who has interest in music based games, you should still keep up with this game and its development as the potential is huge. If you dislike the music for whatever reason, there will eventually be music you can use yourself to play the game with!Also a dancepad will be usable for this game.TLDR: Buy it. If you choose not to, keep up with the development of this game, and eventually you will like it.			"

												Since its alpha phase, Crypt of the NecroDancer has held a ton of promise.  As it's grown into its full release, Crypt has added multiple characters, an expansive monster bestiary, and not one, but two extra arrangements of the already-amazing soundtrack.This game is a rhythm-based roguelike dungeon-crawling game, but rather than carefully planning each move, you're given a time limit of a single beat of music.  Everything moves one turn on each beat, whether or not you offer an input, which means that you're constantly faced with split-second decisions which will make or break your run through each zone.Crypt offers a wide variety of play styles.  Cadence, the first playable character, is a pretty standard roguelike experience.  You take on a dungeon, probably die, and return to the lobby for some purchasable persistent upgrades.  You return to the dungeon, and the cycle continues on.  Later, you'll unlock Bard, a character whose actions are not limited by the beat of the music, and enemies only move on player actions.  And for the perfectionist, Aria offers a frustrating challenge in which missing a single beat or taking any damage is instant death.The soundtrack, which I mentioned earlier, is absolutely amazing.  Danny Baranowski (of Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac fame) takes center stage with the primary soundtrack.  Two other musicians -- A_Rival and FamilyJules7x -- also offer their talents to mix the game's music into heavy techno and metal arrangements, respectively.  Each of these remixed soundtracks is available to play in the game as well.  And, if you should ever get bored of that music, the game allows you to use your own music for any stage you please.I could go on for paragraphs about how great this game is, but suffice to say, it is absolutely worth experiencing for yourself.  It's well-made, it's challenging, and above all else it's just a really fun time.  Absolutely pick this game up if you have any interest in rhythm-based gameplay, roguelike dungeon-crawlers, or just generally challenging gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								And it's like, how much more niche can you get?  The answer is none.  None more niche.Seriously though, this is a pretty fun roguelike.  It gives me the same vibe as One Way Heroics, even though their gameplay is fundamentally opposed: They both add an element of tension that isn't present in normal roguelikes.  In the case of Crypt of the NecroDancer it's a very frantic tension, which makes it hard to play for long stretches at a time but I'm really enjoying it when I do play.  Ideal coffee break game, each run is nice and short.Replayability is similar to Spelunky: It's very challenging as you play through it, but I'm not sure how much I will feel like replaying it once I'm finally through.  Various things to unlock along the way though.  Playing with the different weapon types is a lot of fun, it feels more visceral than most roguelikes and that's very satisfying.The music is addictive.  There's a mode that lets you play it with a dance pad, too, and I'm really looking forwards to that--will update this review when my new dance pads (with official Crypt of the NecroDancer art from precisiondancepads.com!) arrive in a month.

Early Access Review
								I preordered this game ages ago to get early access to the alpha build, and the sound track.  I could not be happier with my purchase. Clever game play combined with wonderful pixel graphics, and a soundtrack that will seep into your subconcious mind combine into an engrossing gaming experience that will challenge even the most experienced dungeon crawlers. I normally don't endorse early access games, but this one is an exception that all others should strives to model themselves after.  The first build of this game was light years ahead of what many games on Steam now call final builds, and for that I am eternally grateful.  New additions to the game are seamlessly added on a regular basis, and any bug or issue are often taken care of quickly and effectively.   I cannot stress enough the professionalism Brace  Yourself Games have shown with this release, both with the handling of this game and in their forum community.  I cannot recommend this game enough.If you like roguelikes. Go for it.If you like rhythym games. Go for it.If you're like me and somehow fall in that strange Venn Diagram overlap then What the hell are you waiting for.			"

												Music is excellent, sound design in general really gives the action a lot of punch and makes the player feel like they can succeed despite the challenging gameplay, which can be doled out in may forms depending on the level, enemy or character the player is up against or playing as. Also, the plot never gets in the way like I thought it might, and its pretty interesting by itself. Great game, as you can probably tell by its reviews.			"

												As an off-and-on fan of rogue-lite/like games, I am always torn determining the amount of skill and the amount of luck you will find in these games. Unseen probabilities within games are something I always am wary of complaining about when I could've had some really bad luck.However, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a game where I blamed myself more so when I made errors than blame the odds against me. This is the first rogue-LIKE where I could tell I was improving myself, and it's the first one in the genre where the demands on the player's skill were mandatory.Because with each failure through the familiarity of the controls and the coodrination of my fingers to the bass-line of the music I was reading the enemy telegraphed moves. Or adjusting myself to a new tempo-change. Or finding myself becoming at ease with the bizarre control-scheme. (Minus the DDR pad.)The Rogue-Like With A BeatThe novelty of this game is that it takes the game of Rogue and gives it a beat. Literally. The musical theme is not solely an aesthetic. The gameplay is interwoven into the music itself. From the way you move around/attack to the amount of time you have to explore the dungeons. Once the song ends, you are dropped to the next stage. (There are red-bars to show that the song is nearing its end.)Every movement/action you make is managed by moving in-time of the music. You and every enemy move according to that rule, which gives the game a charming tactical feel while sometimes relying on you thinking on the fly. Enemies attack in a specific manner which usually results in them having an ""off-beat"" to strike them. If you simply attack head-on with no regard, you'll die a lot.If that sounds too convulted about how the combat works, let me rephrase it like this: You are the metronome; the music is what you need to match (as the tempo can increase and decrease); and the enemies are the other instruments in play. The game plays more like reading a music sheet than another rogue-like game. The controls are the first major obstacle to get over, which you can play this game legitimately with either a controller or keyboard (or a DDR pad, which has an easier difficulty just for itself). To get the best experience, I would suggest you map your directional keys separate from your combo keys. There are too many moments towards Zone 2 and onwards that rely on twichy relfexes in-time with the music to coordinate your fingers in combinations.Thankfully, the game isn't too demanding on you maintaining a constant rhythm. If you're like me, I struggle to keep a rhythm going longer than a few seconds without going faster or slower than expected. The game is leniant on being perfect, but you cannot spam your movements. The game simply won't let you, and you won't be able to obtain the modifiers to your gold (and modified items) if you don't keep the beat.I was able to get past the first zone on my KB alone, but the second stage's music tripped me up when I had to make those split-second motions to drop a bomb or use an item. Switching out the combos to other keys fixed it for me, and I would strongly suggest that if you play the game with a controller you get the directional pad some love.Practice Makes PerfectionMany rogue-lites rely too much on probabilites of which you can and cannot control (FTL). Others rely on attention to details of your item and the levels to spot those small benefits to get you to the end (Binding of Isaac). Crypt of the NecroDancer is a part of the trend where they provide permanent progression across chunks of the game. (There is a story mode for purists who want to play a more traditional rogue-like experience. However, I chose the permanent item/stat increases as I am not the best at these type of games.)There are stat increases and new loot to give your next playthrough something to change it up as well as possibly improving your odds. None of which are mandatory--I wouldn't think of going without them--if you are good enough at the game to read your enemies' movements.Outside of the item/stat increases, you also have another means to improve your next game: Practice rooms.You have a training room for enemies and minibosses that unlocks with a certain amount of kills for every enemy, a boss pratice room (unlocked via currency you accumulate in every run, diamonds), and a weapon-training selection screen to practice in either room. These rooms are unlocked by finding trapped tradders within Zone 1 and 2 and unlocking them with the Golden Master Key.Having a story-mode option and a perma-progression system as choices is the best compromise as both the purists who prefer to learn the game on their own and everyone else has the means to finish the game. But it ain't so easy, nor free.The bosses cost in-game currency to unlock. And you can't simply practice on all the enemies from the get-go--you have to kill each enemy type several times to unlock them. Simply, you can't cheat yourself out of a challenge without investing first.(And if you don't like some items, you can discard them for diamonds with the Janitor).It Ain't No StepmaniaPerhaps the game's own lacking feature is the infamous difficulty of its genre. The game doesn't feel that hard.Make no mistake; the game is difficult for all the right reasons, and you will die a lot. But there are plenty of items to circumnavigate the game's difficulty, and some enemies that make me wonder how fair the game truly is.For example, blood items let you regain your health, slowly, with enough kills chained together. There are also magic spells that might stun enemies, blast horrizontally, or give you some buffs to become overpowered in some situations. I would chalk these up to limitations of making a novel game without all its polish.Some enemies also break the rules. There are some enemies that move in diagonal movements, which you are never allowed to do. The red-dragons also seem unfair without a ""ranged"" weapon (weapons that extend beyond one-tile, such as long-swords or broad-swords) to get around taking damage.Zone 2 seems to have a sharp difficulty spike because you start off with nothing (even if you finish Zone 1). So expect that you may still have some bad runs when you begin new zones.The only feature of this game I hadn't tried is adding your music into the game. This game's music was tailored for the game, and I am sure slow songs will break it while Megalovania will result in a very bad time.Shake Your Groove ThangThis is one of few rogue-likes I'll always come back to because it's a fun experience. It's not a brutal old-schooling, nor is it coddling to the new players. The game's sense of challenge makes an otherwirse creative deviation into a worthwhile game of its own.And how can you not have fun dancing on a plastic pad like an idiot?(Kudos to the devs who put this through Early Access and finished the game. As well as for adding new content to the game itself with no DLCs. If they have another product through Early Access, be sure to give them a second glance.)			"

												Having just completed all three main storylines, I feel I can safely recommend this game now.I haven't played a lot of roguelikes in the past, but I can safely say I will be pursuing them in the future, largely due to the incredible enjoyment I had playing Crypt of the Necrodancer. It's a very well designed game with unbelievably good music and tons of replayability. Even after beating the main story I still feel like I'm only scratching the surface.Since this is my first review I won't go into the minor pros and cons of this game, but I will give it a 9/10 and recommend to anyone even remotely interested.

								EPIC game. I've always been a fan of the Rogue-like gameplay like Dungoens of dreadmore or Rogue Legacy, but this one takes the price.The one thing i never liked too much about the rogue-like is that if you wanted to play it perfect you had to take tons of time to analyse each move. I always had the feeling that is was the game that killed me, not just because i played badCrypt of the NecroDancer have fixed that. Whenever i die i feel like i'm an idiot for not realizing that it was a bad move, but because of the time limit-aspect you make mistakes. You just have to hope you don't make mistakes when it really matters!			"

If none of those artists get you hyped up enough, you can just add your own custom music/songs. The game has a lot of moddability from maps/dungeons to character sprites and UI, what's not to love about that. Besides that, it's really a solid game that provides a challenge for one and all with plenty of replay value.Unless you absolutely loathe 'roguelikes' or have no sense of rhythm, there's little reason to not play this game.

												This is one of the best games I've ever played and it's easily my favorite indie game to ever come out. 10/10Necrodancer follows the roguelike genre, the mechanics are simple in themselves, a tile based roguelike in which you only only move to the beat of the music. That is where the simplicity ends.In addition, each enemy has their own movement pattern, following the beats of the music. There are traps laying on the ground that control movement, send you down to the next level and ones that flat out damage you. All of this mixed together creates complex and rewarding gameplay that keeps you coming back.Being a rythm based roguelike, music is key and the game delivers in its soundtrack. The music was composed by Danny B, known for composing games such as Super Meat Boy and Binding of Issac. The tracks are perfectly suited to the style of game and will keep your head bobbing as you move to the beat. In addition, there are remixed versions of the game's soundtrack done by A_Rival and FamilyJules7x, which allow for more variety and they sound fantastic as well.But what if you get sick of the music? There is an option to import your own MP3 files into the game so you can tap along to your favorite songs as your progress through the game.The art style, while another pixel art type of deal, looks great. The enemies are unique, it's easy to distinguish them apart and easily identify what you're going to be going up against. Even after you play the game with the default character Candence, there are many more characters availible to mix up the gameplay and keep you coming back. If that wasn't enough, there is a daily challenge mode to compete in everyday to hone your skills and try to climb to the top of the leadboards; or you could just compete with your friends.I can go on and on about this game, I adore it, the gameplay, the visuals and the soundtrack amaze me, and it all blends into this perfect package of a game.

Edit: 2 more were added a while ago! A chiptune soundtrack by the same person who made the shovel knight soundtrack & a Synthwave Soundtrack by Girlfriend records, Never fail to amaze with the different styles of remixes!There are 10 Characters total, Each every different things, like bolt who moves at double the speed, or Aria who can't get hit or miss a beat (as in dies in 1 hit or missing a single beat.)There are a bunch of different enemies, which also move to the beat with different patterns which are easy to understand, Each as moving every 2 beats or lunging forward after being hit once or even teleporting the player. Even if you're someone who isn't great with hearing/listening, there's a guideline sort of thing at the buttom of the screen, which you could use to learn the beat.Its a great game and i'm amazed the Devs Created this unique game.

								Give this review a reed, it will only take a minuet. Whatever expectations you have for this game are going to fall flat. The idea behind it is just so clef-er, and even in it's alpha I don't even C any minor flaws. Much less any major ones! It's especially fun if keeping a beat is your forte, and if it's giving you treble don't fret about it, you'll get it. I am no lyre, this game is amazing!Real ReviewI have to say it now, this is my new favorite rougelike game. It is  amazing ! Once you start you are not going to want to put it down. The visuals are great and apealing to look at, and all the enemies dance! How awesome is that!? And the music- OOOOH THE MUSIC -it just works...so well. I actually started typing this review before, and when I typed, ""And the soundtrac-"" I immediately went and bought it without realizing it would erase what I had typed! It's that good. I completely recommend buying it. And then there's the shopkeeper. His voice is the most beautiful thing you can hear while fending off skeletons that have their hands in the air like they just don't care! One thing that is terrible great about it is that when you die, it's your fault. It's because you weren't paying close enough attention, or because you didn't react fast enough. There are some times when I die that I just have to take rest...sorry, and mourn my own stupidity. The game almost never cheats you. Unless there's a red dragon. I'm sorry, that's fate, it's going to kill you. There are some enemies that seem like they do, but maybe I just don't understand them. *cough* bats *cough*[EDIT] I do have a give a fair warning though, the difficulty spikes between levels 1 and 2, and I can't even imagine 3.After playing some more, I have a few things I would like to see improved:*I think the shield skeletons need an ""arms up""-like frame in their animation, it can sometimes be unclear whether they will attack or not*The red dragon is way too hard. Maybe I just suck*The ability to go from Level 1 to level 2 and so on in one run, like in daily challenges. The later levels are just way too hard to start from scratch and hope you get lucky. **More permanent upgrades, the dungeon master is hardly used after the first hour**A option/item that makes the shopkeeper always singing (perhaps if it's an item, you can see him or the music notes all the time)See, not even very many :)I haven't completed it, so maybe some things I just haven't found yet.

												Top tier game.  You'll get your ♥♥♥ kicked, you'll kick ♥♥♥ and jive to it all. It's the kind of game where no matter how many times you die, you will want to just give it ""one more shot"". If you play through the game I recommend playing through with the original soundtrack before swapping it out with your custom music (if you intend to do so). The original soundtrack isn't something you want to miss out on and will definetly set the mood for how the game should be viewed... There is alot of replay value.

EVERYBODY DO THE FLOP!After the unfair atrocity against humanity that is Spelunky, I jumped away from the rouge-lite bandwagon and started to avoid this kind of games entirely. You cannot imagine the frustration which that cursed game gave me with its extreme unpredictability of annoying enemies, dirt-poor and mostly useless item pool, random stuff blowing up in your face without your fault etc.Good thing that Crypt of the Necrodancer fixes nearly everything I listed above. Listening to the Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam apparently is sometimes a good idea!You can imagine the game as a mix of classic dungeon-crawling games, generic rouge-lite games, chess and DanceDance Revolution.

Bought the soundtracks... All of them). It's must-have on the nearest occasion for everybody who isn't tone-deaf, without the sense of rhythm or satisfaction from fair challenge.Also, f*** Spelunky.			"

EVERYBODY DO THE FLOP!After the unfair atrocity against humanity that is Spelunky, I jumped away from the rouge-lite bandwagon and started to avoid this kind of games entirely. You cannot imagine the frustration which that cursed game gave me with its extreme unpredictability of annoying enemies, dirt-poor and mostly useless item pool, random stuff blowing up in your face without your fault etc.Good thing that Crypt of the Necrodancer fixes nearly everything I listed above. Listening to the Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam apparently is sometimes a good idea!You can imagine the game as a mix of classic dungeon-crawling games, generic rouge-lite games, chess and DanceDance Revolution.

												This game fooled me, but in a good way. I was expecting a cute gimmick - a music game disguised as a rogue-like. Instead, I got a solid dungeon crawler with a musical twist.Crypt of the Necrodancer is the first game to combine two of my favorite things; EDM and The Undead. The style is cute, cohesive and somehow works without jumping the shark, which is hard to do for such an odd mix.+'s * Gameplay is solid and difficult, but not because of the musical aspect. ""Spinning Plates"" and managing many simple enemy patterns together takes awareness, practice and planning.* The beat is there as a turn-timer of sorts. By forcing the decisions to be quick, there's opportunities for mistakes (and therefore mastery/learning!) * Several characters with different styles, rogue-like style.* TLC put into the production value, even considering a more throwback/pixel art style.* Soundtrack is fantastic.-'s* While there's a variety of characters, the game's core gameplay has to eliminate a lot of the dungeon options and items that make the full-run version fun, meaning many of the alternate characters are less interesting than the default.* It's said before, but Aria is extremely punishing to play. This is where it truely becomes a rhythm game, but it also has the problems listed above. Not a deal-breaker, but a sore spot.Highly recommend this if you're a fan of strange mash-ups that work, or want a dungeon delver with its own unique feel and flavor. The game holds up without the music, but is greatly enhanced by having it. :)			"

								Wow, what an amazing game!I love its style, the music and the whole gameplay.When I first bought the game I played it for 5 hours straight, without getting tired of it. It is just so much fun to play.But it's not just a rhythm game, you have to think about every single move, which means you have to think fast and react even faster. You have to predict the moves of your enemies, but at the same time focus on the beat and your moves.At first it is pretty hard, but after some time you'll get into it and you'll love it!This is one of the few early access games I'd recommend, because even now it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.

								This game is absolutely amazing. The music will enter your head and refuse to leave, but for once, that's a good thing. The controls are extremely simple to learn, but deviously tricky to master. Even though it can get extremely hard, there's also easier modes and built-in systems for practicing against that enemy that you can't seem to get past, or even if you just wanna relax and explore a bit. To add on top of how beautiful the game is and entrancing the music can be, there is plenty of room for customization through the Workshop, or even just your own music! There is so much to say about this game, so many things to explore, and it's not even entirely done yet! If you like rhythm games, rougelikes, or even just games that have plenty to explore, get this game! "

												You'll like this if :You are a fan of rogue likesLike SpelunkyAppreciate good game soundtracksYou'll hate this is :You have no rhythm and things like DDR drive you nutsGet bored with casual quick gamesThink old school graphics are horribleCrypt of the Necrodancer is a light rogue like game that owes a lot of its design philosophy to Spelunky. It does away with the depth of most roguelikes and instead concentrates on serving up a bite size piece of dungeon crawling in a challenging cute form, with many of the game design elements from Spelunky directly converted into its top down view point.So far, so similar.But CotND has a gimmick up its sleeve. The soundtrack. Everything in the game moves to the beat of the soundtrack, animations, movement, attacks - even your own input has to move to the beat of the soundtrack, like some mad version of Dance Dance Revolution where each step lets you explore further into the dungeon.Move out of step with the beat and you will be punished - losing bonus and also potentially missing your chance to move or attack. Learn to step with the beat, learn how the monsters move with the beat, and suddenly you will be popping along to this fiendishly addictive game.If the idea of playing a roguelike to the sound of a beat sounds weird - it kind of is. And I'll admit I wasn't entirely sure if this would turn out to be a flop or a cool idea. But once you play it, it just makes sense, and adds a very unique aspect to the game - that of timing. Where you have to move to the beat - staying still just isn't an option, and yet a move will push you into the path of a deadly foe, or out of striking range of a target. A new dimension of just how to ""wait"" or move in such a way as to hit an enemy becomes part of the game.The soundtrack itself that supports the main gimmick of the game is absolutely top notch, and there are a few great touches to the game - such as the singing shopkeepers - that just make this game work really very well indeed.An all round excellent experiment in combining the winning formula of Spelunky with a top down roguelike all to the beat of a soundtrack. Don't be put off because this game is kind of... left field. It manages to weld everything together beautifully, and is definitely a game where you will just want One More Try, because This Time, I've Got It.			"

												Do you like rougelikes, rhythm games, adventure games, top down dungeon crawlers, and/or cryptic (Neh heh heh) feeling games, play it. The gameplay consists of moving to the beat of your heart (or music) and only to the beat and figuring out the enemy’s attack patterns. It will take some learning but you'll enjoy dancing while being tortured by this game.Note: Only play this game if you like a challenge and rougelikes. This is rather forgiving for its genre (you can buy upgrades that never go away and only have to redo the stage, not the entire game) and can be appealing to lots of people.

I love the music that goes with each boss and the ability to add custom tracks. And this game will take time adjust to the game play and battle style. So please be patient, unless you're one of those naturally gifted with the ability to keep up with the music the first try. The custom tracks are weird and sorta buggy for certain songs such as ""Maroon 5 - Animals."" I am still unable to beat King Konga cuz his stop on every 8 beats is killing me on his fight.

												A beautiful blend of dungeon crawler and rhythm-based gameplay that shows progress isn't the only reward, not with a smashing sountrack like this.To start, I have put over 80hrs in on the PS4 version. That is how I learned of this game. I had to buy it ASAP because that is just how good it is. Even got it on my smartphone and spent about 20 hours on that version.This game tasks you with crawling through a dungeon while slaying monsters to get to the end. Simple enough right? Wrong. To do anything (move, attack, use item) you must do it to the rhythm of the music that is unique to that floor of that dungeon. Sound fun yet? The monsters also have their own movement style that goes to th music too so now you have to learn their pattern to be able to take them out without getting hurt.There are plenty of things to unlock too, like weapons, weapon types, character boosts, and magic items. There are also different characters to unlock in the game that very drasticallly change up how you play your game!Have I mentioned the soundtrack you play to is absolutely amazing?No dungeon crawler is as good as this one. I fear none may ever be. Get out there and buy this!			"

												""Crypt of the Necrodancer"" is best described as a fusion of ""Mystery Dungeon"" and ""Dance Dance Revolution"" games. You are tasked to explore a dungeon full of threats, traps and treasures while keeping in tune with the current music of the level.It takes its core gameplay from both roguelike and rhythm game genres. As a roguelike, you crawl through procedurally generated levels and suffer permanent death if killed. Each attempt grants a unique experience as you battle monsters, gather equipment and explore the dungeon. As a rhythm game, you must also ensure that all of your character's movements and actions are in tune with the music. Maintaining perfect rhythm gives you additional bonuses, while missing beats penalizes you in various ways.The game has a great soundtrack that changes between levels. The visuals are generally colorful and exciting, but you have the option to disable the bright disco floor if you find it too distracting. The story cut-scenes are simple but well-written and appropriate for the setting. There are a number of unlockable characters and options to allow different playstyles. You can even add custom music or play using dance-pad mode.Overall, I found ""Crypt of the Necrodancer"" as a fun, refreshing and original experience. Easy to learn but difficult to master, I would recommend the game to both roguelike and rhythm game enthusiasts.			"

Crypt of the NecroDancer is a game that intrigued me from the first moment I heard about it.Just about everything in this game is absolutly charming; from the overall visual design, to smaller details like the singing shopkeep, you can realy feel the love and passion that went in to this project. However the thing that truly sets NecroDancer apart from any other game is how it brilliantly blends the dungeon crawler and rhythm game genres into something new, and in my opinion, something greater than the sum of its parts.As a part of the Steam Awards, Valve featured The “We Didn’t Think Of Everything” Award, which allows us the chance to nominate the games that might not fit into an existing category. As such, I would like to nominate Crypt of the NecroDancer for The “Most Innovative Gameplay Mechanics” Award 2016. I have certainly loved playing this game, and I hope that you will enjoy it too!

												Disclaimer. Do not get this game if you like your fancy 100% game completion rate, as this game's achievements will tear it to shreds. They are not glitched or anything, but some are unbelievably hard.But regardless it is one of the best games I ever played. It is almost perfect, though there are a few flaws here and there, mostly minor.The biggest thing is that playing one of the hardest characters is a decent part of the game's story, most of the characters aren't ""easy"" per say, but dying in one hit to anything, including missing a beat is a little extreme to have to go through to progress the story, even if you don't take the hardcore route and do it by playing the zones individually.I heard that you can do it co-op with Bard as your partner to make getting the last bits of the story more reasonable, but I haven't tried it and even if it helps, you're still in for hell of a ride. (I decided against playing that character until I get a few more achievements)Another thing is how one of the challenge characters work, the one where you have to play twice as fast, but the speed of the music stays the same, which is odd surprising that this is a game where you have to play along with the beats of the song and it doesn't quite work right in that case, but apparently there's a mod for that.And the last nitpick being how the singing shopkeeper vocals clash with the metal version of the soundtrack.But regardless it's a great game with good music and providing a unique and fun experience.

The gameplay consists of moving to the beat of your heart (or music) and only to the beat and figuring out the enemy’s attack patterns. It will take some learning but you'll enjoy dancing while being tortured by this game.Note: Only play this game if you like a challenge and rougelikes.

												Warning to all who dare to enter the Crypt - If you have no internal metronome, turn back now. Seriously, you need to be able to hold a beat to even consider playing this game in full. And yes, this is an important distinction - I've seen several attempted runs from someone who didn't, they were very short lived. Another warning - If you have any music preferences, they're about to be formatted.Anyways, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a roguelike rhythm game. The roguelike takes precedence for the most part, but it's good to keep a rhythm-game mentality. The gameplay can be a bit tricky at first, but superb once you get the hang of it. The actual progression is a bit basic (not uncommon for roguelikes), but that's not too major a problem. The biggest issue most people have with the game is that the rhythm-based controls are a bit gimmicky or unwieldy, but I had very little problems with them and they didn't get in my way too much.But enough about the gameplay. I'm writing this review to commend the SOUNDTRACK. This game's BGM alone is worth the $15 admission fee, and that's a bargain. I've been known to listen to the soundtrack on repeat for hours on end, and am working on burning the soundtrack onto a CD as I type this. And if the planets align and someone is born who doesn't like the music - you can set your own too.So in summary: If you think you can manage the gameplay, get the full game. If you don't think you can manage it, already have the game, or need a new soundtrack to listen to in your spare time, buy the soundtrack. And if by some strange coincidence you neither want this game's gameplay nor it's soundtrack, then and ONLY then will I permit you to not touch this game.What are you waiting for... pick up the beat!

Early Access Review
								This game brings Rouge like Dungeon exploration and Rhythm Games Together into the game we call ""Crypt of the NecroDancer"". Bringing you into 3 Different zones each containing their own sort of enemies. Each zone containing 3 levels and 1 Boss Level. Each boss having their own rhythm, keeping you on feet trying to learn how each of them move and react. At the moment you can play as 4 different characters. Some might have a easier way of playing, or a harder challenge to conqour. The game is currently in early access but is still worth buying and playing for yourself.This game will keep you curious for a long time thinking of what this game will bring once it gets out early access.

												Easily one of the best rhythm games to come out EVER. CoTND is a procedurally generated dungeon crawler with the difficulty and addictiveness of Binding of Isaac, with, imo, a killer soundtrack. This is probably because the music was made by the same guy but, I digress. And if for some reason you hate the music (or you get sick of dying and hearing the same bloody song from level 1 over and over again like I do (inb4 'git good')) you can substitute the level songs with your own music. You play at Cadence, one of several musically-named individuals who must make their way through the titular Crypt for their each individual reasons, which is fun but the true awesomeness lies in the music-related combat and sweet pixel art visuals. That being said the game is hard. It's really hard. The good news is with a few proper upgrades you can become veritably unstoppable in any of the worlds. The learning curve drops into a cliff about the time you meet the Red Dragon, who can take you out with a single well-timed fire breath from across the map, and he'll show up every now and again in Zone 1.Easy to learn and hard to master are how I would describe this game, and would definitely recommend it unless you're known to break things if you get easily frustrated. Mice and keyboards are expensive.			"

Crypt of the NecroDancer is a game that intrigued me from the first moment I heard about it.Just about everything in this game is absolutly charming; from the overall visual design, to smaller details like the singing shopkeep, you can realy feel the love and passion that went in to this project. However the thing that truly sets NecroDancer apart from any other game is how it brilliantly blends the dungeon crawler and rhythm game genres into something new, and in my opinion, something greater than the sum of its parts.As a part of the Steam Awards, Valve featured The “We Didn’t Think Of Everything” Award, which allows us the chance to nominate the games that might not fit into an existing category. As such, I would like to nominate Crypt of the NecroDancer for The “Most Innovative Gameplay Mechanics” Award 2016. I have certainly loved playing this game, and I hope that you will enjoy it too!

												Disclaimer. Do not get this game if you like your fancy 100% game completion rate, as this game's achievements will tear it to shreds. They are not glitched or anything, but some are unbelievably hard.But regardless it is one of the best games I ever played. It is almost perfect, though there are a few flaws here and there, mostly minor.The biggest thing is that playing one of the hardest characters is a decent part of the game's story, most of the characters aren't ""easy"" per say, but dying in one hit to anything, including missing a beat is a little extreme to have to go through to progress the story, even if you don't take the hardcore route and do it by playing the zones individually.I heard that you can do it co-op with Bard as your partner to make getting the last bits of the story more reasonable, but I haven't tried it and even if it helps, you're still in for hell of a ride. (I decided against playing that character until I get a few more achievements)Another thing is how one of the challenge characters work, the one where you have to play twice as fast, but the speed of the music stays the same, which is odd surprising that this is a game where you have to play along with the beats of the song and it doesn't quite work right in that case, but apparently there's a mod for that.And the last nitpick being how the singing shopkeeper vocals clash with the metal version of the soundtrack.But regardless it's a great game with good music and providing a unique and fun experience.

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a clever, addictive rhythm game and dungeon crawler mash-up, refreshing and definitely worth more than what I ended up paying for it during this Winter Sale. I am ecstatic to see such creative, inspired titles earn the love and respect (and business) of the Steam community. It deserves it and then some.Is this my first review? I think it is. Definitely worth the effort.My girlfriend doesn't care for this game, but she's has a severe aversion to rhythm games. With that said, this is the kind of game that forming an opinion about simply requires watching some gameplay - you'll know once you see it. It has a good heart, a good beat and a good future.			"

You have to get the feel for the musical moment:Move to the beat. Slay monsters to the chord. Shop to the croon. End a dungeon with a bassdrop. Defeat a boss to a crescendo!The (default) music is really upbeat and entertaining, worth buying separately.Otherwise, your typical roguelike tile dungeon RPG.Buy it on sale, play it for a while.

I'm not typically a fan of rhythm games because it involves no more than correct button-press timing, but Crypt of the NecroDancer transforms rhythm gameplay into something much, much more than what other members of the genre do. Fantastic music, and so much room for replayability. My only irk with the game is some of the shop item prices. I got stuck at Zone 2 for a while and unlocked most of them by the time I finished it. Anyways, this is a great game. You should absolutely get it -- I got it on sale, but I would have absolutely paid for it at full price.			"

												I'm not a huge fan of turn-based games, the careful calculation isn't my cup of tea outside a bit of casual play. I like action roguelikes, which give me a challenge I can quickly work through, but by nature there'll always be a glut of deaths that seem more random chance than my fault.This game solves both problems. By making it technically turn-based but setting each turn to a less-than-half-second timer, every move is forseeable in advance; but you have to keep moving. So it beats me up but every time it does I realize I ""obviously"" could have just used that bomb, or staggered one more turn.Beating the final story is simply one of the most satisfying thing I've done because I felt like I had legitimately EARNED that victory through-and-through. Quick-thinking, experience, and timing got me there, not just lucky drops. That feeling is what makes this easily one of my favorite games I've ever played. But getting your face stomped in repeatedly in hopes of one day achieving the goal isn't for everyone. I'm just in the right place for this game.Also, good job on making the music bearable even after hearing it for 28+ hours			"

It's currently Early Access so I'm REALLY looking forward to watching this game polish up because its in amazing shape for a beta version. This is also one of the few games with armor built for womens breast. Seems like a small thing, but it's notable. This is what's called ""making an effort"" and it succeeds. The mechanics themselves are very easy to understand and simple to manipulate, just as you'd expect from a retro-flavored game. The $15 tag may seem on the high side, but we're all just used to getting Free or $3 games. It's worth every penny and then some. Try this out!			"

								This is what you get when you blend together a SNES-era RPG, chess, and DDR. Who'd knew it's be so entrancing?Do notice (again) that it's still a work in progress. Not enough unlockables, the game still runs on a excuse plot (trailer says about Cadence's missing dad, opening just sets her on finding out how she survived a cracked skull. You won't hear about either anywhere else in the game), and even though using your own MP3 is an seducing idea, the beat-detection program, Essentia, is hit-and-miss on some musics, even with the double and half tempo options.Give it time for the team to work it out though, and enjoy what has been released so far. It's addictive :3			"

												Love it, videos and screenshot make it look intriguing but it's definitely hard to understand without playing.  Once you start though you're literally only seconds into zone 1 before you start thinking, yeah, this is pretty catchy, I'm definitely going to like this. Lots of stuff to unlock, varying difficulties and characters.  Very cool.			"

												This is one of the only Early Access games that I have purchased very early on. It also happens to be the first early access that I have absolutely loved from the beginning and it's probably one of the only early access games that I purchased that actually came out as a complete game.Crypt of the Necrodancer immediately caught my eye because of its unique gameplay (or was it just an impulse buy because of the pun?). It's essentially a Rythm Roguelike game. It has most of the elements of a Rogue-like, except you have to stay on beat!The soundtrack is absolutely amazing (and now offered in 3 different variations!) and the game is deceivingly difficult. It's very easy to pick up, very hard to master and highly addictive.Even having played through the first 3 zones countless time while I waited for the fourth one to come out, then all four a bunch of times when it did, I still enjoy playing this game from time to time (I have played a lot more than Steam indicates.)I often despise randomly generated levels but in this game it works very well and follow a set of logical rules. Each level will always be similar while always offering something new. There are tons of different items that will help you on your runs and different characters that provide different challenges when you get bored of Cadence, the main character.A very charming and challenging game with a lot of replayability, fully worth the 16.99$.

												Completionists, stay away.  There are things that are practically impossible to obtain.Roguelike purists, also stay away.  The game mechanics aren't extremely deep.Otherwise?  As long as you can tap to a metronome (or at least learn to) and do enjoy action, I highly recommend this game.Crypt of the NecroDancer, at its core, is a rhythm-based action with roguelite and dungeon crawler elements.  People have compared this game to games such as Faster Than Light and Spelunky; I really enjoyed the former and felt iffy about the latter, and after 350+ hours, I don't know if I can really stop playing NecroDancer just yet.It's very easy to pick up and understand the core gameplay; one or two local players act to the beat (with only the arrow keys), and everything else responds to your movements on the same beat, allowing you to plan for the next beat.  Getting dropped into the first zone after the tutorial level, you're introduced to a small variety of items, learning about this and that, buying and picking up things to figure out what your favorites are, and dealing with a small variety of enemies.  Items definitely make things easier, but it's absolutely possible to finish everything and low% a run with only default gear.(By the way, if you want to have a sense of genuine curiosity, go into the options and disable ""show item hints"".)And once you inevitably die, it's not so bad.  There's almost always a way out of whatever predicament you managed to get yourself into, and you sensibly chuckle at it and figure you'll do better next time.You slowly progress, saving a few unfortunate NPCs from cages, buying new things with diamonds and slowly expanding the pool of items you get to find and use during runs.  You finally manage to get the boss down, start to learn why Cadence is in this dungeon of dance, and then you're back to square one, figuring out the patterns in the completely new world that is Zone 2.  And you work through it, because holy crap is that Danny Baranowsky soundtrack fantastic and motivating.And you keep at it.  Some things change completely, some things don't, and some things get flipped upside-down and force you to change tactics.Occasionally, you take a break from Cadence and pick up a different character.  Oh yeah, there's other ways to play the game in Zone 1 again, and some new strategies for enemies you've seen before.  All the normal characters are interesting to work with in their own way.Once you feel that you've finished the important stuff, a variety of things open up.  Score runs?  Speedruns?  Sure thing, try to see how well you can do on the boards and in the daily challenge runs.  Low%?  Go for that, if you want to.  In terms of replayability, you get about as much as Spelunky -- everything generally stays the same, but for some reason the variations between runs always gets you coming back for more.Mods are a thing, to some extent.  At the very least, many resources can be replaced and custom levels are supported and supported through Steam Workshop.  That's about it, though; there's no way to add in completely new items and content just yet.Remember what I said about completionists?  Yeah, if you want to 100% this game legitimately, forget about it.  The developers added in a character that even they think is impossible.  There's absolutely nothing except bragging rights and an achievement to gain from completing a run as said character (unlike in, say, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth), so you're not missing out on too much otherwise.It's been great watching this game only get better from Early Access; Brace Yourself Games has been nothing less than incredible with regular development and responsive to the community.  If you haven't been driven away from reading this yet, it's absolutely worth more than the $15 that it's listed for.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a unique game involving following the beat of the music, into your attacking and your movement. You can't just rush from one end to the exit in 3 seconds, you have to time your movements with the beat otherwise it wont work. Not to mention the amazing soundtrack this game has with Danny B, A_Rival, Familyjules7X, and others! There is now a new dlc being worked on and it is amazing, it is worth $6.99 or however much it costs when i'm writing this, There are new characters, new modes, new weapons, new shrines and enemies and there is more coming! They are constantly updating this game. Also it is never the same run every run, You will always find new weapons and tools with different dungeon layouts and boss orders, you can almost never get bored with the game always having a new run to offer along with amazing music.

Move your character in rhythm to the music to defeat a plethora monsters who each have their own rhythym-based attack patterns.

												This game is pure genius.I've never played other rhythm based games before Crypt of the Necrodancer but I've always enjoyed Rogue-like games and I really feel like this one is amazingly realized. To date, nothing even marginally similar to this has ever been released and I sincerely think this has been one of the best games I've ever played.One more ""perk"" of this game is its simple retro-style, which one can love (as I do) or sincerely dislike.Another thing which one must realize BEFORE getting this game is that it's really challenging and requires a lot of time to be mastered.In my humble opinion this game is truly spectacular and it's worth the money.

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a very fun rogue-like rhythm game that even though it is in early access is miles ahead of most other early access titles, and it still has more to come. The music in this game is amazing and it goes with the gameplay perfectly (it kind of has to in a rhythm game) and makes it much more fun to play.  I personally play it in Hardcore mode... the only way to play it, and find it fun and challenging.  There are moments that can be frustrating, but I know that that isn't the games fault.  I know there is something that I can do to correct that, and can make that change on the next try.I cant really find anything wrong to say with this game, but I would say it is worth every penny at the asking price. As I have already 31 hours into this game, and I expect many more hours to come.Video review

The variaty in the sprite's movement patterns create depth, difficulty and replayablilty.In the future there are promises of new characters and floor(s), I really look forward to this.If you like awesome music created by the beloved Danny Baranowsky, then you will love this amazing (not an overstatement) soundtrack.

												Got on steam sale, was hesitant to buy and am SO glad I did.  This is a fantastic rhythm game.  The focus is about unlocking powerup spawns and learning each enemy while grooving to an awesome beat.  The dungeons are randomly generated, but each zone has its own theme which remains the same in any mode (music, enemies, and art).  There are also different game modes; they are not drastically different but definately different enough to change it up a bit.  This game is something kinda new because of the rythm based movement, but DEF worth trying out. 10/10 recommend getting this game if unsure- I know I was and I don't regret this purchase at all!

												I have been interested in Crypt of the NecroDancer for a long while then. All my friends who I have asked about it who have played the game say its really great. Now that I have tried the game I say I agree. NecroDancer is two parts rougelike one part dungeon crawler with a sprinkle of beat matching game sprinkled in. Every action throughout Necrodancer is done to the beat of each levels song. You try to move down floors through the dungeons while collecting loot, fighting monsters and just generally trying not to die to some sort of nasty trap.I feel like Crypt of the NecroDancer is a well rounded challenging game and I recommend it to any rougelike fans.

It's soundtrack is made by the guy who did the soundtrack for the first Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy, there was no one better to do this.The game is really hard at first on stage 1 because it feels odd, it's defiantly its own style of play but once you learn it you love it, and from going from Zone 1 to Zone 2, it gets a lot more difficult, people looking for a good and fun challenge will defiantly find it with this game.There's tons of items, secrets, enemies, and different beats to make the 14.99$ the perfect price.

It's soundtrack is made by the guy who did the soundtrack for the first Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy, there was no one better to do this.The game is really hard at first on stage 1 because it feels odd, it's defiantly its own style of play but once you learn it you love it, and from going from Zone 1 to Zone 2, it gets a lot more difficult, people looking for a good and fun challenge will defiantly find it with this game.There's tons of items, secrets, enemies, and different beats to make the 14.99$ the perfect price.

												This game includes more differences than other rhythm games and differences are mostly positive. Firstly, you don't have to move with continuously flowing display like that audiosurf, beat hazard, guitar hero etc. so you can choice your own destiny. In short this is the first platform music game. Secondly, this game have useful workshop that allows creating mode easily althought there is no tools belong to game. If you are music producer and want to know your music will be able to dance to people, Necro will give the right answer. Thirdly, you can convert your room to gym, all you need is dancepad and deaf neighbors. Besides, skin workshop is still confusing, gameplay is really difficult fortunately dungeon's songs are awesome, therefore I can listen same song over and over without getting tired. Consequently, It deserves every penny of the price because we are being witness and piece of rhythm games revolution			"

												I have been interested in Crypt of the NecroDancer for a long while then. All my friends who I have asked about it who have played the game say its really great. Now that I have tried the game I say I agree. NecroDancer is two parts rougelike one part dungeon crawler with a sprinkle of beat matching game sprinkled in. Every action throughout Necrodancer is done to the beat of each levels song. You try to move down floors through the dungeons while collecting loot, fighting monsters and just generally trying not to die to some sort of nasty trap.I feel like Crypt of the NecroDancer is a well rounded challenging game and I recommend it to any rougelike fans.

It's Dangerous to Dance AloneRouge-Lite games have been done to death within the past couple of years. Retro Aestetic? CheckPermadeath? CheckGenerated Dungeon? CheckWhat makes Crypt of the Necrodancer stand out in my opinion?well..It's rhythm based. I love rhythm based games which was the main reason for me buying this.It's also harder than it looks. In order to move you gotta hit the arrow keys (or whatever button you wish to map to) along with the beat. Unlike some Rouge-Lite's: losing doesnt feel like a waste of time. You just want to return and try to nail the rythm with your finger tips. If you collect enough Diamonds you can buy loot in your lobby and the diamondsremain in your inventory until you restart a new zone.If you somehow are a genius and have perfect rythm and beat the game there's always daily challenges to back once a day to further up your skills.Also if you like the idea of a DDR dance pad then there's a dance pad mode to improve your cardio and dance if you want to be the Patrick Swayze of Crypt of the Nectrodancer.

												Completionists, stay away.  There are things that are practically impossible to obtain.Roguelike purists, also stay away.  The game mechanics aren't extremely deep.Otherwise?  As long as you can tap to a metronome (or at least learn to) and do enjoy action, I highly recommend this game.Crypt of the NecroDancer, at its core, is a rhythm-based action with roguelite and dungeon crawler elements.  People have compared this game to games such as Faster Than Light and Spelunky; I really enjoyed the former and felt iffy about the latter, and after 350+ hours, I don't know if I can really stop playing NecroDancer just yet.It's very easy to pick up and understand the core gameplay; one or two local players act to the beat (with only the arrow keys), and everything else responds to your movements on the same beat, allowing you to plan for the next beat.  Getting dropped into the first zone after the tutorial level, you're introduced to a small variety of items, learning about this and that, buying and picking up things to figure out what your favorites are, and dealing with a small variety of enemies.  Items definitely make things easier, but it's absolutely possible to finish everything and low% a run with only default gear.(By the way, if you want to have a sense of genuine curiosity, go into the options and disable ""show item hints"".)And once you inevitably die, it's not so bad.  There's almost always a way out of whatever predicament you managed to get yourself into, and you sensibly chuckle at it and figure you'll do better next time.You slowly progress, saving a few unfortunate NPCs from cages, buying new things with diamonds and slowly expanding the pool of items you get to find and use during runs.  You finally manage to get the boss down, start to learn why Cadence is in this dungeon of dance, and then you're back to square one, figuring out the patterns in the completely new world that is Zone 2.  And you work through it, because holy crap is that Danny Baranowsky soundtrack fantastic and motivating.And you keep at it.  Some things change completely, some things don't, and some things get flipped upside-down and force you to change tactics.Occasionally, you take a break from Cadence and pick up a different character.  Oh yeah, there's other ways to play the game in Zone 1 again, and some new strategies for enemies you've seen before.  All the normal characters are interesting to work with in their own way.Once you feel that you've finished the important stuff, a variety of things open up.  Score runs?  Speedruns?  Sure thing, try to see how well you can do on the boards and in the daily challenge runs.  Low%?  Go for that, if you want to.  In terms of replayability, you get about as much as Spelunky -- everything generally stays the same, but for some reason the variations between runs always gets you coming back for more.Mods are a thing, to some extent.  At the very least, many resources can be replaced and custom levels are supported and supported through Steam Workshop.  That's about it, though; there's no way to add in completely new items and content just yet.Remember what I said about completionists?  Yeah, if you want to 100% this game legitimately, forget about it.  The developers added in a character that even they think is impossible.  There's absolutely nothing except bragging rights and an achievement to gain from completing a run as said character (unlike in, say, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth), so you're not missing out on too much otherwise.It's been great watching this game only get better from Early Access; Brace Yourself Games has been nothing less than incredible with regular development and responsive to the community.  If you haven't been driven away from reading this yet, it's absolutely worth more than the $15 that it's listed for.			"

I'm full of praise for the game. It's lots of fun, it has great tunes, it's addictive, you want to play it 'just one more time', and it is no push-over. After about 8 hours of play I finally managed to beat Zone 1. And I'm no way near beating Zone 2 yet (and then there's Zone 3...)They did a fantastic job of designing the game, with a vast variety of different items all of which alter how the game plays and how you shift strategies to get further. For instance, spear weapons give you more reach, and broadsword weapons allow you to do a very wide attack. But what does a Monocle do, what about Glass items, Cheese, heh.Every little detail is so well crafted. For instance, if you want to repeat the same level again and again, then there is 'seed' mode where you type in a 'seed' word (e.g. 'random') and then get to play the same thing over and over again, but then if you want to play entirely randomly (rogue-like), with no repeating whatsoever - then just go for the regular play.I could say plenty more... but let's just summarise with this: It's a big thumbs up from me.

								The Necrodancer delivers the electronic beats and a horde of monsters to defeat. Our unlikely herione, Cadance, boldly foregoes the suggested years of dance training and rushes in to save her own heart and vanquish a legendary foe.Roommate 1: ""What are you playing, Legend of Zelda?""Roommate 2: ""That actually looks like a decent rhythm game.""Brace Yourself Games has successfully combined a couple of genres into something you won't expect to be fun into something outright addictive. Every level is randomly generated and challenging in its own right, but there is always a bunch of orderly and easy to learn patterns to every enemy you will encounter. This isn't a game for everyone, but it's a game worth trying despite the fact that it isn't fully developed yet.Sure, the game is a bunch of pixels and the learning curve is a bit harsh. But the satisfaction of beating a single level keeps me coming back for another beating, the default music is awesome, and the game never ceases to be interesting. I don't know if I'll ever get good at it, but it inspires me to no end as a game-designer-in-training. I would regret never having played this game more than I regret a lot of other things.			"

If you don't have this game, buy it now, it's worth every penny!

I'd recommend this to any friend or family member who wants to have a great, grooving time! I'm extremely glad I can be a part of this community too. I honestly need to start a real life group that's filled with people who love the game as much as I do, because Crypt of the NecroDancer is one of my favorite games due to the amount of detail the sound crew, pixel artists, and everyone else had done (I also have to thank the person who made the puns for everyone of the enemy names personally, they're amazing without a doubt)! Although I only have around 50 hours of playing the game, you can bet on the shopkeeper's amazing voice that you'll love it too. And if the wide variety of characters, weapons, etc. aren't enough for you, you can even download mods! A personal favorite of my being the Captain Falcon reskins with sound, truly amazing.) With a great community and even greater team, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a must have. And now, after the real review is over, I must now make a musical pun to balance out the silliness (and to show respect for the beautiful, beautiful man/woman/team who came up with the puns.). Let's see... oh, I have one! If you do not like this game for whatever reason, then you can kindly and respectfully kiss my brass! Heh, I don't mean to toot my own horn or anything, but musical puns are the 'key' to success!

												Rythm-based roguelike dungeon crawler, where you have to press buttons to the beat of the music to move each turn.Putting aside the rythm gimmick, the game plays like a simple grid-based dungeon crawler. As you slay monsters and descend through the crypt, you find a variety of equipable items that upgrade your character. Enemy attacks come in predictable patterns which can be dodged, and your attacks likewise hit with different patterns depending on what weapon you use. The tactics aren't complicated, but it's easy to slip up when you're tasked with making several moves per second. The combination of speed, timing, and strategy is unique and feels very satisfying once you get the hang of it.The story, told through cutscenes, is unremarkable but not bad. Furthermore, the voice acting and pixel art are good, and the music is stellar. The game's focus is on its mechanics, but it manages to cobble together a compelling atmosphere as well.Playing each of the game's four zones one by one is relatively easy and allows you to buy upgrades between runs, but the marathon ""all zones mode"" is much more challenging. There are also several playable characters, each with their own mechanics, as well as local co-op multiplayer.A hugely successful experiment - lots of fun.			"

For instance, if you want to repeat the same level again and again, then there is 'seed' mode where you type in a 'seed' word (e.g. 'random') and then get to play the same thing over and over again, but then if you want to play entirely randomly (rogue-like), with no repeating whatsoever - then just go for the regular play.I could say plenty more... but let's just summarise with this: It's a big thumbs up from me.

												The music is great, the game is responsive, the mechanics are sound. The game might actually be a little too simplistic if it weren't for the fact that you only have until the next beat to decide your next action, it forces you to think fast while moving to the beat.And yeah, the music is really great.

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a fantastic entry into the Roguelike genre, so let's break it down.The primary draw of the game is the great music and how it is worked into the mechanics. In order to succeed you must move and attack to the beat of the song assigned for the floor. This is both simple and wickedly difficult to keep up, but the better you manage the more gold coins you earn due to a multiplier effect.Stats in most roguelikes depend heavily on luck in finding items or leveling up, but in CotND you can definitely succeed with just the basic starter gear. The reason why is because the game doesn't rely on huge health pools and in fact most monsters can be killed in a single hit and the only monster you MUST kill is the boss on the final floor. Playing conservatively is a very viable tactic because there are many ways to advance to the next floor and there is no leveling up that requires killing monsters.Each dungeon, at least for the moment, is three dane-a-thons of fun and a final boss. So game sessions are short and failure does not leave that typical bitter taste.There's a light quirky sense of humor, especially when the shopkeeper starts belting out tunes with the music. Colors are bright and all the monsters get a little dance-y jig which makes things pretty playful. If you're doing well you also get magical disco lighting all over the dungeon, huzzah!This is the Roguelike for people who like music and a shorter, more meaningful play session. The game itself isn't super long, but the random elements and multiple character types will keep you as busy as you would like.Final Score: A-			"

												For the rogue-like and rhythm fans alike, this game provides an amazing soundtrack, lots of replay ability with its randomly generated levels, items, and bosses, as well as amazing pixel art! If you don't have this game, buy it now, it's worth every penny! (And for the people who are a bit tight when it comes to pecuniary measures, don't worry, this game has been on sale a lot these past few days!) I'd recommend this to any friend or family member who wants to have a great, grooving time! I'm extremely glad I can be a part of this community too. I honestly need to start a real life group that's filled with people who love the game as much as I do, because Crypt of the NecroDancer is one of my favorite games due to the amount of detail the sound crew, pixel artists, and everyone else had done (I also have to thank the person who made the puns for everyone of the enemy names personally, they're amazing without a doubt)! Although I only have around 50 hours of playing the game, you can bet on the shopkeeper's amazing voice that you'll love it too. And if the wide variety of characters, weapons, etc. aren't enough for you, you can even download mods! A personal favorite of my being the Captain Falcon reskins with sound, truly amazing.) With a great community and even greater team, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a must have. And now, after the real review is over, I must now make a musical pun to balance out the silliness (and to show respect for the beautiful, beautiful man/woman/team who came up with the puns.). Let's see... oh, I have one! If you do not like this game for whatever reason, then you can kindly and respectfully kiss my brass! Heh, I don't mean to toot my own horn or anything, but musical puns are the 'key' to success! (But back to seriousness, 10 out of 10, would recommend to everyone who plays video games and/or loves music.)			"

Early Access Review
								Crypt of the Necrodancer is the game where you think you're good at beating down monsters to the beat... then you unlock hardcore mode. You think of this as impossible as Zone 3 is one giant zerg rush of skeleton horses and elemental enemies. Nonetheless you try it anyway and manage to get some decent gear. Then a red dragon comes along and says ""♥♥♥♥ you!"" and you get one shot by a fireball because you can't do the sacred red dragon dance at that moment. (That's my life, i cri evertim ;;) But seriously, this game is amazing in many aspects. It's hard to find a game where a particular character dies from picking up GOLD, of all things! Since the levels are randomly generated there is no true pattern to the game and permanent death is indeed a thing. So that guy that dies from picking up gold? He's no exception, better watch your step! Oh yeah, and the only way you can move/attack/dig/open chests is by hitting the arrow key in the direction that you want to go on the beat of the song that's playing. There's a nice little tutorial in-game for that, though. However, there is one thing that bugs me about Crypt of the Necrodancer. That is, the diamonds that are used to purchase items to be put into the item pool for non-hardcore runs. It would make more sense to have everything unlocked already, like hardcore does, but you are forced to buy it using diamonds you find during non-hardcore runs. It's a bit more harmful than helpful and everything should just be unlocked for you to use when it's found. Despite that, this game is well worth your time. I've got 60+ hours and counting clocked into Crypt of the Necrodancer and it's not like I'll be stopping anytime soon. If you like challenging games, get this game. If you like rogue-likes, get this game. If you like rhythm based games, get this game. The point is, just buy the freaking game! What're you waiting for? Scroll back up and click that ""Add to cart"" button!			"

								I'm not sure what's more insane: that Crypt of the NecroDancer combines dance/rhythm games with roguelike RPGs, or that it manages to pull it off in such an entertaining way.I found myself entranced by the seamless combination of music beats and keyboard tapping as I hopped through dangerous dungeons. I encountered cleverly designed enemies and challenges that tested my brains as much as they tested my skill. Even though the roguelike level of difficulty meant I died many times, I'd jump straight back onto that deadly dancefloor for another tango with trouble. Why, I could barely stop myself from playing this game just so I could write this review.Oh no, the music is starting again. The dance... the dance must go on!			"

Not to mention the amazing soundtrack this game has with Danny B, A_Rival, Familyjules7X, and others! There is now a new dlc being worked on and it is amazing, it is worth $6.99 or however much it costs when i'm writing this, There are new characters, new modes, new weapons, new shrines and enemies and there is more coming!

								15 bucks might seem a bit steep for what looks like a simple pixel-art roguelike game, but trust me when I say this: BUY IT.  This a truly unique game, and although the mash-up between genres (roguelike and rhythm game) may seem strange at first glance, it works brilliantly here.  Danny Baranowsky killed it with his score - I find myself humming the songs in my head when I'm at work.  Gradually learning the different strategies for dealing with the various enemy types is extremely rewarding, as you'll eventually work your way up from dying every time you run into your first miniboss to being able to complete runs in 'hardcore' mode, where the real fun is.  Add in daily challenge runs, multiple unlockable characters that dramatically change elements of the gameplay, and more content to come, and you'll be getting way more than your money's worth.Easily the best game I've picked up in a long time.  A+, 100%, 5/5 etc.  And it's only in alpha!			"

You won't hear about either anywhere else in the game), and even though using your own MP3 is an seducing idea, the beat-detection program, Essentia, is hit-and-miss on some musics, even with the double and half tempo options.Give it time for the team to work it out though, and enjoy what has been released so far.

								Brilliant. I was glad i instantly bought this game after hearing so many good things about it. For a while i've watched few people play this game and from what i could gather, it really held up to all it's promises.I bought this game and figured since it has Co op, i could try it out with a friend of mine, and we had a blast.The music is amazing and the whole Roguelike feel mixed with Rhytm was an excellent mixture.The graphics are pleasent for the eyes and keeps a retro feel while having upbeat chiptune esque sounds compossed by the brilliant artist Danny Baranowsky who is also known for doing music for Binding of Isaac and Super meat boy.Alright, let me get into the details of what you're getting yourself into.This game feels rewarding even when you die there will always be upgrades which adds to your progress.There are items to buy and bunch of stuff to unlock to add even more replayabillity including a hardcore mode.Co Op is twice the fun and there were no issues to be had since the screen pans out the further apart both players are.Enemies have patterns which are easily memorized by repeating the game through trail and errors and the same goes for all of the traps and mini bosses and main bosses of the game.But here comes minor nitpicks since no game in this universe is flawless, so don't take this the wrong way.This game can be unforgiving to people who have a hard time adjusting to the sense of beats and rhytms but there is a steady learning curve which seems to work.The controllers input works fine but i can't seem to get the ''start'' button to work at times so i have to use Keyboard whenever i wan't to continue in a zone when i can't use my diamonds.Like i said, this game is amazing and i'm glad that it exists, don't let these minor faults ruin the experience for you.I'm rating it a solid 9/10 and recomend it, especially for Roguelike/Rhytm game fans or Binding of Isaac fans.

								This is a really, really good game. The art style is fantastic, resembling the prettiest SNES game you never played, and the soundtrack by Danny B (of the Binding of Isaac fame) is incredible - as it needs to be, since music is the core of the game. Everything you do in the game, you can only do on the beat: moving, attacking, etc. It might sound like a strange concept, but it's the foundation for an incredibly solid game design. As a roguelike-like with persistant elements (similar to Rogue Legacy), you start each game in the lobby, where you can spend diamonds to unlock new items or bonuses, and choose which game mode you want to play. Presently, there are four game zones (each consisting of 3 levels and a boss fight), a local co-op mode, a daily challenge similar to Spelunky, and several different options for difficulty modifications, including a hardcore mode, or a ""dance pad."" Yep, you heard that right - you can buy and hook up your own DDR style dance mat for this game. A controller or the keyboard works just fine too, though, with four keys (up, down, left, right) being all you need to control the game. Apart from the beat, the gameplay will be familiar to anyone who has played a roguelike dungeon crawler: delve, loot, destroy. I honestly wasn't expecting to enjoy the game as much as I did, but I have to say - it's incredible. Pick it up if you've ever enjoyed the roguelike genre, and don't worry too much about the ""Early Access"" state, or the curious core mechanic - once you get used to it, you'll love this game.

When you die, or lose life you only have yourself to blame, no cheap tricks. And the learning curve only highlights how well made this game is. That being said, there is obviously missing content, as it is in Early Access. The amount of levels is alright, but the overall content seems a bit lacking. It's easy to run out of things to look forward to after you've beaten the 2nd zone (out of 4) as the hub feels rather empty. I'm hoping they don't pull a CuttleFish and cut all forward content after early access release.			"

								Great music, and the ability to import your own songs makes it where you're unlikely to get bored of the sounds.  While each enemy tends to be pretty easy to take down, a horde is a challenge, and can be overwhelming at first.  Thankfully, for those of us who are always off-beat or are overwhelmed, an alternate character (the Bard) allows the game to act more like a traditional rogue-like (with fantastic music), where the enemies take their turn after your character moves.Give the awesome variety of items, shrines, and teleporters already in the game, I'm really looking forward to see what they add during the remainder of development.

								A rhythm roguelike game... at first I was skeptical, but with the time passing and the release of the game coming insanely near, I could not hold back the hype for the game.I bought it and played it and I think I never enjoyed a roguelike this much before. The last time I got lost in a roguelike was when Rogue Legacy was released, but Crypt of the NecroDancer is just so much better than The Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain and Rogue Legacy combined. Having nearly no playtime on NecroDancer just has two reasons: First, 30 free days in a MMORPG just make the MMORPG a priority and secondly I just bought it. ^-^While I still struggle to get past Zone 2 with a keyboard, I honestly think its actually worth trying to play the game with a dance pad. (I don't own one, so yeah...) The game plays insanely smooth nonetheless and the soundtrack is amazing.TL;DR: 11/10. No problem, lazy guys.			"

								This game takes everything that's good about roguelikes and rythym games and combines them, wrapping the package up with excellent music from Danny Baranowsky, the same guy who did the music for Super Meat Boy and the Binding of Isaac.Even with the little time I've spent with the game, it still feels worth it.

												I'm not a huge fan of turn-based games, the careful calculation isn't my cup of tea outside a bit of casual play. I like action roguelikes, which give me a challenge I can quickly work through, but by nature there'll always be a glut of deaths that seem more random chance than my fault.This game solves both problems. By making it technically turn-based but setting each turn to a less-than-half-second timer, every move is forseeable in advance; but you have to keep moving. So it beats me up but every time it does I realize I ""obviously"" could have just used that bomb, or staggered one more turn.Beating the final story is simply one of the most satisfying thing I've done because I felt like I had legitimately EARNED that victory through-and-through. Quick-thinking, experience, and timing got me there, not just lucky drops. That feeling is what makes this easily one of my favorite games I've ever played. But getting your face stomped in repeatedly in hopes of one day achieving the goal isn't for everyone. I'm just in the right place for this game.Also, good job on making the music bearable even after hearing it for 28+ hours			"

												It's a Rogue-Like, RPG, Rythm based movement game with  unlockable items, modes, and characters.  I have been hesitant to play it since I had first heard of it, but after playing it for the first time last weekend I can say I am happy with my purchase.Hours of fun and adventure can be had whether you just want to jam to the game's music, your own music, or just continuously restart out of frustration because you almost had it that time but the timing was off because of that stupid mushroom!           I can quit any time i want to. I dont have to keep dying on the same stage even if it is randomly generated. I can stop playing any time I want to and I will. Right as soon as i give the stage one more try, I have a plan that might help me this time...			"

												This is one of the only Early Access games that I have purchased very early on. It also happens to be the first early access that I have absolutely loved from the beginning and it's probably one of the only early access games that I purchased that actually came out as a complete game.Crypt of the Necrodancer immediately caught my eye because of its unique gameplay (or was it just an impulse buy because of the pun?). It's essentially a Rythm Roguelike game. It has most of the elements of a Rogue-like, except you have to stay on beat!The soundtrack is absolutely amazing (and now offered in 3 different variations!) and the game is deceivingly difficult. It's very easy to pick up, very hard to master and highly addictive.Even having played through the first 3 zones countless time while I waited for the fourth one to come out, then all four a bunch of times when it did, I still enjoy playing this game from time to time (I have played a lot more than Steam indicates.)I often despise randomly generated levels but in this game it works very well and follow a set of logical rules. Each level will always be similar while always offering something new. There are tons of different items that will help you on your runs and different characters that provide different challenges when you get bored of Cadence, the main character.A very charming and challenging game with a lot of replayability, fully worth the 16.99$.

												After playing this game I can say without a doubt.  This is one of the most addicting games I have played!  All of the positive feedback about this game is within good reason.  It's a great quick fix game and can be played for long periods of time as well.  Collecting more diamonds to buy items, and just trying to progress through the various levels of the crypt.The game does a great job of not holding your hand, and letting you experience how the game plays, how various monsters attack, and how to use items wisely.  This however is comparable to ""The Binding of Isaac"" in that it is a lot of trial and error.  So be perpared to die alot.  However, the game is very rewarding and never seems to trap you in a vicious cycle of repeated death without reason.I would highly recommend this to anyone who are fans of Rouge-like, or Rythm games!!!Kryptik Rating 9/10			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a unique game involving following the beat of the music, into your attacking and your movement. You can't just rush from one end to the exit in 3 seconds, you have to time your movements with the beat otherwise it wont work. Not to mention the amazing soundtrack this game has with Danny B, A_Rival, Familyjules7X, and others! There is now a new dlc being worked on and it is amazing, it is worth $6.99 or however much it costs when i'm writing this, There are new characters, new modes, new weapons, new shrines and enemies and there is more coming! They are constantly updating this game. Also it is never the same run every run, You will always find new weapons and tools with different dungeon layouts and boss orders, you can almost never get bored with the game always having a new run to offer along with amazing music.

												It’s a fun game in which you use the beat of the music to move and advance further, think of it as the binding of Isaac but with a rhythm that you have to keep up with in order to move. Much like Isaac the game is fairly short per playthrough but highly challenging. There are a lot of items in the game that you can pick up as you play, most are different from eachother and provide different experiences depending on what items you have.Thanks to the game’s randomly generated dungeons and challenging nature, every playthrough feels unique and different giving the game good replay value.If you are a fan of tapping to the beat of your favourite music this game is for you. The amazing soundtrack by Dannyb and it’s remixes gives the game a ton of charm and if that isn’t enough, you can use your own music in the game as well.As you progress through the game you’ll unlock new characters both playable and non-playable ones.The non-playable characters sometimes offer items that make the game easier but some are for practicing certain enemies or bosses. Practicing is helpful for learning enemy patterns.The playable characters that you can unlock are often harder characters that offer a bigger challenge, this includes; a character with double speed/beats, a character that dies if he picks up money, one that can only use bombs and many more.The game is good, check it out if you haven't. <3			"

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is a dungeon - crawler with rogue - like elements... Yeah, I know. Go ahead. Sigh if you want to. It's okay. I'll wait. Yes, it's true. We're currently in a market hugely oversaturated with ""dungeon-crawling roguelike"" titles. But unlike many other games of its genre, NecroDancer manages to stand out and hold its own with its unique and very fun spin on the familiar idea.The premise is simple enough. You enter the first floor of a procedurally-generated dungeon, moving in four cardinal directions, fighting various monsters and finding random treasure items such as weapons, armor, spells and consumables. On each floor of the dungeon there's a shopkeeper you can do business with.Sounds very familiar, right? Well this is where NecroDancer does things differently. Everything you do in the dungeon, such as moving, fighting, using items, and digging through walls... you have to synchronize with the beat of the music. All of the enemies follow this rule too, and as a result you have a system that's fairly easy to pick up and very satisfying to master and tinker with. On your first few runs you'll be so concerned with keeping the beat that you'll just throw yourself headfirst into enemies and traps, but you'll soon improve the point where timing yourself and enemies is second nature, and you'll beat the boss... only to have this cycle repeat itself in the new area you've unlocked. The game has a short and simple tutorial that explains how to play, but you'll have to learn the rest for yourself.Each run of the game gives you a newly generated layout, but between runs you have a sort of hub where you can unlock upgrades (very similar to something like Rogue Legacy), change characters, and train against monsters and bosses. Additionally, there's a daily challenge dungeon available to everyone.Music-wise, each floor of the dungeon has its own BGM. You can set the music to any MP3 you have on your computer (which works very well), but I kept going back to the original music because it's awesome. The default BGM fits the game perfectly.NecroDancer has full controller support, but doesn't really explain it. If you're using a 360 controller like I am, Use (A, B, X, and Y) to move in their respective cardinal directions. This applies to menus too, with B as confirm and X as back. My one qualm with this game so far is this somewhat awkward menu control.Overall, I would highly recommend Crypt of the NecroDancer to anyone. Whether you're a big fan of the genre or just someone looking for a fun title, it has something for you. NecroDancer is definitely worth its price tag.P.S. It's only in alpha and it's already this good It made it out of early accessP.P.S. Do I even need to mention the awesome cheesy pun in the title?P.P.P.S. You can even hook this game up to a USB dance pad, like something you'd use to play Dance Dance Revolution. I don't have one, and even if I did I'm far too lazy / would probably have a heart attack if I tried but STILL. YOU CAN DO THAT.			"

												This game is amazing! It's a mix of zelda dungeon crawlers with a rhythm game. I highly HIGHLY recommend this game if you want something to pass the time. The only problem with this game is that it gets repetative and after playing and losing/dying multiple times, you're going to need a slight break.Overall the replay factor is nice and if you want to actually play the game the ""proper"" way (in my opinion) you should definately use a controller.

												So, I bought this game a while ago after I had it on my wishlist for too long. And I have to say: I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!It's hard, it's frustrating but it also is pure awesomeness. After 7 hours of playing, I finally managed to beat Zone 1. Yes, it took me that long. Everytime I had a good run, this game kicked my butt and I died. And since it's rogue-like, you have to start from the beginning after every death. Normally I get really frustrated with games like this, but Crypt of the NecroDancer does everything right! Awesome music, awesome design, awesome gameplay. Most times playing it, after 1 or 2 hours I took a break, because it made me crazy to die over and over again. But I always try again. So I totally recommend it!GO!BUY IT! IT'S AWESOME!			"

												This game is beyond one of my favorite roguelikes. When you first start out it kinda is confusing on how to move. Basically you  just move to the music. If you dont like that then you can play bard. Bard doesnt have to move based on the beats. But the downside is that the enemies will move after you. The story is fantastic. The game is well worth its price although the only downside i have had with the game is dying alot. You get these really good items and then you die and it just flops. It is a game that is worth being in your library. The graphics are pixelart but why does that matter? Unless you're a graphics fanatic then i guess it does matter. If you do not like rougelikes then i would not recommend it because you will die alot and lose items ALOT.The badeges and emotes and backgrounds look nice on this game. Anyways if you dont like then you can always refund it and get money back.			"

								The best music around, coupled with the best music integration since Audiosurf, wrapped nicely into a roguelike dungeon crawler with plenty of depth.My biggest complaint is that there aren't any extra songs past the default for each level. You can have the game play any song you load, but the ingame music is so perfect that I wish they made more to choose from.RECOMMENDED for people who like dungeon crawlers or rhythm games. ESPECIALLY RECOMMENDED for people who like both.LESS RECOMMENDED for people who dislike permadeath. Everything can be countered, but you'll die a lot of times figuring out how.			"

												One, two, three, four, aah, AAAH, AARGH! ♥♥♥♥!Crypt of the Necrodancer is a beautifully crafted mix between a rhythm game and a tile-based roguelike. You play as one of several characters who are forced to move to the beat of a catchy soundtrack, each with their own quirk to make the game frustrating, painful, and gloriously addictive. Everything can be done using a single set of four context-sensitive buttons. Just press a direction to move, attack, or dig in that direction, and the game will pick the action most conducive to progress. That, of course, doesn't mean you're not going to die. Through the pressure of moving to the beat, you're going to make stupid decisions, and they will be entirely your fault. Every enemy telegraphs their moves and attacks in a predictable pattern, and if you end up cornered by three enemies and your back to a wall, you only have yourself to blame.Every zone has three floors and a boss. The stairs to the next floor are only opened by defeating the miniboss, but you can fall through a trapdoor at the song's end to get to the next floor, if you don't mind the miniboss and several other monsters following you down, forcing you to kill it before you can actually explore the floor.Each boss has their own quirks. King Conga skips the eigth beat, and if you miss a step he'll get off his throne and charge at you. Deep Blues is a literal chessboard, swarming you with pieces that you must clear out before the King stops running away. Coral Riff floods the area, creating water tiles that stop you from moving if you step in them. Death Metal works through several phases at the pace of the fastest song in the game.And, of course, there are the story bosses in the last zone if you're playing as Cadence, Melody, or Aria. Fight the Necrodancer and reclaim your freedom!You can choose to start at any zone after the furthest you've finished, at the cost of not being able to complete more than one zone at a time, or take a top-to-bottom all zones run that starts you with no character upgrades. Completing and exploring individual zones rewards you with diamonds, which allow you to upgrade your character, unlock equipment, spells, and weapons, or buy items to start with in your next zone run.Of course, unlocking items just means you can find them in your next runs! This is a roguelike after all, and every sword, armor, ring, and spell has to be found in the Crypt itself for you to use them.Play as Melody and only attack when moving! Don't get cornered!Play as Eli and blast your enemies to bits... if you don't blow yourself up first!Play as Dove and friendship the monsters away... for a while before they mob you!Play as Monk and find even more ways to die, since you can't touch money!Play as Dorian and realize that moving two spaces at once is more frustrating than helpful!Play as Bolt and learn that double speed is somehow both faster and slower than you expect!Play as Aria and discover that perfect rhythm is even harder when you gotta stay alive too!Play as Bard and move to your own beat... coward.And, once you've done all that, play as Coda, the Monk-Bolt-Aria hybrid. That's all the description you need. Good luck!Overall rating: 4/4 time.			"

Keeps you really stuck to the screen, while you hear to the masterfully crafted songs of Danny Baranowski, the same guy who did the song for the original Binding of Isaac.And it has custom music features, something I ALWAYS wished from a music based game, something Soundodge+ did.

												I feel like, with 590 hours, it's time for me to review this game.+Literally my favorite overall soundtrack of all time.  There is not a single song that I don't thoroughly enjoy.+Extremely fun and addictive gameplay, if you couldn't tell from the 590 hours.+There's something to do for all people, no matter the level of skill.  Unless you REALLY suck, that is, in which case, stick with bard zone 1 runs.  You might win one day.+Competetive leaderboards for speedrunners, scorerunners, or just people who can reliably win at characters.+Has a very nice subreddit community.+The shopkeeper sings to the music.  WHO DOESN'T LOVE THE SHOPKEEPER?+Very good if you like dying.+Good variation of weaponry and combat styles, with one or two completely impractical yet overpowered joke items thrown in for fun.-I would suggest not buying this game if you're an achievement hunter.  I'm relatively sure that nobody has ever achieved Lowest of the Low, due to the sheer luck and difficulty involved in doing so.-Help me.  I can't stop.-This game is hard as balls.

								Crypt of The Necrodancer is a really fun game that will keep you dancing for hours. Think of taking some of your favorite dungeon crawlers and adding a rhythm aspect to them, and you get this game. But remember, this is also a roguelike rhythm crawler, so that means death means you lose everything and start over from the very beginning. And yes, you really do have to beat things to the beat.

												10/10 and more if I could give it. I'm not typically a fan of rhythm games because it involves no more than correct button-press timing, but Crypt of the NecroDancer transforms rhythm gameplay into something much, much more than what other members of the genre do. Fantastic music, and so much room for replayability. My only irk with the game is some of the shop item prices. I got stuck at Zone 2 for a while and unlocked most of them by the time I finished it. Anyways, this is a great game. You should absolutely get it -- I got it on sale, but I would have absolutely paid for it at full price.			"

								Crypt of the Necrodancer is a fresh idea compared to roguelikes, turning the slow pace into a rhythm.  This keeps you moving while also trying to plan as you move.  Every enemy follows specific movement patterns, which is fairly easy to deal with one-by-one, but quick thinking will help you in scenarios with multiple enemies. "

								Tl:dr; Many games like to try and wear the ""easy to learn, hard to master"" hat. Crypt of the NecroDancer is one of the titles that wears that hat like a ♥♥♥♥in' champ.Crypt of the NecroDancer is a rythm game. No wait; it's a roguelike. No wait; it's both. It's a procedurally-generated labyrinth in which your actions come in pace with the music. It's an absolutely superlative example of the best Early Access has to offer; oodles of content that's already more than playable, and promising to only get better as time goes on.You play as Cadence, a novice gravedigger (I think; it's not really important) who makes one shovel cut in the wrong place too many. Now your still-beating heart has been stolen. Turns out this isn't as fatal as you'd expect, and it even means you can't die permanently, but it HAS made you a Slave to the Rythm(TM). Can you make it through the NecroDancer's lair in order to kill him and reclaim your heart? Or will you be a slave to the rythm for all eternity?Everything in the NecroDancer's crypts moves and acts to the beat of the music. You can use your own MP3s for this, but the included soundtrack from Danny Baranowsky is so awesome you won't need to. Mastering the beat of the music is the key to victory in this game.Remember when I said Crypt rocks the ""easy to learn, hard to master"" hat like a boss? This is why. Moving with the beat is one of those things which is very easy to wrap your head around, but mastering the beat is a whole other story. It's a simple concept executed flawlessly, made all the more satisfying by the fact that it makes you angry in the exact right way - with yourself. Harm comes because YOU screwed up. Failure becomes because YOU screwed up. At no point does the game throw anything at you that you can't deal with - or at least, can't learn to deal with it. We can all name dozens of games that are plain broken, where often failure comes because either the game did a whoopsie in its pants or because the random number generator decided it hates your face. Crypt doesn't do that. There's only one thing Crypt will get you angry with; yourself. And that makes it so very compelling. When you fail, you want to do better. You want to get back in there and get further - to wipe away the shame of your earlier failure. Before you know it, you're hooked.Speaking of which... I need to find a new vein so I can get another hit of this delicious juju.			"

Early Access Review
								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a fantastic entry into the Roguelike genre, so let's break it down.The primary draw of the game is the great music and how it is worked into the mechanics. In order to succeed you must move and attack to the beat of the song assigned for the floor. This is both simple and wickedly difficult to keep up, but the better you manage the more gold coins you earn due to a multiplier effect.Stats in most roguelikes depend heavily on luck in finding items or leveling up, but in CotND you can definitely succeed with just the basic starter gear. The reason why is because the game doesn't rely on huge health pools and in fact most monsters can be killed in a single hit and the only monster you MUST kill is the boss on the final floor. Playing conservatively is a very viable tactic because there are many ways to advance to the next floor and there is no leveling up that requires killing monsters.Each dungeon, at least for the moment, is three dane-a-thons of fun and a final boss. So game sessions are short and failure does not leave that typical bitter taste.There's a light quirky sense of humor, especially when the shopkeeper starts belting out tunes with the music. Colors are bright and all the monsters get a little dance-y jig which makes things pretty playful. If you're doing well you also get magical disco lighting all over the dungeon, huzzah!This is the Roguelike for people who like music and a shorter, more meaningful play session. The game itself isn't super long, but the random elements and multiple character types will keep you as busy as you would like.Final Score: A-			"

In this game you move to the beat of the song, if you can do that you have already mastered the game go home and get some ice cream or something or if you're like me it offers a very nice challenge and a rhythm in your erm fingers?

												Got on steam sale, was hesitant to buy and am SO glad I did.  This is a fantastic rhythm game.  The focus is about unlocking powerup spawns and learning each enemy while grooving to an awesome beat.  The dungeons are randomly generated, but each zone has its own theme which remains the same in any mode (music, enemies, and art).  There are also different game modes; they are not drastically different but definately different enough to change it up a bit.  This game is something kinda new because of the rythm based movement, but DEF worth trying out. 10/10 recommend getting this game if unsure- I know I was and I don't regret this purchase at all!

I'm very glad I was proven wrong. CotN is a fast-paced and quick-witted game based around completing actions based on the beat of the music playing in the background, and I found it quite amazing. It has a ton of replay value, it keeps you on edge and requires split-second reactions. Also, the music is really f*ckin' good. Maybe I'm biased, maybe I'm not.

												This game includes more differences than other rhythm games and differences are mostly positive. Firstly, you don't have to move with continuously flowing display like that audiosurf, beat hazard, guitar hero etc. so you can choice your own destiny. In short this is the first platform music game. Secondly, this game have useful workshop that allows creating mode easily althought there is no tools belong to game. If you are music producer and want to know your music will be able to dance to people, Necro will give the right answer. Thirdly, you can convert your room to gym, all you need is dancepad and deaf neighbors. Besides, skin workshop is still confusing, gameplay is really difficult fortunately dungeon's songs are awesome, therefore I can listen same song over and over without getting tired.

Every level is randomly generated and challenging in its own right, but there is always a bunch of orderly and easy to learn patterns to every enemy you will encounter. This isn't a game for everyone, but it's a game worth trying despite the fact that it isn't fully developed yet.Sure, the game is a bunch of pixels and the learning curve is a bit harsh. But the satisfaction of beating a single level keeps me coming back for another beating, the default music is awesome, and the game never ceases to be interesting.

												It's a fun take on the roguelike genre. As a musician I really enjoy the way rhythm is incorporated in to the game mechanics. However I'd love to be able to somehow define the rhythm interpretation of the custom tunes, because I'd love to utilize some more progressive tunes in the game as well :)After a while it starts to become a bit repetitive and frustrating, but it offers quite good fun for some time at least. Interesting and definitely a bit different game from the others, so definitely recommended to check out especially if you are a musician!			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is definitely one of the most unique roguelike games I’ve ever played, with the added bonus of actually resembling rogue instead of using roguelike as another term for “permadeath without saves”.  You play a family of musicians (or a motley crew of side-characters) determined to unlock the mystery of the magical lute and defeat the Necrodancer, a cursed necromantic bard.True to its name, you “dance” around each level by moving in tune to the rhythm meter at the bottom of the screen. Each level has its own tune and rhythm and the game steadily increases the pace as you progress. Keeping in tune with the music while vanquishing enemies will net you a higher multiplier which increases the amount of gold you find, in addition to enhancing certain special items found throughout the crypt. Failing to keep to the beat will cause your multiplier to go down and may also prevent you from moving. Since the monsters in the game also move to the beat, they will eventually close in on you to attack and you cannot stand still to “pause” the action (unless you’re playing the bard character). I found the soundtrack for CotN to be excellent and very diverse. Each level’s song fits its theme pretty well and there are a few tracks that are instantly catchy. The shopkeeper in each level will also sing along with the music, giving a clue to his location, and all of the monsters are either music-themed or have a name alluding to some musical term or instrument, adding an extra layer of detail to this thoroughly polished game.There really aren’t any faults with this game that would prevent any fan of rogues from picking it up (playing as Aria is extremely hard though) and, even if you’re not normally into games in this genre, the learning curve is very fair. This game is worth picking up even at its original cost, though if you can catch it at the average sale price of $5 it’s quite a steal!			"

												I waited to get this game for weeks and I was not disappointed. It's an absolute joy to play, balancing the strategy of roguelikes with the addictiveness of rhythm games. Even though the game itself is short, there's a surprising amount of content with several characters and dozens of items to unlock. Some characters even have their own alternate soundtracks, which constantly keeps the game fresh even after dozens of plays.Really, the only stain marring of this gem is the game's poorly-designed story mode. In order to see all of the game's cutscenes, bosses and songs, one must beat it from start to finish with three specific characters. The first two are fine, but the third is an insane leap in difficulty that requires weeks of practice and an incredible streak of luck to beat.Final verdict: If you pick up this game, expect to have a good time while it lasts. Try out all the characters, pick up some mods, get some achievements, but don't expect that you'll be able to finish it.			"

												It's a Rogue-Like, RPG, Rythm based movement game with  unlockable items, modes, and characters.  I have been hesitant to play it since I had first heard of it, but after playing it for the first time last weekend I can say I am happy with my purchase.Hours of fun and adventure can be had whether you just want to jam to the game's music, your own music, or just continuously restart out of frustration because you almost had it that time but the timing was off because of that stupid mushroom!           I can quit any time i want to. I dont have to keep dying on the same stage even if it is randomly generated. I can stop playing any time I want to and I will. Right as soon as i give the stage one more try, I have a plan that might help me this time...			"

								First off I like to say I really enjoy this game not only because of the unique concept but also because it requires a lot of skill and knowlegde.You could say it is a turn based rogue-like, though the beat is the turn, so if you don't follow the beat you will lose your chance to do something.It takes some time to get used to the game, and there will be a lot of deaths, but at some point you will start learning the patterns and that is when the game really begins, you can speedrun it, score run it and you can even race it with other people.Even if it is a early access game, it got so much content and depth I would recommend buying it right now! Another thing to consider is the community it is great try going to the Necrodancer forums and you will see all kinds of great discussions.Be a NECRODANCER today!			"

								I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical of this game when I first started.  I loved DDR and I love roguelikes, but to mix the two?  What fresh madness was this?  THIS WAS THE EPIC MUSIC MADNESS OF THE DEEP!  The music is energetic and fun, the game is easy to learn and the tutorial is short (seriously, VERY short, but all you need to know).The game is most certainly a roguelike, no saves, randomized layouts and drops.  But that's just the beginning.  Your ability to sync your movements to the beat isn't just a gimmick.  This mechanic rewards you with things like coin bonuses for the long combos you can create as you dance through the levels.  It requires you to plan while you move, if you stop, you miss a beat and you lose your combo.  The game is simple and addicting.  You never feel too bad about dying because you use the rewards you gained from the previous play to help you on your next, simply perpetuating your endless jimmy through the dark tunnels as you slay monsters with  your dance moves and your beat only legend can recount.A bit pricey at $15.  I bought it on sale and it was well worth the money.  If you love roguelikes and love awesome soundtracks, it could very well be worth the money.  If you're on the fence, wait for a sale and jump on the deal like Jon Travolta on a disco beat.			"

								This game brings Rouge like Dungeon exploration and Rhythm Games Together into the game we call ""Crypt of the NecroDancer"". Bringing you into 3 Different zones each containing their own sort of enemies. Each zone containing 3 levels and 1 Boss Level. Each boss having their own rhythm, keeping you on feet trying to learn how each of them move and react. At the moment you can play as 4 different characters. Some might have a easier way of playing, or a harder challenge to conqour. The game is currently in early access but is still worth buying and playing for yourself.This game will keep you curious for a long time thinking of what this game will bring once it gets out early access.

								Crypt of the Necrodancer is the game where you think you're good at beating down monsters to the beat... then you unlock hardcore mode. You think of this as impossible as Zone 3 is one giant zerg rush of skeleton horses and elemental enemies. Nonetheless you try it anyway and manage to get some decent gear. Then a red dragon comes along and says ""♥♥♥♥ you!"" and you get one shot by a fireball because you can't do the sacred red dragon dance at that moment. (That's my life, i cri evertim ;;) But seriously, this game is amazing in many aspects. It's hard to find a game where a particular character dies from picking up GOLD, of all things! Since the levels are randomly generated there is no true pattern to the game and permanent death is indeed a thing. So that guy that dies from picking up gold? He's no exception, better watch your step! Oh yeah, and the only way you can move/attack/dig/open chests is by hitting the arrow key in the direction that you want to go on the beat of the song that's playing. There's a nice little tutorial in-game for that, though. However, there is one thing that bugs me about Crypt of the Necrodancer. That is, the diamonds that are used to purchase items to be put into the item pool for non-hardcore runs. It would make more sense to have everything unlocked already, like hardcore does, but you are forced to buy it using diamonds you find during non-hardcore runs. It's a bit more harmful than helpful and everything should just be unlocked for you to use when it's found. Despite that, this game is well worth your time. I've got 60+ hours and counting clocked into Crypt of the Necrodancer and it's not like I'll be stopping anytime soon. If you like challenging games, get this game. If you like rogue-likes, get this game. If you like rhythm based games, get this game. The point is, just buy the freaking game! What're you waiting for? Scroll back up and click that ""Add to cart"" button!			"

												For the rogue-like and rhythm fans alike, this game provides an amazing soundtrack, lots of replay ability with its randomly generated levels, items, and bosses, as well as amazing pixel art! If you don't have this game, buy it now, it's worth every penny! (And for the people who are a bit tight when it comes to pecuniary measures, don't worry, this game has been on sale a lot these past few days!) I'd recommend this to any friend or family member who wants to have a great, grooving time! I'm extremely glad I can be a part of this community too. I honestly need to start a real life group that's filled with people who love the game as much as I do, because Crypt of the NecroDancer is one of my favorite games due to the amount of detail the sound crew, pixel artists, and everyone else had done (I also have to thank the person who made the puns for everyone of the enemy names personally, they're amazing without a doubt)! Although I only have around 50 hours of playing the game, you can bet on the shopkeeper's amazing voice that you'll love it too. And if the wide variety of characters, weapons, etc. aren't enough for you, you can even download mods! A personal favorite of my being the Captain Falcon reskins with sound, truly amazing.) With a great community and even greater team, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a must have. And now, after the real review is over, I must now make a musical pun to balance out the silliness (and to show respect for the beautiful, beautiful man/woman/team who came up with the puns.). Let's see... oh, I have one! If you do not like this game for whatever reason, then you can kindly and respectfully kiss my brass! Heh, I don't mean to toot my own horn or anything, but musical puns are the 'key' to success!

								Another day, another roguelike. This one has a very unique and downright fun mechanic - move to the music! Every move you make, every attack you make, needs to be on time with the (very well done, and very enjoyable) background track. Stay on beat and get more money to buy upgrades, miss beats, get attacked and probably get dead.Watch the intro video for a quick idea of how this works.Gamewise, this is your average roguelike dungeon crawler. It is fun, and the music mechanic is enough to carry the game through its few shortfalls, Bear in mind that this is early access and there is a decent amount of missing content. Many upgrades are not available, and one entire dungeon did not exist at time of writing.Recommend steering clear of the the ""add your own music"" feature, because frankly, it's crap. Beats continuing through silence, they're not detected accurately, and so on. The pack-in tracks are good enough that you won't want to do this anyways.That said, those minor issues aside, I really recommend this game in spite of the unfinished-ness. If this game is this good at this stage in its development, really, it can only get better. Thumbs up!			"

												Let me just say, I didn't really know what I was getting into when I first bought the game. I thought ""oh, it's just going to be a fun little rythem game that I could easily beat"". I was so wrong. It was a game that was easy to learn and hard to master. The first zone was actually more difficult then I expected, but I beat it without troble. By the time zone 3 came, I was just about to throw my controller. But, I kept going, kept persisting and eventually I beat all of the zones. But, the replability comes in with new characters with differnt atributes that kept me coming back to play again. This game is harder then I thought, but it was definitly worth my money.Pros:-Fun, simple rythem game.-Ability to use custom music. (Just hearing Weird Al sing Bukingham Blues on the Deep Blues boss was sooooooooooooooo satisfying.)-Tons of differnt characters to unlock.-All zones mode to dare the experanced players.-Clean, pixel graphics.-Awsome music. (There are three versions too!)Cons:-Needs more weapons/items to unlock, I basicly got them all once I reached zone 3 with my first character.-Needs an online co-op (Local feels like multiplayer in the 90's)-Needs a better interface on the level creator. (I found it slightly annoying actually, you have to use the arrow keys, enter and delete and it quickly got tedious.)Overall I give this game 9/10. I had a lot of fun with it and it has the potential to pack in a ton more hours. "

												This game is beyond one of my favorite roguelikes. When you first start out it kinda is confusing on how to move. Basically you  just move to the music. If you dont like that then you can play bard. Bard doesnt have to move based on the beats. But the downside is that the enemies will move after you. The story is fantastic. The game is well worth its price although the only downside i have had with the game is dying alot. You get these really good items and then you die and it just flops. It is a game that is worth being in your library. The graphics are pixelart but why does that matter? Unless you're a graphics fanatic then i guess it does matter. If you do not like rougelikes then i would not recommend it because you will die alot and lose items ALOT.The badeges and emotes and backgrounds look nice on this game. Anyways if you dont like then you can always refund it and get money back.			"

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is a dungeon - crawler with rogue - like elements... Yeah, I know. Go ahead. Sigh if you want to. It's okay. I'll wait. Yes, it's true. We're currently in a market hugely oversaturated with ""dungeon-crawling roguelike"" titles. But unlike many other games of its genre, NecroDancer manages to stand out and hold its own with its unique and very fun spin on the familiar idea.The premise is simple enough. You enter the first floor of a procedurally-generated dungeon, moving in four cardinal directions, fighting various monsters and finding random treasure items such as weapons, armor, spells and consumables. On each floor of the dungeon there's a shopkeeper you can do business with.Sounds very familiar, right? Well this is where NecroDancer does things differently. Everything you do in the dungeon, such as moving, fighting, using items, and digging through walls... you have to synchronize with the beat of the music. All of the enemies follow this rule too, and as a result you have a system that's fairly easy to pick up and very satisfying to master and tinker with. On your first few runs you'll be so concerned with keeping the beat that you'll just throw yourself headfirst into enemies and traps, but you'll soon improve the point where timing yourself and enemies is second nature, and you'll beat the boss... only to have this cycle repeat itself in the new area you've unlocked. The game has a short and simple tutorial that explains how to play, but you'll have to learn the rest for yourself.Each run of the game gives you a newly generated layout, but between runs you have a sort of hub where you can unlock upgrades (very similar to something like Rogue Legacy), change characters, and train against monsters and bosses. Additionally, there's a daily challenge dungeon available to everyone.Music-wise, each floor of the dungeon has its own BGM. You can set the music to any MP3 you have on your computer (which works very well), but I kept going back to the original music because it's awesome. The default BGM fits the game perfectly.NecroDancer has full controller support, but doesn't really explain it. If you're using a 360 controller like I am, Use (A, B, X, and Y) to move in their respective cardinal directions. This applies to menus too, with B as confirm and X as back. My one qualm with this game so far is this somewhat awkward menu control.Overall, I would highly recommend Crypt of the NecroDancer to anyone. Whether you're a big fan of the genre or just someone looking for a fun title, it has something for you. NecroDancer is definitely worth its price tag.P.S. It's only in alpha and it's already this good It made it out of early accessP.P.S. Do I even need to mention the awesome cheesy pun in the title?P.P.P.S. You can even hook this game up to a USB dance pad, like something you'd use to play Dance Dance Revolution. I don't have one, and even if I did I'm far too lazy / would probably have a heart attack if I tried but STILL. YOU CAN DO THAT.			"

												After playing this game I can say without a doubt.  This is one of the most addicting games I have played!  All of the positive feedback about this game is within good reason.  It's a great quick fix game and can be played for long periods of time as well.  Collecting more diamonds to buy items, and just trying to progress through the various levels of the crypt.The game does a great job of not holding your hand, and letting you experience how the game plays, how various monsters attack, and how to use items wisely.  This however is comparable to ""The Binding of Isaac"" in that it is a lot of trial and error.  So be perpared to die alot.  However, the game is very rewarding and never seems to trap you in a vicious cycle of repeated death without reason.I would highly recommend this to anyone who are fans of Rouge-like, or Rythm games!!!Kryptik Rating 9/10			"

 Crypt of the NecroDancer review 	After 200 hours of playtime I think it is finally the time to do a review of Crypt of the NecroDancer... so lets get startedCrypt of the NecroDancer is a Rythm based Rouge-like, so If you like the awesome soundtrack and don`t mind restarting from the beginning, then this would be the perfect game for you.+Great Soundtrack by DannyB (Also did music for Meatboy etc.), A_Rival and FamilyJules7x+Graphics - They fit the game really good (Dancing skeletons too)+Easy contols (You only have to use 4 arrow keys, but you can bind the button combos to other buttons too)+Contoller/Dancepad support+Highly skill based (You can beat the game without picking up any items)+Awesome Shopkeeper+++ Finally beating that boss you never beaten before-Getting into the game, as you have to learn the enemy pattern, get into the beat etc.Crypt of the Necrodancer gets a solid 9.5/10 from me :Pbtw... only game you can play with 1 hand  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												This is an amazing game that I would highly recommend to people who love music and dungeon crawlers. All variations of the soundtrack are nice and suit the game, and the ability to use your own music is a good feature to have. The gameplay is great and once you get the hang of the game it becomes very addicting to try and complete the game. Highly recommended.EDIT: With the release of the new ""Amplified"" DLC recently, the game feels even better than before. The remastered version of the metal soundtrack sounds even better than the original versions did, and all the new items, as well as the new zone and character, add so much more to the original game.

Its awesome!Just moving on the beat is great, seeing this unique bosses and music is geater but all coming making necrodancer is the best.Totaly worth it!Well, wait before buying.Maybe you need to (illigal) download it first, just to make sure you enjoy it. Dont want to waste money right?Learing patterns and being tactical and having quick flexibels it recommended. You can still have fun, but you cant unlock further things that are making this game awesome!Ohyea, having a controller or something like that makes it much easier, then you can sit back, relax, listen to the music, and rage some couple of times....To be honest.... I give this game a :8++ The music + Unique, havent seen this before+ Full controller support, including dancepad! Whait they still exist?+ After beating all the zones, there is so much other things to do!+ You can sit back while doing this+ Good value- You need to learn patterns etc. Even while sitting back and relax you need to focus to dont rage!- Some people consider its too hard and its not woth the price, i argee and im not a prof player but i made al the zones so,,, its possible "

Play through each zone seperately and aquire gems to unlock new equipment and expand your health or magic, and then attempt Hardcore Mode where the game really begins. Completion of hardcore modes takes skill and concentration, but the feeling of actually doing well at it is quite rewarding. Unlike many other roguelikes, this game is NOT gear dependant.

												DDR meets Spelunkey. Shopkeepers sing along to the music. Fight a chess-themed boss. Murder or get murdered. And DANCE to fantastic music! Yes. The beats are much more forgiving than a standard rhythm game, and if even those are too hard, there's a Bard character that eliminates the need for beats entirely. The weapons are balanced to be more than just extra numbers taped on to a sword (most change your attack pattern) and permenant upgrades help out a lot in later levels. 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Originality300/10 Soundtrack+1 Title Pun+1 Singing Shopkeepers+1 Import custom musicTotal: 322/30 (Must buy if you're at all interested in this kind of thing)			"

												With the surge in popularity of roguelikes, it was an eventuality that developers would need to do something other than merely make another punishing dungeon crawler like the original Rogue. While there have been many grand takes on the formula by entrants like Rogue Legacy, FTL, and Nuclear Throne, the last concept I was expecting was a roguelike crossed with a rhythm game. I wondered how this mashup would even work, but it turned out that the answer was quite simple; you just press the arrow keys in time with the music’s beat while traversing floors of a dungeon. Simple premise, but Necrodancer is deviously challenging because of its rhythmical movement, even if it can suffer from incredible roguelike luck.Dance Dance Revolution meets a dungeon crawler is the quickest and easiest way to define the game. Both the enemies and your movements are tied to the music’s beat, where trying to move on an offbeat will result in an awkward hop in place, and skipping a beat will act as a ‘passed turn’, both dropping your combo. Most enemies have a specific pattern or interaction with the beat, like how skeletons will raise their arms for one beat before moving forward on the following one, or how minotaurs will charge in a straight rhythmic line upon direct sight. Learning these patterns and quirks will let you dance around enemies, and pulling out deft, tactical evasions of enemy mobs never fails to be incredibly satisfying. Items and equipment are available to be discovered or purchased (via a rather vocal and potentially homicidal shopkeeper), including weaponry like longswords that supply an extra square of attack range, boots that let you walk across hazards without a care, rings that bestow various effects like increasing the amount of gold dropped by enemies, spectacles that will let you see what treasure you’ll get from chests and other containers, and other fun utilities. Some loadouts of equipment are more preferable than others, and gathering them becomes a priority in order to make later sections laughably easy. No need to worry about lava or ice when you can just float above the floor! No need to worry about health when you have a blood bow that lets you kill enemies from afar and replenish your health! There are trade-offs between items and gear of course and your ‘this is the run’ loadout will no doubt vary from my own, but once you get an optimal loadout, the game’s later challenging sections become trivial save for boss fights. On the flip side, poor luck resulting in less than ideal loadouts can also occur, and raw player skill can only go so far in some cases.The challenge in Necrodancer primarily comes from how the enemies never -ever- falter in their timing and movements with the music; The player however can (and will, on your first few attempts) make mistakes, thus making a missed beat punishing or potentially run-ending - Not to mention you lose your gold multiplier from being struck by an enemy. Many roguelikes require situational and environmental awareness in order to avoid losing a run, but Necrodancer demands auditory awareness on top of it all, what with how the music is your means of moving. Thankfully the developers included a visual aid of a heart that beats with every beat, as well as scales that close in on the heart to cue you on when movement or attacking is possible, which is both kind and intelligent on their part. I cannot list the number of times I’ve panicked and had to look at the heart beat in order to get back on rhythm. The music doesn’t last forever however, and if you’re still on the dungeon floor before the song ends and you don’t reach the exit, you’ll automatically be ejected to the next floor. Also as a kind gesture there’s a bestiary that lets you practice against encountered enemies to study their patterns and traits - Considering the later difficulty, these aids help balance the field. Necrodancer had more characters and modes of play added during its period in early access, like dance mat support, a cooperative mode, and even a custom track function to let you jive around dungeon floors with your own music. The core game doesn’t really change, it simply becomes modified with the various characters and different rules. There’s even a puzzle mode that gives you a floor to tackle using specific items and strategies that quickly becomes head scratching, and of course included is a daily seed that gives all players the same dungeon to take on and go for a high score. Once you get a solid grasp of the game and can get successful runs frequently, these various ways to play improve the longevity of a game that would’ve otherwise been rather short and easy to gleam over.Your purchase for Crypt of the Necrodancer will primarily rely on whether or not you enjoy the soundtrack; if you don’t, chances are you’re not going to have a good time. Rhythm games can only be so enjoyable if the soundtrack doesn’t sit well with the player, and in my case I’m a fan for most of Necrodancer’s tracks. Danny Baranowsky’s composition is full, vibrant and seldom with any musical downtime, which lends a very active listening experience to the game; for a game where the combat and movement is based on musical beats, having any song be boring or lacking instrumentation would result in dull gameplay. The backing synth for many of the tracks end up giving the soundtrack an almost gothic/horror feel but doing so within its techno/rocking manner. Of course, that’s when you discover later on that there are not one but -two- remixed soundtracks in later sections of the story mode, with the first striking chords of a laser disco and the second more grounded in reality with heavier, nastier rock. All three soundtracks have been uploaded to YouTube if you want to judge for yourself, which is advisable homework when it comes to purchasing rhythm games.Necrodancer’s strengths lie in its longevity, challenge and gimmick; like many roguelikes the difficulty does become somewhat trivial once you are knowledgeable of its components and mechanics. That said, the demands the game makes of the player ensures that you can know what items work well together and can dance around enemy patterns easily, but it all means nothing if you can’t execute tactfully. Back up this challenge with fantastic music and multiple ways to play, and you get a roguelike that is both satisfying and incredibly enjoyable.			"

								I have only one word for this game: YES. This is one of the not-so-many games that are worth buying for the FULL PRICE in Early Acces. And it gets even better, becuase the soundtrack is made by Danny Baranowsky ( the same guy who made the music for The Binding of Isaac & Super Meat Boy ). This game grants you fun, frustration, mainly frustration, and eargasms. And yet you'll keep coming back to the game, trying to reach further zones, or even your Personal Best.What I am saying is: Get this game. It's more than worth it.			"

It's a shame to see some cheaters mucking up the scoreboard now, but I'm sure dev's will take care of that in time.The sound track is awesome and the remixes for Aria and Melody are fantastic.Despite most rouge likes Crypt of the Necrodancer doesn't seem luck based, or at least the luck is very balanaced out with skill.

												You buy it now! I mean it.This is a concept game, and an incredibly good idea!Four keys are required to play, the arrows, nothing else. And with these four keys, you will ""dance"" on the music toward victory! or a quick death... Every step you take is a move, an attack, or a special action. On a slow music, you have about one move per second, a lots of time to think and make the best choice... but on a fast music, your reflexes will be challenged because the smallest error can kill you.The game offers many different items, all offering different advantages. The strategical value here is to know when to buy or not an item depending on your situation. Every game feels different with the random dungeons and you will never get bored playing.The game also displays many different monsters, all with a unique AI. Some are easy, you will love them; some are nasty, and you will hate them. The game doesn't force you to kill all ennemies of course, only one : the boss... but killing ennemies give you gold, and gold give you better objects. You will have to decide all the time if you risk it or not... quick! You have one music beat to decide! Oh too late... :)			"

												DDR meets Spelunkey. Shopkeepers sing along to the music. Fight a chess-themed boss. Murder or get murdered. And DANCE to fantastic music! Yes. The beats are much more forgiving than a standard rhythm game, and if even those are too hard, there's a Bard character that eliminates the need for beats entirely. The weapons are balanced to be more than just extra numbers taped on to a sword (most change your attack pattern) and permenant upgrades help out a lot in later levels. 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Originality300/10 Soundtrack+1 Title Pun+1 Singing Shopkeepers+1 Import custom musicTotal: 322/30 (Must buy if you're at all interested in this kind of thing)			"

								Rating: 9/10Quote I would use: It's like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon with a Rythmic Twist!Such a new idea for a game!The game is like a dungeon crawler with a twist, you move to the beat.When I first heard of this idea, I thought it would be a silly gimick with nothing to it.But when I started playing to the Amazing soundtrack (same guy who did the Supermeatboy soundtrack),I was having alot of fun with it, killing enemies with my sword to the amazing and quick beat (theres a little timeline for you to follow the beat to). I haven't played too much of the story but It gave me a nice cheesy epic vibe.I was surpised to be able to use my own songs to play to the game (this is so awesome and appreciated.The Dungeons re-generate making every experience challenging and unique. The enemies are killed in a way I haven't seen before which is cool! This game is also super awesome to play with a buddy.The game is easy to learn but hard to master (you will die alot at first).Absolutely recommended. "

												A roguelike (i.e. a turn based game where you explore a dungeon, with a different layout every game, finding loot and slaying monsters), with the turns set to a musical beat. NecroDancer negates most of the genre's traditional flaws.NecroDancer has adorable pixel art in a style reminiscent of the good 2D Legend of Zelda games, but more colourful. Roguelikes traditionally have either ASCII art or crappy looking tiles.NecroDancer is fast paced and games typically last no more than 30 minutes. Roguelikes traditionally take hours to play.NecroDancer has wonderful music and sounds. Roguelikes traditionally have either nonexistent or very bad music and sound effects.NecroDancer has simple, predictable rules for enemies (albeit challenging because you have to act on them fast). Roguelikes traditionally make the dungeon monsters all behave erratically.NecroDancer has simple controls. You play with literally just the arrow keys, occasionally pressing 2 arrows together. Traditional roguelikes such as NetHack not only have a different action for every single character A through Z both with and without the shift key, but also have an ""extended"" set of commands that you have to type by name to use, because there just aren't enough keys on a keyboard for them.The main downside is that NecroDancer is really difficult to play if you have a massive hangover like I do right now. Traditional roguelikes are no more punishingly difficult than usual when you can barely see the screen and have to stare at each individual inch with one eye, because you can just take as long as you need to pray at the porcelain throne in between turns.

								As i am writing this please keep in mind this is from the early alpha build so there may be many things yet to be added into the game in the near future.This game is a really good mix of rhythm meets rouge-like rpg, when you begin you have little on you and can only move when the beat hits the sweet spot (or something like that), and as you go deeper into the Crypt, or zones (whatever you prefer), you will meet stronger monsters and newer upgrades, all of which have a unique take of gameplay. Please also note that you will die a few times on your first try but thats ok, when you die you have a chance to spend any gathered diamonds on upgrades or extra items found in chests and then try again. The Crypts/zones are always randomised meaning not every run will be the same, some will be easy as in the exit is right in front of you, other times you would need to fight through a mini-army to exit the place and will bring many challenges for you to face. At the end of each Crypt/zone, ussually on the forth floor, you will face one of three bosses, all of which brings an interesting take to battle.And if you get board with the in-game soundtrack (no idea why since the merchants singing is quite fun) you can always add your own music and try get through with your own beats.So far the alpha has three Crypts/zones with the forth in the making still, but what i've seen the game is really good and i would recommend this game to anyone for how fun its turned out to be.Personally i give this game a 9/10 (c^_^c)			"

												This game, just by hearing the type that it is, causes most people to doubt it or wrinkle their nose in confusion. You'd probably think that at first too, it's a dungeon crawler, a rhythm game, and a totally amazing rogue-like game. How does it work? We may never know, but one thing's for certain: a game of this difficulty that's this fun to play deserves more recognition. Like, a lot more. The soundtracks, all three of them, all provide something awesome to the game. I've only had it for a couple days now (yeah, I'm that guy who shows up three hours into the party and acts all cool about it) but that doesn't mean I don't know that this is a game far beyond amazing. Cheers to everyone at Brace Yourself Games, you've created a masterpiece of a game that lots of people will agree is easily one of the best rhythm games out there. I'd go on, but there are too many things that are awesome about this game that I'd probably end up breaking the character limit or something. Don't worry Rhythm Heaven, you've always got a special place in my heartBut seriously, get this game. It's more than worth the $15, no doubt about it.			"

												If you haven't bought this already, buy it.Pros: The dungeons are different every time.Tons of characters with very different playstyles (ex the default character has to move to the beat, another one can move to his own beat, one more has infinite bombs, etc.)The music will get you. I literally cannot get the music out of my head.Pretty easy to understand. You only use the arrow keys.Daily Challenge (if that's your thing). Every day a random dungeon is set up and you get one run to score as high as possible. There's a global leaderboard.Pop in your own music and play to its beats.Cons:If you don't like rhythm games, well you won't like this. It is very VERY hard at first. You meet lots of enemies who each have their own movement and attack patterns. You will probably die a lot, and it can be frustrating. There are a lot of items that can make the game either a (relative) breeze or very hard if you don't have them.I don't really know if it's a con or not, but it was frustrating.End of list.TL;DRThis is my GOTY.

												BUY/SALE/PASS: Buy - Feel free to buy at full price.Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rhythm roguelike dungeon crawler action RPG from developer Brace Yourself Games and publisher Klei Entertainment, and if the description of the game is confusing, don’t worry.  So is the game.  Players are dropped into randomly generated dungeons and tasked to explore as deep as possible without dying.  Death is permanent; when you die, you start from the beginning all over again.Exploring, fighting, looting, moving, everything is played to the beat of the Danny Baranowsky chiptune soundtrack.  You are likely to die many, many times as you come to learn the various kinds of loot you’ll find and the multitude of enemies to fight.  The good news is that the game is ultimately fun to play and enjoy for players who are into rhythm games and randomized dungeons; the bad news is that getting to that point is layered underneath the frustration of not knowing what to do for the first few hours.  Stick with it long enough, and this game becomes really engrossing to play.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is phenomenal. It gives a full roguelike experience but with a unique twist - all movement and actions must be done in sync with the background music. It really is, in effect, a cross between a classic roguelike and a rhythm game such as DDR or osu!This is more than just a gameplay gimmick. The entire game relies deliberate consistent movement and fast thinking. All enemies have very predictable attack patterns but that hardly makes the game easy. When you have to contend with several different enemies and traps on the screen at once the difficulty can get very challenging, especially in the later levels.Like all roguelikes, you, as a player, get exponentially better with game experience and knowledge. At first even the earliest floors of the dungeon may seem impossible, but as you start getting faster at processing your situation and taking advantage of your resources, you're able to delve deeper and deeper into the crypt with less effort. Eventually you may find even the nastiest enemies have no chance against your well timed steps. The skill ceiling is so high it's actually possible to beat all consecutive areas without taking damage using the starting weapon. In fact, there is a character and achievement for doing just this.The best part is that it's all just so satisfying. Not only does everything about this game feel well thought out and balanced, it's hard to express just how good it feels to take all of your actions in time with the music. Every living (or unliving) thing in the dungeon is literally dancing or bobbing its head in sync with the rhythm and it's all just so.. fun! Did I mention the soundtrack is awesome? The soundtrack is awesome.			"

												No game has had songs looping through my head quite like this one.  The game was a lot of fun as well, definitely play with a controller.  It reminded me of Rogue Legacy in that when you start out you'll probably die quite a bit, then as you go you'll both unlock items to help you get better and you'll learn tricks on helping yourself.  There are boss fights as well, but I didn't find them as challenging as the levels preceeding them.  That's a blessing, because sometimes making it to the boss at all is enough of a challenge.  I love that they did music DLC, something I think other games should try sometime.			"

												I got this game a few months ago and it is really fun to play!The reason I keep coming back to this game are these reasons:   -Great soundtrack   -Decent story (after finishing the first character, Cadence)   -Great gameplay   -Isn't a game you will beat in a week or two   -5 different soundtracks   -Support for custom music   -Mod support (texture mods and music replacements)   -Level editor (You need to beat the game with one character first)That all may sound great, but this game is NOT for everyone!  This game requires a lot of patience and practice.  It's fairly straight forward to play, but extremely hard to master.  The game requires you to beat each zone (individually at least) without missing a beat of the song and perfect movements.  If you cannot keep tempo/rhythm, this will not be a game for you.  The game heavily relies on you to be able to keep up with fast tempos.  If you can't do that, this game may not be for you! This game, however could be good for you if you do want to practice keeping tempo.I would rate this game 9/10 for being ridiculously fun, but a bit infuriating when trying to beat the game with a harder character (like Aria or the monk)			"

												BUY/SALE/PASS: Buy - Feel free to buy at full price.Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rhythm roguelike dungeon crawler action RPG from developer Brace Yourself Games and publisher Klei Entertainment, and if the description of the game is confusing, don’t worry.  So is the game.  Players are dropped into randomly generated dungeons and tasked to explore as deep as possible without dying.  Death is permanent; when you die, you start from the beginning all over again.Exploring, fighting, looting, moving, everything is played to the beat of the Danny Baranowsky chiptune soundtrack.  You are likely to die many, many times as you come to learn the various kinds of loot you’ll find and the multitude of enemies to fight.  The good news is that the game is ultimately fun to play and enjoy for players who are into rhythm games and randomized dungeons; the bad news is that getting to that point is layered underneath the frustration of not knowing what to do for the first few hours.  Stick with it long enough, and this game becomes really engrossing to play.			"

												Brace Yourself Games has developed easily one of the most creative games I've played recently.  Crypt of the Necrodancer combines the roguelike/rhythm genres to produce a dungeon crawler that summons memories of Michael Jackson's Thriller. The skeletons dance, the zombies hop, and the shopkeepers sing as you navigate through the floors of the cryptIt plays similarly to classic turn based style roguelikes, except that the turns happen on the beat of the music.  You will find yourself hopping back and forth to the beat, dodging enemy attacks, and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.  The soundtrack is great, but you can play using your own music instead if you wish.  There is also an easier difficulty setting specifically for playing the game on a dance pad.  It makes me wish I still had a DDR pad lying around, I'd love to give it a try.The parallels with classic roguelikes do not end with the turn based combat/movement system.  The floors, the contents of treasure chests, shop items, and even boss order are all randomly generated.  The game is also very challenging, quite possibly challenging enough that some players won't enjoy it if they don't like difficult games.  There are several features available to the player to mitigate the challenge.  As you play you will unlock the ability to start at each zone, buy items before entering a zone, and practice against enemies in a risk free environment.The only criticism that comes to mind about the game is the small number of zones.  There are four zones, and each zone has three stages.  The amount of content reminds me of some NES games.  Many old NES titles could be completed in less than an hour, but took much longer due to the learning required to play successfully.  While I don't feel like there are as many zones as there could have been, they did include ten playable characters.  The characters all have very different styles of play and allow for a solid level of replay value.Crypt of the Necrodancer is a lot of fun, but I think many players should be wary.  Prospective buyers may be lured in by the cute visuals and awesome soundtrack but miss an important fact about the game.  Necrodancer, at its heart, is a challenging turn based roguelike.  I've played through and finished quite a few games that most would consider to be hard.  This one is tough.  According to  Steam's global gameplay stats, 7.2% of players manage to finish the fourth zone as the main character.  If you're down for a challenge though, you'll have a great time.  I've certainly had a lot of fun with it.			"

								This game is very well made. Difficult, but not too much so that you can't play it.

												Crypt of the Necrodancer's a really inventive game. It takes two things that don't really go together--rhythm and dungeon crawling--and mixes them so beautifully. Playing a game like this to the rhythm of music makes it incredibly easy to get into a certain flow. Combat is smooth and challenging. The sound design and OST are phenomenal and really add to the overall atmosphere of the game. Having been keeping track of the game since early in its Early Access days, I was satisfied with the product back then and am even more so satisfied with it now. Crypt of the Necrodancer is truly worth all fifteen dollars you pay for it. I could not recommend this game more.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a dungeon-crawler, rouge-like, rythm RPG with loot. You can only move and attack monsters along with the beat of the song playing, so you have to memorize the pattern of each monster's movements and attacks to kill them. It's not as hard as I made it sound, but can still be fairly difficult. If it gets too hard, which isn't likely, you can go into a training zone of the monster you struggle to defeat.Moving and attacking with the beat isn't hard, and deploying weapons and attacks you've aqcuired just takes a combo of two arrow keys.The story of the game is nothing special, and that's completely fine. The replayability is beautiful, and there is also a daily challenge to keep you playing.What I love about this game the most is that although it's hard, I've never rage quit. The fun outweighs the difficulty to keep you playing. You can add custom music from your computer's files, but it will disable achievements.It's a beautiful game with a great soundtrack, achievements, and Steam Workshop support to change the textures (Undertale, Megaman ect.) If you like retro RPGs and rythm based games, it's for you.			"

												A seriously creative and fun take, on a generic dungeon crawler. Really addictive.Basicly its a top view dungeon explorer, with a simplicity that reminds of Tibia. The game's catch, is the fact that you can only move on the music's beat. So its Tibia with Guitar Hero lolThe soundtrack is amazing and unique. Roguelike elements are lacking a bit (not many upgrades on death), but it does have legit concept, that you can unlock boss practice rooms. So yea, its more focused on the player skill instead of player upgrade. Think of this as, Magicite, ftl rogue elements vs Roguelegacy type.Definetly recommend this game. Its short sure, but just as short as FTL, Magicite, Rain etc.. its totally replayable.			"

												This game, just by hearing the type that it is, causes most people to doubt it or wrinkle their nose in confusion. You'd probably think that at first too, it's a dungeon crawler, a rhythm game, and a totally amazing rogue-like game. How does it work? We may never know, but one thing's for certain: a game of this difficulty that's this fun to play deserves more recognition. Like, a lot more. The soundtracks, all three of them, all provide something awesome to the game. I've only had it for a couple days now (yeah, I'm that guy who shows up three hours into the party and acts all cool about it) but that doesn't mean I don't know that this is a game far beyond amazing. Cheers to everyone at Brace Yourself Games, you've created a masterpiece of a game that lots of people will agree is easily one of the best rhythm games out there. I'd go on, but there are too many things that are awesome about this game that I'd probably end up breaking the character limit or something. Don't worry Rhythm Heaven, you've always got a special place in my heartBut seriously, get this game. It's more than worth the $15, no doubt about it.			"

												If you haven't bought this already, buy it.Pros: The dungeons are different every time.Tons of characters with very different playstyles (ex the default character has to move to the beat, another one can move to his own beat, one more has infinite bombs, etc.)The music will get you. I literally cannot get the music out of my head.Pretty easy to understand. You only use the arrow keys.Daily Challenge (if that's your thing). Every day a random dungeon is set up and you get one run to score as high as possible. There's a global leaderboard.Pop in your own music and play to its beats.Cons:If you don't like rhythm games, well you won't like this. It is very VERY hard at first. You meet lots of enemies who each have their own movement and attack patterns. You will probably die a lot, and it can be frustrating. There are a lot of items that can make the game either a (relative) breeze or very hard if you don't have them.I don't really know if it's a con or not, but it was frustrating.End of list.TL;DRThis is my GOTY.

I love that they did music DLC, something I think other games should try sometime.			"

												Ever wanted to play Dance Dance Revolution but with a bit of action and narrative added to the mix? Well Crypt of the Necrodancer is a good waltz in the right direction! Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rhythm, rogue-like dungeon crawler that has you moving and attacking to the beat of the tune.The gameplay as stated above generally has you doing everything to the beat of the tune by using only the arrow keys, whether your in the main lobby or fighting your way through the next level. You can even set the game up to be played with a dance pad! In the main lobby you're able to buy permanent upgrades to weapons, armor, spells and trinkets found in the levels,  practice against certain enemies, read background about the game and choose which zones you'll be ""dancing"" through along with a few other options. In the zones themselves the overall objective is to find the stairwell to the next level, however that doesn't necessarily mean you should be racing for the stairwell with all due haste. Diamonds, your currency for permanent upgrades, can only be found while exploring these levels, and once you are done with a zone you will only have those diamonds in your next trip to the lobby. Once you decide to go back into a zone you will lose all the diamonds you collected on the previous trip! So finding enough diamonds to buy those ever increasingly costing upgrades can be well worth the exploration. Remember how I said those permanent upgrades to items only affect what you find in the levels and are not given to the characters themselves? Those items can either be found throughout said levels or in the shop in each level. Enemies drop gold in order for you to purchase these items from the store, and if you keep up with the beat, a coin multiplier is added when you kill enemies so you get more gold for your kills. With that being said the levels are on a time limit, can you guess what that time limit is? The music! If the music you are playing to finishes before you get to the stairs you are immediately dropped to the next level. On top of this each level has a boss, and not only will you lose your multiplier combo if the song ends but rather than being dropped into a relatively safe room at the beginning of the next level you will have to face that levels boss immediately if the previous levels boss wasn't defeated. The games uses pixel art and uses it's musical theme in some of the enemy designs. For example the Minotaur enemy's  horns are actually a harp and the reaper has a microphone attached to his scythe. This leads to a very visually pleasing themed art style that looks and plays it's part.The music is electronic and catchy, even making you want to stay on a level just to keep listening. In lower levels of each zone the beat is actually slower so that players adjust to the beat as it get faster with each level.Crypt of the Necrodancer is a fun and enchanting game and is well worth your time and if you have a love for rhythm and rogue-like games alike, this original gem will not disappoint you.

								Addictive, catchy, hard. I feel a ""puzzle game"" vibe from some of the things you have to do in this game.The ability to quickly restart a run makes this game incredibly difficult to stop playing, and the sound blending between the Hot and Cold area themes in Zone 3 makes it so that particular music never gets old, even as I try for the 50th time to beat the flipping first stage...Due to the amount of enemies you have to rapidly and strategically dispose of at some points, I feel like mastering this game will take me quite some time. That's a good thing in this case, because it's all due to simple concepts blending together to make something challenging. You know where you went wrong and why you died, and if you didn't, the deathcam is very helpful in pointing that out.The majority of the upgrades could probably do with some sort of price increase. I had no issue unlocking pretty much all of them pretty quickly, before I had even a chance to use 80% of them, and stat keeping would be cool too, but these are just balance suggestions rather than complaints and they barely put a scratch on the rock solid game that is CotN.

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a competently executed Roguelike with a gimmick that you have to make all of your moves to the beat of some annoying techno music. This gimmick is cool for only a few minutes, then it gets annoying. Fortunately, there's a character you can unlock called ""The Bard"" who gets rid of that gimmick and lets you play it like a normal, non-musical roguelike, and that makes you realize that it is a solid, though unremarkable, roguelike experience underneath the gimmick. It's not life-changingly good, but it's not bad either.			"

												I've been addicted to this game since I started playing it. I am not a big fan of rogue-likes in general, but this game is among few rare exceptions.You have 4 zones to beat, each one contains 3 floors and a boss fight. Every zone has its own theme and enemies. But wait, there's more. The enemies each move to the beat in their own unique pattern, and you have to recognize it and adapt quickly. For example, some enemies might be moving along a scripted path, others try to go for you specifically, some might stay still for 2 beats and then move on the 3rd one, others might move on every beat, and so on. It's all very well done.During your dungeon crawling, you'll also come across a lot of items of varying degrees of helpfulness. You have healing items, weapons, armour, rings, spells, and even some unusual items. Some can spawn from the start, others require unlocking via collectible diamonds. You can even remove the less useful items from the dungeons via the janitor, so that there's more chances instead for chests to contain the items you find more useful.There is of course a fair bit of luck involved, as is pretty common with rogue-like games. At times you'll be lucky to find a nice weapon and other useful items early on, other times you'll just be spawning with enemies all around you. It is a very challenging game. You will die a lot. But you do learn to recognize the enemy movement patterns and eventually overcome them.I also really like the whole light-hearted theme the game is going for. I think the devs pulled it off perfectly. The music is also amazing and will just drag you in to the beat.In addition to the regular mode with the main character, you also get to unlock several other characters, which seem to have their own unique abilities (for example one of them can only confuse enemies but not kill, another is only able to use bombs, and so on). It all adds an extra challenge for those who want it. You can even go and practice fighting against specific enemies and bosses if you wish.Great game in general. Highly recommended.			"

With a total of 10 characters to play as, the game has a natural learning curve, which gets of the charts at the end!The Music is excelent,Danny Baranowsky's music is groovy, so are the additional soundtracks from A_Rival and FamilyJules7x.The Controls are as simple as it gets, meaning the dance-pad way of playing is not far fetched.It's a game one might play only 30 minutes of, or try 5 hours to get through hit freeEither way, I heartly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of rogue-like or disco-esque music.

								I might not have played this game that much, but I am absolutely in love with it. This game provides a fun and challenging experience for all players to enjoy. From the combat and movement system, to the wonderful and energetic music, this game is amazing, while not perfect, as it is in early alpha, it still keeps me entertained. Every enemy has a pattern to it, which means you need to memorize it to do good, there is no RNG nonsense. In the game you move and attack to a beat. Once you break the beat, or you lose your coin multiplier (for cadence at least, not sure about the other characters) which can make the game a lot harder on you. If you can keep a beat this game is for you. All in all I give it a 9/10 at the moment, rating subject to change as more updates come out.			"

After 4 hours of playtime I STILL cant get even past the first level of the second dungeon. It could be because I am a pastey white-boy with no sense of rhythm... Anyway, that doesnt stop me from taking another crack at it every couple days. I'm looking forward to seeing this game evolve as it gets closer and closer to its final release.			"

It combines typical roguelike gameplay with an amazing soundtrack creating an experience like nothing else out there right now. Most importantly, every death can be prevented. You don't have to take a heart of damage if you're careful. This game is wildly skill based and highly addicting.

												I held off through early access and almost passed up this game because it was still over $10 upon release, but I'm telling you know, it's totally worth it.  It's a pretty standard roguelike (the exception is the heavy emphasis on digging through walls).  However, because you have to move on the beat of the music or else you lose your gold multiplier, it really adds a whole new level of difficulty to an already difficult genre.I'm almost considering getting a dance pad just to try this game out with it.  Just a fantastic game.			"

								As a rogue-like fan, I must admit that this game is really good despite being an early access game because you can't solely rely on your luck but you also really need to have the skills to complete a level.Pro(s): - Good gameplay by combining rhythm with dungeon crawler- Good design with cute pixel art graphics- High replayability because you can play with different modes and use different characters- An awesome soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky (I really enjoyed the music)- And a little bit tricky (like destroying walls with bomb to get a lot of money :P)Con(s):- The content is still not that much right now because it's still an early access but the workshop content from the community can fill the gap- The shortcut/hotkey for the items and spells is hard to be pressed using keyboard maybe it's different when using gamepad or dance pad since I don't have both- The enemies have fixed pattern and that makes the enemies predictable maybe the enemies need to have combination of patterns to make it unpredictableI highly recommend this game because it's challenging and fun and it has awesome soundtrack, you really need to buy the soundtrack as well			"

								Me and my cousin had a little inside joke between us. When we played Heroes 3 of Might and Magic back then, we called the Necromancers, Necrodancers or Negrodancers. Yeah it's a stupid little joke but heck, it gives us plenty of laughs back then.When this game popped up in Steam, my cousin messaged me "".. Have you seen the new game title in Steam?""Ha!So anyways, the game itself is fun but only in short bursts. Being able to use your own musics is awesome, but as of now at least in my opinion, most of the musics I use doesn't match with the in-game beat well/precisely. Could just be because its still in Early Access. More items is being released too but as of now, IMO its just an ok game.[WORTH TRYING OUT]			"

												""Hello sir, may I buy this new music game on steam with some of money I earn by working for you?""""No, you dirty underling, drop your pants and take a deep breath, because I'm cutting your wage in half for asking this!""This is most likely the conversation you had with your super rich boss that forces you to work 18 hours a day at minimum wage when you asked him if you could get the new book by the famous canadian political author, Brace Yourself Games. You might think that this just happened because your boss is an ♥♥♥ and while that part is also true, it's not the only truth behind it.In fact, he is afraid and he has to be afraid, because Crypt of the FreedomDancer is a lot more than just some indie book around music, it's actually a political concept that might open your eyes behind what you do and it might end up with you standing up, defending your democratic rights and take back what the sinister communist boss of yours took away from you a long time ago.Crypt of the LibertyDancer, or FREEDOM in short, is a political RTS shooting firefighter simulation in which you take the role of a supressed American worker that is enslaved by the liberal agenda of communists like Obama and Clinton. You have to dance in the rhythm that they dictate without congress approval and while doing that, you are trying to dismantle the system of injustice and slavery that they built up.Level by level you accomplish that by destroying their supression machine in form of evil monsters, skeletons and spiders that come down from your wall. You kill every brainwashed liberal boss in the end of each world and end up in the hort of evil itself, the bureau of Hillary Clinton him very self.Of course, he is entirely invulnerable until you take a guitar named Donald Trump to hit him, then he becomes vulnerable and you can kill him. Once you accomplished that, America is once again free of a dictated rhythm and you can proceed in your life in peace, wealth and prosperity.The symbolism here is clearly political and obvious. You are the great hero that is to dismantle the sinister machine of doom the liberals created, however you have to follow the rules they dictated in order to prevail.How is that fair you ask? Well, it isn't. That's what liberals are about. Being unfair and evil.In order to fully grasp the vastness that this game covers politically, we should take a look into the founding of Israel after World War II in 1473. The United States of America that just created the greatest and most freedom-loving army in world history and in order to re-establish fairness and peace over the world, it was time to create a new country named Is-Real. People immediately loved it and started moving there, creating houses and cities, lived in freedom and prosperity until the dark day Bill Clinton, son of widely known Satan Clinton, came to destroy the homes of those who seeked shelter and freedom in the new country. They started a sinister war and tried to took over the United States by disabling the constitution that our great founding fathers wrote millenia ago shortly after the Roman Empire fell in 1773. That is by the way the reason we still celebrate the day of founding in July 4th with fireworks and turkey.These historic facts are all covered in this game. Illustrated cleverly by allowing the player to choose between various characters you can go back in time and revisit those events and understand why we as free and hard working Americans have the duty to fight the liberal agenda and ensure that our consitution, especially with amendments like the first and second that build the very foundation of liberty in our great world, remain intact, even against backstabbing attacks from liberals.If you think that 9/11 was bad and that we have to stand up and fight the infowar against the groups that try to dismantle our great liberty, you should go forth, play this game, get inspired and go out on the street and fight the liberals. It is on you to defend our constitution and make the world great again.God bless America.			"

												Rhythm-based roguelike that has you move to the beat to kill and avoid monsters. Deceptively hard and good music. I was going to beat it to completion, but then Overwatch and The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine expansion came out. So take this recommendation for what it's worth: deserving of your time if you don't have the money or a good enough computer for other, better games. That's a back-handed compliment, but I'm not really a huge roguelike fan. That I played this long enough that I could no longer refund it is compliment enough.

If you are the person who does not get easily convinced with positive reviews, better check this out, will keep it short.Crypt of the NecroDancer has an interesting concept and is quite unique among all the other rouge-like games. I agree with most of the positive reviews. Yet, this game lacks something essential which should keep your spark alive. To a certain extent it was okay, but then it feels like a mobile game you start with excitement and delete after a short while. If you like repetitive games (should also mention it has an unusual difficulty curve) you might give it a try. But I do not recommend it for the long term.			"

												7/10One of the most challenging games ever created by mankind. Seems to be only 4 buttons and nothing extra. But unusual mechanics where you need to play ""Diablo-clone"" by clicking in the rhythm of the music completely changes the rules. Catch the rhythm of the original soundtrack is not easy, and huddled together in one accord leads to the feil of the whole rollers. And well if the player was revived in the beginning of the location. No, he starts the game from the beginning Zones, each of which is generated randomly. If you pass the ""Crypt of Necrodancer"", then all casual like ""Dark souls"" will be, as the nuts snapping.			"

												Personally I think this game is my favorite game released this year. Beating out Mortal Kombat X and Killing Floor 2. Gameplay is based off a dungeon crawler rougue-like. Every thing moves along with the rhythm including you. This adds a very unique gameplay element as you have to manage following the beat of the song along with keeping track of enemies in order to dodge or attack them. It is quite a lot to take in at once so it is very challenging. The music is incredible, and even if it is disliked, you have options to use custom music. A feature that is very rare for rhythm based games. It has an auto detection that determins the beat of which ever song you place and then can let you play the game with that song. If you couldn't get from my earlier statements, I like the game and I will definetly try and convince some of my friends to buy it, and if not get them to play it at the very least.			"

												I have never been a massive fan of rhythm games (other than Elite Beat Agents!), pixel graphics or dungeon-crawler games, but this has certainly made me reconsider! You move and attack in time with music, whilst picking up weapons, powerups and fighting a variety of enemies. Gameplay is simple, all based around arrow keys, but incredibly hard to master. The game itself is very challenging and you will die A LOT. But you keep playing because it is awesome. The music is probably one of the best parts of the game - infectious, catchy electronic music that hasn't got old yet! Defintely worth grabbing this Steam sale.			"

												CAUTION: This game is extremely addictive.This is a rogue-like RPG that merges all of your actions, such as moving and combat, with staying in tempo to whatever song is playing, as well as letting you permanently purchase upgrades and item spawns in a hub area for each randomly generated dungeon venture.  Each zone has a few areas which end with a boss fight, and you are able to return to completed zones to grind for gold and diamonds (diamonds are used to purchase upgrades at the hub while gold is used at shops within the dungeons to buy gear, spells, and health).I really like that you can start with a different character who changes the gameplay from rhythm to turn-based so that you can learn the mechanics of the game before adding in the need to stay with the beat.  The ability to use custom songs is an awesome touch, adding even more so to the already excellent replay value.9.75/10			"

												Crypt is a game I admittedly bought pretty much exclusively for Danny B's soundtrack. The music in this game is fantastic. So much so that I bought the game for PS4 as well. But the gameplay is extremely difficult. It's randomly generated, but extremely based on enemy patterns. There's very little room for error, and each run can end in the blink of an eye. It's a game I really want to get better at, if only because it's so unique. If you put a bit of practice into learning each of the enemy's patterns, it is incredibly rewarding to beat each floor, especially for the first time. It's certainly not a game for everyone, but it's a game that you will enjoy if you spend a bit of time learning how to play it. And even if you suck, you can still enjoy Danny B's beautiful soundtrack.			"

								This game is a real joy to play, largely owing to the awesome soundtrack. It was written by the same guy who did the music for Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac. He has the best style, it's like Techno Nintendo Metal from the future. Don't let the whole 'rogue-like' thing scare you, this game is lots of fun and when you die it just feels like 'meh'.

								If you're like me you never woulda thought an idea like ""roguelike rhythm game"" would work... and we'd both be dead wrong! It's devilishly difficult, infectiously amusing, cute and creepy, and most importantly, the soundtrack is great! In fact, the music is so good that I haven't even tried the rolled-in option to play to music from my own collection.

								I legitimately cannot think of a single bad thing to say about this game, even in its current state. Maybe a lack of content? But not really, each zone has an entirely new set of enemies and enviromental hazards. The difficulty curve is stellar, as well. There's no ""easy"" in the game but it ramps up at just the right pace so as to never overwhelm you. It's mostly a matter of learning each enemy's patterns. Heck, this game is practically an action/puzzle game (or pure puzzle, with the bard). Mostly about strategizing on the fly, keeping the rhythm and never missing a beat while tearing monsters to shreds. It all meshes together so perfectly that I can't even. I can't. The soundtrack is great, too. Very diverse sounds that fit their areas well, and pretty catchy to boot. The game also looks wonderful, great spritework and animations and a very cohesive visual style. There's little story present but who really needs it, this game is about the gameplay through and through.I could keep going on but it'd be redundant because I absolute adore this game through and through and can't wait to see it updated and finished. Heck, even if it doesn't get ""finished"" ever I wouldn't be overly disappointed, what we've got already is certainly worth the asking price.			"

												WOW. This game is a lot more difficult than I expected. Watching videos and things, it seems like it would be simple once you memorize all the attack patterns and things, but with so many enemies doing different things all at once, it's so easy to make a mistake. The great thing about this game is that you totally get each success and failure. As in when you clear a room without taking damage you're like ""yeah, totally nailed it"", but when you walk right into enemies you immediately know what you did wrong, and the game never feels unfair for it. Also IT'S A RHYTHM BASED ROUGELIKE HOLY CRAP WHY DON'T YOU OWN THIS YET?!?!?!?!			"

												TL;DR: This game is good if you like games that are both challenging and fun. It also has good music.I will start out by saying that this game is one of my favorites. It is very fun, if you can handle the challenge.It's a quite odd game, if you think about it. A rhythm based roguelike? You probably haven't played anything like it.As I have said a few times already, it is very challenging. The game will likely smash you into a pulp a few times until you learn how to beat the enemies. Which, shouldn't actually take long, as they all have patterns that you can memorize, as well as animations that will give you a heads up when they are about to attack.Though, if you are still struggling, they have a special room where they will show you... Well, more like force you to learn, how to beat some of the tougher enemies.It also has tons of different items, randomly generated levels, (Or you can put in a seed, if you prefer.) and many different characters, each with different mechanics, so you will probably never get bored.""So, you said that it's a rhythm based roguelike. Is the music any good?"" You bet. It is really good.The default music is composed by Danny Baranowsky, who has made music for several other great games, including the Binding of Isaac, and Super Meat Boy, but there are also several remixes/remasters made by other artists, or if you really want, you can use any music you want!It is also VERY compatible with dance pads. XDIt also has a story, which is mainly told through cutscenes, which are few and far apart, but they do tell a pretty interesting story.So, overall, I definitely recommend this game. It is awesome, and very fun. It is a must have for your gaming arsenal.100/10			"

												I read in some review (can't remember where) that this game is particularly good because when you die, you blame yourself and not the game. I wholeheartedly agree with that, and it sums up the biggest reason why this is my favorite game that I've picked up from the 2015 Winter Sale (so far). There is enough simplicity to it such that I feel like I know it front to back, but enough depth such that I feel like there's plenty more to master. I finally finished my runs of each individual zone the other day, and I haven't even come close to an all zones run yet (and that's just with Cadence).Great game, right up my alley.			"

												Very enjoyable, and also at later stages very difficult. It is what it looks like: a rhythm-based almost-roguelike game - an unusual combination of genres which works surprisingly well. The game does not have a vast number of areas, but the  levels are procedurally generated so it is not too predictable and the challenge is great enough that the game will not be over too fast. There are also various unlockable characters with different playstyles and varying levels of difficulty, which helps to extend the life of the game. The soundtrack is good, which is crucial for this type of game, although it is occasionally difficult to pick out the beat which the game expects you to move to. The only major complaint I would have is the aforementioned limited level variety which does become frustrating when replaying the same sorts of levels over and over with any one of the several ludicrously difficult-to-play characters in the game. Overall, however, the game is still well worth buying if fast-paced 2D games hold any appeal for you at all.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer Review:I rate this game: 8.0 / 10.0Where to start... hmmm... Before the games full release, my friends told me this game was awesome. Looking at it from a spectators view, it didn't feel like a good game. The reason I tried it is because of the game's music. This game has awesome music, and the word awesome cannot even begin to describe how good the music is - awesome is an understatement if anything else. Well, the music better be super awesome because its main theme is a Music-Rhythm Dungeon Crawling Game. Yes, put that cloth down; stop rubbing your eyes, your glasses and eyesight are both fine. MUSIC - RHYTHM - DUNGEON - CRAWLING. Who would've thought combining those elements would make an awesome Rogue-lite game, Brace Yourself Games and Klei Entertainment did. Okay, so, I start playing the game on my friend's game on steam during the early access phase.MUSIC AND HOW IT PLAYSThat was the starting point that sucked me into this musical addiction of dungeon crawling awesomeness. At the beginning, just like all dungeon crawling games, you don't know anything about the dungeon. You start treading about slowly, and then you realize, how come my movements aren't registering very well, are these controls buggy or broken? NO, you can only move according to the beat, you cannot move whenever you please BUT the enemies and monsters do the same, they move according to the beat. This gives the game a semi real time system and gives you little time for planning strategies. Then, when you want to attack an enemy, you just stand next to them or in range of your weapon and click the direction the enemy is at. Most of the time, you will fight and suddenly another monster comes from the top, then below, then the boss of the stage is coming for you. When that happens, you gotta dance with the enemy on the fly. Each enemy has a different ""dance"" pattern, and with that, you ""dance"" with them. This part of the game made me come back for more. When you pull it off successfully, timing the beat perfectly, dodging everything, playing with the game's advance tactics that give a single beat invulnerability, that feeling that rushes through like adrenaline - well it was like that for me.THIS SECTION SEMI-RELEVANT ONLY----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Aside from that, just like any dungeon crawling game, itemizing is also one of the main fun points of roguelite or roguelike games. I'll write a few ITEM SPOILERS here, so if you want to find out what the items do on their own, you may wanna skip this section. Okay, At first, I loved the Broadsword which attacks 3 spaces in front of where your character is facing, not 3 spaces front, 3 spaces wide - in front of you, that box to the left and right. Unlike other weapons, this is one of the few weapons that can hit multiple targets. For the first few days of playing this game non-stop, I always looked out for the broadsword cause it was my main choice. Itemizing that with Ring of Might which gives 1 damage and combo that with a War Drum that let's you stay in one position without missing a beat and also increase your damage if you stand still. You could possibly one-shot a dragon if you use that combo with the War Drum. Then one day, I asked my friend: "" Man whenever I get the Rapier, I feel like I'm bringing myself to death."" Just so you know, the Rapier can only hit one target, with a range of two spaces in front of you. IF you attack a target that is two spaces away you lunge toward that target. Basically you attack and move a the same time, but why would you want to do that lunging towards a boss? If the boss doesn't die from that attack, you take a beating from the boss. Then my friend gave me the theory on how the rapier is awesome, and it piqued my interest. I practiced the rapier for another few days and apparently the rapier fit my style of combat. Then, I learnt that best combo with a rapier, Ring of Courage + Rapier. Ring of Courage gives 1 bonus damage and moves the player towards the target if the target is killed. I stumbled upon this combo, I held both items, and I was surrounded, no matter where I move, I'll get hit, and I have half a heart of HP remaining, anything would kill me, so, I YOLO-ed and dash around the battlefield killing everything in my path but eventually dying at the last 3 enemies because i messed up the beat. Along the dance of carnage, I saw myself got hit, but I didn't die, and so I realized, the Ring of Courage moves you one step forward, and gives you a one beat invulnerability. What solidified my choice of weapons to the rapier was this one time, so happen I have a damage boost ring, damage boost boots and a Glass Rapier, yes, Glass... Glass breaks your weapon if you get hit but it does 4 damage - the highest damage in the game, most mooks don't even have 3 HP. And so, with the rhythm and beats of the dancing gods i killed all of ""Death Metal's"" minions, I proceed to kill ""Death Metal"" himself, the boss with 10 HP, after a few frustrating side steps to get around his shield, i finally got a position to do a lunge attack with the Glass Rapier and I took it. To my surprise, Death Metal died. I just stood there for the next 1 minute, wondering what just happened. Scratching my head over it, thinking that there is no way possible i can hit 10 dmg in one hit, I finally gave up on figuring it out on my own and checked the wiki. Apparently the Rapier does double damage on lunge. From that moment onwards till today, I finished off most bosses with mostly a rapier.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------LONG STORY SHORT, The itemizing in this game is fun and there are so many combinations to try but sadly there are only few favourites among players and people normally only stick to that because the other combinations are not as reliable. Comparing the itemizing to another Roguelite: Binding of Isaac, this game lacks in the itemization department.ETCThe monsters and enemies in this game are very interesting to ""dance"" with especially in the final zone. The monsters make me want to come back to this zone with better gear just to try and fight them again. The story plot of the game is interesting but not amazing. In my opinion, it is a great story, I got mind blown at one point, and then mind blown again when I went to character select. So, once again, in my opinion, I think the story is great. Also, after getting the official full release and playing until the end of the story. I found out that you get to play as other characters to progress the story. That in turn makes the replayability of the game pretty good. Even without the extended story from other characters, I already played the entire game from zone 1 to final zone for hundreds of runs. Finally finishing the story, if im not mistaken, there might be DLC for extra levels or just Crypt of the NecroDancer 2 and I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT!!! JUST TAKE MY MONEY!!!DOWN-SIDEThe couple of downsides of this game, is the lack of itemization options and very limited bosses. Every zone, the final floor will be a random pick from 4 bosses, and the further zones just improve their HP abit and include harder mooks in the boss chamber. I was expecting 10 different bosses in the official release. Only the Final Zone, Final Boss is fixed. The fight was amazing. To put it in words without spoilers, the game basically just told me ""THIS IS THE LAST BOSS, HERE IS SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW YOU NEED TO GET USE TO TO BEAT THE BOSS, NOW GO!!!"". Now back to the negative points, the very final part of the story is ludicrous hard and I can't say any further because it would be spoilers. I consider that as a negative because it would frustrate people to a point that they would give up trying. If this game had more bosses, and more items, I believe I would give it 10/10.			"

 Crypt of the NecroDancer Oh boy where do I begin?The gameplay is so Unique and Intelligent which is why it's one of my favorite games on Steam! EVER!It's a Rouge-like game that combines Rhythm and Dungeon Crawling, 2 completely different genres! And it works perfectly! How crazy is that!?You play with the rhythm and make a move at every beat, whether it's walking, attacking, using items, mining (technically it's shoveling 'cause you use a shovel but there is a pickaxe), etc.As easy as this may sound, it is a really and I mean a   really   difficult game, every enemy feels unique because they all have a unique pattern to memorize, and the only way to beat it is to learn them and be able to predict when they move and where.Still not convincied it's hard? Well try playing as one of the harder character such as  Aria , ON A DANCEPAD (this is an official thing by the way, check their site for details)The graphics are really neat too! It's really captures the ""I'm underground"" feeling really well, the sprites are so full of life, er well, they're kind of dead but they're still full of life, there are also Steam Workshop mods out there to change the sprites and sound effects to everything.The music, oh God, Is it beautiful? Yes. Is it addicting? Yes. Is Freddie Merchantry the best thing ever? Absolutly. I can't get enough of the soundtrack, ESPECIALLY Freddie Merchantary's voice, but if you want to, you can change the music to whatever you have on your computer, but then you won't hear the game's awesome soundtrack or Freddie Merchantary's voice, so are you sure you want to do that? Also the voice acting is top tier just wanna point that out, Fantastic work.Now if you look at the price tag and thought this was expensive well think again, because this game is going to stick with you for a long time, I usually move on from one game to another, but this is one of those games where I can't let go of because of how amazing it is.I don't hear much people talk about this but there is a level editor if that's your thing, I'm not particularly good at making levels but I sure as heck can try.In short, It's basically one of the most unique games I've played, sure you can say you played some unique games but I never saw anything quite like this, and while writing this review I couldn't really fully express how I feel about this game, it's so good that if it were a food, it's my favorite food that I can't get enough of. My brain created tactics automatically and is one of the only games where I get 100% focused on, despite playing for (as of this review) 30 hours I can still screw up really badly. I'm currently having difficultly playing as  Aria  in Zone 3, and I love it.I have high respect to everyone who worked on this game, it's a huge inspiration to game developers, musicians, and heck even the fans like myself, because I consider Crypt of the NecroDancer as one of the most innovative games of this generation and I'm sure many others do, so a big thank you to everyone who was involved with the creation of this game.Also I just wanna point out that this game was inspired from another Rouge-like game called Spelunky, which is also another game that I love. I think I'm gonna buy a Dancepad just for this game  "

												Awesome soundtrack, challenging levels, great design, no bugs so far. Roguelike game which has an added gameplay element attached to it: you have to move, attack and destroy with the rythm of the music. And not only that, every foe you may encounter, every trap, every dungeon level has its own rythm as well. The learning process is fairly simple: trial and error, till you get to know how to act to counter that rythm. It's so much fun, and challenges the player in a way many would enjoy, that you could even compare to Dark Souls. The feeling of accomplishment when you finish a level, is indescribable. 100% recomend it, and at this price (currently on sale at less than 4€) you don't have to think twice.			"

												Personally I think this game is my favorite game released this year. Beating out Mortal Kombat X and Killing Floor 2. Gameplay is based off a dungeon crawler rougue-like. Every thing moves along with the rhythm including you. This adds a very unique gameplay element as you have to manage following the beat of the song along with keeping track of enemies in order to dodge or attack them. It is quite a lot to take in at once so it is very challenging. The music is incredible, and even if it is disliked, you have options to use custom music. A feature that is very rare for rhythm based games. It has an auto detection that determins the beat of which ever song you place and then can let you play the game with that song. If you couldn't get from my earlier statements, I like the game and I will definetly try and convince some of my friends to buy it, and if not get them to play it at the very least.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a special mixture of the rogue light genre and the rhythm game genre. It forces you to fight your enemies to the beat, making the player resort to their rhythmic intelligence and their reflexes. Without a quick mind and sharp instincts, you'll die. A lot. Most of the deaths are the player's fault. Whether it was being surrounded by enemies, or forgetting an enemy's pattern.To quote Cadence from the game.""Every enemy has a predictable pattern. Learn that and you won't suffer as much as a scratch.""This game relies on skill, as you can take any amount of luck in your procedurally generated dungeon and win with enough skill. You learn from your deaths, failures, and misplays. I retrieved my heart from the Necrodancer. Can you?			"

												WOW. This game is a lot more difficult than I expected. Watching videos and things, it seems like it would be simple once you memorize all the attack patterns and things, but with so many enemies doing different things all at once, it's so easy to make a mistake. The great thing about this game is that you totally get each success and failure. As in when you clear a room without taking damage you're like ""yeah, totally nailed it"", but when you walk right into enemies you immediately know what you did wrong, and the game never feels unfair for it. Also IT'S A RHYTHM BASED ROUGELIKE HOLY CRAP WHY DON'T YOU OWN THIS YET?!?!?!?!			"

												Quite fun. The mechanic of moving to the beat is an interesting gimmick, although I can't seem to get the hang of it. Keep missing some beats (because the soundtrack is incredibly excellent? Heh... not really. Just great, but not superb kinda thing). The soundtrack changes every level you go on, meaning that the beats change pace level to level. This also provides a nice variety while playing - you move at a different beat every level, and combined with the randomly generated levels (can't memorise paths - they always change) provides enough entertainment for a few hours.You can also change music tracks if you want, which I'll be doing soon. So if you for some reason get disappointed in the music, swap to your own. The provided soundtracks are nice, but sometimes the fast(ish) beats combined with the dungeon monster aspects results in missed beats and dead characters. I do not have any significant flaws with this game - it provides what it says it will - a different approach to rogue-like dungeon exploring that is enjoyable and not buggy at all (I didn't encounter any bugs while playing). Got it on sale at 50% price or something, but even at full price it would be worth grabbing to play.Price - fineGameplay - funBugs - None found while playingSoundtrack - Sometimes not to my taste, but irrelevant when you're trying your best to survive in a dungeon. All tracks are enjoyable for playing. +1  "

												With a lack of rhythm games in general, Crypt of the NecroDancer (or CotN) delivers with Grand Results. The controls only use the Arrow Keys, but it uses this limitation to its advanatge since some item can only be activated via 2 button press and forces you to not mess up, or it i'll cost you a heart or 2. Yes, it IS a simple rouge-like, but the game requires you to plan ahead, know the patterns of enemies, know what items do what, Etc. There are upgrades to the game, but it still requries the skill you had without said upgrade. the Co-Op mode feels weird with player 2 using WASD, but It still manages to work. The Game also offers different characters with differnet play styles, an online leaderboard via Daily Challenge, and Mod Support (lets hope we dont have to pay for these any time soon) The game gets VERY challenging after world 3, granted there are only 4 Worlds, and after beating the random boss at the end, you get a little cut-scene talking about the story of the game. Overall, this game can be enjoyed by most, if not all fans of Rouge-likes and Rhythm games, I give Crypt of the Necrodancer:9.8/10BUY IT, AND ENJOY IT (the 0.2 that isnt included is just some personal issuses)			"

Early Access Review
								First off, let me just say that this is an EXCELLENT Early Access title, right off the bat we have fully functional local co-op and so far I have noticed no glaring visual, AI, or mechanic bugs.Crypt of the NecroDancer is all it was hyped up to be: a rogue-element dungeon crawl that moves on a metronome, turning conflict situations into highly tactical battles that demand a considerable amount of quick thinking and strategy from the player. In spite of such strategy requirements, the game is surprisingly fluid, encouraging players to keep moving along to Baranowsky's stellar soundtrack!My one point of critique is that some controls are difficult to execute: Use items require use of two of the movement buttons and depending on your input this can be cumbersome! (Xbox controller's big bubbly buttons make it difficult to keep a grip on those controls. The misaligned position of WASD keys makes outward commands like W+A or W+S a little tricky.)This game will definitely be worth the cost, it will provide you with hours of entertainment especially if you have a friend to play with. (Can't wait to try it with dance pads!)			"

												This game is so very awesome. Words can't even describe the amount of happiness this little title has given me. I think what I love the most is you can play this game one handed as you sit back and relax in your comfy reclining chair. It's definitely a challenging title, but not in a way that makes you think the game is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but rather usually a death is the result of a screw up from you, the player. It makes you question your own stupidity or lack of attention that sets you in a rage against yourself, rather than against the game.The music is perfect. Zone 2 is my least favorite of the bunch, but there's so many classic tracks during the gameplay - Tracks like King Conga and 3-2 or even 4-3 are just utter perfection. Danny B deserves more acclaim from this work than he's already received. A rhythm game needs good catchy music, and Necrodancer has that in spades.The daily challenges offer a chance to separate the good players from the players like me. It's a nice touch, offering every player the game challenge, so you and some friends can compete against each other. There's a nice variety of items and shrines you can use to build your necrodancer with. A rougelike with a twist! I wouldn't recommend this game if you're deaf... or blind. I mean, that should be a given. But if you have one good hand and you like bouncing to the beat of some catchy music, you should purchase this title. And then buy yourself a t-shirt and continue gushing about your praise over this game to your girlfriend unitl she asks you to leave her alone. I mean, that's what I did. It worked out for me.			"

If you do beat a monster AND move accordingly to the beats, you get a gold multiplier, which multiplies the gold you get from fallen monsters WHICH you can spend at shops inside the dungeon WHICH got a shopkeep who sings with the voice of Luciano Pavarotti.

								I haven't put a lot of hours into this game yet, but it's probably one of the best games I've played in a long time.I generally like most rhythm games, but to have one that incorporates an adventuring game within it, and doing so VERY successfully, is rare to find.  This game doesn't require much time to play through a single round of it, but you can easily lose a lot of time in the game.It's certainly a title to pick up if you enjoy well composed original music set to a rhythm style play that doesn't require ""twitch-skills"" and also want to adventure through a few dungeons and killing a few baddies along the way.

								This is one of those games that has a very clear understanding of what makes it special and commits to it hard. As a result, the game is an absolute joy to play and once you get the hang of it, you feel like a beast. Using your own songs seems to work really well (I've only tried three songs so far, but they all were great). The default music is thankfully really enjoyable, with the shopkeepers sort of ""singing"" the tunes when you're near. While the game is in early access, it feels pretty complete to me at this point, though I should point out that I only played it for about 2 hours and got as far the 5ish level, what I'm trying to say is, if you buy it now, you won't get a bug filled mess with no content.

								I legitimately cannot think of a single bad thing to say about this game, even in its current state. Maybe a lack of content? But not really, each zone has an entirely new set of enemies and enviromental hazards. The difficulty curve is stellar, as well. There's no ""easy"" in the game but it ramps up at just the right pace so as to never overwhelm you. It's mostly a matter of learning each enemy's patterns. Heck, this game is practically an action/puzzle game (or pure puzzle, with the bard). Mostly about strategizing on the fly, keeping the rhythm and never missing a beat while tearing monsters to shreds. It all meshes together so perfectly that I can't even. I can't. The soundtrack is great, too. Very diverse sounds that fit their areas well, and pretty catchy to boot. The game also looks wonderful, great spritework and animations and a very cohesive visual style. There's little story present but who really needs it, this game is about the gameplay through and through.I could keep going on but it'd be redundant because I absolute adore this game through and through and can't wait to see it updated and finished. Heck, even if it doesn't get ""finished"" ever I wouldn't be overly disappointed, what we've got already is certainly worth the asking price.			"

												I bought the game on Sale, went for the Collectors edition solely for the soundtracks. Totally worth for the music alone.  On to the game!This is a like a blend of The Binding of Issac and *insert music based game here*.

												This game combines two of the best things in life, roguelikes and awesome music.A little tricky right at the start, but once you've learned the enemy patterns the skill ceiling is quite manageable.Very satisfying to play when everything clicks, and you slay dozens of monsters to the beat.If the included music isn't good enough you can add custom music as well, so you can bounce around the dungeon to phat Beethoven beats instead if you so desire.

												Very enjoyable, and also at later stages very difficult. It is what it looks like: a rhythm-based almost-roguelike game - an unusual combination of genres which works surprisingly well. The game does not have a vast number of areas, but the  levels are procedurally generated so it is not too predictable and the challenge is great enough that the game will not be over too fast. There are also various unlockable characters with different playstyles and varying levels of difficulty, which helps to extend the life of the game. The soundtrack is good, which is crucial for this type of game, although it is occasionally difficult to pick out the beat which the game expects you to move to. The only major complaint I would have is the aforementioned limited level variety which does become frustrating when replaying the same sorts of levels over and over with any one of the several ludicrously difficult-to-play characters in the game. Overall, however, the game is still well worth buying if fast-paced 2D games hold any appeal for you at all.			"

								This game is a real joy to play, largely owing to the awesome soundtrack. It was written by the same guy who did the music for Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac. He has the best style, it's like Techno Nintendo Metal from the future. Don't let the whole 'rogue-like' thing scare you, this game is lots of fun and when you die it just feels like 'meh'. Worth playing for the sheer uniqueness of it imo. I even convinced my non-gamer roommate to play co-op with me today.			"

								A harmonious fusion of what should be a pair of the most dissonant genres imaginable. It's a strong roguelike with the spine of a rhythm game, and it pulls it off spectacularly. It is a testament to the game's strengths that it's even a blast while playing as the bard, a character that completely ignores the rhythm component of the game.The rhythm component is much stronger than simply moving to the beat, as the various enemy tells end up with you effectively creating dances around them. And of course, the soundtrack is nothing short of fantastic.The fact that this game is still in early access is extremely exciting, as in it's current state, it's already a beautiful mashup.

												The game's only failing is that the fun falls apart if you don't play to the beat. The punishment for breaking the beat on most modes is you lose your coin multiplier. This doesn't serve as a direct in the moment penalty, but as a penalty for down the line when you don't have enough money to buy the cool things.It has a great variety of playable characters which change up the challenge.

I. Love. This. Game!(Even though I suck at it.)When I started playing this game, and I couldn't beat the first stage, I wasn't really good at catching rhythm in songs. But now, it's a piece of cake! You can really learn from this game. Anyone who is making music should try it out, to test their rhythm skills, and maybe learn how to play rogue-like dungeon games :PIt has a total of 10 different characters (and another one in the DLC), each having different playstyles than the others.The soundtrack is amazing! It's made by Danny Baranowsky. It features 24 tracks in the base, and 5 extra in the DLC! (on 4th of February 2017, I don't know if Dan will make more soundtrack (which I would really like, it's amazing))Not to mention, there are a couple remixes in the game too!-an EDM remix by A_Rival;-a metal remix by FamilyJules7x;-a freestyle retro remix by Jake 'Virt' Kaufman;-a synthwave remix by Girlfriend Records;-a (i don't know what music type it is) remix by OverClocked;-and a chiptune remix by Chipzel, featured in the Xbox One version!You can also upload your own tracks, and this game will even find the rhythm!The only problem I have with this game, it's really hard. You have to stay concentrated, feel the rhythm, know the patterns and think fast - I often find myself dying from little mistakes, but that's the process of learning, right?I recommend it for everyone. It's worth it, and I love it. You might rage a bit, miss a couple beats and die, but don't all games do that? If you like challenges, this game is for you! But I don't get it, why people say it's not a game for casual players. Who really cares? It's an amazing game! I found myself enjoying it all the time. GET IT!Have fun, and don't forget you have a shovel :necroshovel:			"
