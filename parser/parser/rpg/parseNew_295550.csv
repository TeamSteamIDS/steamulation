												Alright, after 6 hours of playing this game and hitting level 20, I think I can review this now, because I'm not about to waste any more time playing this game.I'll start with the Pros.Pros:-Good looking game, variety of enemies, and I liked the coloring.-A decently big tree filled with Talents and skills, but only sub classes per each class, (4 classes, 2 subclasses each)-I thought the music was pretty nice.Cons:-BARELY any bag space, if you want more bag space, guess what? $$$$$$$-Adds nothing unique to the genre, very bland.-Barely any players (Probably because you have to pay to get in, there will probably be a lot more in the next week)-Very, and I repeat, VERY generic mmo. The quests consist of gather that, kill this, talk to this guy, give this guy this, etc etc and they have you running around huge amounts of land which is very time consuming.-Forced PVP in some areas, I got killed without knowing twice by some random player while doing a quest.-Obviously a Pay to win game, even the cosmetics give you +5% hp or +5% stamina, and those are just items ON TOP of your actual equipment. I have also not received a regular mount 20 levels into the game, so paying is your only option to get a mount as far as I can see.-Again, very generic mmo, this game would have been good 8 years ago. conclusion: this game isn't worth your time, there's way better mmorpgs out there.

												This is a ""pay to play"" even though they claim it to be a f2p mmo. By f2p they meant you can download the game for free and log-in to it and that's it. Once in the game you immediately see how badly they want you to pay to play the game, 1. Your inventory space, you'll be throwing stuff every now and then just to accomodate the things you need the most.2. Deep in a dungeon/far from the city and want to go back? go buy teleport from the item shop else suicide your character.3. Quest is too far, can I have at least a low quality mount sold from an NPC to travel faster? No, go buy from item shop else be a warrior (they somehow have some for sale).4. I saved hundreds of thousands just to buy a mount from a greedy paying player, I'm bad♥♥♥♥♥now right? Hell no, that's just some low quality mount unless you feed it(go buy from the greedy player again or the item shop).5. You seem to have lots of things that needs to be bought from the item shop, we can do daily quests to earn small amount of item shop currency right? Hell no! get lost you filthy Earth scum! lolThese are just a few of the things that I personally dislike about the game but to be fair I'll add something good about it.1. It's just another MMO, you know the game you play just for nothing. You just want to try it and not expect anything great about it.2. You'll probably be turned-off in just a few hours of gameplay therefore it won't be able to waste your time a bit more unless you try to make the game likable but in the end fail(like me).			"

												It's an F2P, P2W game.There really isn't a lot more to say about it.If you want to grind forever, get killed all day long by people who spent $20 and level half as fast as anyone else around you, by all means. Play this game.If you actually want to have fun, play anything else.			"

												Don't let the idea that you can purchase premium currency with in game gold fool you, this game is pay 2 win. If you're high level (50+), you can earn enough gold to pay for a premium membership (or royal blessing, as it's called), but there's much more to be had with premium currency. More backspack in your tiny backpack? Pay up. Per item type (equipment, loot, potions, quest items). Would you like to revive instantly? Pay up. Fast travel for no gold? Pay up. Pet collars? Pay up. In fact, you're constantly nagged with functionality that requires you to either get a premium membership or pay a one time fee in premium currency. Constantly.If you don't have a premium membership, you receive a lot less gold, experience and loot. Your resurrecting sickness lasts seven times longer, and much much more.The game itself is alright. There are tons of different spells, and different classes really do feel like different classes. Some quests are unique and interesting, but most are fetch, deliver or kill quests. The PVP wasn't well thought through, and can be tedious at times. Most areas look similar, and enemies are not very unique in the way they act.The chat is horrendous and unintuitive. This leads to very little chatter over the airways and a sort of isolated feeling, as if you're not really in an mmorpg.Overall, the relentless pushing to get you to pay up spoils most of the fun, especially since your basic account is so limited it's hard not to feel pressured into spending money. I can't recommend it.			"

												Okay, let me start by saying, the whole look and feel is wonderful..My only problem with this game is that its a point and click, which i rather hate for these types of games furture more they do not give you the option to change controls to WASD like most logical minded games would. When you first get into the game the first thing they do is try to get your money... and when i say try to.. they TRY TO.. all these screens pop up to buy premium and then shows you the item shop next, this is before you have even got started on the game. So.. of course i took a look though the store, and this is all Pay 2 Win, meaning..There is no balance for Paid vs. Free players. I understand the whole idea of these Free 2 Play games, but this game is clearly just out for your money. Its not like other games that have great balance like LOL, Dota, CSGO, Neverwinter.. ect ect.. Don't get me wrong some people like Pay 2 Win, but what sets this apart from others is their dire need to lure you in before you even get started in the game and this to me just screams desperation. Your next question probably is going to ask is this a turnbased game, my answer to that is yes and no.. its semi turnbased due to the controls, its def not hack and slash as most would generally expect.The eye view on this game is also terrible.. really terribe, i would suggest not getting this game till its 100% free and not pay for anything till you have tried it out for yourself. Some people like point and clicks, some people like terrible views, some people like Pay 2 Win, but since this is my review i dont.At this time i do not recommend this game. I will continue to watch for updates and see if they make any changes to controls then ill give it a shot again, for now.. NO			"

												I've Been playing this game since Open beta released. I gotta say, The people I've met here in RQ were kind, and sharing. Community Is Great(I'd rate it 7.5/10) There are trolls and ragers, But not that many. Now, the gameplay is pretty strange since this was my first click to move MMO that I've Played. You get used to it though, I see why they would drop the normal WASD key configuration to click 2 move since there are many spells in each classes(LOTS,There are also many Slots to add in your interface,Side slots and 3 rows on the bottom). Also this game forces you to pay for blessings, which is a time duration item that gives a certain amount of bonus exp+gold intake for an amount of time.     Now about the bad things to point out. To reset skills 1-20(Yes, there is a limit of levels where you only can reset from a certain item) 1-20 is where it only takes about 200 gold(which is really REALLY easy to get). Now 21-49, you need a flower. This Flower costs about 99 reales(reales are REAL LIFE CASH-Worth about $2-$3). The flower can be easily bought for about 800k+ and is pretty expensive for people that are levels 21-49. Now 50-60 is where it gets really damn serious. To reset you need to spend $$$(199 reales) or 2-3 Mil gold in game just to reset. This is ridiculous In my opinion. Also note that there are 2 certain categories to reset, Talent Points and Characteristic Points(STR-INTEL-VIT-LUCK-DEX) Which makes you have to spend x2 the money just to reset everything. This Plus the Blessings people usually buy.    Now the PvP system. The PvP system they have for RQ was only probably meant for 1v1s, Only because there are so many single target spells for many of the classes,subclasses etc. PvP In royal quest always connected to eachother. Meaning that One class counters another and another.    Finally, the conclusion of what I think about this game is that if you are beginning to play MMOs, This is a really REALLY great example of what to play as your first MMo. But if you are an experienced MMo player and a hardcore MMo player like me, There are so many MMos that beats this one(No offense Royal Quest). Rattings-Overall Gameplay-7.5/10Combat-6/10Ez Navigation-8/10Community-9/10Graphics-6/10StoryLine-2/10This is all In my Opinion, Please Do NOT get offended If I said anything wrong about RQ.			"

												For all those calling this P2W you need to quit reviewing F2P games, you have no clue how F2P works. Every MMO F2P game has microtransactions. Someone has to pay for server upkeep and development, in short no F2P MMO will ever be truly free.The upper hand Royal Quest has over it's competitors is that over 95% of what can be bought with cash can also be sold in the in game market for gold. Collecting gold in game is also very easy for players who do not want to pay any cash into the game. Even the cash shop currency can be sold. So it gives no advantage to any players that prefer to buy cash shop items.This is actually a great game and THE MOST BALANCED F2P with cash shop items I have ever played and I have played them all, literally. I am sick of the all the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor reviews of games by players who don't have enough knowledge into said game to give it an factual review. So let's clear up some of these misconceptions already put out there for this particular game:1. Bag space. Your bag upon starting is split into 5 sections with 14 spaces each, that is 70 slots total. I've played plenty of ""F2P"" MMORPG's with less.2. There is no forced PVP Zones. You can choose to follow your open world quests and grind or you can join the sandbox PVP zone for boosted EXP points.3. EVERYTHING except the market currency can be bought at different NPC's, INCLUDING CASH SHOP ITEMS AND MOUNTS FOR IN GAME CURRENCY! One of the best mounts in the game cannot even be bought, it has to be unlocked with quest items. You don't have to buy these items just from players. Cash shop currency can be bought through the auction house . And they have included a maximum/minimum cap on how much a player can charge for cash shop currency. This is to fight gold farming companies. IN WHICH CASE NO OTHER ""F2P"" game has ever initiated a limiting system like this and has actually done very well for this game. You won't ever go into town seeing shouts of ""Golds 200k=9.00 US @ royalquestgolds.com"" or some garbage along those lines.4. You don't have to pay anything to get in as some other review has mentioned.5. Another reviewer had mentioned getting constantly killed by another player with OP cash shop gear. You cannot buy gear in the cash shop for this game. You cannot buy the ingredients in the cash shop to craft gear. This RPG much like every other RPG is heavily character build based. I haven't purchased **** since I first started playing and was already dropping characters 10 levels higher in the PVP zone in the most basic gear I could pick up. Also in which case PVP zones are limited by levels also so no getting into battles at level 13 with level 47 characters. PVP Zones are level designated & only allow a 10 level difference. 6. Now with the newest update all classes are about balanced in PVP. The crusader for a time there was a tad bit horrible but the new update has fixed that.7. No kill stealing, no powerleveling. Everyone who hits an enemy will gain their proper share of exp from it. Even if you are not partied with that/those other person/people. However who ever does the most total damage will get the loot. All characters in a party with the exception of PVP zones, since parties can get split up in the zone, must hit the targets to get exp from it. No letting another character stand aside gaining EXP while a higher level character decimates the battlefield. Each person must attack to get their exp share. Again another way to combat gold farms & their services. In the PVP zones however, you will get exp from ally kills no matter where you are and the total end exp when you leave the zone is what you truly get, it is not split up dismally between the party when you leave. What you see is what you  get.8. All mobs that can aggro will be aggro'd. A system in Royal Quest needed in most MMORPG's to eliminate people's needs for vacuum hacking. If you run past 20 aggro set monsters in Royal Quest you will pull 20 aggro set monsters. At that point it's fight or flight. Which can make for some interesting save-your-***-moments. Had another character try &  run past me pulling roughly 10 monsters, he ended up dying right next to me and in an instant they were set on me.9. There is no such thing as junk in Royal Quest. Everything you pick up can and will be used for crafting something or commission(repeatable) quests which give Exp/gold/items sometimes all 3 and a few of them give a cash shop item. Even not so great gear can be broken down for crafting materials. Which makes making money in the game so easy. There is always somebody looking for what you have. And as I had mentioned earler more than 95% of cash shop items are sellable in the market. There really is no upper hand for cash users, unless you think that NO bonus stat costume is giving the player at the controls an ego boost...(At this time there are only 4 total pieces of costumes/pets/decorations that give bonus stats, which are horrible compared to the stats you can get from crafting normally).10. Fair level up system for those of us who work. Your character gains 2x exp points when you are offline resting. The exp amount is dependant on your character level. Fetch, kill and collect quests are pretty fair in ratio at each level. So for collect quests which take the most time you can grind for a little bit, collect the money then buy the necessary collection items in the market/auction house.It is your standard point & click, press skill button, type of game. Lightweight on processor and graphic usage. For those that prefer WASD movement like myself...as someone else had mentioned, the point and click system absolutely sucks. Because of this, I would compare this game to a cross between point & click ease of Diablo, skill system of Dekaron, and speed of Dragon Nest (When you get into higher levels of course). Some AoE's have a targeting system similiar to that of Wildstar. Camera movement is very Diablo-esque, which can also be annoying sometimes. This game could also use a better guide on how to obtain certain types of currency in game for specific NPC's, and NO, none of this special currency cannot be bought in the cash shop. HOWEVER, ONE WARNING: This game has been in open beta for over 2 years now(Yeah, I know that is rather ridcilulous.). So be prepared for major changes that could be postive or negative.Update as of 07-24-16 I can no longer recommend this game due to it's unchanged model & extremely slow updates I have moved on to Eloa (Hosted by Webzen), Devilian (Hosted by Trion), & HeroWarZ (Hosted by Kog Games). These 3 games are much better 2.5D games.  Eloa being the most similiar to RQ but with much more content and much less push for Cash Shop items. Also Eloa uses a unique ""Stance"" system that allows certain skills & weapons in certain stances for each class. As well as your pets help combat enemies in the realm. Even better WSAD or Click to move are options. Sadly this is not a suite (Steam, Arc, Origin, Aeria Ignite) game, so the population is not great at this point.			"

												kind of addicting until you get past level 20 and start going into pvp zones... or rather they are regular zones that you need to get crafting mats from where people can kill you. So most pvp is just people griefing crafters.  Also very p2w after level 20.If your going to play this game, just get to level 20 sell your gear and send everything to the next character you want to play and so on.			"

												1 month on the game and i can tell you, if anyone says this game isn't pay to win, they're filhty liars, grinded with my partner for hours and hours, the pvp and pve was enjoyable, then the high lvl twinks and ptw players appeared... this game could be enjoyable if you got a 1000$ to just throw at it otherwise your going to be farming and farming for days, only to have a player, who puts money in to stomp your face, and the royal quest wiki people from in game edit and delete information that should be mandatory. if you have fun getting your face stomped by players that have spend hundreds/ to thousands of dollars or spent the last 6 months on game so they can kill you what ever level you are this game is for you. if your looking for a game based on skill and that isn't pay to win i suggest looking elsewhere.

												Not a terrible game at first, really is F2P and is quite enjoyable. Until you hit level 20 or so, and then you're forced to go into pvp zones to gather quest items. These zones are designed for trolls. Don't get me wrong, there are some people who understand that you're only there to get what you need for a quest or two and then leave. Or just to farm some xp for your next level. But thats about 1% of the people in said zones. The zones usually encompass 9-10 levels meaning you could be level 20 trying to grind and there is a level 28 trying to do the same. Except when you come across someone who is 8 levels ahead and is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they just continuously kill you. Long story short, the game is designed for trolls beyond level 20. I highly recommend you just save your time and anger and just avoid this game all together.			"

TOP QUESTION: Is this game P2W (Pay to Win)ANSWER: The short answer is NO, however, let me go in depth with this...When you start this game you get 3 days free premium this gives you:+50% EXPERIENCE AND DROP RATEPORTAL SKILL (This allows you to save 5 places and teleport to it at any time including Maidens (Rogues/Assassin/Thief get a skill called Secret Lair which allows you to save only one spot but its free!)).FREE TELEPORTATION BETWEEN MAIDENS (Even without premium it doesn't cost that much)+10 QUESTS IN QUEST LOG (I have never needed 30 quest slots even at low levels where I had 18 quests at one time, even with dailies (I will go more in depth into the dailies later on).PETS AND MOUNTSPets are utility centric as in they do nothing but pick up drops for you they do require you buy SIlver/Gold Magnet Collars from Cash Shop, they have a durability called Charge, 1 Charge = 1 drop picked up (Pets are not worth the trouble having other than aesthetics you can easily just pick up the drops yourself with spacebar).Mounts again are utility centric they offer increased movespeed as well as various stat boost such as attack or health, they require Mount Feed from Cash Shop, Crusader/Dark Knight can get Mounts that do not require food for 300G from Ricker in Varlone City he is in the centre square off to the top right and from Ronda in Iris out of the South Gate of Varlone, these Mounts only give movespeed bonus (Mounts are semi useful for all classes as the buffs from them last for 1 hour even if you dismount, only the classes I mentioned can do mounted combat). You can also use Grass Chewing Gum which gives you 20% Runspeed for 15 minutes, you can get it from a daily quest or dropped from monsters (its rare to get a drop), you can also buy it from the Market fairly cheap.A Mount and a Pet can be bought from an NPC (Head of the Merchant Guild) to the south of city square in Varlone City.Reales can be bought from Market for 10-14k gold per Reale, 10x Mount Feed is 29 Reales and last for 1 hour each (290-406k for 10 hours of extra buffs, which you totally dont need if you are just PVMing although it would be useful), Silver Collar 2000 Charge is the same 29 Reales. You can get 100x Mount Feed for 269 Reales and Gold Collar 9000 Charge for 99 Reales. This is on the EU Maragorne Server.BAGS AND WAREHOUSEYou have 14 slots for each type of item they are split into Equipment, Expendables, Loot and Crafting Items. You can store excess/rare items in your Warehouse which has 27 slots available accessible at any Maiden. The 2 Bags that get full fairly quickly are Expendables and Loot but once you learn what you should keep and what should be sold to NPC or put on the Market you won't have too many bag problems.EQUIPMENT, ITEM IMPROVEMENT AND SEALINGALL Equipment in the game can either be bought from NPCs, Crafted, Dropped from Monsters, Found in Dungeons (Marked by a Cross Shaped Grave Stone with Blue particle effects, these are mostly personal so you will not be able to sell them on the Market) or bought from Players via the Market.Item improvement is done through Alchemists you will know the NPC is an Alchemist because they will have an Alchemical Cauldron next to them which is used to craft recipes. Philosopher Stone Chips are used to upgrade C Class Equipments only, Philosopher Stone Shards are used to upgrade B and A Class Equipments. Ashkalot Cubes can be used to upgrade any item while reducing its cost and protecting it from breaking (there is a daily to get these cubes), Cash Shop items can help in your upgrading but if you start using those before level 40 you are just wasting your money.Sealing is EXPENSIVE, this allows your equipment to gain extra stats quality of seal is as follows from worst to best Green/Blue/Purple/Orange. Emeralds are used to seal C Class Equipments, Sapphires for B Class Equipments and Morions for A Class Equipments. Crystal Vessels can be obtained through a daily quest, this item can be used to grant you Blood Crystal which can be used to place a new seal on an already sealed item (The current seal will be DELETED and a NEW seal put on). Emerald, Sapphire, Morion and Crystal Vessels can be purchased from Master of Enchantment outside of Academy of Magic Varlone City bottom right of map. Cash Shop items only help to alter the seals already on the equipment or to allow the lowest quality of Blue to be added.DAILIES AND X2 EXPERIENCEThere will be many dailies but the two worth mentioning are Caustic Acid (This nets you 3 Ashkolot Cubes for 50 Caustic Acid) and Green Slime (This nets you 2 Crystal Vessels for 50 Green Slimes), you can take these quests soon after you hit level 20 from the Message Board in Varlone City centre to the bottom right. You can also get a free Emerald along with 2 Potions from Protecting the Vegetable Garden from Pests taken from Connor Barr in Elgore. You can bring up available quests by hitting the M or Q key and clicking the Available Quests tab top right (You will need to bring up the map and click this tab and quest to see where to go for it each time you lose your way).You will gain resting bonus experience if you are not on your character for more than 8 hours to a max of 20 hours this works on all quests and monsters you gain experience from will be doubled till it is depleted.BELLA THE RARITY BUYER AND SELLA THE COLLECTORCards are rare drops from monsters which can be given to Bella for Insignia's of Distinction or sold on the Market. Various items can be bought from Sella for Insignia's of Distinction including PREMIUM TIME as well as a few things that can be bought in Cash Shop which includes Decorations that give +5% Health. They are both located in centre court of Varlone City to the northwest. You can also gain Insignia's of Distinction by PVPing in PVM/PVP areas Rewards are given monthly and you must be in the top 20 PVPers.CRAFTINGMost loots are used for crafting, C Class Equipments are 100%, B Class 80% and A Class 60%. Flax is important in crafting you find this randomly by digging up plants. Ores are also found scattered around areas and as you progress through the game you will find the higher quality ores, digging ores also gets you Anthricite. Elum is obtained through Equipment that you put in the Splitter, the higher level the Equipment the more Elum you will get, Red Elum comes from Weapons, Blue Elum comes from Clothing (Armor, Headgear etc), Green Elum comes from Accessories (Rings, Amulets etc). So keep those Equipment drops! if you plan on crafting (Crafting gets you personal gear with slots, the same as Dungeons). WARNING keep all Gem drops if you do plan on crafting as they drop rarely and are used in recipes at high levels. Some Crafting Recipes can be bought from NPCs inside of PVM/PVP areas, they require you gather Elenium nodes which will give you Alchemical Runes with which to buy the Recipes. Recipes also drop from monsters. You can find all the machines necessary for crafting/splitting at the east side of Varlone City, SPECIAL NOTE the Elenium Converter requires Alchemical Runes to change 1 material to another.PVP FIGHTING ARENAPushing A on your keyboard brings up a Menu with Battleground, Arena and Store (in the Center, Blue button), You can join Arena 5 times a day to earn Blood Tokens which in turn can be used to buy from the Arena Store to improve your prowess vs other players, there is also a Mount and Pet as well as various potions.To conclude the game is beautiful the music is great and I enjoy playing it for free.I hope you found this Review(Guide) informative and insightful.Go here for more!All about RQ and MORE![eu.royalquest.com]HAPPY RQing!

												I thought i would like this game, as my girlfriend talked wonders about it. and it looked promising, but theres a few things that spoke out ot me after a few days of playing it.Its a classic ""Pay2Win"" MMORPG like Forsaken World or PerfectWorld.now that wouldnt bother me as much, if it didnt have a huge payment wall right at level 20 when you have to pick a subclass. I was a warrior, and i wanted to be a Dark Knight. There were 2 options to become one. 1. i could kill a room full of mobs and then kill the ""Horrid Beast"" or i could go grind for a few hours, collecting 65 peices of grass. I picked the faster, and obvious, Horrid Beast line. So i clean out the room rather easily and then get ready for the beast. well the beast killed me and i respawned. so i started strategizing and saw that potions heal instantly and i can be in combat, so i get the 100% health potion and i bought a very expensive Energy restoration potion from the market and try again.. and again... and again.. because no matter how many times you try, you cannot kill this monster. I had the best gear i could get, i spent hours grinding levels and weapons and i even bought the Welcome Pack. Not to mention the countless payment walls i noticed. Bag space is limited to about 15 slots, you can extend your bag if you pay with ""Reals"" which are the premium currency. theres a premium shop full of gear and stuff you could buy, not to mention the other 2 ""Dlc"" items that add gear and stuff to your account. If you want anything in this game, you have to buy it.*EDIT*So ive been getting comments (Like Kez1304, stating that since i had 2 options of getting an objective done that its not ""pay to win"". first off, thats completely and utterly false. its a paywall, a very classic example of a paywall. And on top of that, he said that i didnt spend a dime on the game, so let me clarify.), which i have deleted because steam does not allow comment replies, and most people are spineless and dont allow comments on their profile. I had bought 2/3 DLC packs, which gave me a very powerful edge on the gameplay. Potions, armor, weapons, items, mounts.. all in one pack. On top of that, most items in game cost gold, which is really hard to grind........ unless you buy it with the premium currency.			"

												Not gonna go into too much details there are way too many reviews that explain far better and go into great details about why the game is below average. Here are the reasons simply said from someone who has played the game for 2K hours and was stupid anough to think the game was going to get better:1. The game Screams pay to play. Only people who enjoy it are the ones who pay and it's because the pretty much rule the server and decide if you will ever get gear as good as theirs.2. Very slow grinding - common for many MMOs but when you're not a premium user and you have to waste 6 hours for 2% by doing the same daily quests over and over and over untill they end and congrats + 2% xp gained.3. Lack of Quests. I swear in a couple of hours of play you're going to finish all your quests for your level and you will be forced to play in a PVP map where any parties of players or possibly a player with 9 levels above you will kill you, take your items, you have a chance to spawn right next to them and will give you weakness witch you need to wait out.4. The Community and Forums are♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you don't agree that the game is a masterpiece and it needs no player feedback, suggestions, balance or some improvement then you're just a ""♥♥♥♥ing idiot with no place on this planet who should uninstal the game because you can't tell what's high class and perfection and you should go die""5. The Steam version is EU+US version. Don't play it. I know it sounds stupid but find the Russian version. They hold events so common, players are nice to each other, the gap between paying and non-paying players is shorter, prices at market don't charge you absurd and unpayable prices, your feedback is rewarded and there are English speaking players. If you want to try this game out go ahead, you have been warned. As soon as you reach level 27 your fun is going to End. Have a nice day and maybe look for a better MMO			"

												Ok, After playing a little bit, and having 2 characters reach level 20+ i have this to say:the game is fun, at first.-- Bag Size, WTF?!? the bag is so small you start throwing things away. you have to pay REAL money to get a bigger bag.-- Mounts, WTF?! Unless you started as a warrior, you have to pay REAL money to get a mount.-- Death, WTF?! Ok, I died. i want to revive at the same spot cause i walked alot to get there. ""PAY ME"" the game shouts.    if you don't pay, you go back to town, with 1/2 of the HP and Energy, and if you are Lvl 20+ you also get a 10 MINUTE    weakness!---------------THIS GAME SCREAMS MONEY--------------i actually think that there are more MicroTransactions on this game than on most Mobile Games....********PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE PLAYING UNTILL YOU GET TO LEVEL 20-25******                           ********without using money, game is worthless******			"

												Royal Quest is incredibly enjoyable, but be prepared to loosen your purse strings.Pro's:- Satisfies the desire for an old-school grind MMORPG.- Many skills and combos, great for PVE and PVP.- Guild wars.- Castle sieges.- Challenging raid content.Con's:- Very Expensive Cash Shop (A few friends have spent >$5,000 on upgrades/equips on a geared max level character).- P2W is the foundation of being good end game.- Only two populated guilds.- Player population is very low and dwindling.- The DEV team does not engage or communicate with the player population.- Patches are geared towards the cash shop, never game balance, updates, or fresh content.- Extremely overpowered / underpowered classes.To recapitulate this game was fun while it lasted, but is now far past its prime and not worth the monetary investment.

												The graphics and animation in this game are extremely fluid and beautiful. The art design and monster models are often very creative. I'm enjoying this game more than I thought I would. I also really enjoy the isometric top-down view. Otherwise it is pretty standard fantasy RPG fare. But I like that just fine.Also, the F2P features aren't so bad. You can buy the store currency with the in-game gold you earn by playing. I haven't found that there is too much the pay store offers that you can't do without anyway. The mounts are a bit overly costly to maintain, but aren't all that much faster than walking anyway. Bag storage is a pain, and too expensive to expand much, but stores are abundently available for shedding a filled up inventory. I'm not finding it too bothersome ...yet.I recommend giving the game a try. If it's not for you, so be it. You have spent nothing.			"

												Royal Quest is a decent game, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't bring anything spectacular to the MMORPG table. It's about as run-of-the-mill as you can get content-wise. A few of the pet-peeves I had were the fugly faces in the character creation and the horrendous camera angles. You also have to use click-to-move, but I didn't have much of an issue with that since I played a lot of Diablo and Torchlight games. But dang, the camera♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off more than it should have.			"

												So, after racking up over a hundred hours I decided to actually write a review for RQ.First off, the game is -NOT- Pay to Win. You can buy premium currency with gold. Second off, most of the people who are bad mouthing the game either have very low hours played (under 5) or got their♥♥♥♥♥♥rocked in PVP (Which is entirely optional)It feels alot like Ragnarok Online but with better graphics and animations. There are also far more skills than Ragnarok.The leveling is slow, but the game isn't all about leveling. Anyway, here's a Pro/Con list.PROSDecent, fluid graphicsFun gameplayYou can buy any premium item with gold.There's PVP (That is instanced so you don't have to PVP)Lots of class diversityDaily quests for faster levelingCard system to upgrade gear (Apply poison/fire/etc or extra damage to weapons/gear)You can buy premium items with in game currency from other playersYou can buy premium account time from other players with in game currencyYou can set up shopsCONSSometimes the grammar is a little bit off, nothing major.The upgrade system is based on a % chance so after +5 it fails alotThe debuff from dieng lasts a little whileOverall, it's a great game that I'm having lots of fun with.

												First, complete ripoff of the classic MMO, Ragnarok Online. It misses what Ragnarok had however by.... messing up completely.Furthermore!, everything about the game screams, ""GET OUT NOW UNLESS YOU PAY US!!!"". Within killing a few different types of monsters and grabbing up the loot, my bag space become completely full. No, wait.... there are seperate bag slots [equip/use/loot/ect], my LOOT bag became full almost instantly. It was then that I took a look at the bags, just a few measly slots. If you are going to try and become a crafter, you NEED to pay for extra room.... or just do a lot more work than you should have to.I died. Yes, it happens. I died and got the option to revive in spot instead of having to walk for five minutes to get back to where I was. Thing is, in order to revive on spot, you NEED to pay for that. I didn't take a close look at how much the in game currency costs but I think it's like 25c in order to revive on spot. That's $1 for 4 on spot revivals... YIPPEE!!!I said it before, I'll say it again, this game STOLE everything about Ragnarok Online, changed some of the gameplay, changed the grid layout to more of an 8 direction instead of 4 like RO, changed the art and called it fresh.THIS. IS. NOT. FRESH! This is copywrite infringement at it's worst.Jesus... I thought Hunters Blade was a travesty against Monster Hunter, this is worse because it has the potential to actually succeed, to actually make a truly obscene amount of money. And it IS obscene because it IS theft. They are trying to profit off of one of the most amazing MMO's that has ever existed and they are saying it's like nothing else??They said, point blank, ""Guild Wars"". Catchy name, huh? I wonder why... hmm... because it's one of the top MMO's of our day? I get it, yes, they mean War of Emporium. They couldn't very well say THAT could they?They are getting away with copywrite infringement because, while the game is an obvious clone of RO, nothing is exactly the same. Fly Wing [randomly teleport] isn't called Fly Wing, Elder Tree are called Stock [who came up with that lame name?] and don't drop branches that summon random monsters [that I have seen...] and just... everything is slightly different.It still just.... it isn't right. They are going to make a killing off their truly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ [against players] P2W system and it isn't even their game. And, honestly, it isn't even very good. I had people constantly come up to me while I was fighting, wait till my monster had like 10% health, attack it once for the kill and steal it.... the exp, the items.... everything. I think that's how the comabt system worked in RO [or... am I wrong... it's been years] but these days, people have no internet morals. Give people a way to kill monsters, get items and exp without having to fight, without having to lose health and mana/energy/ect.... they will do it.I remember in RO how the bots would always take stuff... they were the only one's... well, them and noobs but noobs learned fast that it's better to be chill and not steal. Oh, that brings me to another point!; I played for a few hours, there were some people just running around killing everything, stealing kills... same people... for hours. The game ALREADY has bots!!! I mean they are f***ing cockroaching the game already!!! Bots. Killed. RO. Based on the amount of bots in the game... I don't really know for sure if the game WILL survive..... I just know that it has no right to survive. It is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ripoff of one of the greatest MMO's of the past.... well... of the internet ever actually!My top list of MMO's [some of the games do not apply past certain points, only at their high points but it is the high points that count to me] are, in no particular order.WoWRagnarok OnlineStar Wars Galaxies [pre CU but LOVED Jump to Lightspeed!!]The Secret WorldMabinogi & Vindictus [putting them both together because same game universe]EVE OnlineMonster Hunter Frontier [even though I only played a few hours, I know I would love it most of all~]Dungeons and Dragons Online [before the crappy P2W version...]The -nevergonnahappen- Pokemon MMO that is crossplatform between PC, WiiU and 3DS!!! The dream of an open world Pokemon MMO fuels my hopes and dreams for a better age of MMO's!I'm probably forgetting some.... hmm... but one thing that I'm not forgetting is ANY MMO that is thick with Pay to Win!! DISGUSTING!! Just add cosmetic stuff, people go crazy for that and the more that people play a game, fall in love with it, the more likely they are to BUY COSMETIC STUFF!!!! JESUS!!! It isn't that hard to understand is it?Er... that.... that right there is just in general. Cosmetic only for F2P MMO's.... this one, this MMO, it NEEDS to either die or the developers need to admit that they stole most of the game from Gravity [the people that made [[?]] Ragnarok Online].

												So I rarely do serious reviews, but I do love this game enough to want a good review to be seen.First things first; this game is NOT pay to win, in ANY way.  Everything in the game, yes, EVERYTHING, can be purchased with gold. If somoene buys an item with real money, they can sell it for in game gold, and people frequently do.  This is one of the best systems of any free to play ive ever seen.  If you dont feel like spending 5$ to get a ""real money"" item, just wait til someone else buys it and sells it.  You can just get enough in game gold to buy it off them when you want!I could continue, going on and on about the game in paragraph form, but ill simply list the Pros and Cons.PROS:- Fantastic Music- Responsive/noncomplicated UI- Veried Environments and Enemies- Varied Missions and mission rewards- Tons of weapons, hats, shirts, pants, shoes, etc; all with unique stats- Gear Upgrading system. (Find a reall nice piece of gear? Upgrade it and make it better!)- Lack of Pay-to-Win Elements- Devs are active! They do announcements in game, as well as work on updates, and help players who are having issues.- Fantastic community. If youre a new player, 99% of the community will answer any question you have and try to help you along the way!----------------------------CONS:- Occasional bugs, but nothing major- Bag size is relatively small to start with (this can be expanded at any time)- Some Quests have you running across large portions of the map, and you move slowly at first (better gear can fix this ""problem"")- Game is still in Beta. (This will obviously change, leading up to the full release)----------------------------Honestly I only made this review because the current top rated reviews for the game are completely inaccurate.  Most of the people who reviewed the game and then said ""PAY TO WIN DONT PLAY IT LOL"" are completely wrong.  They invested just enough time to get to about level 15 (not even to the first major choice you make in the game, which branch of your class you want to advance into) and then declared the game unbalanced.Not only is this completely false (as i said above, someone can, and people constantly do, buy ""real money"" currency and sell it on the in game market for gold. You get gold, you buy the real money currency, and you dont have to ever spend a cent on the game) But it gives the game a bad name and bad light.I played for about 2 hours and then quit originally, but came back a month or two later and havnt quit playing since.  Once i got past the newbie level stuff, I really began to enjoy the game a lot more.I also think its important to mention this is my first MMO.  I literally only play Shooters besides this game, and I usually hate games like this.  It takes something special to make a hardcore CSGO fan enjoy a top down-esque MMO game.			"

												UPDATE:changed the recommendation to NO!extremely boring...no action whatsoever!nothing that i haven't already seen in an asian anime mmorpg!so disappointed,i was expecting this game since they announced it ,back in 2009! :(ok. so this review is made when reaching lvl 10. Later, i will probably edit this.First of all, if you are a King's Bounty fan,you will probably like this game... It is developed by Katauri,same developer.Now, step by step explanation:-it isn't open world,you have regions like Dragon NestMovement:- identical like King's Bounty\Diablo, as in Click to move,( no WASD).Despite this, it's not a Hack'n'slash game.-it has also an auto-path movement,which can only be activated through opening the map.( i hate this autopath in general).Stupid thing: in autopath movement,you are not safe, the mobs will attack you... :))Combat:-you have skill bars,like any other mmorpg, but it also have the auto-attack skill which can be disabled (quite tricky though).- i play as a rogue,which has energy as a resource skill spenders.Unlike any other mmo, the energy bar is refilling very slow,and makes you wanna use the auto-attack which makes you feel like you're watching a movie or smth, because there's nothing for you to do... (big downside here...)if you don't use the auto-attack,you will lose energy after 2-3 battles and need potions to refill... which you need to buy...Levelling up:-at each level you obtain 4 skill points that need to be distributed through 4 skills... all this time, i spent them equally between the skills ,because (and maybe here i wasn't paying attention) i cannot find a skill that suits best for my rogue...questing:-basically,like any other free-to-play mmo is kill that,bring quest,receive items, etc... kinda grindy imo...item enhancements:-you need some resources for that, which i couldn't find until this level... maybe you can buy them from merchants....Professions:-until this level, i couldn't find out if this is really a feature...you can gather all sorts of items,grassy things,ooze things, etc, but i couldn't find any use for them,so i sold them to merchants...bags:-you start with one bag,slots can be bought with royal reales,which can be obtain with real cash...,until now, i found no need to buy extra slots,but after each quest, i sold everything unneeded to merchants...-stupidest thing: you have different tabs in bag (equipment,consumables,etc), but NO ALL tab.! so everytime you need to do something or to search something in your bag, you'll have to switch between tabs... kinda annoying.Graphics:style identical to King's Bounty (same engine), i give it 9\10Music:nice, but nothing compared to the music in King's Bounty,which is amazing...although I entered a dungeon of some sort,which had the same song as in KB :)Playerbase:in this moment,i found only one player in the zone,but this is because 1C Publishing made a HUGE mistake on launch:they announced it is an Open Beta with only 3 hours before launch,and turned out to be DLC purchase players only,for the first week!Overall:-it has potential..-don't spend your money to get early access, wait another week,until it's free.-i will spend some more time playing this game,and if you like KB,you need to try it.

												Alright, I think I'm far enough into the game at this point to give an honest review. Keep in mind that you may disagree, and that's fine. I want to start by saying that I have a max rank (Lv. 60) character and a guild I've personally founded by myself. I do love this game, it's very addicting. It's your tradional point and click MMORPG that reminds me a lot of how Vanilla WOW was back in the day difficutly wise.You can explore a wide variety of beautiful locations, quest with friends, tinker with whatever build you're making at the time, or just goof off and explore. If you're more of a PVP player the game offers duels with other opponents in safe zones. On top of that you can also compete in Castle Sieges, Arena, and Battleground, all of which are aimed at people who love PVP, as you'll be fighting other well geared opponents. I can say with confidence that you can hit level cap with no Premium and it's not a necessity, though it does make the game easier and a lot more enjoyable. I've given you the good, now I'm going to give you the bad.While everything up to level cap isn't pay to win, everything afterwards is. Now don't mob me on my post for saying this, it's true.1. To compete with the best players in the server PVP wise, you need great gear. Upgrading gear past a certain point requires very deep pockets as the odds of successful improvent start to go lower and lower, and finally hitting 1% after a certain point. This requires you to buy many Red Stones and Runes of Preservation.2. Sealing. Not only is getting the seal you want hard, but then getting the seal you want Orange is outrageous. You must have very deep pockets  to do this with every piece of gear, as well as unbelievable luck.3. Cards. If you want Monster Cards you're going to have to put an insane amount of grind in and hope you get super lucky, or buy them off of the market for an insane amount of gold. Some of them aren't that steep while I've seen some go as high as 150 Million Gold.So in conclusion, while this game is free to try and it's completely possible to hit lv. cap without paying a single penny, if you plan to stick around and get serious about PVP you're going to be shelling out a good deal of money, or spending many many hours end game grinding for the gold you need. So, maybe not necessarily pay to win, more like pay for convenience.  "

												Love the combat and talent system, the game plays out like an old school point and click with some old-WoW twists and stuff... But, there's flaws in the game it's not a true free game because your inventory for starters is a nice pile of poop. Traveling is only fast for paying players and some other small and needless things that require money.. Most F2P games can make enough money on appearance items.. So fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thanks.			"

												So after i played this game for a bit i can tell you few things which might help you decide to play or not .First : About p2w Aspect yea you can buy stuff in cash shop mount, bag space , hp potions ,cards well most of stuff which can be obtained from drops but low chance. But here is a thing you can buy cash shop money ""reales"" with gold from other ppl in the market so you can obtain same stuff just not instantlySecond : Game is a bit grindy, with ques,t which helps a little but you will grind for items, for craft mats etc but in my opinion its good that you can't get good stuff instantlyAnd third : Game has open pvp zones where you go to farm mats for recepies soem quests and other stuff and its free pk zone on all ofc its lvl based you can't get in to lvl 10-19 zone with lvl 20+ char So overal i like this game, I played for 200h and still gona play it as its pvp is engaging , there is NONE p2w aspect only pay to be lazy aspect, and the game has a freaking castle wars :D owning a castle is always fun			"

												I'm sort of confused by some of the negative reviews, as I'm finding this to be a pretty decent game that doesn't have many problems.First, it has a lot of lore and story to it.  It's not just quests like ""Kill 10 rats because I stubbed my toe and need toe medicine"" - the quests have more detail and story to them than that.  Each quest has been pretty detailed so far with lots of extra tidbits of story and lore you can get out of the NPCs if you select to ask them certain questions.You also find a lot of NPCs that aren't part of the quest line but that actually have story bits to add if you talk to them.  I find this extra work and detail to help the game to be much more immersive.The classes are all very different.  If you don't like the way one plays, you really should try the others as they all have their own different way to play and their own feel.  The powers are all different and specific for each class line and greatly change and affect the way you play.  This isn't like some games where the only difference in classes and skills are that they make a different graphic for them but they play the same way.  Here they all really play in specific unique ways.  Even when two classes have traps, one class they are auto traps and the other are traps you manually detonate.  There are a pretty good amount of skills too and they all have purpose and do different things rather than just being damage upgrades that look a little different.The game plays out just fine and quickly.  Yes, your main attack if you click something is set on default to autoattack (like 99.9% of every MMORPG that exists, so why one would complain about that I don't know - especially since you can toggle it off to manual if you really want) but in most classes that attack is very fast and you're going to be worried about using all your skills all through combat.  You quickly end up using a lot of them.  The only class that plays a little slower to start out is the Warrior, but even they end up with a lot of skills in time too.  If you're into melee and want faster combat, play the Rogue.  The Warrior is meant to actually be a party tank and has a lot of taunts and things instead of the fast pace skills of the other classes.  That isn't to say they are lacking, they have quite a few and you'll see them as you level up more.The game isn't well known here, so there aren't a lot of people in game right now.  Not only that, but they don't really understand why it's a free game they can't get in (the first week is just for people who buy one of the DLC packs, but they only say that if you go searching elsewhere to find that info and didn't post that here).I'm not that into PvP, but for people who are they have these nice castles your guild can take over that spawn chests of loot and have other neat little extras in them.I don't really get their whole ""PvPvE"" thing - that's just a fancy way to say PvP zones.  Most MMORPG games with PvP also have monsters in the same zones but they just call them PvP zones instead of trying to be fancy with the wording.  I really very much dislike PvP and want to avoid it, so I'll have to see how much it affects my gameplay as I level up.  I hope it's avoidable and not too too bad.  A description at their web site says there are quests in those areas which I never enjoy being forced to go to PvP zones to do quests, especially in game that has so much story and I really am enjoying reading all the quest text.  I'm not really there yet though to see how that's going to affect my play.  It could have a huge negative affect for me and even get me to quit if it's bad enough but I'll just have to wait to get there to see.The camera angles really aren't that bad.  I think they limited it in order to make the game work better on lesser systems, I'm not sure.  It runs very smooth and pretty though and I don't really see why they can't allow you to pan it so you can see into the distance a little more but you do have some tilt control and it's really not too bad.The one thing I dislike though and very much want to see change is for us to get the ability to use WASD movement in the game.  A lot of games like this launch with click to move movement only, and it's always the same.  I get sick of clicking so much, it's a pain in the butt after a while.  They really need to change the game to allow keyboard movement controls as well.  I know it doesn't work great for every situation, like if people set the camera to auto movement, but they could always disable it if you have auto camera on or find some other work around.  Too many people are going to want WASD movement controls, maybe they'll listen and put them in game in time though.So I'm finding a pretty decent game here.  You may want to wait and not chance it, and give it another 4 or 5 days until it's opened for free to everybody, but I for one am very happy with the game as it is and am glad I bought a DLC pack so I could play now.  Even if PvP areas make me quit later (again I still don't know if they will or not, it depends if I can still level and quest around without having to deal with them for the most part) - I still will be happy that I got and played the game.  It's been interesting and fun and is a good example of how to put real story and more meaning into quests.  It also is doing something very right with the skill system all being so different.  Hopefully once it's opened for free a lot of people will find out just how much they like it too.The video they have here really doesn't show much of the game, you can find videos elsewhere online of people playing the game if you really want to see how it plays though.  They don't take the time to read and go through all the extra text and things in those videos however, so if you're a person who really likes story and lore in your games you won't really see how cool it is until you're able to get in there yourself.

Some people may not like the top-down camera or the click-to-move controls, but I think they work well.It's a really nice looking game and has a pretty high level of polish for a F2P title, the exploration and questing is pretty standard but does the job.There are 4 Classes with 2 specializations and each specialization has 3 skill-trees. You get 4 stat-points each level to spend on your main attributes. Combat is fine, it's auto-attack with hot-bar skills.There are plenty of different zones and each area tends to have a dungeon or two - some of which have open-PvP which again some people may not enjoy, I think it adds to the fun.Lots of theme-park style questing from hub to hub and from what I've played you level up pretty quickly - though that may change at higher lvls.I won't comment at this early stage on whether the game is P2W or not, but I may update my review at a later date to clarify on   the cash-shop.Overall I think it's a good game and I recommend it to people who don't mind a more typical MMORPG.

												This MMO reminds me of those older Asian MMOs that came to NA many many years ago (pre-2007). This game is much more polished however, and I absolutely enjoy the ease and depth the game has to offer. With a weapon upgrading system as well as a card augmenting system and mobs dropping some very rare gear, I highly recommend it.There is a premium status you can purchase for your account which gives you moderate perks (slight boost in EXP/Drop Rate) but it's not necessary to enjoy the game. There's also your typical MTX shop but it's not blown out of proportion like other games, or at least not from what I've seen anyway.In one quest you have to play Plants vs Zombies. No joke, I have a screenshot if you're curious.			"

												This game definitely resembles Ragnarok Online, there is no doubt about it.However I still feel it does lack compared to Ragnarok Online.But don't get me wrong that doesnt make this a bad game.Royal Quest definitely have some things going for it.It is a grind-fest, but for those who like that sort of thing it's perfect. The mobs in the game are balanced well and I found myself needing to heal myself frequently.It offers a decent variety of classes. (4 base classes, each with 2 advanced classes)Quests are plentiful and will definitely help you get through the initial 20 levels of the game.Stats are self allocated leading possibilities of many unique play-styles.On the flip side there are things that Royal Quest lacks.Skills are linear, everyone of the same class will get the same skills. The talent system makes up for it slightly, but it still would be nice to have a ""skill-tree"" system.Bag space. It's not that big of a deal, but it is annoying at times and would be better if they gave us double the space.Although the cash shop isn't that bad, the cash shop definitely saves a lot of time.If you can get past these hurdles this game can definitely be something worth investing time into.

												Click-to-move only, and one of the worst cameras I've ever seen in an MMO- you can't tilt the camera down so you're stuck with an extremely limited view of your surroundings, even if you zoom all the way out. Also the camera auto-rotation just doesn't work.If you can deal with those things (I couldn't), this looks like it might be a fun game. I know this isn't much of a review, but the camera is just so awful in conjuction with the click to move, I simply cannot recommend it.			"

												This game is fun for about a few hours, and then it just gets stale. All of the character designs are pretty much the same, everyone has the same weapons, the same clothes etc. The good thing is that plenty of people play it, so if you need help with a dungeon, there is a pretty big chance that someone else is looking for a party too. However, it also has its downfalls because it takes forever to farm the items you need for a quest because 10 people are in the same area doing the same thing. Its nearly impossible to find a guild because the forums are dead or unless someone invites you randomly.  Oh, its also click click click. Click to move, Click to attack, blah blah. My biggest complaint is the fact that the inventory space is so small! Like 10 slots! And they want you to pay money to get more. If you are out farming for quest items and need to get stuff to make gold, your inventory fills up so fast. Sometimes you forget to sell stuff and have to go all the way back to the npc to sell stuff before you move on to the next area. Also, it might be worth pointing out: A lot of people don't like pvp in this game despite there being pvp in certain maps. I was in an area where I had to collect quest items that was a pvp area and soooo many people were complaining about being PK'd. I don't think its that big of a deal because when you die, you spawn to a different random area on the map without having to respawn to a npc far away.			"

												This game is really fun. I don't understand how people are voting it down because you have to click to move. Like, have you played Diablo/Torchlight? Get over it. Anyway, back to the game:It's an MMO, so be prepared for a lot of fetch quests. Besides this, it does some pretty unique things. First of which would be the leveling system. It's typical in the sense that every level you get stat points and sometimes a talent point, but the stat system is really cool. basically, every 10 points put into a specific stat, you get an extra bonus to it, and your 'rank' in that stat increases. So if I put 10 points into stamina, which is the rangers base stat, I'll get +15 to my damage output, on top of the points I put into it. Very unique and I enjoy ranking up stats.The talent point system is also fairly unique, as they're all passives. There are multiple paths to travel down, which each give your class a unique playstyle. I'm not sure if there's a way to reset these, but I'm sure there is. This game is NOT pay to win. You can obtain the premium currency by using gold, the in-game currency. Actually, gold is pretty easy to obtain as well, and so are most of the items in the game. It could be a bit of a grind, but that's how most MMOs work anyway, so it's not a big deal. I really have been enjoying my time with this game. It's fun, it's a good time waster, and it feels like there's been a lot of love and time put into it, in order to make it good. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun MMO to play with.			"

												Tried this out since I got bored with Path of Exile and Tera.  It's a mega pay to win scheme game.  Fun for a few hours, gets really boring unless you want to spend lots of $$$.  Nothing special, just like 1000 other games where you can pay to win.  You can spend your money elsewhere on better games which won't rip you off so bad.			"

												This is one of those games that makes me wish Steam had a Neutral rating for reviews. While in truth this game isn't bad, and that the game play is fairly solid, it's also true that there's nothing new here. It's the typical MMO fair. The movement controls are click-to-move, so if you've played Tourchlight or Diablo, you know what to expect. The camera feels a bit wonky at time, shifting to a higher angle at odd times, but thankfully you can rotate it 360 if needed. However the mini map doesn't rotate with you, so that gets annoying.You start with 2 toolbars for skills, but the top one is bound to Alt+# instead of the F-keys, which feels odd to me.The health meter is too small, not attracting enough attention to it, and as it's placed in the upper left cornor, it's easy to overlook it in a fight because the action is always closer to the toolbars.The initial graphics settings are OK, but even with everything cranked as high as it'll go there's very little change aside from adding shadows and foliage. I can't comment on whether there's P2W or not becasue, honestly, I haven't seen it. But as I ahven't explored a lot of this game it could be there and I just haven't seen it.Honestly, as this is a F2P game, it's up to you whether to try it or not. It's not bad but it's not great either, so I'm 50/50 on this game.			"

												I understand many of those people who rate this game low especially after 6h gametime on record(/sarcasm) If you play for few hours you will think that game is p2w. It might be. Yes there is premium item shop, and you can get items from ther without spending any ££ since you can buy it from other players for ingame money. I have spent little money in begginging to get 7 days premium because I wanted to get xp faster, I'm lvl 40 now and I just make enough gold to buy reales now. I believe the developers deserve the money anyway. I used to play RO and I was dissapointed with RO2. This is like the perfect fix for me. Yes the game feels generic , grindy but gameplay is smooth and rewarding and I believe thats the game the developers made. I've read one interview that theyre inspried by RO and D3. The game is free so you can try for yourself. There is some lore and story but I dont care about it. I just want to pew pew mobs. And people who say that game should be 100% free ... I would like 100% free car , can you get me one ?			"

												I don't know if its just me but... if you were waiting for an Ragnarok 2 here it is! (Since RO2 was totally a shame.. linear korean boring grind).Im not saying this dont have a grind look a like but is more close to the original ragnarok grind,..and man.. they got everything! Cards to put into weapons, Kafra (here called Maid), isometric camera(but with zoom and rotation), the shops at the city(and yes.. the city looks like protera) And the most notable thing: The knights use a pecopecolike creature as first mount (you change later to dragons and things like that).To me it's look awesome! Grab the Ragnarok stuff and get some elements that made World of Warcraft famous and then you have this prety cool game!The Grind at low levels is pretty medium rate (its not hard to lvl up but its not that easy too)Its NOT Pay to Win since its possible to sell and buy the cash currency at the market place. Its not cheap (almost 10k gold) but it never is in MMO.The players basicly, as far as i've played, are Latin American, but english language prevail.And the MOST IMPORTANT detail: its in Open Beta Test.. So the game is still in development.. And at the game official forum site you can give suggestion(if supported by huge amount of players your idea probably will be used).So lot of bugs and game balance will be done until the final release!I can see a promising game rising here if the developers don't make some classic mistakes MMOs are making nowadays.

												Alright, I have played quite a bit of Royal Quest and I can tell you one thing, all the other reviews that tell you that the game is pay to win couldn't be more wrong, premium items, not only aren't that great, but even those you can buy with in game currency.This is a great game, it has that old school feel to it and in my opinion the only bad thing about this game is the camera, which is usually decent but sometimes it puts you in a very weird perspective, other then that  it is totally fine, and for the price of free why not give it a shot.

I know my review is 'negative', but this is not really a bad game.  I just don't think people should bother playing it on Steam for a few reasons.  As far as I know, you cannot link your account from the official Royal Quest forums to your Steam account.  Which means you need to download the game all over again if you want to use the free promotional stuff.  Or even talk on their forums, because you have to pick a character you have created in the game to give your profile an actual name (instead of the generic one you are given when you create an account) or to actually post anything at all on their forum. Edit: Was told how to link Steam account & take advantage of the premium service they are giving out for a limited time.  Thank you very much to Enya for helping me to understand how to do this. Another issue I have is the camera does not follow the character around very well at all.  It can be disorienting and frustrating having to constantly move it around, even after having ticked the option in the menu to make the camera follow you.  It slides very slowly around your character while you move around, and doesn't look good or act very well at all.You have no option to move with W,A,S,D keys.  Only the mouse.  It's not a a deal breaker for me, personally.  But I would rather be able to move with the keys then having to hold the mouse down all the time or clicking from one spot to another.  Plus with how wonky the camera is, it just adds to the over all feeling of frustration with this game.It gives you tips and guides you, but it doesn't.  You have a tutorial you can go through to understand things a little better, but it doesn't really explain everything.  Like, everything you pick up says LOOT.  Well duh it's loot.  Everything is loot in a game like this.  That is like if you went into a bakery and every item was simply labeled ""BAKED"".  Then there's a LOOT tab and a crafting tab.  But every single thing I pick up (be it something a mob dropped or something I harvest) says it can be used for crafting but it doesn't go in the crafting tab!  That makes no sense to me and I end up selling everything very confused.  A lot of times when I go to sell something the vendor tells me the item is very expensive but they can't give me the amount it is actually worth and that just confuses me even further.Besides these things, it really is an ok game.  A little too grindy for my tastes though, as literally every quest is either kill X amount or collect this amount of these things (either something a mob drops or something you gather from the environment).  It's a good looking game with relaxing music.  You can left-click on your map to sort of auto-run to quest givers or whatever.  I just wish it wasn't so grindy and with such frustrating moevment and awful camera.			"

Posted: September 1, 2016
												As someone who joined in the first week when the game was released as open beta, left for a  while, returned, left again aaaaaand returned again, I think I can do a review of this game.First of all, you may read on other reviews that the game is dying despite decreasing player base. Well, I believe it WAS dying. Since the player base seems to have increased from 1 year ago to now. I see a lot of new players, new guilds, and a lot of ppl online! - Ok, now I can start the usual review.I've tryied some other MMOS when I left this game, but I came back! - Why??This game community is awesome! People are overall really nice and help new players with stuff, it's very easy to forma parties for PvE, there is a good PvP system and there are ALWAYS ppl playing PvP. - So it's really hard to be forced to play alone, as in some other games.There are LOTS of Guildes which you can chose from! There it THE Top Guild, with maxed lvl players ONLY, there are some other Elite Guilds, there are the Nacionality Guilds, like Russian or Brazilian Guilds, Small Guilds, Big Guilds, Active Guilds, Unactive Guilds and Ok Guilds(ENMITY yay!).Basically, there is a Guild for everybody! - Sometimes they require you hit lvl 20, 30 or even lvl 60(max) to join one, but it's actually easy to get to lvl 30 by youself. But the sooner you get to a Guild, the sooner you can ask veteran players for tips more often! - As a lvl 50 who left for a long time I sometimes ask my lvl 60s friends who are still playing lol.About it being a Pay to Win game, it is not! - Maybe if you want to defeat the Top Guild You HAVE to spend some money since some been playing the game since it released and they have AN ENOURMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME of effort by playing the game! - But you can pretty much hit lvl 60 by not paying a cent! - Sorry Katuri! - But the  grinding GETS faster when you pay real money to it! - You can also pay for it in Gold(game currency)! But it's not very cheap. The top players who don't pay real money do it! So here's my first tip lol(I should do it more often). So, I don't agree it's a pay to win game, because there are a lot of new players on the game and just a  small amount of those paid real money.On the other  hand, why not paying real money at some point? You are playing a very good game for FREE! The first two packs are actually decent priced considering the quality of the game. The third it's like VERY GOOD, but it's more than I would pay for the game, if it wasn't free.The graphics are not THAT GOOD, it may be a little childish for some, but considering MANY other MMOS that have been releasing, this one has a really nice graphic! The maps are really good as well, some quests are tyring, others are not, the game has a REALLY COOL item upgrading/ recipe/ Seal making/ stuff like that/ market System! Everything well planned and It's even possible to reset your skills WHENERVER you want(as long as you've reached lvl 20)! - If you pay one kind of in game currency of course. The game does not punish the player base who works and studies, because when you leave the game for a certain time, there will be a 2x xp bonus for quite some time, depending on the time you were gone, and it seems that the highest lvl you are, the biggest time the bonus will work for you - it seems that way, but I have not confirmed this yet. The mobs are well made, graphically and functionally, also give us drops that makes sense. I love the class/ skills system,  very good, with lot of options to chose from - not as much as tree of savior, but just enough! You can also  have many characters to your account, which means you can make a character of every class to see which you like most to play with. There are some forced PvP areas, which I really enjoy  it!The bad things about this game are the LAGS, it LAGS SO HARD at certain times! Since last patch it was almost impossible to play with my sorcerer(maybe because I use a lot of skills), but same does not happens with my other characters who don't use as much skills when I go farming. - But it's something they can fix and they do some server maintence(if I didn't write this word right, sorry, not first language and I had a blank on how to write it). Also, the time you spend grinding and how expansive stuff are, if you expect you'll get lvl 60 fast and be a top player fast, forget it! You may hit lvl 60 on record, but it takes a LOT of grinding to it. You may spend over 2 weeks on a single lvl at a certain point of the game! lol. - Right now I'm lvl 50 for 1 year! But I left for 1 year so it does not count much haha! Another bad point is the walking! AAh the walking! The game requires a LOT of time by walking from place to place. There are the instant teleports, but they cost gold, and at certain points of the game, you don't have gold for that! So, good luck on walking. Mounts are only efficient for knights, other classes can't attack from mount. And not real money mounts are not very efficient(fast), but they help a bit. Or you can also make a seal on your shoes that increase your speed! And use certain items. The space on the bag is a real struggle as well, but you can live with it and you can buy reales to buy those slots!Sorry for the confuse text, here is what you wanted:Good:CommunityFree to PlayGuild SystemMarket SystemSealing SystemUpgrading SystemForging SystemGraphicsSoundClassesSkill TressPvPPvEBad:LAG LAG LAG LAG LAGLOTS of grinding?Expansive StuffWalk Walk Walk WalkBag SpaceIf I forgot something on the list that I wrote on text, sorry, I'm late for work! lolHere is a Potato:( .)

												This game is 100% pay to win, Yes you could grind out your gear in this game, but to reach full gear, with full refines, and full cards(items that improve your gear further, which are necessary to be competitive in pvp) it would take 2 years of playing at least 4 hours a day every day. To reach max level as a new player you're looking at a solid 350 hours if you buy a premium boost to increase how much experience you get, or 525 hours if you dont want to put money into the game. But, to each their own, if you wanna shove money at this game and become the best on the server it's still possible as it's in open beta, it will just cost you about 5 months of your life playing 6 hours a day and about $4,500 dollars to build an end game character that can compete at the top tier of pvp. If the thought of taking a semesters worth of college funds, soaking it in gasoline and lighting it on fire, in addition to destroying every relationship you have in the real world sounds appealing to you then Royal Quest is the game for you! :D Closing statements: NO I AM NOT KIDDING, DONT PLAY THIS GAME IT'S CANCER, GONAHERPASYPHALITIS, PARALYSIS, AND ALZHEIMERS ROLED INTO ONE MASSIVE COCKTAIL OF DEATH.if you're lookin for an mmorpg to pour your life into, go check out tera, path to exile, or guild wars 2.

												This game has well overall gameplay mechanics. Reales that are needed to feel like a Premium Subscribe is way over cost. Make everything about 50-75% off, then this would be a Champ MMORPG to Play. When a Item Enhancement system is Rigged, the game not worth playing. Last time I was fooled was in Dragon Prophet by this same system. Good Games, greedy developers. Overall, still a fun fun fun game for a way way way Newbie. As Far Veterans of MMORPGS for 15 years +, its a money sinker and not worth the next F2P Game to motivate you to eventually spend another monthly or buy special currency. No break given to any of us Long time Players. Anyways, Enjoy if your a total Newbie.			"

												Everyone saying this game isn't pay to win is lying, they're trying to get you to start playing this game. Royal Quest is absolutely pay to win, if you were to save all the gold you made until max level you might be able to get 1 class A piece decked out without paying. PVP is VERY UNBALANCED in this game as well, the hunter class has a talent for chance to stun with basic attacks and they STACK ATTACK SPEED so its literally stun-stun-stun-stun until you die im not even lying at all, and theyre pets also have a chance to stun with basic attacks so if you do interrupt them, youre stunned again anyways. It's literally pathetic how the game developers overlook this and think this game is balanced lol. Also Warlocks have the capability to silence you for 10+ seconds, and they have a skill called insanity that makes it so you cant attack them or heal your allies for 10+ seconds.I'M NOT EXAGGERATING AT ALL THIS IS HOW THE GAME IS.

I would say above averageI payed 10$ in the 9 hours I played the game , but I could only increase my  inventory space by 5 squares (10 couse the inventory is split into categories )  , and even then It was way to small for the ammount of items (even quest items) that flooded it .The main issue is the monetization sistem, its too expensive and to reliant on it even at low lvl . pros : Great gfx (if you like clean handpainted textures )class variation in skill trees free pvp in dungeon with great loof/xp sistemcastle siegesneat pvpchallenging con :gamebreaking  cashshop repetitive soundgrindy ( I dont really mind that ,but it gets back to the casshop ) "

Grade: 40/100Difficulty: Painfully easy. You don't even have to use the different skill buttons if you have auto-attack enabled. Worse, you can click a point on your map and your character automatically heads there. Easiest RPG I've ever encountered.Pros: If you enjoy looking like you're a high school kid dressed up for cosplay, you might enjoy the character appearances. The simple format of the game makes it easy to pick up as well. So if you want a reasonably pretty game to play on the fly to kill time -- this might work.Cons: This is a Final Fantasy wannabe. From the chocobo-doppleganger mounts to the kidlike character appearances. They nickel and dime everything of value, so F2P is only going to be worthwhile for the first 10 levels. Good luck finding your quest line at that point, too. It seems to drop you like a bad habit. They also, unfortunately, let players have little shop spaces which they then proceed to line the main cities with. It's like reading through ♥♥♥♥♥ subject titles.Replayable: Not worth investing real money in, therefore no.			"

												The start of Royal Quest is fine, normal MMO doing quests till you get to the next zone where you encounter the Moron players.  Rogues in the game can use an ability called Stealth which takes them out of combat for a certain amount of time. One Rogue inparticually pulled alot of mobs and runs them all through town, then stealths to kill all other players. You cant just go into another server as there is only 1 server open at this point in time. Players can also summon monsters, which Rogues again can summon and leave to kill other players. This is not a game friendly for beginners, and no where is safe execpt major towns. If you want to play this game be warned.			"

												I think I could give one of the best reviews for this game, melee classes are very challenging to use in pve because everything hits real hard, but pvp they totally rock. Ranged classes are pretty dominant in pve because they can kill things really well and they can pretty much take all the monsters they want. Ranged classes are alright for pvp. leveling to level 20 is really easy, once you hit 25 or so you will have to start power leveling, there is a specific place in this game to go to for power leveling which is totally dominated by clans, if you don't get into one then you should quit the game because leveling will pretty much seem impossible because the only thing you can do is daily quests and no one likes that♥♥♥♥♥♥ The reason why clans are dominant is because when you get teleported to a different zone to farm monsters and get good exp but for some reason the developers thought it was a good idea to make it a pvp zone. So I would say to give this game a try if you want, you might enjoy it, I know I did until I reached level 25.			"

												It was a lot of fun at first. I played a mage (eventually a warlock at lvl 20) and when I started to attack a mob I was delighted. I was flinging spells with a flick of my wrist while holding a spellbook in my other hand. It was great. The quests are pretty generic and the environment is nice to look at. For some reason only warriors and its subclasses can have mounts and they require food to run at full speed (otherwise it's reduced to 20%). The food also costs special currency that has to be bought with cash or the random player shop will be selling some mount feed for an outrageous price (I saw 10x mount feed for 100,000 earlier. To put that in perspective at lvl 24 I barely have more than 105,000 gold). Immediately after hitting level 20 the amount of experience it takes to gain a level is severely increased and I've run out of quests and had to grind my way to 24. It took me 2 days to get from 20-24 and that was with the free premium upgrade for 3 days that increases experience gain by 50% (I also had a few periods of rested experience).It's still in beta and things are subject to change, but it's definitely an asian mmorpg so if grinding at a mind numbing pace is your thing, go play it. I'm going to move onto something else.			"

												Don't be fooled by the release date, this game came out 2 years ago in Russia and is just now hitting the US. While it's a polished game and has a few quirks here and there it is just another MMO copycat. I don't even want to get started about the ridiculousness of their in game ""Premium"" and store functionalities. Royal Quest is completely set up to be a cash cow while having an extremely limited amount of uniqueness and originality. If you're a fan of Ragnarok Online and are looking for something similar you should definitely give the game a try though, they offer a 3 day trial of their ""Premium"" which give you bonuses including: +50% increase to EXP/gold drops, a teleport to Maiden spell (you attune to Maidens which you ressurect at when you die), and free teleport between Maidens which act as instant flight paths, but unless you're a Premium member you're paying about 1k gold per teleport at low levels, I'm not sure if it scales in higher level areas since I did not use my free time. The game is also quite the grind, it took me the entire time I have played to obtain a level of 22 which is only about a fourth of the cap which is 60. Surprisingly enough as well for a game that's already 2 years old it's seemingly polished look hides a nasty collection of bugs and spiking ping. While the game does look good, it just doesn't feel good and there's also many balancing issues that I feel need to be addressed. The unfortunate part of Royal Quest and games like it is that they just can't keep up with their secondary userbase, porting the game to the US is just another way to milk the cash cow. Take a good look at how active and busy the forums are in the US versus in Russia.http://us.royalquest.com/forum/http://sdn.royalquest.ru/forum/Who do you really think they're going to pay attention to? There may be 1000~ daily concurrent players but the game is FREE on Steam AND featured as well on the front page of the store! The game is busy now (if you can call 1k users busy) and will only begin to decline after it fades into the nether of the Steam store. I highly suggest trying this game if you feel like paying for features you deserve as a free player is something you like. I unfortunately do not like it in any way, shape, or form. If you don't believe me, try the game for yourself and go without the free 3 days of Premium for a day or two and then activate it and see the difference. If you are going to charge people for fundamental game functions you shouldn't call the game free.☆☆☆★★ Overall ☆☆☆★★ Gameplay ☆☆☆★★ Story ☆☆★★★ Graphics ☆☆☆☆★ Sounds ☆☆☆☆★ Oddity "

												This is a very simple and streamlined MMORPG. Sometimes, you need to dumb things down in order to have a better experience, and this game does just that. The art style is traditional and simple for the most part and doesn't really glare all that badly.Okay, is this game called Royal Quest because the Quests are a Royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to complete? I have to kill 100 Cockroaches in the Catacombs? 100?! It doesn't even help that there are people EVERYWHERE killing what I need and taking all of the loot. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY hope future editions can make monsters open for killing, like in Neverwinter. It almost never mattered if you were in a party or not; if you at least damaged it, you get the experience and got credit for a quest. The only exclusive drops from monsters should be the loot.Okay, now that I've actually played to level 20, WHAT KIND OF ♥♥♥♥ING MASSOCHISTIC MURDERHOUSE IS THIS?! THOSE ""INNOVATIVE"" PVPVE AREAS ARE ONE-SIDED DEATHTRAPS! GOOD LUCK GETTING GEAR AND ELEMIUM FROM THERE, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S, BECAUSE EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING WANTS YOU DEAD, AND YOU. WILL. DIE.ALSO, THE CAREER EVOLUTION QUESTS, SO FAR FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN, ARE SO ♥♥♥♥ING UNFAIR! LITTLE TIME TO KILL ALL OF THE ENEMIES UNTIL THE BOSS APPEARS AND WRECKS YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥ JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW ♥♥♥♥ING BRUTAL THIS GAME CAN BE! AND I'VE PLAYED THROUGH GAMES LIKE DARK SOULS, WHICH WERE JUST AS BRUTAL, BUT I COULD ACTUALLY FIND OTHER WAYS TO PROGRESS! NOT IN THE CASE OF THIS GAME! ♥♥♥♥ING RPG LIMITATIONS! NEVER PLAY THIS!

												People ask if this is P2W? No, i don't think so. It just takes longer to get to where people who paid to play got to. You can easily keep playing and grinding out for gold, which then results in buying gears, such as costume items if they are on sale in the market. Also you can buy the ingame currency for gold, which isn't cheap but is a nice option for free players.Is the game worth your time? Well there are many features to the game, and it's not bad for a free mmo when you think about it. Some may be put off by the grind, but when you do start up, you are given 3 days worth of free membership, which include 50% exp and drop rate bonuses to help along the way.Do i reccommend this game? Yes. No it's not perfect, but there are some many things to do on the game, plus it can run on pretty much any system.			"

												There is near to know infromation on the web or website for this game. The game is cute to look at, don't get me wrong and there are people enjoying it. But I hate a game that has no written info about it anywhere, there shouldn't be a reason to go to a russian forum site to look up loot drops for monsters or to wander aimlessly to figure out the most basic of needs in town.If the info was out there and easy to find, I'd say this is worth playing, But the closer I get to level 20, the less I want to play because there are no clues on what or where to go next. No quest logs, no hints on where to travel. Nothing. I feel like there should be a quest that leads from one area to the next once you exast all there is in one area. But it's missing. Also there seems to be no clear story in the game, they just let you loose in the world to quest, there's no tie to the world at all, or I'm missing it and it's completely unclear.DO I recommend this game? No.			"

Once you get into some dungeon crawling game has lots of depth to get into.  Lots of end-game with guild castle ownership, but a huge grind to get decent end game gear, but that maybe enjoyable to some hardcore mmo fans, lots of spells and crafting recipies to sink your teeth into :)...REALS...the ingame curency very expensive, for this mmo, at ~5cents US per real gets very expensive quick, decent gear or shop items 250 reals for example that $10 bucks for 1 mth premium stub for example or $5 bucks 100 reals+ for decent potions or crafting item that only lasts 30 min x 20...ouch too rich for this mmo...but freeplay is duable....dont need to spend much if you Budget, but this mmo sure tries to suck you in the spend $. be warry not to fall for the Paywall !

												Final Score 2.5/10Pros: Free to Play. Brought some successful elements from Ragnarok Online, which I enjoyed. Graphics Updated from RO, but.. Good flexibility for hot keys. Many premium items can be obtained in-game, but..Cons: The list of cons is huge.1. Graphics are updated, but .. mediocre by today's photorealistic qualities.2. It is definitely a free to play, but PAY TO WIN, model. In comparing the relative speed at which pay users achieve end game characters and equipment, I would estimate that the pay players are at least 5 times faster to achieve their goals over the average free player. This is evident by players who have started around the same time as me (free player), but have already been miles ahead of me in a matter of days, and I'm not one of the average free players, myself. Likewise, many who play much less, are already left behind in the dust.3. Grinding end game levels will definitely put you on your knees, and that's even with a premium membership. Yea, lots of level grinding. I've heard of a L55 premium sniper complain about it. And when you see L22~26 players grinding on L50+ mobs..and the max level is L60..you know, something is wrong here. When you die, above L20, you are exposed to a 10 minute status ailment called weakness, that halves your attack and defence. The only way to get rid of it immediately is to pay the npcs gold, gold that escalates every level higher than L20 you are. So each time you respawn, you've got to do something else to wait out the weakness time..otherwise cough up (or go premium, which reduces that time to 1 min).4. Earning in-game currency is really horrendous. It's subtle, but with a closer look, you'll see that the loot that you bring in from the monsters, especially true for the higher levels, are not only few, but they hardly add up to buy a single health potion of equivalent level. The rest of the loot can be vended, but only with a time-restricted stall that you need to purchase for more coin..So what does this mean? It simply means, you'll have to farm loot with minimum potions/foods most of the time unless you can successfully fetch a good price for your vended goods. Other times, you'll have to rely solely on the gold earned through quests, and there aren't that many well paying quests after you've completed your main ones. On top of all that, if you've got weakness, you've got to wait it out before you can even start farming for loot.5. PvP everywhere, if you're a friendly, social player like myself, you'll hate the PvP, but that's fine of course, if it's confined to themselves and we PvEer are left to our own entertainment. Sadly, that is not entirely true. The guild system has a lot of perks, like discounted npc prices, better drop rates, better running speed, more defence, more attack and a social community. However, past rank 10, and the guild is prone to other guilds declaring war on it. Some high level players have decided to band together in a certain guild (unnamed, but it could be anyone) in an effort to extort protection tax from smaller guilds so that they will not be PKed outside of towns..it's kind of like how the triads extorts everyday citizens. I guess this is a reflection of the situations real Russians face..but still..THIS IS A BIG DOWNER.6. A massive rip off from the once popular Ragnarok Online. Not that, that in itself is a bad thing, since they had done a lot of concepts right. And most games these days are copied from one another. Big Deal.I could say more, but I have to go.Stay away like the PLAGUE!!			"

												After a good amount of hours in this game i feel like i can safely give a good review on it.Pros-Nice graphics and style-A good sized skill tree with 4 classes and 2 sub-classes each-A large player market in the main city of the game-Overall pretty funThis game is very P2W you have to pay for more inventory space and even the cosmetics give stats like more hp or stamina.Cons-P2W-Alot of boring fetch quests which just involve talking to people or delivering something to someone-You can send money from a high level player that you made to another one of your accounts. So say you have a lvl 60 that has 200,000 gold you can send all of that gold to a lvl 1 character you made making your character OP in pvp areas and in general.-Alot of the first areas in the game are kinda boring Varlone (the main city) is kinda cool but the only good areas are past the areas surrounding Varlone.Some opinionated stuff-There is alot of grinding in this game and if you like that then cool becuase you will be doing it alot later on-I mentioned the market before and while its a cool feature players over price things CRAZY amounts buying most things from NPC's is just a better idea-In PVP areas ther are usually a group of people teamed making it impossible to do anything in there. Which i forgot to mention some quests put you in PVP areas.Overall im ok with this game there are clearly somethings wrong with this game but if they were fixed (which i assmue making the game non-P2W would be easy)  this game would be good.Also less fetch quests plz.

												What can I say about this game there are so many problems with the game I dont even know where to begin. The biggest problem with the game is that its pay 2 win. One of the other big issues with the game is gear progression is almost non existent you gear is always 7 levels lower than the monsters you are fighting. Another huge problem with the game is they have these group quests that have decent rewards to bad you cant group up with anyone to complete them. If your looking for a good online multiplayer game stay away from this there are plenty of better titles that are free and dont have half as many problems this games presents. The final verdict -4/10.			"

												First thing first, this game is a ""Grind-Fest"". After lvl 45, you get 2 quests and daily quests. That's it, the rest of the XP. You're going to have to grind for it. It's extremely bland. When you reach endgame, all you can do is PvP Battlegrounds, and farm world bosses, which really aren't even that fun. It's not pay to win, because you can literally farm material and sell it. And real money so far only gives you cosmetic items. Best-in-Slot items are crafted or farmed by World Bosses.AGAIN, this game is extremely grind heavy. Quests are almost worthless in terms of XP Gain. It also lacks end-game material, like I said previously. After reaching the lvl cap, all you do is Pvp Battlegrounds or farm world bosses.			"

												Graphics are acceptable, but nothing great. Camera and movement are a pain.That aside - this game isn't even trying to not be pay2win. Membership grants you massive advantages (including a large exp bonus), bag sizes are so small you have to return to towns regularly to empty them (unless you pay for more space), cash shop grants you anything you need to do better than the non-paying player with very few of the items that are just cosmetic.If you enjoy being able to pay your way through a game or grind forever alone - this is the game for you.

												Fun casual MMORPG very similar to Ragnarok Online. Leveling becomes a challenge from 25+ onward truthfully. You wont level fast or reach far unless you are willing to grind out some levels because quests won't bring you to the next level. At these time it's best to get into the community and see for yourself if its worth continuing to play with others.Still early days in the game as there's surely more content to be added in the future.

												     After playing an hour and a half of the game, I've noticed several things I'd like to list and why they somewhat ruin the fun aspect of this game. I encountered a pay to win player soon off and noticed that despite the 3 lower levels they were than I and the same class of character, they did ""SIGNIFICANTLY"" more damage than I did. I mean where I was doing 20s and 30s as a full dexterity & strength fighter, they were doing low hundreds. That's the first thing I noticed that seemed off. Secondly, this game almost forces you to buy premium to ignore the ill effects of weakness once you reach level 10, the revival effect or pay gold to remove the effect.      The next problem I have with this game is the fact you basically walk to & fro from quest giver to location and back to quest giver, one....at....a....time. I figured that it would stop after a few levels, but a solid hour of playtime and it was still doing it. It gets old, FAST. Next problem is the somewhat limited arrangement of classes available, and evenmoreso with the choice of subclass. There is no imagination or love here and while this game boasts freedom; it yields very little to the aspect. In short, don't support this game if you're not into another very generic MMO rpg that better belongs with it's browser brothern. Thumbs down and I'm uninstalling.			"

												This game, albeit one that I like, has so many corners cut it's more of a damn circle than an actual circle. The quests are spaced way too far apart, the market is broken nothing has a predetermined price, so say a mount (actual in-game reference here) that costs 300 Gold is being sold on the market, it's being sold for more than quadruple that. This game is seriously P2W, the premium is the only proper way to level at the higher levels, elsewise you're stuck griding for hours, maybe even days at a time. And it would seem to be the only way to get from Lv.59 to Lv.60, which is the game cap so far, you need to have 90M Exp. Assuming you stay around that long. Theres about a dozen different things wrong with this game, but I haven't played 100+ hours of it because of everything wrong with it. I stayed because I found a group of people who share my same interests in it, so far that's about the only other good thing I've found about this game. The other being that the graphics and gameplay are somewhat enjoyable. All in all I would rate it about a 6.8/10. So long as you don't mind spending half your time in the grinder.			"

												First Impressions of the game: The color choice and aesthetic is great, many colors, nice feel to the game, though often very bland in areas that are heavily paved (like the main city). The aesthetic shines the most in field areas with a bit of blending between one zone and the next. The second thing I notice, is that the Camera is locked in this psuedo-isometric position, which allows full rotation, but limiting tilt. you can look almost straight down at your character if you wish, or at a slight angle, but you are incapable of looking parallel to the ground, let alone being able to see any trace of sky. (Probably to lessen the system-demand for rendering, and the need for a skybox)The third thing I notice is the obvious Premium service. The game practically screams P2W. I honestly wouldn't mind if there were some benefits to paying players, but what ruined it was the constant self-advertising. The fact that you'd have a Premium / VIP tab right above the hotbar that remains there forever, alongside tabs that would remind you of unspent skill points or stat points. It's also a nuisance to see that little blue 'Premium' tab at the center of your screen as you try to pay attention to skill cool downs and potion counts.The game spends quite a bit of effort reminding you that you 'could' be enjoying the game better if you paid for it.Next on the list is the combat, which is a bit dull. It's your standard auto-attack, use skills when ready, repeat on the next bad guy. What's interesting though, are the passive skills (Talents) that somewhat modify the properties of previously obtained Active skills, though quite a bit of advancement is required.After your first class advancement, you gain this Rift-style 3-option talent tree, in which you can specialize, or become a jack of all trades. Specializing yields you a powerful (or less-than-powerful) active skill at the end of one of the three trees for your class. But frankly, the three-tree system is nothing close to the way Rift handles it, and feels like a dumbed down 'my-first-RPG' experience.The game itself lacks depth from the beginning, and the overall pacing is slow, the quests are un-engaging, and are your standard 'go kill me some wolves for their pelts' ordeal. Occasionally you will get some quests that mess with the props in the environment, or sends you on an errand run across NPCs, concluding in an encounter with an instance (or psuedo-instance)Here's another drawback that really bothered me. The fact that what I had assumed what were instanced dungeons, are actually open to other players. Caves, Underground Libraries, Sewers, were all loaded with players with the same quest, therefor your target monster or drop would also be hunted by several other people, making your 25 Slime kill quest last longer than it really should. My only experience with a true instance were the randomly spawning 'entrances' that whisked you away to an extremely linear and un-engaging mini-dungeon, or one of the Boss Dungeons that I fought with a party of four.Though with that drawback, there is also a certain benefit: The Community. The early-game community is pretty large, everywhere you go you are guarenteed a sighting of another player probably doing the same thing as you, hunting Monsters. Not just one, but many players, all hunting monsters, all having a bit of fun. That's nice. Having lots of players around is nice, which makes this experience slightly more enjoyable. Sort of like you and your friends going to a really really bad theme park, somehow with your friends you were able to squeeze some fun out of it, despite the actual place itself being an uninteresting experience.There are also a few somewhat innovative features: Like castles that could be fought over for guild dominance (though I haven't experienced this feature myself) as well as competitive 'deathmatch dungeons' were you can grind for loot and exclusives materials only if you can survive the onslought of players doing the same thing. (essentially an open PVP dungeon that only allows you to keep your loot if you can escape). Even a raid boss would wonder into town to face the innumerable number of players turning in their quests, leading to a 15-20 player assault on the big ol' boss guy.---In the end the game is colorful and full of life, but also in turn, is uninteresting, even annoying, when alone amongst crowds of other people, all competing for a limited supply of Monsters. The game has it's moments when partied up, and certain aspects are enjoyable, with a few speckles of innovation. But overall, the game feels like an RPG experience lacking in depth, but not lacking in it's P2W ego. It's a game worth trying out to see if it fits you, but also is a game worth completely ignoring if you're a hardcore MMO'er looking for deep an immersive RPG experience.Not Recommended, but try it anyway.

												tl;dr: Game screams ""gimme money.""Semi tl:dr:Pros:-Detailed and bright graphics.-Great cheerful soundtrack.-Interesting skill/talent tree.-Game rewards you for grinding.-Interesting random ""dungeon"" system (gravestones spawn at random locations, and if you click on them, you are transported into a dungeon).Cons:-SPEND $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ ON ME.-Generic classes.-Extremely grindy if you do not plan on spending money.-P2W(?)-Gravestone dungeons maps are level reliant (Map structures are always the same unless its a different level).Now if you want to read the full review, here goes.So when I just started this game I was actually enjoying the game by quite a bit, you had monsters to kill, nice bright graphics, cheerful music, everything you would expect from this game. However, after playing for about 2 hours, I found out about the inventory space, yes, the dreadful inventory space. You get less than 20 slots per tab, which if you have some RPG gaming experience, would know is not even close to being enough for the later on grinding sprees that you'd need to go on, and if you need more space, guess how? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Speaking of money, the game is screaming ""give me money"" as you play, you need $ to buy in game currency to buy cosmetics, which DOES give you stats, and the stats are not exactly tiny (Example: 5% max hp for footprints). Now some of you might argue that you can buy the ingame cash, ""Reales"" with ingame currency, but when I last checked, 1 REALE is about 14k gold, which is considered A LOT in this game, so if you are planning on buying reales, you might need to spend quite a bit of time. Speaking of grinding, the game also has a ""member"" system (remember Runescape?), yes, the member advantages are not even close to being as much as Runescape, however, they get 50% increased exp/loot drop rate. All in all, if you are not planning on using money on this game, be prepared to spend money.			"

												Overall, this game is a mixed bag, there are some good points to the game, but also the game really seems lacking in some areas as well.On the plus side, it will run on a fairly old computer and look pretty decent.  The controls are intuitive, and the opportunity to find random little dungeons scattered around the map is a nice touch.But this game is dull as dishwater.  There seems to be nothing that makes this game stand out above its peers in any meaningful way.  The quests seem to all be go to X and kill Y Zs.I cannot comment on the P2W,F2P aspect as I didn't get that far, the game just wasn't interesting in any real way to grab me.All in all, I give it a hearty 'meh'.

												Before I get to a joke about this game i'm going to tell you what I think of this game.Terrible I was looking for a fun game to play about the middle ages and so I decided to play Royal Quest.Very disappointed in this game. I didn't understand the controls at ALL, even after an hour of playing.Well this is the joke.My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. "

Join Guild Wars, conquer Castles, and battle other players in unique PvPvE locations, or explore the vast world of Aura and enjoy the story on your own.Felt generic as hell in terms of quests.

												Only played for a while. Encountered a quest that required you to gather 22 items, which seemed rather rare too. Yeah, nope.The combat was insanely dull, though that should be expected from low levels. Looking at the skills though, it probably doesn't get much better later either.The f2p aspect is one of the worst I've seen. Paid premium time gives insane bonuses (+50% xp, portal, think more drops too..). The bags are *really* small, and apparently the only way to get more bag space is to spend real money. There is way, way too much non-cosmetic stuff to spend real money on.			"

												After playing for, lets see... about 9 hours, I think I have a understanding of what this game has to offer. It kinda makes me sad... too see all that potential wasted, because of mind-boggling decicions in game functions (I will list some of these below) and despicably predatory business model via micro transaction. However, with all that being said I still can understand anyone that gives this game a ""thumb up"" because it very much ""feels"" like a quality mmorpg. Here are pros and cons the way I see it.Pros:- Graphicly the game looks pretty nice. Not eye-poppingly good, yes but in its own cartoony way very pleasing.- Skill/Passive tree is reasonably interesting and the skills look good.- You get 4 stats per level that you can allocate to strenght, stamina, intelligence, dexterity or luck, which adds to diversity. Im a fan of that.- UI is very clear and good looking...Cons:- ... but the fact that you can affect the UI very little is a huge turn off- No W,A,S,D movement in a game that claims to be a high speed action mmorpg??- You can not target enemies in any other way than by clicking them individually... no TAB targeting.- I mentioned the micro-transactions, right? Prepare your wallet if you want to 1) travel quickly between areas, and receive more xp gold 2) have more inventory space... the starting inventory space is no where near enough and the only way to get more space is to buy it with real cash! 3) Maximise your effectiveness in battle since some of those cash shop cloths give you stats.. (I hate when games do this) 4) just buy any potions or anything from cash shop! Why bother spending in game gold on potions since you can just buy them from Cash shop? lol- The game offers nothing new in terms of innovations...- I didnt find any way to que up for instances or dungeons or anything..? Yet the game frequently gives you quests that require 4 players in the team/higher level... talk about frustrating.Now you may be thinking why did I say that I can understand those that give this game a thumb up?... yes, the game is very generic and offers very little new for a mmorpg vet, and yes, it has a lot of micro-transaction barriers but if you dont mind micro-transaction and you prefer click movement/targeting you may like this game! Then again there are better mmorpgs out there.Im going to have to go with ""not recommended"". Good try for your first (?) mmorpg Katauri Interactive... try harder next time (and please little less micro-transactions? please)			"

												Regardless of what negatives you can claim about this game being pay to winlack of inventory, lack of buyable mounts outside of cash shop, forced purchase of teleport to gain access to town with out suiciding, etc.This game is just not fun. I've played MANY mmo's with a cash shop that pushes itself upon you often yet those games, cashshop aside, were still fun regardless. Mabinogi is a prime example of this, great gameplay, deep plot with now 15 or so different main stories to experience back to back all adding new mechanics and types of combat styles. Fairly big world to explore, interesting NPC's with friendship system allowing you to gain perks by gifting npc's and talking to them. Every Pet/Mount doubles as a playable character in of itself. There's just so much GOOD with Mabinogi that the cash shop is just a small bother by comparison of the fun you can have with the game with out the cash shop.This game on the other hand, is just flat out NOT FUN. I was expecting a Diablo-esk style mmo with the topdown view faster point/click style combat and such but no, a single click auto attacks, the spells and skills take FOREVER to charge and cast, quests are boring and generic fetch quests like most mmo's seem to be doing these days, tho top it off the visuals aren't even good enough to validate it's existance. I'm not saying visuals are EVERYTHING but if the game itself isn't fun at least make it look decent enough that you'd want to stare at it for a while. But no it doesn't even do that properly.			"

												I honestly haven't been playing very long, but in all honesty I cannot recommend this game to anyone. There's just too many things that require microtransactions to interact with. I honestly don't find it a good thing to get someone excited for finding a Gold or Silver chest out in the open in the world and ask for gems to open them. I also didn't agree with the fact that whenever you died it gave an option to rez in the place you were at, which would cost 5 gems and once again an UNNCECESSARY MICROTRANSACTION because of the fact that if you didn't do that option when you're leveling a low level character. You'd be sent all the way back to where your character first started. I honestly have no idea why games have to take this path when it comes to Free to Play, everyone is okay with little things like having cosmetic items for gems or even pets and mounts for cosmetic, but for the love of god dont go making everything cost gems! I'd rather pay $5-15 a month to play a game like this and have everything else FREE or atleast obtainable in-game.Microtransactions aside, the game is good and can be a whole bunch of fun, the graphics are good and the combat system reminds me of Tales of Pirates / Ragnarok.

												While I can understand the concerns of others that this is simply a ""Play to win"" game, I quite disagree with the concept that this ruins the game experience.After playing the game for almost a week, I believe see that paying certainly does have its benefits, boosting your way to the higher levels and buying more powerful weapons. But by simply playing the game as well, you can have fun whilst levelling up with friends and tackling monsters together. This is rewarding in itself and is much more entertaining than paying to reach higher levels. Finding weapons on the ground and trading them with friends, rather than buying them for extortionate prices at a user-based shop, is a truly wonderful experience that teaches the player to be generous and tactful with their items, rather than spending real-world money and buying the highest level sword you can.Obviously this game can be played a lot easier if you splash the cash and buy your way to level 50, but where’s the fun in that? Get on, get stuck in and battle your way to it. Then you can truly say you’ve accomplished something, without paying half your life’s savings. While the fanbase can be small and in-game prices are a little bias in their amounts, we must remember that this is simply an open-beta and things will be changed and fixed in the future. For that reason, I recommend this game to any budding young MMO player, or an experienced try-hard just looking for something fun to divulge your time to.			"

												Royal Quest is just a grindfest with terrible controls disguised by cute and bright-colored asthetics.  It's also pay-to-win.  You can't do much without spending money in the game's store.  You're limited greatly by the non-premium version of the game, too, not allowing as quick of movement between maps and getting less loot.  The bag slots are in absurdly short supply, so you'll have to sell almost everything you loot from enemies just to make room for more loot.The negative points aside, the character customization is somewhat detailed with face and hair styles, visible equipment, and suit items.  You can also choose either gender for any of the four character classes, rogue, archer, warrior, and mage.  I created one of each class and mostly stuck with the cute girls but gave the male mage a go and was surprised by how good the outfits and poses are.  Everything just looks good.The downside to the aesthetics is the camera doesn't tilt low enough for them to matter most of the time.  You are always looking at everything from a bird's eye view.  If you were thinking it would be like Torchlight, you're in for some disappointment.  The movement controls also suck.  Characters are slow and can't attack from a stationary position, making the long range attacks somewhat useless unless you find some kind of obstacle to lock the AI behind.  That brings me back to my RuneScape days and reminds me how awesome that game was, compared to this anyway!			"

												This is my first negative review, ever.The game itself is actually kind of fun. It's the apparently intentionally confusing pricing in the cash shop and the constant prompts to spend money that warrant the down vote.Most F2P games I have tried are at least roughly based on the dollar. $10 gets you 1,000 coins, or 900, or 1,100 or something close. Here it is 260 coins for $10. This makes it very confusing to figure out how much anything actually costs.For example, crystal keys to open chests are 889 coins for a stack of 10 (used to open random high level chests). So how much is that actually? The answer is $33, or $3.30 to open one chest. You must multiply the item cost by 3.8 to get the dollar price (if buying in $10 increments.)Another example is the item you need to gurantee a combine doesn't fail. They are also over $3. How many ultra-rare reagents you going to see poof before you start buying those?Inventory slots are 36 cents...per slot and per category (armor and weapons go in one bag, potions in another, etc.) You start with 19 slots in each category, the 20th slot is a ""buy"" button. This makes it $7.20 to buy 20 bag slots that only hold potions (or only armor, etc.). This wouldn't be too bad if the slots could be used for anything.When you die you have 2 choices. Run back from town, or pay to res right there. Which would be tolerable, if every town allowed you to bind. I could find no way to bind in the 2nd town at level 11, died and had to run back from the first town. I died because of a level 59 skeleton that came out of nowhere and started one-shotting people.You can buy a 40% speed mount for (I think) only about $1.60, but that was the only decent deal I could find. I only played to level 12, but from what I'm reading the grind is very bad at 40+ unless you go premium, which is another $12 a month. And going premium does almost nothing to change the intrusiviness of the cash shop.I'm not at all against spending money in these games. I do it all the time. But this whole thing would be more reasonable, and not as confusing if you got 1,000 coins for $10. Maybe their pricing is based on the Rubel or something and will be adjusted before release. As it is now, it's very expensive and intrusive.Bottom line, the game is fun if you have deep pockets. "

												Reminds me of Ragnarok Online 2 with a mix of Diablo. The starting gameplay felt extremely easy and I wasn't really required to use abilities. Didn't really seem to be for me, but I'm going to recommend it for people who are looking for something to blow some time away. C1 is a fantastic developer and I love the King's Bounty series (minus the old Sega ones).			"

												This is a failed game. Not worth it at all. The developers obviously don't understand Pay-To-Win. The Russian company behind King's Bounty isn't a good developer. There are people trying to defend this game with ""You can use gold to get premium items"". Sure, if you grind for 10,000 hours, perhaps. This game is just bad design.PROS1. Global Map MovementYou can use the Map feature to left click on the point you want to run to and your character will run to the location accordingly. No need to keep left clicking all the way.CONS1. Pay to Win3500 Reales for $100. Here's a list of core mechanics you can buy with cash1. Bag slots x 1 for 9R. (Inventory space, another core mechanic)2. Arena Tickets x 10 for 29R3. Maiden's Ticket x 20 for 29R (They are selling 20 town portal scrolls for $0.80, a bloody core mechanic)4. Ambrosia x 20 for 9R (Heals 100% Health, Energy and Mana over 5 seconds, Elixirs can be bought with cash too)5. Card of Chaos for 399R (Weapon Insert : Attacks with Chaos Element Weapons deal increased damage to all other elements. This is an item advantage)6. Royal Blessing x 30 for 319R (All experience gain increased by 50%, Item find increased by 50%, Town Portal Skill and 4 other buffs)If this isn't Pay-to-win, I think the developers are delusional.2. BoringBoring as hell. The most generic backtrack quests that I have seen. Fetch quest galour.3. Empty3 servers. Elgore, Iris, Kabuk. 2 are offline and 1 has a low population.4. Premium AccountConstant advertising for you to sign up for a premium account.			"

												Good game.  If you like in depth skill choices that have a big effect on play, this is a great game to give a try.  It does seem like it may be a pay to win title, but I'm not sure at this point.  What I've seen I've liked, especially when a lot of mmorpgs are taking meaningful character progression choices away from the player.Edit - after putting more time into the game, it is very, very content lite.  The game turns into a grindfest, where your ""quests"" are just turning in 50, 70, or 100 pieces of different kinds of monster loot.  To level you grind.  You'd figure a game that has been out in Russia for a couple years would have some content, but this doesn't.  And its grind leveling completly forces you to purches additional storage.  Lastly, you are forced to purchase a premium account as you will die a lot, and there is a 10 minute death penalty (half defence and offense) for non-premeium players.			"

												~Creating a CharacterThe character customization was really dull, I mean that gave you about 7 faces,hairs, hair colors, and skins. But, really they didn't look that much different.~GameplayI didn't expect it to be point and click so i was pressed WSAD for about 5mins with popups going all over the place. I got to a dungeon I think it was. I died at the boss for some reason. Maybe I wasn't suppose to go there, but then again i never read the quest dialogue because it was far too long. ~ConclusionIf you're looking for a game thats fairly new and something to grow on then this is for you. If you want a game thats action based and intruiging in the slightest then no.			"

												When the brazilians that HUE this game up aren't farming bananas, they're farming lowbie kills by training every monster in the zone through town and vanishing.Twinks prevent all but the most patient from accessing 20+ content. Levelling is painfully slow, mostly because of the twinks.In 20 hours of play, I feel I've gotten to know this community very well. It is brazilians,♥♥♥♥♥holes, and brazilian♥♥♥♥♥holes. If the League of Legends community wasn't irritating enough for you, then good news. You've found your new home in Royal Quest.Edit: As a side note, the first couple of times my group of friends got their♥♥♥♥♥♥pumped by one of the twinks in Zerro were heart pounding and fun. Once they figured out that we were leaving the area and coming back in in order to level while they pumped us, they started camping exits instead. That is when we all quit.			"

												pros: I found the game very entertaining and fun for all ages, I have a friend who claims to be 60. The game does take a little time to get were you are going to and I like that because if it were too easy then it would be no fun. There are places were u can fight eachother or even invite eachother to a friendly duel. If u go into a place were its pvp take someone you trust with you or you will be easy prey for the stronger packs and players.Cons: The game is time consuming and addicting for me. I find it hard to level up and get were u are going too but that can present the challenge some players need. So in conclusion I rate this gaame a 7.5 out of 10 stars for exellence but it can use some work.			"

												I'll try to keep it short and sweet. I played till level 52. Didn't use premium/blessing until level 30.Pros:-Sweet time waster with lots of fun for early levels.-Making decent gear for class C items (1-30 ish) is easy and fun. Most materials are obtainable from daily quests with easy to farm items.- Exploring the maps with mobs that can kill you in 1 to 2 hits is fun. Basically it is fun to be noob in this game.Cons:- P2W. Gold cost for gear improvements and seals increases at almost triple or more  from each class. Just look at the NPC price of Emeralds compared to Sapphires compared to Morions. Without mentioning the required cashshop items for item improvements as the success rate for higher class item is much lower if using non-cash cubesPremium/Blessing is a must to play at later levels even when 60. Gold/time costs of weakness debuff after death is very high, and players can die a lot especially when playing in areas with range mobs or during guild wars. Maiden tele costs adds up without Blessing. (7K here, 8K there and all your gold farmed is gone) Another thing is the tax on non-preimun account for players setting up markets is ridiculous (15% vs 5%). Either spend time spamming to sell instead of enjoying the game or suck it up losing 10% extra.TL/DR:Reccomended for those who like grinding games with an objective to reach level cap and for causal/serious pvping in lower levels.  Not reccomended for those who wants level cap PvP because the costs is too prohibitive for most. (too grindy or too P2W)			"

												Royal Quest is nothing new or origonal. Basically play this if you want to relive experinces youve had with other games 5 or so years ago and are quite happy about wasting your time. Its 100% grind everything in the game has pretty much been ripped of RO or similar. The combat system is clunky and auto attack based so very little skill other than working standard rotations - which have been done to the grave by many games but hey like I said Royal Quest brings nothing new to the table.I guess the reason you are even looking into playing this is because you have played other games in the series or see that this game is free. Neither of those are good enough reasons to play a game that has been made with a lazy attitude.2/10 its really that dull.			"

												Should you try it? Yes, it's F2P the modern demo version and player bait. (Free to Download, with restrictions/limitations like most F2P games) I won't review any gameplay specific apects as they are in my opinion considered things you should experience yourself especially when it's F2P because even if every aspects shines like a potential HL3 and you do not like the gameplay, well then f*ck this game amirite?Is it P2W? After browsing the cash shop and taking a closer look the premium acc (15€/Month I think) I suspect that you gain too many advantages by simply paying a sh!t ton of money in comparision to your non paying peasant players. There are just too many shop exclusive items that you simply cannot ignore in higher levels be it for respec, upgrading your gear or boosts.On the bright side you can trade with other players your worthless stuff for their cash currency. Milk all those rich players!So reaching a point where the pay walls do not faze you anymore will take a huge amount of time or depending on your business / economical / farm knowledge a little less than a huge amount of playtime IF you truly do not wish to spend a single dime on a F2P game. I haven't spent much time on this game as you may have noticed so if anything noteworthy regarding F2P / P2W / pay walls etc. please leave a comment / follow / subscribe / hang yourself.TL;DR : Try it -> No likey gameplay -> deinstall ;             likey gameplay -> browse cash shop -> feel digusted and dirty -> milk paying players -> get rich -> ... -> profit!

												With the slick trailer and pricey buy-in to the closed beta you might have thought that this was a brand new high-end MMO. Wrong.Turns out it's a port of a Russian game that's about two years old. You get one race (anime influenced human), four classes (I bet you can guess what they are) with, at level 20, a choice of two specializations each (again no surprises). If you've played browser-based MMOs before then this will all be familiar.As I didn't make the mistake of paying to play I don't really have any significant complaint. As an uninspired F2P no-brainer this will pass some time.			"

												A very poor quest system is the first thing that bothers me the most.If you want to level up then there is only one thing for you to do, like in most of mmorpgs. And thatis questing. So you are like ok let's do this quests and be done with it. Sadly this game is all about runningto a certain point kill few mobs then run all over the whole map over and over again. You will spend mostof the time running all over map in this game, then killing mobs and farm. The running is really slow and timeconsuming. I don't recomdmend this game to anyone who doesnt wana pay lots of cash just so you can play like you should.Unless they give away some mounts or change quests, makes the a bit more interesting and include less maraton running ( which i highly doubt ) then they will those players that they have sadly.

												My experience in this game has been great!! The in-game community is pretty solid and helpful. Guilds are easy to build and understand. The game, however, is a giant grind fest. Leveling to 30 is quick and easy and can be done in 24 hours. Then the experience requirements get pretty insane. The Reale shop is unreasonable compared to what players sell their crap for. They sell stuff for way lower than what it is worth in reales, based on what the reales themselves are allowed to sell for on the market. For a free to play game, it has few trolls. most of the community, whatever language you speak, can actually hold a conversation.I'll continue to level because i want a castle dammit!!!			"

												First off, the game is -NOT- Pay to Win. You can buy premium currency with gold. Second off, most of the people who are bad mouthing the game either have very low hours played (under 5) or got their ♥♥♥♥ rocked in PVP (Which is entirely optional)It feels alot like Ragnarok Online but with better graphics and animations. There are also far more skills than Ragnarok.The leveling is slow, but the game isn't all about leveling. Anyway, here's a Pro/Con list.PROSDecent, fluid graphicsFun gameplayYou can buy any premium item with gold.There's PVP (That is instanced so you don't have to PVP)Lots of class diversityDaily quests for faster levelingCard system to upgrade gear (Apply poison/fire/etc or extra damage to weapons/gear)You can buy premium items with in game currency from other playersYou can buy premium account time from other players with in game currencyYou can set up shopsCONSSometimes the grammar is a little bit off, nothing major.The upgrade system is based on a % chance so after +5 it fails alotThe debuff from dieng lasts a little whileOverall, it's a great game that I'm having lots of fun with.

												Fairly enjoyable MMO, not pay2win at all, only thing close to pay2win is buying cards from cash shop. Levelling isn't anything special, but the spells you get and talents are fun and new. At higher levels soloing with melees is pretty AIDS though. If you aren't in a ""prestigious"" or big guild (ex. Immortals/Revolt) you will NEVER get to kill a boss, even if you camp it for a week straight, pretty frustrating. At around level 30-39~ any good farming areas are camped by level 60's grinding for drops, so good luck. Almost no reason to party up before level 44 due to completely♥♥♥♥♥♥exp sharing. But aside from those downsides I've had considerable fun playing, even if the community is 90% biased level 60's :)			"

												100% pay to win. 90% of player base are either asshats and scumbags who had been playing and paying for almost 2 years now. Only one guild farms bosses and elites, they even keep track of the spawn time. A GM is also a guild leader and they have a history of conjuring end-game and rare items. Lack of end game content, PvE is very difficult for undergeared players. Will recommend it if you have tons of money to waste.			"

												I was going to complain about it being pay to win but I've found that i don't need to.  The game is completely unplayable.  High level players sit in areas you absolutely have to go to in order to do the storyline and farm the low power players as they try and play the game.  You cannot progress in the game at all.  It is impossible.  So you can either give up or sit in the lowest areas and try to build your hero to a high level off small monsters in desperate hope of getting past high power players.

												I'm always up for trying and playing new F2P MMOs. I have an addiction do them. But, you noticed I wrote the word 'new' up there. There isn't a damn thing in this game that feels new to me. I went through and, no joke, each class's quest line wasn't just similar, they were the same with small variables changed. EVERY class starts out with the 'pick the pretty flowers' quest, and it gets worse from there. I had to stop when I made my Archer (the last of the four) and I realized I was about to rehash the next 20 quests from the previous 20 from every, single, other, class.Quests aside, this also feels like the two dozen other Asian-style MMOs I've seen a played. Ragnorok 2 comes to mind in the visuals, classes, and class upgrades. There really isn't anything to the storyline thus far that grabs me either.Honestly, if you're looking for a decent, NEW, MMO to play, pass on this one.			"

												I happen to like this game but I do have some slight issues... um the controls for one... they should of made the controls a tad easier... this game kind of reminds me of Final Fantasy which is the style game I enjoy... I am still a low level character so it'll take me some time to get used to the game play but for the most part I happen to enjoy it. I'm not one of those technical people that would know the difference between a bad or good game but for me I think this game can be okay... I'm still learning though... I'm not sure if you can play along-side a friend and battle with them or not but I will find out soon enough			"

												Please fix the camera.  The terrain needs to be see through when it's in front of the camera.  When in combat a hill can block your view 100% and totall f you over.  This needs fixed.  Makes combat VERY painful.  Also there are no where near enough quests in the game.  I've ran out of quests in all the zones that are equal to my level and can not progress any further with out mindless grinding random mobs.  Each zone needs 20+ more quests.  Some of the zones have ZERO quests.  I dont' understand why this is.  At this point I will not tell any one about this game.  WAY to may issues.  Could be great...in it's current status it's not.

												Yeah, I saw it, so I downloaded it to take a look. I'll tell you something. With only having about a few minutes on the game it's quite fun, enjoyable and entertaining in my opinion. It's not that bad a game. The only thing I wish they allow you to do is choose whether or not to use ""Point-and-Click"" or using WASD keys when you first make a character on the game. I only say this because I prefer using the WASD keys other than point and click. I'm also sure there are some out there that want the point and click, or use the WASD. Other than that, I think it's a fun game to play.			"

Posted: September 3, 2014
												Overall I like the game. One important thing for me with MMO's is responsiveness of controls and fluid animation. This does both very will. I have played other MMO's (such as AION) that, while had beautiful scenery, felt like it had choppy responsiveness.You really do not need to spend a dime of real money to compete in this game. If you know how to use your character class with some skill, you can win a lot of PvP matches (duals, PvP dungeons, etc). I play the assassin class, and when I get challenged to a dual, can beat characters who clearly have superior equipment but only know how to ""left click"".My only complaint, which I hope they fix, is how useless it is to upgrade the Dexterity attribute. It is suppose to improve attack speed, but compared to just improving your strength attribute for more damage, it is totally useless. They need to make the dexterity either also upgrage your dodge, or just make the attack speed increase MUCH higher (something like +1% for each point, and +5% for every 10 points).I think this game is still in Beta so hopefully they fix this.

												Don't bother playing this unless you really like grinding, pointless fetch-quests, and uncooperative cameras. My initial tutorial consisted of a ""here's how to walk"" message, a ""click this piece of scenery"" quest, and a ""kill three inoffensive mobs"" task. After that, I was kicked out the door into what was presumably my actual training.This training was nothing more than brainless fetch-quests, one... at... a... time. All from the same person, in the same location, sequentially. Every time, it was either clicking on stationary objects (like plants or fans), or attacking non-aggressive critters (like animated tree-bark or anthropomorphic drops of water, seriously). With each task's completion, I had to march back to the person who gave me the job, get handed some trivial reward (like a piece of gear that was functionally identical to what I had at the start), and then I could take on the next job.Which was, without fail, clicking on bits of scenery or attacking mobs that otherwise ignored me.An hour into this, and the game was just giving me more of the same, without showing me what it was capable of. All those things shown in the trailers and screenshots? No idea how long you'd have to grind to get to that point. Game-play at the one hour mark looked identical to game-play at the ten-minute mark.Stay clear of this one.			"

												Started as a Mage, so I can't really judge in terms of solo difficulty, but every quest up to level 8 at least has you go out, possibly to the opposite side of the current map, kill/loot something, and return back to the starting town again, only to repeat for the next quest. The quest induced yo-yoing is bad enough, but the caves/buildings you are sent to for quests are also shared with the other players, rather than instanced just for you or your party, which can lead to having to struggle against other players in a PvE environment for kills and loot. Admittedly this struggle is pretty standard in MMOs and probably drops off as you level up and the population density declines.But the breaking point for me was a primary quest to kill a Magical Dragonkin. This quest has you go out into an area teeming with aggressive monsters, and find the one and only magical dragonkin, capable of spawning anywhere in that quarter of the map, and kill it. If someone else kills it before you get there, you have to wait for it to spawn and hope you or your party can get to it first.That said, I did find the combat itself enjoyable, with the advertised weaknesses present immediately at the start, and all stats being relevant and plainly explained in tooltips. If you're okay with the questing issues and small inventories, you just might enjoy this. But for the average gamer, this feels like a no go.			"

												Fail of understanding is to think, something is free, only death is free, and it will still cost your life. This game just sucks. At this instance, where you collect those blue currency, lvl 10 ? - 20 ... there camp level 19 overgeared idiots who farm everyone that enters and let nobody leave the instance again, so you cannot exit and get gold, xp, and loot. And no matter what u do, as a melee you can't attack a caster, casters can permanently cast a barrier, that pushes you back, and deals damage to you, you can't hit him even once. Another Problem in this ugly game : spawned beasts attack you instantly, if you are in a calculated battle with some mobs, you get visitors from behind that just kill you and then you can respawn back in town or PAY AND RESPAWN IN PLACE. I have never seen such a bad MMO. THUMBS DOWN !			"

												i can't recommend this agme. it filled me with a aweful taste, a miasma that if i even so much as screw up one thing, i can't recover from it. the player community is akin to World of Warcraft on how it treats you: insignificant even to fellow party members. the ""pay to win"" idealism applies here: you get boosts if you pay, and those boosts let you effect negatively the other players.avoid at all costs if you wish a fun time. it sucks the fun and gives you ""GGUSUCK"".

												I'm going to check recommend because I feel like there is more good than bad about it, and people are being too mean. It's a nice, new game with a classic feel, and at least for me bug free.Pros:Classic feel, RO meets vanilla WOWLots of varried enemiesVarried, seemingly balanced classes (Sorc Warlock and Sniper OP)Bug free (for me)NewFreeVery unquie pvp-zone farming areasGuildsCons:Even with 'premium' exp rate is very slowNot much to do unless you set your own goalsQuesting (boring, ends soon, long gaps, everything)Although I do not plan to play anymore after making a couple characters get to around 25. I had fun, the EXP is too slow for me and I just don't have it in me to make my own goals in a game I have not grown to love (as I do every time I go back to Ragnarok Online.)I'd say try it.			"

												This game really wants you to do pvp. Like some quests are in pvp area and that's not always clear. So one second you are helping to kill something and the next just getting killed by the same person. Plus the game after a while just seems to lack quests. Really the game needs more stuff all around to keep people interested so that they would pay for things instead of how it is.			"

												The gameplay is simplistic and entertaining enough.  The game itself is completely free and I haven't come across any need to pay for access to content.  Bag space, item development, and many other areas require in game currency you purchase with cash.  The game would be better with a different microtransaction system for vanity based items.			"

Posted: September 10, 2015
												Three months ago I wrote a negative review for royal quest after rewriting my original positive review. I will now go on to expand that negative review.  My last review ended with me summarizing that Royal Quest is pay to win. Which it is, however, it gets worse. The admins, and mods in charge of the forums online are corrupt and protect people at the top of the food chain in game that have cheated their way there. To help people understand the game and the background of what i'm saying i'm going to give a very fast breakdown of all the different levels and parts of the games. levels 1-20 = having fun, playing casually, (taking the bait)levels 20-40 = more challenge, figuring out your class and game goals (getting hooked)levels 40-50 = sinking more time & money into the game you didn't expect (you can't turn back now)levels 50-59 = hoping that the max level 60 will change the game for you (being disillusioned)level 60 = looking to get in a top guild, throw all your time & money at the game (your fate)so all in all how Royal Quest works is this: it lies to you in the beginning, and then once you've invested too much time and money into it to leave, it forces you to join a top guild to succeed. which isn't inherently bad if it weren't for the background corruption of the game. and that corruption boils down to this: monster cards. there is a special item in game that are called monster cards. essentially these cards are very hard to get and make your gear and character very strong. however, there are normal monster cards and then Elite/Boss monster cards which are the hardest monster cards to get but also the strongest. Now when you get to level 60 typically the last thing you do before finishing your character is finding all the normal and Elite/Boss monster cards you need. However it came to light that the leader of one of the strongest guilds in the game had fabricated the majority of his Boss cards some time in past. And to top it off when someone tried to call him out on it, their account was permanently banned. Since that time, people have avoided openly talking about that incident for fear of being permanently banned.  but it gets better. That corrupt guild leader then became a moderator. And as a moderator in any medium your responsibility is to be objective and help the players in the game you moderate. However this corrupt moderator went around and instigated arguments with players (because that's the type of guy he is) and then would chatban people who hurt his feelings.  Recently I was one of those people that got temporarily banned for arguing with him after realizing how corrupt he was. The interesting thing is there are in game rules where you're not allowed to discredit those in authority. however, every single forum post or in game conversation that shows evidence of moderators abusing their power magically gets removed. so when they ask for evidence to our insinuations they know we dont have alot because they took away most of them. To make you smile even more, after this recent happening of me and my friends arguing with the corrupt moderator, i messaged the admin about the whole incident and was promplty temporarily banned for discrediting the corrupt moderator. I then made a forum post about the whole situation and how the moderator was corrupt and broke the silence on all the wrongdoings of the mods and administration and was promptly banned from making forum posts. TL;DR:-this game is dying because of corrupt moderators and admins abusing their powers to cover up illegal stuff they did in the past and only care about the top guilds that those corrupt people are a part of. -There is no way to prevent the people in authority from abusing their powers so they do it all the time and you get punished for even trying to stop them. -don't play this game if you want to have fun. don't play this game if you're bored. don't play this game at all. play WoW or guild wars 2, or Tera. literally any other MMORPG. Thanks for reading, now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to try to get gold in league of legends this season.			"

This is the most important thing which everybody wanna know about this game before starting playing it. Don't worry, guys, there is no OP-gear in donate shop, I swear you.Second thing: if You ever liked games like Ragnarok Online/Runescape/etc. - you'll be like Royal Quest a lot. There are tons of fun, pvp action and, of course, tons of sweet-old-chineese-mmo-grind. Just try it, bro.			"

People call this a P2W game but this is however an unfair review to the people that haven't played enough to realize you can earn in game currency. The in game currency are called ""Royal Reales"" and can be bought using Gold found by doing quests, killing monster and many other ways to get it. I enjoy this game even more with the nice community it has and with high visual graphics it's amazing that the game is free. I am currently lv 36 and with a great guild supporting me, I love this game even more every time I play it! "

You may have to spend on some cash shop items to make the game enjoyable (the inventory slots particularly). I played as a mage glass cannon with the intention of going elemental sorcery.

												I think it's really good game and i don't know why people say its P2W because it's not. Maybe u can buy some goods for real money, but you can also buy Reals (money from $,€ exchange) for gold. You can have premium account without using your real money. I was playing something like 40h and it was fun.  If you want enjoy the game in every aspects join to guild (there is many guilds from many countries). :D			"

												Feels like Ragnarok Online. A lot of similarities to RO especially card system, monsters and some loot drops.Freemium mmo - take that as you will. You may have to spend on some cash shop items to make the game enjoyable (the inventory slots particularly). I played as a mage glass cannon with the intention of going elemental sorcery. Not many people in game though - well not the noob areas anyway.This review is based on a playtime of approximately 2 hours.			"

I'm loving the game so far, it takes me back to RO when it was first up and definatly how the second should have been! If you love grind games and enjoyed Ragnarok, then definately check into Royal Quest!			"

												YetAnotherMMORPG - The gameplay is extremely solid and well polished. But as others have said, it's nothing groundbreaking or particularly original. (In fact, the lore basically seems to amount to ""Let's kill monsters for the king, okay guys?"")The cash shop is largely just a shortcut and doesn't seem particularly P2W. Classes are somewhat interesting.If you need that MMO itch scratched, jump in and try it.			"

												This game is realy nice. If the developers where going for that old school mmo look and feel, they nailed it. I recommend this game to anyone who likes a good laid back old school style game. I don't recommend this game for anyone who don't appreciate the classics. Now the crafting takes some time and its not realy ""pay to win"" its pay if your in a hurry to level up. And there are thing that will try to get your loot befor you and thats what the pet collars are for to make your pet get the loot befor any one els dose. But its kinda fun raceing to grab your loot befor they do. It is a realy good game but the view is a bit maddening sometimes, its also ment to be as social as the old school mmo's. But it seems like I have played it befor the hole mint leaf in the mouth thing, someone message me and tell me why it seems so familiar.			"

												One of the better free to play games iv touched in a while! The graphics are simple, yet colorful and full of life. The gameplay resembles diablo, torchlight, and spiral knights. Iv only put in 18 hours, (at the time of this review) and im enjoying it immensely. Its crazy addicting, tons of loot to gather, and the community seems to be nice if you have any questions about the game, or want to join in a party etc.. I definitely recommend this to anyone seeking something new to play! Oh and if you're wondering, its not pay to win. if you end up spending money of the game, its just for cosmetics, a new mount, better potions, and so on. You can also buy premium membership for double xp, more quests, and more added stuff to the game. but its completely free, and you never have to spend a dime!			"

												Enjoyed the game so far. It is pay to win, if you want it to be. If you focus on PvE aspect like me, you'll have a lot of fun. If pvp is your thing, maybe look for a MOBA game instead. PvE is pretty grindy. But, I had fun. Helpful Tip:1) Make sure to have your character accumulates ""rest"" - This can be acheive by not logging in the game for a period of time. ---- The trick here is, to not used up all of the ""rest exp"", instead save them for future usage.  <-- This method is incredibly useful for higher level and will save your a lot of times for training.  (I leave my rest exp at 5000 exp)2) Play a sniper for PvE. (You can hit level 56 Bonerattler when you're only level 27)  Fastest leveling up. Check out the forum ---- ""Jumong's Sniper Guide."" <--- Very helpful guide for PvE sniper.   "

												Three months ago I wrote a negative review for royal quest after rewriting my original positive review. I will now go on to expand that negative review.  My last review ended with me summarizing that Royal Quest is pay to win. Which it is, however, it gets worse. The admins, and mods in charge of the forums online are corrupt and protect people at the top of the food chain in game that have cheated their way there. To help people understand the game and the background of what i'm saying i'm going to give a very fast breakdown of all the different levels and parts of the games. levels 1-20 = having fun, playing casually, (taking the bait)levels 20-40 = more challenge, figuring out your class and game goals (getting hooked)levels 40-50 = sinking more time & money into the game you didn't expect (you can't turn back now)levels 50-59 = hoping that the max level 60 will change the game for you (being disillusioned)level 60 = looking to get in a top guild, throw all your time & money at the game (your fate)so all in all how Royal Quest works is this: it lies to you in the beginning, and then once you've invested too much time and money into it to leave, it forces you to join a top guild to succeed. which isn't inherently bad if it weren't for the background corruption of the game. and that corruption boils down to this: monster cards. there is a special item in game that are called monster cards. essentially these cards are very hard to get and make your gear and character very strong. however, there are normal monster cards and then Elite/Boss monster cards which are the hardest monster cards to get but also the strongest. Now when you get to level 60 typically the last thing you do before finishing your character is finding all the normal and Elite/Boss monster cards you need. However it came to light that the leader of one of the strongest guilds in the game had fabricated the majority of his Boss cards some time in past. And to top it off when someone tried to call him out on it, their account was permanently banned. Since that time, people have avoided openly talking about that incident for fear of being permanently banned.  but it gets better. That corrupt guild leader then became a moderator. And as a moderator in any medium your responsibility is to be objective and help the players in the game you moderate. However this corrupt moderator went around and instigated arguments with players (because that's the type of guy he is) and then would chatban people who hurt his feelings.  Recently I was one of those people that got temporarily banned for arguing with him after realizing how corrupt he was. The interesting thing is there are in game rules where you're not allowed to discredit those in authority. however, every single forum post or in game conversation that shows evidence of moderators abusing their power magically gets removed. so when they ask for evidence to our insinuations they know we dont have alot because they took away most of them. To make you smile even more, after this recent happening of me and my friends arguing with the corrupt moderator, i messaged the admin about the whole incident and was promplty temporarily banned for discrediting the corrupt moderator. I then made a forum post about the whole situation and how the moderator was corrupt and broke the silence on all the wrongdoings of the mods and administration and was promptly banned from making forum posts. TL;DR:-this game is dying because of corrupt moderators and admins abusing their powers to cover up illegal stuff they did in the past and only care about the top guilds that those corrupt people are a part of. -There is no way to prevent the people in authority from abusing their powers so they do it all the time and you get punished for even trying to stop them. -don't play this game if you want to have fun. don't play this game if you're bored. don't play this game at all. play WoW or guild wars 2, or Tera. literally any other MMORPG. Thanks for reading, now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to try to get gold in league of legends this season.			"

												(i dont know if i should say yes or no, but i guess it's a yes?) it's a pretty decent RPG, good graphics, fair microtransactions, and a simple skill system.but the music.  it's a bit too calm, does not even deliver the adventure vibe. it sounds more like a lullaby IMO. gameplay is a bit outdated (movement systems.. why point and click..)

												10/10 for a F2P game of this sort, definitely recommend getting this if you're a fan of the typical MMORPG type.Loads of different equipment, various classes, swanky outfits, castle raids, boss fights and most of all I should mention that playing this game with a friend or a couple of people to make up a party is definitely twice as fun than going solo.

												Played for about 5 hours today... game is pleasantly nice. There is some pay to win, but atleast it isn't like most games where you can't play at all. For those who reviewed that health and mana potions are with real money, actually, i found that you find many on the way, and there are some you can buy from vendors you can buy with looted gold. Until now, game looks fine. I reached level 15, and liking the game so far.Only one item I didn't like is missing teleportation. Even for the basic one, you need a premium account.Edit: After playing for over 27 hours, I feel this game is pretty addictive. Atleast until now I could manage with all F2P features, but I should say thanks to the amazing community that helped me.			"

												As an adult gamer I don't have enough time to enjoy yet another stereotypical MMO. Getting to level 8 didn't take long but all I got to do was fetch quests. Movement is ok-ish, in dieablo-style clicking but using skills as a mage felt terribly clunky. Graphics ain't nothing to brag about just another MMO that looks like all the other million contenders in the genre. I rather pay for a game that I enjoy playing from the beginning than play a free2play game that is just another timesink. Avoid like plague.			"

												What I liked about this game is that you can play it in a very casual manner.It has a nice music, clear environment and a friendly UI.This game, having a point-and-click gameplay does not matter.It is just a matter of preference.What I disliked about this game is that it's like Ragnarok Online 1.Don't get me wrong. I really loved Ragnarok Online 1.But to try and copy RO1 is a mistake. (Kafra, cards, point-and-click, starting point for each job.)But based on my overall experience:I recommend this game. "

												I feel I can do a first look review since I played 90 hours now. This game is what ranganork Online 2 should have been. If you liked RO you are going to love this game.In the other hand if you hate grinding, this isnt for you, questing is not a big part of the game, most quests give so little exp that you would rather grind instead. You can level up by questing easiely up to lvl 20-25 but after that you have to grind. If you played RO this might feel familiar and it shoul'nt be a problem at all. Grinding is not that hard and you get cool rewards for it. Also there are pvp zones with mobs in it where you can grind and the exp is at 120% just be careful with the other players.So far this is not a pay to win for me. Theres a currency called Royale, which you buy with real money and with this you get a premium account that gives you boosts in exp and such. However you can buy royales with gold. At this moment it costs about 500k gold to get 3 days of premium account. In case you are wondering, 500k is not expansive at all, I had spend that when i was about level 25-30.Finally: If you are going to give it a try play after level 20, this is when the game starts to shine. Althought for some classes is very hard to go from 20 to 30. I played as a crusader and as a Sorcerer. Sorcerer is the easiest class to lvl. Just mob mob and mob using AoE. At my current level (35)  I can get a level per hour if I play good. In the other hand, the Crusader at lvl 26  i only can get a lvl every 2 hourrs of grind. This is because the lack of AoE skills, but everyone keeps telling me that at lvl 30 you get a skill (Grand Cross RO fans know) that allows you to kill a bunch of mobs at the same time and so they say is going to get easier even though the exp requierd is going to be a lot more. Right now for the Crusader I usually go in party to lvl faster.Lastley I've been playing a roug for a couple of hours but I cant say much about that because I havent play enought to get to 20.PD community is great too. Bunch of Guilds, people is friendly and ussually like to play socially.			"

												I like this game a lot. Step 1 to enjoying it, like any MMO, is finding people to enjoy it with, Once you have that down it is gravy.This is a PVP game but PVP is entirely optional. Don't want to PVP? Don't go into the elenium caves, don't queue for a BG or duel.A very few might say this  game is pay 2 win but in my experience it isn't. There are many things you can buy from the cash shop but free players can buy them too. The cash currency 'reales' is tradable and often bought and sold. The cash shop items are also commonly bought and sold. The most popular being 'blessing scrolls'. There re 3/7/14/30 day varieties and they are basically a 'subscriber' type buff for XP and a few other things. No weapons or armor are cash shop items. Of the items in the cash shop that gives bonuses, equivilent items not in the cash shop are superior. I could buy a +5% HP decoration or I could work for one that can't be bought for cash and has a card slot. It is like this for all items even mounts.The game gets regular updates. In a recent update called ""Patch of the Crusader"" the class I play as was completely reworked. Before the patch there was a very specific objectively best path to work through. This was because many skills were so weak as to never be used and others being so powerful as to being crutches. This was reworked as to allow multiple ways for the class to be used without one being objectively best. In addition some classes got buffs/fixes/nerfs. As is the far easiest classes to level are the two mages and the sniper.Some people complain about the grind but I have found the grind to not be very bad compared to other MMOs I have played. On the range of ""No grind"" to ""Extreame years long grind"" I'd have to put it in the couple months catagory. If you take a mage you can get to level 40 in 3 days and 50 in a week now that enough time has elapsed for people to determine the optimal leveling areas. "

												Alright then where do I start with this game? The game itself is awesome that I can assure you! So here are the things that I like about the game -Its more of being the actual RO2(Ragnarok:2)-Jobs/Class : Your basic Swordie, Mage, Archer, Assassin but it would have been better if they had atleast 3-4 more classes -Other ppl saying this game is P2W. : Well its kinda IS and its kinda NOT, the reason behind that is Ive played for 1 month without any PREM x2 EXP and I did enjoy it. It just comes to a point in the game that you need to atleast shell out a couple of bucks to atleast help out.Other than that pretty much thats the only thing you need to get going.After 2-3 mos of playing the game I would have continued playing this game since Im 54/60LVL. already but quite a few  player ingame have somehow gotten tired of the game already.Well anyways MORE POWER to RQ maybe someday I'll play it once again :)IGN: WaydyuwanakimeeGame: 8/10			"

												Royal quest is pretty good game for me. it remind me when i was still playing RO (ragnarok online) and combine with a bit of WOW mechanic. When some people say it's pay-to-win I always check what the item mall was selling and guess what.... they selling item for reset your stat and talent, special pot, a key to open chest, suit with no +stat, and use to recharge premium account. The premium accout offer you 50% more EXP but for me it's ok... well I mean you can get to max level with or without premium so why worry. some other player selling cash around 8000g so it's not really purely p2w game. you can pick 4 class in this game Archer, Warrior, Mage, Rouge then after you hit lv 20 you can chose 2 more class... like warrior to crusader or dark knight. well i wish there are more job to chose. the backpack is so small and if you want to expand u need 9 cash but that's ok if you can adapt to itanyway it's a fun game if you like RO			"

												Ultimate drama, strategy, teambuilding, conquest, divide and conquer, sabotage and betrayal game. Better than Pokemon, better than TV - have to read between the lines, its never about the grind. - Droog.Just has a really bad name - all will agree with that. Those who play generally agree - very similar in format to ragnarok 2. MMORPG. First off, let me say that this is a well crafted game - those who enter the f2p/p2w argument generally and unfortunately dont stick around long enough to understand the dynamics of the game. Many come in with a high expectancy and first impression of pay to get ahead quick - you have to remember that in any game that would♥♥♥♥♥♥off anyone, no one wants that. So, no - this is not a P2W game - it's meant to be a balance between the two and the access to store items is monitored to ensure world availiability. Pay is for the impatient - ie. i want a gold treasure card so i can start making money, buy store items, IMPORTANT - NOT FOR BUYING A WHOLE BUNCH OF STORE ITEMS FOR GUILDMEMBERS, alot have tried to become a guild leader - feel this sudden mantle of responsibility and sudden need to line the storehouse with store bought items - just dont - it's bad form, people cry when it gets stolen, and most act like babies when they cant control everyone, and then leave game - money doesn't buy people. My own personal feelings - the cost of store items have been a high par requirement for this game - and while devs need to eat, most would be unwilling yet as an observation - as prices go down - the population becomes more spend thrifty on a regular basis - and i think the devs see, recognize and have been testing that with the event sales some of us have been expecting.Many likes on how supportive admin has been - i believe it has made a general impression on the community and many have seen that, and are very suprised where normally this is absent in other games.Dislikes would say probably the ""Open Beta"" sign - hoping that comes down soon. In my eyes, games going to have problems, issues and updates. Alpha for program testing, Beta for input and changes, General Release - Steam. Bugs and maintenance going to happen - at the same time if it were at all possible to rename the game to something more strategy minded - would catch a lot of WOW LOL fanboys - to me this is a treasure I almost skipped over because of the name - very reminiscent of the old vanilla WOW days (before it was ruined) in some ways, I find able to recapture that here.

												An enjoyable mash up of MMO and Diablo style RPGsNot bad for a FTP game, and I know it's new so these minor concerns can be corrected in subsiquent patches, but here goes:1) Not nearly enough quests, after you leave the nub area you will routinely find yourself grinding to finish a level and thus unlock new quests, which will not be enough so you will be grinding again...2) The base class/specialization class is interesting, but it would be nice if there was a way to change specializations. At level 20 you area forced to pick on to pregress and if you decide you picked the wrong one... Well, youre boned so level another character. Which won't be fast b/c see above...3) Post level 20, the only way to respec is to get a expensive item. So don't ever mess up and choose the ""wrong"" option between two that you really know nothing about... Especially if you've never played this game before...			"

												Royal Quest could be a fun mmorpg, but it is lacking in the fine tuning. The panning view/area with the mouse is severely limited making it hard to navigate using  mouse clicks. You cannot see far enough ahead or zoom out enough to plan your movement, you have the overhead map but then have to keep resorting to it as you harvest and enter various dungeons. the entire game is designed to seperate you from your money, we already have enough free to play minimumly games like Everquest and Everquest II. Right now in Beta there are too many players to have any kind of fun due to fighting over resources and people stealing kills, I hope that changes with the final release. I played about 7 hours, and it was really not very exciting or fun, most of the time was spent fighting over resources. people in the game are not very friendly because of this strugggle for resources, but as I say this is a beta with one server for the world presently. I would reccomend this game for kids under 14,			"

												This is a great game with unique ideas, monsters can eat your drops and if you want them back you have to kill them! so much fun, and if you're reading this message and you're unsure  to play or not, just do it man, i mean don't let the ""pay to win comments"" get to you. game is surely not pay to win and can give you lots of hours of fun, people don't know what pay to win is. Pay to win is buying stuff with real money that you can't have any other way which makes your character stronger than others. Thing is.. You can buy everything that is on the item mall from other players or the market, the stupid people that give this game a bad reputation are just lazy to farm for gold to buy good items, ignore them, have fun in game :)			"

												What do people expect when they play rpgs ? this is not a pay to win game as it requires alot of grinding and stratagy as many onthers do. pvp zones are not a problem for someone who can make friends. anyone who thinks that spending money makes a big difference is just plain lazy and should be greatful they arn't being charged.

												Hey Guys, It's yo boy Stackbizz.I'm reading people bash this game.  Mostly due to the fact that you have to pay for convenience.  People rage and ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about games that require you to buy stuff in game, yet not too long ago we were all involved in monthly subscriptions for games that we already bought just to be able to log in and keep playing.  I personally prefer not paying for a game, having it be completely free, and paying for stuff in game IF I CHOOSE TO.  As apposed to buying a game, paying for 4 months, being down like $100 and getting bored and moving on.  Guys this free model is awesome, and the free games are getting freaking amazing. Have you played Planetside2 or Firefall? Free freaking awesomeness.  This game is the second coming of Ragnarok Online and I'm loving it so far. Full video review in the works. youtube.com/stackbizzy "

Check.Painfully slow progression, with very little reward? Check.Pay2win goods being rubbed in your face constantly? Check.If you like oldschool grindy MMOs this is for you. If you want something different and interesting I'd recommend eating nails over playing this.			"

												So this will be one of the very few games that actually made me to write an review.Royal Quest is a definitely FUN mmo to play! Altough it's lacking balancing hard, especially between ranged and melee classes. It's a game that features a freedom of building your character (i will mainly focus on mage-sorcerer as i play one). As a sorcerer you can go pve-solo build, pve-support, pve-pvp or purely pvp way. There are three main weapons for a mage and it is spellbook - cheap but medicore ranged attack, scythes - high atk close combat and bracelet+orb combo - medium damage but tons of def (i use bracer+orb). But that's not the end of it, you also got 4 talent trees which specializes in different range of enchantements to your playstyle. On top of that we got equipement that can be imbued with special seals and slots that can fit cards that gives dozens of enchantements. The range of how you want to play is quite diverse which i really like! :)There is no ""true crafting"" as you could see in other mmos, there is no craft leveling, all you have to do is get a proper recipe and resources that are needed for an item and just craft it. It sounds simple but getting those items requires either lots of gold or lots of grind.Now let's go to badies of this game. The amount of grind is helluva big, without premium it would take me ages to get to 31lvl (as iam now) and i already can feel like even with 2x exp and all that it will still be quite long before i hit 60 (note that i preffer solo style untill i reach like 50).The game is not exactly p2w but it has it's aspects, even tough everything can be purcharsed with normal ingame money, to get this money without any help you either grind like mad or just buy premium currency and sell premium stuff, either way will let you achieve what you want. I personally bought dlc from steam store and im happy with it.It's quite unballanced game, especially very hard start for all melee classes, if you have no money then go mage or archer, both of them got healing spells and can kite harder mobs in early, unlike other melee classes, ofc it's not easy, it still requires skill but it's still much easier than lets say, DK which i started with and dropped at 24 lvl (it took me 2 days to get to 24 on dk and 1 day to get to 24 on mage)Overall i would score this game 7/10, it would be 10/10 if melee classes would be optimized better way. Hope i helped!			"

												For a free MMO RPG game, it's actually not that bad. It's fairly simple to understand and runs quite smoothly. Only problem I have with it is that, like WoW, it really has no storyline to me. That, and when you're taking a quest, the text that the quest giver is supposedly saying isn't really worth reading. Other than that, it's not that bad of a game.			"

												This game is very fun til you hit level 60 then there is really only pvp and improving your gear to do. There are only single player dungeons which are currently broken for normal players over level 40 to do with the end bosses being too hard. Be prepared to do massive amounts of grinding daily quests as the normal quests gotten after level 30 will not even take you anywhere near leveling. If you want to level faster or have a better chance in pvp you need to join a guild. No guildless are even allowed in castles sieges. I find the community to be friendly & helpful with the occasional beggar (you know who you are) that needs to be called out in global. I'd rate this game a low 7 out of 10 overall, with it becoming an 8 out of 10 if they put in more daily group quests like zagre and implement group dungeons.			"

												Simple. Fun. Entertaining with a friend or two. Some of the quests are silly to ask you to kill lots of things, but other than that it's a pretty basic MMORPG. The controls are interesting. It's worth a quick try and seeing if you like it.To add to this review. A lot of the negative reviews have the same theme. ""This game is Pay to win"". I tend to find that this comes from a group of people who probably have ADHD and have never played an actual MMORPG in their life, or if they have it was WoW after it was nerfed to hell to accomedate casual players and allow them to earn the same rewards as the people who spent 100s of hours earning them in mere 1-2 hours. If you don't hand these people stuff on a silver platter, they won't be happy. It's simple as that. Their time in game reflects that. Most have 1-2 hours played. What can you accomplish or even find out in that time?Boo hoo. I can't have a mount at level 20. What about when you needed to wait till you were like level 40 to even see a mount in WoW? Flithy casual!Boo hoo! I have to pay money for more bag space. Stop hoarding then. You don't need to pick up ever jelly or wooden stump you see.As someone pointed out in their reviews. You can get the ""money"" currency, in game, by using in game gold. Sure it's a bit pricey, but that's what MMORPGs are about. Grinding. Grinding. Grinding. If you don't want to grind, don't play MMORPGs. Otherwiese, buckle up kiddo, farm that gold, get that money, and buy that mount or bag space you so desperately are crying for. Don't expect things to be handed to you just cause it says ""Free to play"". Nothing in life is free. Not even in video games.			"

You can buy premium cash for ingame curency. (going to work and earning real moneys would be faster way)Mages yet OP.Pros:Combat feels nice.Somemtimes funny situations. (spawning monster in willage that killing all players there (including yourself))Graphic is nice for eye.You can buy premium cash for ingame curency.For last 9 h of gameplay i had decent fun :) But lack of pure warrior class (not some funky DK) was something what maked me stop playing.Not so hardcore path of exile.

												This is a fantastic game and I fully recommend it. Everyone seems to say that's it's P2W, which is absolutely untrue. Just because you spend a couple dollars on this game does not guarentee you'll win at any fight. The two DLC packages offer armor and weapons which are only useful up until level 20 when you are given armor and a weapon with better stats. The mounts one of the DLC package gives you only offers a movement speed boost and a small stat boost, and the pets are entirely cosmetic, unless you want to spend further and have them get the ability to loot, which you could just as easily do yourself by clicking the spacebar.Aside from that, the purchaseable currency in game, Reales, can be bought and traded to and from other players.Lastly, Premium, you get to try it out for 3 days when you make your account and it's most noteable points is that it offers a 50% exp and drop boost. Again, not making the game P2W, just making leveling a bit faster for those who choose to go that route.In summary, don't be discouraged because so many people like to say games are P2W without investing any time in the game itself.

Pay to Win is just a more stable way to play this game instead of having the trouble to go through so many problem to get some item. I am personally a dark knight in the game level 21. If u r having problem with the dungeon, get a party or join a guild and ask people to join u and u can go off killing players or defend urself. I find this an enjoyable game. To those who r doing class advance? if u r saying the boss is tough to kill well...try upgrading ur equipment or resetting ur talent or stats. nth is impossible in that game LOL.			"

												It's a pretty good RPG brought to us by the makers of King's Road.It's a homage to the MMO's of the late 90's, much like the first Ragnarok Online, in a way.You get to choose from 4 starter classes, and each will branch out into even stronger and diverse classes which'll make you want to play more -- discovering what each class has to offer.The visuals are pretty interesting for where the company started. Pretty simple, colors are great,monster designs are kinda generic (but meh), however the character designs are pretty good.Music is also fantastic. I can just grind my way listening to the bgm since its so relaxing or sotense when it needs to be.Gameplay wise, its a good balance between questing and grinding. Quests scale depending on your character level so you'll have no problem with it althroughout the first few hours of gameplay.But since it's this kind of MMO, expect lots of grinding and questing. Theres a fair amount of pvp for allthose people who want a slice of the action. Classes are pretty much balanced.This game deserves an 8/10 at least! Try it out, it's free :P			"

												I tried it, but about died of sheer boredom by level 10. This MMO takes no risks and does nothing innovative at all. It is just like a bunch of other f2p MMO's out there (such as Eden Eternal). You pick from one of 4 generic classes, and then embark on a series of generic fetch/kill quests. The quest objectives eventually are so far away that you can just put your toon on auto-run and go make a sandwich before reaching them. They separate you by class, so forget questing with your friends unless you are all the same class. The stealth ability for the Rogue class made me cry...lasts a very short amount of time and makes you move extremely slow. I understand some movement speed decrease, but RQ takes it to the extreme. Overall: extremely disappointed. There are a ton of f2p MMO's that do everything this does but better.I honestly didn't even look at the cash shop, so I have no idea what is in it. I don't spend a penny on games like this anyways.			"

												I really don't like the yes or no rating on steam, but I guess I'll settle on no.The top-down camera and point and click work fine, but it can be touchy in situations where ranged characters need to kite and dodge large creatures. And picking up loot Ragnarok style gets old fast; loot should either be automatic, walkover, or corpse collection, not 5 items sprawled on the ground each needing its own click.The inventory complaints I've seen in reviews are somewhat unfounded. Yes, there are only about 14 bag slots, but there are 5 different bags for different types of items, so in essence, there are a lot more.Quests are the standard, but they require treking back and forth repeatedly, with random spawn points, which is extremely tiring and annoying.The game is decent; in depth skill trees, unique play-style classes, decent graphics. Enjoyable for some, but anyone seeking a game to grab them and make them want more should look somewhere else.			"

												14 inventory slots for general monster loot (food, skins, craftable items, etc.) will often make you spend time trying to re-arrange your inventory... and makes it hard to progress in quests without throwing away something potentially important.Otherwise the game seems decent at first, but you'll soon notice that you can't even take no minibosses of your level without having enough stamina (health), because you can only drink potion once per minute. Pretty annoying. Don't think I'll continue playing with the low inventory slots paired with  unbalanced combat.For better clarification: I played the melee class rogue that has no cc and tried to fight my own level minibosses: They would either 1 hit me or simply have too much health to kill them before dying from their damage even if using skills in the right order. There are zero defensive skills at least early on.			"

												This MMO reminds me of those older Asian MMOs that came to NA many many years ago (pre-2007). This game is much more polished however, and I absolutely enjoy the ease and depth the game has to offer. With a weapon upgrading system as well as a card augmenting system and mobs dropping some very rare gear, I highly recommend it.So after i played this game for a bit i can tell you few things which might help you decide to play or not .

												This is a pretty unique little gem of a free MMORPG with a somewhat deceptive item shop.Before I start - the item shop IS NOT mandatory.Everything in this game is purchaseable with ingame currency, including the premium currency itself. It is expensive, but you can buy it with in game gold.All in all, this reminds me of some old school point and click action bar MMORPGs similar to Lineage and specifically a game called Ferentus, but a lot more polished and with a very well presented UI and ideas.Summary:-8 classes to choose from (4 in the beginning)-a variety of ways to min/max your attributes-crafting is very important and the only way to get best items (so far)-item shop is very very optional-lots of PVE content, but mostly traditional MMORPG grindy stuff-encourages grind with rewards...lots and lots of rewards-a million ways to customize your character to your taste stats wise-okayish graphics and good sounds effectsAll in all, this is by far one of the better free MMORPGs I played in a long while and has a very fair item shop that is very non intrusive. I definitely recommend this to the fans of the genre and especially those old school players that miss some of the older MMORPGs Check out my longer-ish review here "

												Royal Quest is a decent free to play mmo, it does not do much if anything different but it looks pretty, runs smooth and is simple to play. It is very simple so don't expect anything breakthrough, just a good amount of content we have already seen ""re-skinned"". If you are looking for a new free mmo, without feeling pay to win, but also don't want to try one of the newer more popular games, I bet this could be a good fit for you. As I have ever heard of the game before its steam release I cant attest for how large the community will be after the Steam release players ""die-off"", but overall I think the game is worth a try. Come in expecting a terrible game and you will be pleasantly surprised its not that bad.			"

IntroductionThis game fackin blows just kidding. The game has many ups  and downs to it, just as any game of this genre. Before we start lets get rid of some obvious stereotypes that I know you're thinking of;There ARE pay to win aspects to this game. it's an MMORPG, what do you expect?You have to actually put effort into the game to level up past the level 20 hump, where players basically say its ""too slow"". Ask yourself a question, what MMO is NOT grindy? k. done.Yes, there are PKing types, get over it, it happens, ignore them and take a break, go see the sun or something.k, so we got that out of the way now what to talk about? well what more than the gameplay?it starts out in a tutorial, which every game does, of course, but this tutorial is unique as it gives you freedom to stay once you're complete or not, which might not mean much, but at lvl1 grinding the tutorial mobs can get you to lvl5+ before you even leave the tutorial. Next, the graphics, yea they aren't the sekciest, but who cares? they aren't ugly either. I quite frankly love the character and mob designs. It's the textures on the ground and such that I'd like to see changed. There are glitches in some spots, and holes and such that aren't a game breaking aspect.Ok, so you got to lvl 20, it slows down a ton, should I quit as a player?HECK NO the main aspect of MMORPG's are the grinding aspects, you play the game to get a higher level, which requires you to do quests, and kill stuff. It's really a simple concept.I really reccomend this game. I hope you enjoy it. (130+ hours played, I think I understand a little bit right? right? "

												This game may be similar in many ways to other mmo rpgs but it has managed to create a stimulating atmosphere where somehow it doesnt feel the same.... It could be thx to the music, very progressive and diversified. Instead of a tempo-constant loop, there is a wide range of uplifting and thrilling effects to get from the tracks. It also has to do with the animations which have been well polished. Look at those groovy barking trees and the way they react, aren't they amusing?! And those attacks give a nice arcade feel to it.I only did a few quests, which were not that different in content from other similar games, but looking at the world map and how the worlds vary at relatively short distances, I feel drawn towards discovering more.I say good job so far...

Looking forward to try out new stuff!Seventeenth Hour; Found out that mages are overpowered to♥♥♥♥♥♥.. I got through most of the stuff  in a couple of hours compared to the warrior class which took AT LEAST double that. Conclusion; Awesome game but for the record, there isn't a huge amount of quests for people to do... It's basically the same quests for every character no matter who it is. But it still it very good. For a free game, pretty good! I give this a 7/10P.S I know I had said there aren't varied quests depending upon your character, but keep in mind that this game is currently in BETA TESTING. Be patient with it and new quests should pop up sometime in the future.			"

												ill start with the pros-music is good-other players are really nice and friendly and quests add challenge to the game-good looking game in generalcons-not necesarily a pay to win gamr you CAN buy stuff if you want but you can earn better items-farming becomes a ♥♥♥♥♥ form about levels 20-30and in general people are complaining that this is a pay to win game not exactly you can get mounts buy buying hem with gold about 60 thousand or so and you can buy items that will help you but just become useless after level 25 because you get better gear that goes into that slot the clas selection is good but they could add mroe subclasses or another class mabye to add more variety to the game and when you reach level 20 you could enstently get a boost of exp for 1 hour atleast to make it easier and less boring to farm players are ncie but most of them speak brazilian german or spanish and i cna barely find a guild that speaks english they could increase the level cap to level 100 wixh you can go to another subclass and then cpa the level at 60 but in general tis a great game			"

												Surprisingly enjoyabgle f2p ARPG!I certainly didn't expect a great deal initially, but absolutely enjoying this title!The graphics and controls are well done, very fluid combat and with no lag at all.  4 Classes to choose from.  The f2p mechanics are good, this isn't a B2W product up to this point (currently level 12).The loot is good and mostly obtained from personal dungeons which is a neat idea.  I wish mobs would drop loot ( mainly just craftable stuff it seems which is a negative).Give this game a go if you like games ala D3, TQ and mythos etc...			"

												The game plays a lot like an Action-RPG (Torchlight, Diablo etc). It has a decent playerbase (as of Aug.07.14) and seems to take a lot of elements from other popular games, which is not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion since the game is fun to play.Positive Things:+ Great Soundtrack+ Beautiful Graphics+ Very well Optimized+ Varied Landscapes and Scenery+ A whole lot of Different Enemies+ Interesting Lore+ Nice ammount of Loot+ Free 3 Day Premium for Newcomers+ Reales (cash shop currency) can be purchased for in-game gold coins.Negative Things:- A lot of ""Fetch Quests""- **Cash Shop and Premium Membership seem to be slighlty ""Pay 2 Win"", though it just helps you     get EXP and special items faster.- Very small Inventory (can be upgraded with **Reales)- Forced PVP in some areas, which makes it hard to finish some quests because some players just love to kill low-level players.All in all the game is quite fun to play in my opinion, the ""Pay 2 Win"" aspect isn't as bad as it sounds, Free-Accounts can still have a decent ammount of fun so the game is definitely worth a try, especially if you enjoy Diablo-Like games.** You can buy some stuff in the cash shop and upgrade your inventory space for a currency called ""Reales"", you can purchase them with real money or you can buy them in the in-game market for in-game gold coins. Buying Reales with in-game money is a lot slower of course and requires grinding but that way you cana ctually buy everything in the cash shop without having to pay real money, so in that sense the game isn't really P2W.

												I don't know what everyone's problem is that is giving negative reviews. Yes it's pay-to-win and is much like other games, but nowdays, there's just so many mmorpgs, it's hard to find anything unique anymore. Just each games has their own style and variations. And as far as pay-to-win goes, that's what you will get when you play a FREE TO PLAY game... The damn makers of this game have to make money SOME HOW to keep the games going... Let me get one thing straight about all the negative reviews.... All these things things the negative reviews are complaining about, is just pretty much what you will find in any typical free to play mmorpg.Now here's my personal opinions on the game so far:Pros:The graphics are beautiful for this type of game, way more beautiful than I expected.The things that you can do to upgrade your gear is a nice feature.So far from the low level maps, I've found these randomly spawned gravestone things that you can click and go into a mini-dungeon (I assume). I've found these quite fun to do because you can get some decent loot from these. I hope there's more in the game!The characters and customization all look quite nice. The faces look just a little weird on some of the options, but other than that, I really like it. There's a decent amount of options for you're character's looks, more than even some mmorpgs I've played. I'm a sucker for character customization, so I really hope they add more features to this.I haven't gotten into crafting (if there is), but what I'm seeing looks like it should be interesting as well.The classes, skills, and stat points when you leveling, all this I really like. There's a unique (to me anyhow) feature for spending your stat points each time you level.The amount of options you are given in the settings (graphics, sound, chat settings etc...) is very nice as well. Games that give you a lot of settings and customization is always nice.Cons-ish:I do hate the click to move, but from all the mmorpgs/games I've played, I'm use to it by now.Bag space is annoying, but I just put things in storage I don't keep any time soon, and sell everytime I go into town. So I never really run into many problems with it.There are pvp zones, I'm not quite sure how it all works, but I look forward to exploring this. From what I've heard though and from what it seems, it doesn't tell you when you are in a pvp zone. Hopefully this stuff will be changed up some.There is a 10min death penalty. After you die, you're stats are decreased for 10mins, but this can be removed for 500g (which is REALLY easy to get) from the respawn points. So it's not a big deal.TLDR? The game has it's ups and downs. To best figure out if YOU like the game, I'd honestly suggest trying it out. Like I was saying earlier though, these negative reviews are kind of BS. Their complaints are stuff you will deal with in almost all free to play games.Every game is going to have at least 1 thing you don't like, after playing games almost my whole like, and 12 years of it being mmorpgs, I've learned you just work around it and deal with it if you like the game enough. No game is perfect :P			"

												Not bad at all.  It seems like there is huge skill customization that comes within time.  It's not exactly a ""twitchy"" game, but the combat does take some thought, or else you are toast.  It reminds me a lot of UO in some ways.  With open world pvpve later on in the game, this seems like it could be a great time.  Overall, pretty solid, polished game that reminds you of the old days of mmo.With a few more hours, it's still super fun.  I got into the PvP dungeon thing, and it's just a riot.  It's getting better and better with skills and quests, and the PvP actually has good rewards if you do well.  You can take their stuff once you kill them.  The stuff that they collect in the PvP area at least.			"

												Hello all,Just want to mention this game is awesome and it's something everyone should try out and play. :)This is NOT pay to win game everything can be bought with in-game cash.I only bought a mount with real-life cash to help support the developers.Classes in this game are amazing and well worked.Pros:- Awesome community, everyone is helpful- Guns! What else can I say we all love guns in an action game :)- Crafting is well worked- Dungeons on this game are cool - Looting items, the looting system is awesome in this game - Classes are well balanced out and easy to useCons:- Camera angle, would be awesome if it was all-round up and down camera- Spending Reales to revive your character when dying in the spot you died at- There isn't a lot of quests, there needs to be more!- There is only a few cities to explore- Not able to zoom-out further - Using mouse to control your character movement would be better with WASDThat's all, just another mention this game is worth a try and it's only going to get better!Awesome game.

												This MMORPG is very enjoyable compared to most of steam and most free ones I've played in the past couple years. The questing is a little basic as it tells you to go kill stuff and retrive stuff, but thats what MMORPGs are. However, many quests even early on require help from others, something MMOs need and most lack nowadays. Also, around LVL 15 you have to go in a an underground area for a quest and collect some items, wll that undergound area is an open PVP area, so while you are questing you can be killed by other players at any time. This is a nice challenge which most MMOs also lack nowadays. You either have to fend for yourself or group up and protect each other while doing the quest. You are free to distribute your stat points to your liking, can create many different playstyles with that and how you also choose your path for your class. I think the game deserves a try from anybody that enjoys MMORPGs.			"

												Point & Click Adventure.. much like Ragnarok Online but even more similar to Secrets of Solstice (Xenepic Online)Pros- Colorful graphics- Great Performance with speedy loading between maps- PVP is pretty good- Lots of Quests to do- Enchantment system is easy and straightforward- Full control of your attribute stats (Now don't go and mess it up with a crappy build)- Teleporting from city to city doesnt cost money I thinkCons- Virtually NO MOUNTS! & Travelling around on foot is SLOW- Overcrowded maps.. (Game just went Open Beta a few days ago and there is only 1 server)- Doing the same quest as everyone else can be a nightmare, causing you to wait on respawns then other people run to get it before you do- The Ingame Item Mall somewhat makes this game Pay 2 Win			"

												Everything in this game wants to remind your brain of old old Ragnarok Online.I'm fine with that, maybe that why i liked it in the first place. Translation problems aside,  you will either like the game for what it is (a RO clone) or hate it because of it. Microtransactions are worth overlooking early on i guess, but things like being able to use real $$ to avoid breaking items while upgrading them does seem to push the game into a very p2w side of the issue.Try this game if you liked RO or arpgs in general. Don't expect a ""modern"" feel to it.			"

												First off I just wanna say, if you are seeing a lot of negative reveiws disregard them and read this one.The most common complaints about the game are its camera angle and the pay to win aspect of the game. The camera angle from what I've played is fine I personally really like it and if you played any of the Diablo games and didn't mind it then you should be fine. The pay to win aspect is there but with a f2p game that is almost always the case but the thing about that is that only the PvP is pay to with, the PvE (Which is what I am here for) from the 4 hours I've played I haven't had any trouble making it through the PvE parts so if you aren't looking for PvP then you can ignore the pay to win because it doesn't concern you.Pros:-Beautiful music and textures, some of the best I've seen for a f2p game.-Fast paced combat, no turns.-Copious numbers of quests to do, you never have to just farm for no reason to do the next questCons:-Only 4 playable classes with 2 sub classes each at level 20-No race selection (Only humans)-Lack of armour and weapons for each class.Over all its not a bad game considering it's free and with the graphics and combat it has it's definately worth your time to check it out.

												Played this game for about 2 hours or so and really love it. Its very simple and understandable for anyone to get into. Love the simplicity of crafting and upgrading the items you have.As always, this is a Mmo that involves grinding, but with all the fun, kid friendly atmosphere you get from this, you'll find yourself forgetting how much time is being spent and get absorbed int this new free to play title.This is just my opinion of personally playing this game. Hope this helps someone!			"

												Okay so I spent a lot of time on this game. I have played off and on for quite some time until recently. I can honestly say that I liked this game a lot, but after some time it just got tideous. I don't understand how people can get all the way to level 60 and enjoy this game still. For the first like 30 levels it's a really good game, and then it becomes a grindfest. It's an MMO so I expected that, but not to the degree it ended up being. You can just grind for better gear, but you really have to improve all of your stuff quite a bit for it to even be useful. The issue there is, money isn't exactly everywhere. I found that I was broke 24/7. The in game economy has gone down hill over the two years I have played. It's just not worth the grinding anymore.TL;DREverything costs a lot and it's hard to make money. Either be rich or good luck man.			"

												Needs a bit of work, but it's a good game so far for coming out of Closed Beta not long ago. The core game is from...Russia, I think. The PVP is pretty great though with guilds in the PVP zones, it can be rather overwhelming to jump in without any backup. I think I spent the first 3 days more dead than alive in the PVP dungeons. Only 5 character slots per server so alt-itis will hurt some people. More servers are expected to open later.			"

												the game isn't pay to win, you can get monster cards including card of chaos from drops and i don't mean extremely rare, i'm level 38 and i already have 4 monster card 3 of which are 99 reals each, 270 reals is $9.99. Cosmetics DO NOT give bonuses, cosmetics are suit items, suit items DO NOT give bonuses, there is other gear which do give bonuses from the cash shop which are face and head items, which replace your face and head gear, and right now the only gear you can buy for face and head with cash is +5 stam, or +3 hit or 5% max health, which is useless late game even level 40+...  cosmetics = suit items, suit items = no bonus = game is not pay to win.  all the reviews on steam are thumbed down and the main point is pay to win, clearly all these people haven't played the game to understand how to get item seals and +10 gear. i have easily already made a legendary level 24 +8 dagger without spending any real money and it only cost me 30k in game, and i sold that dagger for 300k. So late game, maxed out level, best gear in the game is very possible  without spending any real money, don't tell me this game is pay to win. its like calling league of legends pay to win.120+hours on this game, i know what im talking about. As soon as people see cashshops they log out, thumb down, and say pay to win.			"

												I played this game for months on end until I got bored with it.  It has a Diablo-esque feel to it, but there is no real variation to the endgame equipment, the leveling is very grindy, especially after level 40.I would not recommend that you fall into the trap of the pay to win system.I really feel that the community I had come in contact with while I was playing is what kept me on board for so long.  After playing the game extensively, I can say this game has little to offer in terms of fresh ideas or new and interesting Action RPG/MMO gameplay.There are other games that have much more to offer, but I had a great run for the time I played.

												The game is pretty fun so far, and not quite as easy as I thought it would be. I like the fact that you can play for free. I have played for around 12 hours already, raising the level of my character (mage) to 21 pretty fast. Player base seems friendly in general. The story, while not amazing, is pretty simple to follow and interesting. The look of the game kinda reminds me of Tales of Symphonia, the parts when you were on the world map running around (which, to me, is a good thing).The only problem I have with this game is the fact that while it's free to play, you always, ALWAYS have a ""premium"" button thingie on your screen, right above your action panel, if you don't have a premium account. It gets really annoying. Also, there are various chests randomly put on the maps, and you can only open them with keys that cost real money. Basically, you can play for free, but you won't have access to everything if you don't pay.In other words, this game is enjoyable, but it's not perfect, especially for people who don't want to spend real money like me. I would still recommend it.			"
