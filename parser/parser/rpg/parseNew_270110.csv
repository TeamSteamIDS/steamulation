												Out of all bans I got from the Steam community, almost all have been caused by DMCA claims made by Mindblocks/the developers of Block Story. It is to be noted that if you even dare saying that Block Story is a bad game on the forums you will be permanently banned even if you took 1 hour making a huge wall of text carefully explaining why the game is bad.(in a best-case-scenario your thread will be deleted if they were calm at the moment)Excluding the steam's community/developers that is/are as toxic as Chernobyl and as restrictive as North Korea or Russia, Block Story is just a game that was made when Minecraft PE didn't existed on Android/iPhone, it's just Minecraft but with less voxel and more ""RPG"", and it's what makes it boring to play.TL;DR : Toxic developers + huge differences between android/iphone/pc version + Game made for ""smartphones"" ported to personal computers(PC) = bad game.edit: outdated			"

								Get Hexxit mod for Minecraft instead. Except some slightly better graphics there is nothing more to find here.Except for some strange crafting. You craft stacks of pickaxes cause you need one pickaxe for each block, just like swords. Which are useless btw, cause the best sword deals 40dps (damage per sword ^^) and a pig got 400hp. Ofc you could lvl up by digging ore for hours to get to lvl 40 and set you 40 earned skillpoints all into fighting so you deal 80dps...still sucks. The balancing so so far away from highly polished that it hurts.And this ""terrain that begs to be discovered"", well no! Looks all kind alike and quite lifeless except for this clone army of 3 different npcs that will give you ""oh hello, kill 20 bad mobs. Well thanks, now kill 20 other bad mobs"" quests.Did I mention ""Oh look at my 200h of work I got a Castle where I can sit on my Throne all by myself cause its a singleplayergame, but well done I can take a fu*** picture in the menu and post it on facebook"" yeah wtf?! go to hell -.- I dont know, there is still no real new feature that would be worth the price.

Early Access Review
								This is an Early Access game so there is still a lot of stuff to come.I have been playing this game since iOS and Android and even got it on Desura. It's a fun game.Unlike Minecraft, I like that this game has spawn blocks to collect, containing people, animals and such that you can use to populate whatever area you want them in. It's especially handy when you are getting attacked and you throw out a spawn block of a Warrior, Fighter, etc., and they come out to protect you and attack the enemy. If I'm fighting something powerful, I just spam out spawn blocks left and right having an army of warriors fighting for me. :PThe system in Block Story is similar to Minecraft and also has it's own unique features like learning magic spells and being able to create vehicles and a bunch of other cool things, but there are a lot of things I would like to see in Block Story, one would be to have multi-player. That would be badass! But I'm sure a game like this is not easy to make. Even Minecraft in all the years that it has been out is never complete. They always keep bringing out new updates.If you are looking for a nice Minecraft alternative with more adventure elements and don't mind doing it solo, then give this game a try.			"

												Recommended : NOTBlock Story is survival craft voxel game.[positive side]+RPG system with many skills to improve+ All creatures seem tamable (friendly, neutral & hostile)+ You can travel between generated worlds (infinite ressources)+ Tp system thru beds and tools in same world+ Tutorial from NPC missions+ Dragon system+ Respec (with diamonds)+ You can earn diamonds slowly in-game (microtransaction)+ Achievements in-game & Steam[negative side]- Short inventory, especially when you need to carry many tools- Fighting too close friendly NPC turn them agressive against you- Blocking NPC especialy in tiny corridor or when they stand near doors- Generated worlds with huge caves that require flying to explore (hard at game begining)- Game too easy & fast with microtransaction based on diamonds- Forging bars & repairing items require too many time like stupid MMO to force you to spend diamonds to short delay (no need that♥♥♥♥♥♥in solo game paid at full price, for example about 40 mn to repair 1 jewel with hammer)- You seem Tp verticaly and if you meet something solid you stay at higher solid block above bed- NPC & creature can't stay at floor where spawmer is, ""they shrink like they are in water"", on floor deeper (very bad management from solid block)- No multiplayer for fun[- negative from version before beta]- no update since more than 1 year for version < beta- dev delete all thread on forum that report no update or ask for more content because console version is updatedFor 2.99 USD or less you can buy it but i don't recommend it.I really don't accept you can craft with no delay but you need time to forge bars and repair stuff. These delays ruin game and are only implemented to force you to spend diamonds to short time required. If Dev need more money, he just have to raise purchase price instead of poluate game with microtransactions with diamonds to force you to spend it.You can play this free to play with cosmetic microtransactions only like Path of Exile :instead of Block Story.

												I originally bought this game while it was still in Early Access, long before it went to the pay model it adopted on release.  And to be honest, I'd already uninstalled it before release because it was already a fairly tedious game not improved by the odd loading limitations of the world chunks.  I can't say I was enthused when I heard about the new pay model, but as the devs claimed the game was fully playable without, I thought I'd give it a fair chance.One thing I will give them:  the world looks much better now that it's loading larger chunks, or else loading them faster.  And the topography of the world section I've been playing in is much more realistic, whereas it used to just climb off into Escheresque directions at random.  Water physics is still confusing, where you think you're going to float, and sometimes you do, and sometimes you end up at the bottom of a ravine.  The 'village' you start in is rather charmingly constructed, at least.  And speaking of charming, the baby dragon is a nice touch.As to whether the game is playable without pouring cash into it...well, that depends.  Do you have a high threshold for tedium?  Because this has not changed.  To be fair, it hasn't changed one single bit--as far as I can tell, they haven't slowed down any of the processes from what I remember.  It's just that it's exactly as bad as I remember.  Your tools last practically no time at all, whether they're constructed of stone or iron.  The higher the tier, the faster it goes, but pretty soon you feel like you're spending all your time mining just to replace your tools so you can mine some more to replace your tools.  The dragon is cute and quite useful in the outset, but I already feel like I'm going to be spending all the time I'm not mining trying to keep it fed.  And in order to feed it, I could keep giving it apples, at least until I run out locally...or I could give it meat from animals I have to run down to kill, while they're healing obscenely fast, so that I always need to hit them one more time than I should, wearing out my weapon quicker, which I'll have to--you guessed it--mine to replace my tools and restock my coal and build more furnaces to smelt a single bar of iron over four minutes to replace the weapon so I can keep my baby dragon from starving.  Or I could throw money at the problem.  (The ability to throw money at the problem is literally the only time improvement I'm seeing here from pre-release.)Yes, diamonds have been dropping in-game, but not fast enough that I feel like I can grind my way out of this.  On the whole, the game is just slow.  Painfully slow.  And I'm literally achievement-hunting a game where I'm waiting for potted plants to grow, but at least I can leave that up and switch to another window.  Considering that we're supposedly able to take or leave the new pay system, and considering that by choosing to leave it, this is almost exactly the same game I've been playing all along, I'm going to have to say that the same flaws that made me uninstall it the first time around are still present and have resulted in a game that's more of a slog than a grind.  With all the other sandbox games in my library (and with all the new ones coming out), I just can't see wasting any more time with this one.			"

												Lets pretend for a moment that you have absolutley no idea what this game is, and the past of this game on Steam (with the developers snapping at the community and refusing to update the game on EA and then just dump it as a complete game.) With all of that you'd think that ths is like the StarForge fiasco on a smaller scale. But lets forget that, and instead focus on how lacking, dull, and unfinshed this game feels.OptimizationThe game runs surprisingly well. On my old 2010 Notebook I can get an adverage of 50-60 FPS which is actually great! On my full computer (What I am typing this review with) it gives me about 300-400 FPS while not noticable by the human eye (no joke intended) it still is surprisingly well optimized given what this game is.The World:For an open-world Sandbox game the world feels surprisingly dead and static. For something that most other sandbox games do excellently (Minecraft and Creativerse most specifically) is the idea that once you expand and build and upgrade your character and world it will not only make you feel, well, accomplished but also it would feel like it was changing, like YOU were changing it. Here however the world just feels dead but surprisingly cluttered. There are randomly generated building and tons of NPCs but they have no reason, or just feel like they aren't adding anything. Top that with Water physics that don't even move (Which is a sing for Sandbox Survival games like this) and the lack of leaf decay makes the world feel astonishingly static, as if nothing will change, and for the most part nothing does. Although for what it is worth, the world generation looks very nice with long plains and deserts with massive forests spread around and they are almost fun to explore. (almost) I guess I should also mention the endless all that the world presents, where it will generate endlessly up and endlessly down. While this sounds awesome on paper, it truley is just that, awesome on paper, it is impossible for the idea of an unlimited cave system and unlimited sky lands to be fun and feel complete exploring. If there is no end then the player feels like it made no progress, and with no feeling of progress leaves me to turn off the game. Boss monster spawn without reasons and vanish without reason. There is no ecosystem feeling here. The random building are floating above nothing and some features (like weather) have no effect and just look and feel like they were added just to appease fans of realistic enviroments. The world, from a distance, looks nice with a great lighting engine to boot. But, get too close and it's true ugly head revils itself. The textures are detailed and fit nicley for the most part (Some don't blend well as if their art style was completley differnt.The Combat:It is awful. Now, Minecraft's combat (Block Story's main competator) is surprisingly good for what it is trying to do, and as of 1.9 is actually pretty great. Block Story's combat however is an obveous tide from it's ancient mobile days. It truley does feel unsatisfying and looks performs more like your weekly Clash of Clans rip-off than anything. You click once and then you hit it if your close or not, the hitboxes make it so as long as you are somewhere near it then it will register which is very poor feeling. It truly is hard to put into words on how bad the combat feels. You tap, and it does it, it just feels awful.  If there is anything good to say, you can spend your upgrade points on damage upgrades so you don't have to fight at all. Mobile Holdovers:This was once a mobile game. Which wouldn't be a problem if the game acted like a compotent 2.99 dollar game. There are microtransactions everywhere, sure you can earn the gems in game (like most other Microtrasnaction heavy games that are FREE on MOBILE) but it surley will take you a while to get EVEN ONE. Over 2 hours of gameplay and I had yet to get one gem, sure it may be random, however it shouldn't even be in a game that we payed 2.99 (which isn't as bad but still) for. Here is a kicker. The Microtransactions take center stage when you open the inventory and start to smelt items. Each item, (Iron Ore) which is fastest item to my knowledge to smelt, how long does it take without Microtransactions? 5 minutes. Yes Creativerse does have timers, however they don't use Microtransactions making it fair for all players. Additionally of the total 25 slots in the inventory to store stuff you get a mere 10 without paying  275 gems for an additonal 5 rows. which basically means that to unlock your entire inventory you need about 6.70 to do so which is rediculous considering that is over 2 times over the price people payed for the game. Music:It comes out of nowhere and constantly plays without reason and sounds awful. There are some interesting pieces of music here but the instrumentation and mixing is so awful (and the really bad midi soundfont they used) which makes it sound cheap and really ear grating after only an hour of playing.Overall:Block Story is sadly still very unfinished in it's ""finished"" state and with the developers being quiet since the release [Except for a Christmas update a week late. But still an update nontheless got to give em positive moral points for that] and other people slowly realizing the problems I wouldn't be surprised if this game is forgotten with time. And with all of the problems that I have encountered it would probaly be for the better if this were to happen. There are some good things, but they are overshadowed by the microtransactons, poor combat, dead world, and ear grating music. Don't get me wrong, I REALLY tried hard to like this game. I really tried. But, it just got wrose, wrose, and even more empty feeling and heartless and basically pasionless as it went on.

Early Access Review
								Block Story is an RPG set in a voxel world. You can explore the land, slay monsters, complete quests, gather, craft, and build pretty much anything. As with any RPG you can gain experience and level up with allows you to improve a wide variety of various skills from hitting harder to mining faster. Because it's a voxel game, some will draw comparisons between this game and Minecraft. Though if you allow yourself to get hung up on that comparison, you will lose sight of the real issue and fail to see Block Story for what it is: an attempt to push what can be done with voxels and deliver an RPG experience in this format.I firmly believe that such games deserve all the love that they can get, especially if they try something new with an existing concept. At the end of day, enjoyment and enrichment of the player should matter the most when it comes to how a game is judged and I most definitely feel that Block Story is a very enjoyable game. I honestly found Block Story to be personally  more enjoyable than Minecraft (and it's not as prohibitively expensive). Is it perfect? No. But it is a lot of fun.Of course if you're still convinced that this is a Minecraft ""clone"" keep in mind that Minecraft itself was inspired by Infiniminer and Dwarf Fortress. If anything, the emergence of this game along with games like Sky Nations, Fortress Craft Evolved and XenoMiner show that voxel as a means of shaping game worlds is a concept with lots of room for new ideas and ways of playing. I for one welcome this game and invite those with an open mind to give it a try as well.			"

								Great price for a fun little game. Similar to the popular Minecraft (as if you didn't notice), but has a bit more of an RPG element to it that will have you wanting to keep looking to find what is ahead.PROS:* Nice RPG System and a in-game ""recipe book"" that shows you what things you need to make items, weapons, etc.* It's a low price, one time purchase (no subscription fees)* It's in Early Access as of May 2014 and it's playing and functioning just fine.* I like the ""higher resolution"" blocks. CONS:* No Multiplayer (yet?) - Everyone loves multiplayer, and I'm not sure they are even considering it.* Weapon durability system is strangely different than other games, but it might grow on you.* Some enemy movement gets silly especially when odd shaped bricks are around. The collision system is exploitable.Other Points:* Enemy and friendly creature spawns are based of certain brick locations. They make it obvious. This allows you to ""dig"" the spawn brick and place it somewhere else. This can be fun to create epic battles between creatures.* I still can't figure out how to load the gun. It might be just me though...Overall, I'd say if you like Minecraft and different monsters and animals appeal to you, you might be interested in getting this game.			"

Water likes to float, because... well... **** gravity right. Durability is 1 tool per block, terrain is littered with 'spawning' blocks, the quest system is awkward, the performance isn't too brilliant and the graphics are so... ~puke~ nothing blends in well or matches up at all.Save your dosh, a zillion other games out there similar to this. Or go back to basics and install some mods on MC, which appear far more developed than this 'thing'.			"

												I just bought the game and for $2 its not too bad of a price but i still havent figured out to get the ""curency"" in the game besides finishing achievments and once in a while finding them while gathering stuff, however you need to spend the diamands to get more inventory space (and alot at that it was 250 for the first 4 slots then 1500 for the next 4 slots and now it costs 2500 for teh last 4) and you only start out with 1500. It takes 5 min to make 1 iron ingnot but you can speed up the time with 3 diamonds, compared to minecraft this is a complete joke of a game, however there are dragons you can eventually ride, and you do quests as well but it is very slow going, i couldnt even focus for more then a couple hours at a time. i never even made it past the tutorial i got too bored. when it comes to crafting there is a ton of stuff to craft but for instance a crafting table you can only place it and re-pick it up like 2 times b4 it is gone and you have to make a new one. It is a type of game where if you dont mind a slow game that takes a bit to do everything then you would enjoy it, me im the type who wants to build alot faster and dont want to wait 5 min for one iron ingnot, who knows how much longer it would be for gold or whatever else there is. never tried creative mode however that could be better but all in all the price is ok for the game but it is much less fun to actually play			"

								Once in a while, you have to review games that you dislike. Welcome to Block Story. Block Story combines popular 3D voxel, sandbox exploration gameplay with exciting and addictive role playing elements. Complete a variety of quests to survive and become the greatest warrior in the realm by conquering ten diverse biomes. Build strongholds, encounter a wide variety of creatures, battle boss monsters, and mine valuable resources to upgrade weaponry, access better equipment and create artifacts to summon monsters of all sorts – including dragons! Block Story is currently in its Early Access phase on Steam and is a game that took part in the greenlight program, passing the greenlight stage. You can purchase the game for $9.99 and was created by MindBlock Studios.First off, this game is very clunky. I'm not speaking just controls, I mean everything. From the controls to graphics, it feels like a badly ported mobile game that came to the PC. The graphics are all around terrible. This game is very much like Minecraft with a story, although that story very much feels like an MMO storyline. And we all know MMO storylines are nothing special. Basically, MindBlock decided to give blocks all new textures that look awful. Some looks a lot better than Minecraft's textures, but most of them look odd and out of place. One thing they did add to Block Story is companions. Whether it's a cat or some weird mysterious creature, you can have someone fight along side with you as you battle the odd looking dragons and other creatures that roam Block Story Land. Yeah, that's what I'm calling it. All of the NPCs look very awkward and they cut for some more clumsy textures.Lastly, the controls are TERRIBLE. There is a small tutorial in the beginning and is one of the worst tutorials I've ever encountered. They leave out some vital controls that may save your life in a dire situation. Whenever you walk, it feels like your head is bobbing all over the place and made me dizzy while playing the game.Those are my (Andrew's) First Impressions on Block Story's Early Access and it's not very good right now. I would say it's not worth the money but I am hoping for a better version of the game in the future. And yes, I have played the mobile version of Block Story before, and it wasn't a very great experience. At it's current state, I'd give it 4/10 at best.			"

												i'm sure this game would be a lot of fun if I could figure out the over complicated User Interface. I have no clue how to even use the Hot Bar. The Crafting is clunky but managable. The game seems to have a lot of content but I just can't bring myself to play it for more than an hour without getting frustrated at the Interface. I constantly ingite my torches just scrolling through my hotbar trying to select a tool or weapon. I have no clue how to feed my Dragon or really even what he does. Left click to attack/dig and Talk to NPCs and Interact with Doors or other Objects is quite annoying. At one point the Wizard told me to craft a Sword so I did, then I tried to talk to him and ended up attacking him and being killed. Seems like I was tricked into that one. It's also annoying that I can't see what a particular object in my INV is unless I actually click on it (no mousing over it). And moreso, You can't see the number of items in a stack when crafting. Say I have a stack of Sticks and a stack of Stone and I'm making a bunch of Pick Axes. You can drag one at a time or pick up a stack with right click then drop one at a time with left click, but you can't see how many you have left as you drop them into the crafting table. I hope you guys really streamline all of that stuff since you're now working with a superior medium (I played this game on IOS originally and it was clunky there but made more sense) I look forward to future updates.. I just hope they're not all content related and that you're working on a UI overhaul. Right now I wouldn't really recommend it due to how frustrating everything is to use. I'll be keeping an eye on this one though because this has the potential of being a great sandbox game but right now there are a lot of things that make it unplayable, in my opinion. Good luck!			"

Early Access Review
								Early Access, a term used to define a game being released in a early state so that the finishing touches can be completely with the help of the community.This game is no where near the promised finished product, it behaves more like an Alpha state than anything else. It makes a mockery of Early Access games that update frequently and stay in touch with the community on a daily/weekly basis such as 7 Days to Die, Don't Starve Together, Starbound, Plague Inc... Etc.For the first hour of the game, it was interesting seeing everything from a new eye. But I later came to realize that everything is quite... Lackluster and unpolished. The quests are plain and boring, crafting is a bit of a chore and not very clear, the graphics of the world itself make Minecraft look like the latest next gen game, and the leveling system is dull, clearly either the devs were going for a money grab with the pixal-block genre craze, or I'm missing something big.Over all, I DO NOT recommend this game to anyone out there, the dragons in this game is merely another way to get your interest in giving them your wallet.

Also: it is interesting to point out that only 16% of the players of this game have actually killed the first boss monster ...			"

												Block Story is a Minecraft knockoff, with more bugs than the underside of a mossy log. I gave it a try and I really just can't recommend it. The texture pack they used on Block Story, looks a lot like the High Def texture pack mod that can be downloaded for Minecraft. Parts of the world load so slowly that NPC's, and Animals look like they are floating in the air. The action bar only lets you hold a few things at a time, and the inventory space is smaller than Minecraft. I'm not entirely sure about the crafting catalogue as I didn't go that far into it, but what I have seen I was completely unimpressed with. Honestly folks, if you want to play a game like this, go with Minecraft. You can download Mods to add NPC's, or upgrade the textures, and you won't have as many bugs.			"

												The game has some good and bad. Overall it is very enjoyable.Great World generation. Varied biomes and many types of buildings.Easy to use crafting system and a ton of craftable items Bad enemy AI and placement. Most enemys can be beaten by just strafing. Enemys just appear out of nowhere. Sometimes a large enemy like a T-rex will spawn behind you and you will get instantly killed out of the blue. Not enough NPCs - there are about 4 total that have clones everywhere. This makes the World seem stagnant. There are empty houses and villages everywhere. So again, the World generation and crafting are strong but the character side is pretty bad. But I guess you could say the same thing about Minecraft really.			"

Early Access Review
								What would happen if you take the Minecraft world and throw in every Super-Awesome-Cool Stuff, that I can think of! That's probably what the developer of this game must've thought. I suppose you could create stuff in the game similar like in Minecraft but everything here just feels off. Obviously all the NPC's, dragons, other creatures... which are higher res, simply do not fit in the world. Besides that, the UI feels and probably IS like a casual game. Block Story has been in Early Access for almost a year now and there are almost no updates. It seems to me like this game is build in a hurry just to earn a quick buck, obviously without any love for games. After reading some of the other reviews I found out there's also (going to be?) microtransactions, which is just silly for a game like this, especially since the game is still 10 bucks, which is way too expensive. If you want a game like this, go get Minecraft for the same price. "

Early Access Review
								This is the main reason why I don't trust Early Access games anymore...Ok, we get that the game in incomplete. But Early Access SHOULD be used to make people test the game, while the updates are coming. It seems the developer doesn't understand this though. Its been MONTHS without even a single update. The game works, but it has SOO many issues, and so many things missing that where promised, that I just lost interest.Now the developer is inviting people for a CLOSED BETA TEST. So... isn't this Early Access? Aren't we paying to test the game already? Why doesn't he release updates so that everyone who paid got this can test it?The way the game is, its almost unplayable. Early Access games are usually buggy and incomplete, but we at least get updates from time to time. In here, we don't even have that!As for the game itself, its a clone of Minecraft, but with some new ideas. It features RPG elements, quests and a more complex system. Its a good idea, really, but the execution is, at the moment, horrible. The quests are lame, and usually not fun to do. The construction aspect isn't as fun as Minecraft, and the RPG elements need a WAY better implementation. I don't recommend this game as it is. Its one of the most incomplete and nonfunctional EA games I've ever seen, and the lack of updates made me doubt the developers are even taking this game seriously.EDIT: I'm not gonna change this review based on the Beta patch, because I'm gonna wait until the game is finally released. But I should just add that the game WILL HAVE MICROTRANSACTIONS.			"

Early Access Review
								I just bought the game, and am very unsatisfied with it already. ;( I want to like this game so badly, but I just can't, I even voted for it to get Greenlighted ages ago. My first gripe, is that when I encounter a hill, the char takes more time then nessasary to negotiate going up a simple block automatically. If you try jumping it to negate the clunky control, you either jump short and have to rely on the automatic manuvering, or both imputs are being considered and it's still slow as heck moving up a block. Secondly, the crafting window. Kinda cool how to craft you have to make the materials resemble the shape of the tool(i.e for a pickaxe, take wood and stone to make a ""t"" shape, Terriara did this too in the beginning) but making stacks of material and moving them around are a pain! It took me multiple clicks to get the game to recongnize that I was trying to pick up items to move around in my inventory. And then, either I picked up the whole stack, or none at all!! I tried playing on a different computer, thinking that maybe it was my mouse/keyboard, but still the same issue.Thirdly, my char must have some weird aversion to water, because I always get stuck in it somehow, and die from lack of oxygen. Additionly, one positive thing I have to say about the game is the amount of detail they put into the mobs,npcs and sky. With that being said, the difference between thoes elements and even just the landscapes are HUGE. For the first time in my 20 odd years of gaming, just looking at the game gave me a headache(I know that is entirely subjective). Comared from looking at the sky( HD metor showers!=D) and then focusing back to the landscape is so jarring due to what looks like a child picking colors. The grass blocks are bright puke green with little texture, the sand is just tan blocks of blah-ness, and the water blocks are so very transparent with a extremely light blue hue. At night there are many random patches of bright electric purple and green that it's a hard on the eyes(and I play with lights on in my computer room) too. Speaking of NPCs, talking to each and every one is a slight variation of ""go kill 20 mobs and bring back the spoils"". Nope, no thank you half naked dude. I had trouble with the first mission of collecting wood from ""trees"". The reason why I put trees in quotations is that once you harvest the blocks from it, most will not be accepted by the NPC. The harvested block title has to just wood, not anything else. For whatever reason, I found a lot of palm wood and various other types, and the NPC wasn't having any of it. Having trees drop normal wood isn't a hard concept is it?! And lastly, I can glitch through blocks and see for a good distance, but with no texture at all, just basic colors. I understand that at this point it's an early access game, and the devs need players input, but dang, one would think that a game would be more polished when relased to the public.I have little hope for the refund from Steam for the money I spent on this game.

												Fairly decent 7.5/10Using the minecraft Template and trying to build on it, creative envirnments and itemsI've bought the game for mobile back pretty early in development and I got to see it grow, and since i bought the android version i emailed the developer and asked for the steam version since i didn't wanna buy it twice and he emailed me a key. long story short like 3 emails of keys turned up used but eventually I got one that worked which was nice since he was patient enough enough with mebut the environments creative, the random worlds are almost never alike in any way, and it's engaging to say te least.I just feel the world is TOO random and the fact that NPC's spawn from blocks doesnt help either, thou you can grind those enemies using other NPC's when you're low level, so there's that, and since you dont lose stuff on death, it encourages exploration.

Early Access Review
								This game is very awesome, having decent graphics for a block style game, not to add an rpg element, a quest system etc...The game however has some issues (earthquakes can make you suffocate in walls, crafting is slightly difficult, hard to impossible to get texture packs, worlds etc. This game also needs a lot more blocks, more tools, a larger variety of weapons, and possible a different way then spawners to spawn creatures. Other then that the game runs extremely smoothly even on max graphics (because its a mobile game fashioned to run on pc later), has a lot of weapons and even more mobs. The feel of adventure is insanely good and once you get started you cant stop playing. The main problem with this game is that updates are no longer being released on the steam version it seems.That could possibly be because of a huge update but thats unlikely because the other game versions not on steam are updating fine. If you are gonna get this game, do not buy the steam version because it has a high price for less game. Go get the mobile version for $5 which has updates every couple weeks, or if that isn't possible get the pc version that they actiually update from their website.  I give this game a 6/10 (7/10 for the mobile game, it updates a lot more) and higher if more things were added.			"

												A Minecraft clone focused more on the exploration than on the mere building; there are over a hundred of recipes, spacing from iron pickaxes to rocket launchers, all respecting the lore (when you'll get a rocket launcher you will have found out a reason for it to be in a fantasy-like world).The world is populated by dozens of different creatures: from birds to spiders, sharks, snakes, featuring creatures such as dragons or the epic Tirannosaurus Rex as minibosses.The recipes are contained in a handy book we can reach whenever we open the craft menu, and while we will unlock most of the fancy recipes (such as boats, advanced armors, magic weapons and more), we also start with a wide variety of recipes that will sure keep us busy for quite a while to find the materials to craft them.Furhtermore, the game is RPG-oriented, so the character gains experience, and therefore levels, when we kill monsters or solve quests given by random NPCs; when we gain a level we can upgrade one of many characteristics, from health to mana, to the flying speed, the amount of time we can hold our breath underwater, the damage we do with bows, swords, magic weapons, mining speed and more.While the graphic is outdated, the sound department is more than satisfactory, featuring plenty of different sounds and a good soundtrack used parsimoniously enough to don't become annoying and repetitive.The developers are also actively updating the game to fix bugs, polish what's already here and add new content.You will also hear about this game having microtransactions, and while it's true, they add nothing to the game, and merely speed it up for those who don't have time to actually play the game. To give you an idea: every day you log in you earn 50 Diamonds (which can be found in game or bought for real money), if you log in 5 days in a row, the 5th day you earn 500 diamonds instead of 50, so you get 700 diamonds by merely logging in 5 days in a row and not playing the game; follows a screenshot where you can see the prices of this in-game currency. Personally, I've never even had the need of using diamonds, as the game scales so smoothly that diamonds do actually push you through the game as a sort of cheat, if you allow me the comparison. I'd like to point out how I got my Steam copy free of charge, providing the developers proof that I had previously purchased the game through a bundle, where I got a Desura cd-key; I e-mailed them proof of ownership and I got a key to redeem the game on Steam. I can't help but tell you that I'm pleased by the attitude of these people: they surely know how to treat their customers/player base, in my humble opinion.

Early Access Review
								Although this game is a game of the type similar to a MineCraft, it has the point that many are different. As what is not in a mine craft first, it is a many NPC, Qwest which receives from them, and concept of character strengthening by existence of a level and skill. These have given the element as RPG strongly to this game. Moreover, it is raised as a unique point that a monster does not occur spontaneously. They are born only in a place with each Spawn block. The Spawn block is generated at random according to geographical feature with specific each. When that a monster attacks suddenly has led to few [ very ] things and it glances at this, it may be a point which is not like RPG at all. However, in some RPG which continues from ancient times, it is advanced at its pace, and a monster does not appear by any means in areas where safety was ensured certainly, such as a town or a castle. Moreover, the mine craft never felt let down and I thought that it was a very unsettled game. In that respect, this game can be played comparatively leisurely. Probably, there are many people who feel it the same besides me. Next, I will raise the thing which is in a mine craft and is not in a block story. It is restriction of height or the depth, and restriction of the number of stacks of an item. When these restrictions do not exist, a building as imagined can be made being unconscious of the inconvenience currently felt by the mine craft at all. It finishes dyeing sand and glass, and the original color block which was rich in the variation can also be made, so that he is surprised. Since there is no monster expression if the Spawn block is not placed, he does not need to be conscious of the thing of a light. It was just the game which I desired. From now on, a recipe, a monster, and Qwest will be added, and it desires to become more pleasant.			"

								----------------EDIT------------------------------After keeping my hopes up for years, this game refuses to update and appears to be a shameful money grab from the developers. It's a shame because the game had so much potential.I would like to point out that I am not changing my review from a yes to a no because, although it has been turned into a shameful money grab - it is still a pretty decent game. I would still recommend this game, but not for this price and I would recommend it as if it is a complete and finished game, it is likely that it will never be updated.. I would not suggest buying it if you expect it to get updated. If you like the product as it is - go for it!Thanks.----------------END EDIT-----------------------Love it! (played it on android before pc)Good points about this game:     * well done graphics engine, runs at 700fps on a nvidia 660 ti, and even when rendering 3d in cinema 4d, it runs @ 100fps    * ambient music, based on the current situation really increases your game play experience.    * plenty of content, supplies near endless hours of gameplay.    * well done first person view, bobing makes you feel like you are really in the game.    * very hard to star up in game, makes it more of a challenge to play, personally this make the game play more enjoyable.    * tons more...Things that could use improvement in this game:    * water physics, water does not drain (or atleast it does not appear so)    * native controller support, it does not seam to support joy sticks on xbox remotes.    * memory usage is ok, but the cpu usage is a little bit out of hand.    * general polishing.    * lack of multiplayerAll in all its a great game, supplies hours of fun, and has a ton of potential :DTLDR: Great game, buy it now.

												Block Story is a great sandbox game that is worth the price it's asking for. Pros:*Over 90 different creatures*7 bosses*You can ride 29 creatures including Dragons!*Large verity of weapons including, swords, bow and arrows, magic staffs, and a pistol*The ability to raise pets and dragons and watch them grow and get stronger *Over 100 quests *Infinite height (up and down)*Lots of structures*Great terrain design*Advanced, but simple, crafting*The developers listen to their feedbackCons:*No Multiplayer*AI can be dumb at times*Not a very active communitySo, you're probably wondering why this game has mixed reviews. Back when this game was first released, there wasn't that much to do, it was in early access, the game had microtransactions, and originally the price was $10. The developers did listen to the complaints, and removed the microtransactions, lowered the price, and added lots of requested features that the players have been asking for. In my eyes this game is well worth the $2.99			"

								This game is basically just another Minecraft rip-off game with RPG elements. You play as a guy with magic flying powers in a land where the enemies are actual 3D models that look like they were ripped from an old medieval fantasy game with poor sound quality and awkward timing for music that only plays for 5 seconds. The only difference is you can have multiple characters that carry over their inventory to other worlds like Terraria.The first thing I would absolutely LOVE to point out is this game is a mobile port. The first sign that it is a♥♥♥♥♥♥game. Second, I've been following this game for a couple years now, waiting for an update, but it never came, or so I thought. The updates did come out, but only for the MOBILE version. They haven't kept the PC version up to date at all! There are features being shown off on the dev's YouTube channel that came out on mobile devices that just aren't there for PC.Second, the controls are horrendous, due to being a mobile port, optimized for touch screens. Going from touch screen to a mouse and keyboard makes it really hard to move around in your inventory, proving difficult to grab only one of an item in a stack or seperate the stack in half.Third, the way they went about mob spawning is really stupid. They spawn on/near a specific block, rather than having the mob spawn randomly throughout the world or in certain biomes. It's also REALLY hard to find the specific mob you need to kill sometimes, so you actually need to check the forums for a seed to find that specific mob or NPC to give you that required quest.Fourth, the crafting is revolting. Combined with the horrible controls, in order to craft armor and shields, you need to gather a boat load of ingredients to put into one square, just to craft something that goes away after a few hits. You know all that time you spent killing horses for their hide to make that stupid goblin armor? Well, it just got wrecked after that bat bit your arm!FINALLY, these devs are kind of nice people, but they put it all to shame with their empty promises. I have had this game for around a year and a half and have waited and waited for an update that never came. This is absolutely unacceptable, even for an early access game. They have said the game will recieve an update, but they haven't released even a bug fix. It also seems to me that they may have abandoned this game completely because recently on January 12, 2015, they released a video on YouTube about ANOTHER game they are working on. All my hope for this game has completely died.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to find my gun...			"

The game has a lot of to develop in the future. Did I tell you the game is also a mobile app on some mobile phones? I have a lot of suggestions towards the game, but I love it. *Main Suggestion*My suggestion is to add multiplayer, because the game can get boring when it's time for me to stop building, and finish a numerous of quests, but playing with another person absolutely makes it more fun!

								Back then, the game was good since it didn't have over P2P content, smelting /furnace mechanics (So you had to gain the ores and instnatly use them in tools. Like terraria). And seemed much more ""free"" to me.It was worth 15 dollars, honestly.Now it's the definition of trash, P2W mechanics, sorta bad storyline, and there are no spawners everywhere, meaning you have to face intense grinding torture where you have to go everywhere and wittle enemies with toothpicks to just get them to turn into a spawner.Not to mention, back then it was alot more better with the mechanics, the durability system was much better since it was unique; no green bar, but just that you had to craft a certain amount of the item and that would be its ""durability"".  It was pretty ""spawner based"", meaning you can alter what mobs spawn in an area and what don't.Now you have to have random things spawn in your house at times, pay to skip smelting too.Back when it didn't have the phone mechanics, like paying for stuff, was when it was the best.

I probly have 80-100hrs maby more,in this game.I see only a few reviews of people giving less than THUMBS UP"" after 1 hr or so this might be an indacation that they may not know much about this game Unless like me they have alot more hours in game play on eather Desura or other devices. Purchased this game early, because it was only available on Desura. I have 4 worlds and I have my android. this game has a lot to offer.""BIG SPOILER"" (Do NOT read if you dont want know any of what there is to do in Block Story) Here is a few: Unique colors in landscape, questing/RPG, crafting, If thats not enough you also have exploring, 1st main world where you start amasing at night. 2nd there is a underworld that goes on so far there might not be an end youll have ck out for your self. 3rd a under water world with lot to do. after all that there is floting Islands and more to do up there but I havent done much up there yet. Then lets not forget there is cross platform, you can play on Android phone when not at your pc. With all this and much more. Maby you should ask yourself how could somone really make a comment without having played more than about an hr Oppinon yes guess its not for everyone. We steam gammers voted greenlight.I would think A BIG BIG YES THUMBS UP.			"

								Great game. The development team is nice and very helpful. The creatures are interesting and the quests are fun. It has leveling up like a classic rpg. Can't wait for multiplayer. Good game for those who like to build, mine, and fight. Its a nice casual game. Also, if you got this through Detura or their website, email Ron at their support for help. He gave me a Steam Key. Thanks Ron!			"

												stay away. stay far away. TO elaborate -the game wll occasionaly cause you to bounce up and down uncontrollably, causing sickness and giving me a headache. The options menu is basic but not too terrible.Creative mode doesnt allow you to craft everything or spawn everything, the combat is even WORSE than minecrafts, which is saying something, everything is slow, clunky, dull and unlikeable. This game wouldn't even be worth the asking price if it was FREE			"

												I wanted to love this game; I'm a big Minecraft fan, and the RPG elements, better-looking mobs, and various other elements really appealed to me. However, I couldn't play it for more than 20 minutes without becoming frustrated with the buggy tutorial system, broken quests, and general lack of polish on what I believe is a finished product. I wish I loved it, and maybe I'll give it another go at some point. Were it not $2.99, I would return it for a refund; however, three bucks isn't bad for something I may eventually get some enjoyment out of.			"

								Well after just shy of 30 hours I am now done with all the quests in Block Story.  That's actually a pretty reasonable amount of gameplay for a game now a days.  I am hoping more quests start coming up with more variety and more craftables.   I have to say this is a pretty good game.  I never was able to get into it on my phone, but playing the Steam version was a very new experience.  Yes, the quests are repetitive, yes, there are similarities in Minecraft.  (Though I would argue Minecract is about the creation and not the gameplay.)  But, where Minecraft bored me in a few hours, this game kept me occupied until I completed the quests.  I'm hoping there's more to come.  Especially if the modding community is able to start making quests and items.  I have enjoyed the worlds and textures that the community has put out so far and feel that it portends good things for the future.			"

												THIS IS A FIRST IMPRESSIONS REVIEWI got this game for free. I wouldn't have bought it if I didn't get it for free.Well, to begin with, this is just another Minecraft clone. Buggy, unoriginal, uninspired and greedy.I'm not opposed to microtransactions, but here it feels way to forced. You open a menu or begin a quest and you can buy the item right away. That loses the fun of the game, where you have to keep playing to obtain things.Graphically, it's really inconsistent. Some textures are good, some bad. The design of the enemies is just aweful. Props for trying to be a more mature game than Minecraft, but it just isn't enough.The game feels cheap right from the start. If I had bought it I'd be downright dissapointed.I think that Steam's Greenlight is giving way to some awesome games, but not in this case, trying to be a money making machine with microtransactions rather than a game.Bottom line: I do NOT recommend it.

Not as good as it use to be. I realized my review could be more helpful: Unnecessary Barriers:I go to the creative spawn menu. I'm looking for the saddle. I can't find it. I later find out it's in the store menu; I have to buy it despite being in creativity mode. Not only do I have to buy it, but my money is also limited which means I can't just obtain a ton of them. Not only am I limited by my money, the saddle wears in durability whenever it is used and eventually breaks. So to keep using saddles, I would have to figure out how to obtain money which moist likely means going out of my way to do quests, challenges, or trading. In the end, I'm still in creative modeI'm in creative mode, but some items are restricted from the creative spawn menu... Why? Why restrict the creative player?At least we don't have to use real (out-of-game) currency. "

												Block story is gud, git gud nubs.Seriously, unlike minecraft and other sandboxes, it actually has lots of objectives which makes you play the game for a long time and objectives are the reason why I play video games, sure you can say minecraft has achievements like defeating the enderdragon, killing the wither or even downloading mods to experience more, but what happens when you finish all of that? Is it really worth the time playing a game with a repetetive playstyle? That's why I like Block story, it's addicting and has a intense, interesting, long and worthplaying experience and game.Also 1t h@s dragons, me l1ck dragons.			"

												Honestly, at first it seemed like a minecraft rip off, but as I tried it out, I realized it was more than that. There is so much to do in this game, not to mention the awesome weapon designs. You can of course build your house or a castle (or anythng), craft cool and unique types of weapons and tools, explore so many biomes such as the underwater ocean buildings or the space islands. I did not forget, you also can fight lots and lots of enemies, and even bosses. Although the attack animations aren't the best, the graphics are pretty darn good. This game is for you if you like medieval/minecraft.			"

												First off since there is no Neutral option I'm giving this game a tentative recommendation.I originally bought this game through Desura before and was able to get a steam key from the Dev since they had abandoned Desura as a platform. Which I thank them for. As for them Abandoning the platform, it is understandable, since they have stated they have not got any sales through Desura in a long time. Some people might complain but Desura itself has turned into a burning wreck, and I personally no longer buy games through it, so it's smart.As for the game itself, like I said I give it a tentative recommendation. It's not the best game in the world by far. Yet for it's $2.99 price tag it's not a bad game. Building wise it fall behind minecraft and other games, but RPG wise it far ahead of them. And it's system requirements are fairly low. For it's price tag I'd say it's an okay buy if you looking for more RPG aspects then building aspects.			"

												This game has no mouse sensitivity slider and no option to turn off the annoying music. There somehow has, just HAS to be a very good reason for this or I am stupidly blind or just plain stupid, you would think..And this says a lot about the gameplay... such a waste of time and nerves. I literally got frustrated in the first minutes of playing, and the gameplay didn't even come close to being worth frustratingly switching between sensitivitys while doing basic tasks. What would a person who doesn't have a manual switch for different sensitivity profiles even do? What an annoying, amateur soundtrack as well.If I am just stupid and someone can prove me wrong, this game will still get a negative review because stupid people want to play games too.			"

								The game so far has nothing interesting. Most textures are stolen from something else or just look plain bad. The gameplay is lacking and unoriginal at best, considering how many are attempting voxel-based sandboxes, this game's a disgrace, absolutely horrendous. Its only unique features are horribly implimented and some are just ridiculous and frankly, stupid. 1.5/10. Nothing is as dynamic as described.			"

								Painful. Went in depth to the core of the game, within 5 minutes it was bugged in creative mode with equipment and items. Began exploring regardless. That hurt. Repeated layer upon layer of the same layout -2500 blocks into the ground. Needs alot of improvement. Hope to see some patches and a large overhaul for the purchase of this game.			"

								Great on Android, same experience on PC.The Dropbox sync is great for continuing from right where I left off. Not to mention, Dropbox is great for backing up my worlds.From my experience with Minecraft, I can say I like this better. While the community is insane for Minecraft, there are things I like about this better.I play almost exclusively in create mode. I've found that placing blocks is a lot more flexible than Minecraft. This results in building structures that much faster. I can do things in hours that might take days in Minecraft. What needs to happen:This game has seen too little support. For an early access game, there needs to be frequent updates and additions. There needs to be more variety in blocks and furniture. Really, what the game needs is more content. I've hardly played Story mode, spending most of my time in create mode. The game does not seem to be optimized for PC, performing better on my tablet than even my PC. I have 8GB of RAM and still have to play on very low horizontal/vertical load to reduce impact on memory.I believe this game makes creation simpler than even Minecraft, among others, but needs some attention.

								If you have never player MindCraft before, this is a reasonable copy (up to a point). At first glance the graphics, AI of enemies and the story seem to be an improvement. However after a few more hours play, you realise there are far more limitations. Mindcraft is all about encouraging creativity. But the combinations of possibilities in this game are very disappointing. I am middle aged and tried mindcraft a couple of years ago just to see what it was about. I got hooked because of the games deceptive simplicity, but I have to say with no story/quests, mindcraft was ultimately pointless, except for the challenge of creating wondrous constructions. By comparison, Block Story has quests that are tedious (like going back 20 years in expectations). Characters and monsters (graphics at least 10 years old). Worst of all is the lack of array of blocks and tools you can combine. There also seems to be a many differences on the android version, but to be honest, that is not much better. If you want a mindcraft experience, try Mindcraft. If you want questing RPG, there are so many options now available. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS.			"

								imagine minecraft with lord of the rings kinda u have tons of blocks and candles, teleporters, magic etc...... there are a few villages with people who give qeusts and there are mobs all over the world good and bad. Good as in rangers and elfves and bad as in dragons and trolls. there are 8 different planets to explore. over all i love it is an exellent game. The only bug i have found is deleting items from my inventory i have to just spam click it to other items to delete it and well thats about it very fun game i would get it. Its about $8 right now. Ohh did i mention Smeagles ""precious is in it"" :D			"
