												FINAL UPDATE: May 27, 2015WARNING: A new ""HD version"" of this game titled Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin has been released. It is an entirely separate game and includes all DLC content. Most importantly, this ""old"" version (released May, 2014) DOES NOT update to the new version, which is sold separately.Exclusive to the new version are re-mastered encounters, additional multiplayer slots, new invasion NPC with new items, improved enemy AI, and graphical updates not available in this ""old"" version of the game. Furthermore, the two versions of the game are NOT compatible with each-other for online play, nor are saves transferable between games.A recent patch to prepare for the new re-release added changes to soul memory, a couple new items, and other tweaks to the ""old"" version of the game. The patch does not and will not contain the exclusive enhancements of the new version. If you want the exclusive content listed above, you will need to purchase the new version of the game.Therefore, it is my recommendation you avoid purchasing this ""old"" version for PC, as the new version is currently available. I also strongly encourage you to scrutinize the business practices exercised by the developer and publisher of this game; we are being sold the same game again with minor, though desirable improvements.

												From Software has announced a new ""HD"" edition for 2015, but most of it's features and all patch support will be moved over to the ""next-gen"" DX11. The two versions are not character compatible; people playing on the current DX9 version will not be able to play with those on DX11 and any characters created on DX9 (the current version) cannot be transfered to DX11. There is a fair $20 discount for people who already own this version of the game or a $30 discount if you own the DLC too.For those who have yet to buy Dark Souls II, don't bother buying this as Scholar of the First Sin will be out in April and feature continued patch support, new content, improved multiplayer, and even more DLC.

												Don't buy this game. Namco has decided that they are going to release an upgraded version of this game that runs on DX11 in April next year with visuals that were advertised for the first version but were cut out, while everyone who has this version will be stuck with DX9. These versions will use different servers, and the new version will include the DLC for free. Everyone who has already bought this version of the game has officially been screwed over, and if you bought the DLC you are even more screwed over.♥♥♥♥ you, Namco.Update: The cashgrab is out. General consensus from people who aren't morons with lodsofemone just lying around is that it's not worth upgrading to, unless you don't already have this version of the game.I ain't paying twenty buckaroos for crap that should have been in the game in the first place.

												Dark souls 2 is like being married to a woman who is attractive and charming and funny and intelligent, and you are soulmates and everything is perfect, right? She is the perfect woman, you could not ask for a more better woman in the world. you love her, and she loves you. Only she has one flaw, Every 5 minute, she punches you in the face... For no reason, she just punches you in the face every 5 minutes. Even at night you wake up, She punches you in the face, you recover, get 4 minutes 38 seconds of sleep, then she punches you in the face again, and you love her.			"

												You probably won't like this game. You will die, your ego will be crushed, your soul exhausted, and you will inevitably fail at every turn. Yet somehow in those moments when you do succeed, learning from every agonizing death, it is one of the most triumphant feelings in the world. Those heart-pounding moments where you narrowly dodge a towering giant monster's killing blow and swiftly strike at him with your last ounce of stamina, bringing him to his knees and finally overcoming him... are the most rewarding moments you will ever experience in gaming. But to get there, prepare to die. A lot.About the game:Dark Souls 2, like Dark Souls, is a 3rd person RPG set in a fantasy world filled with nasty beasts that are much more powerful than you. Bosses are even more powerful, and require gaining knowledge through fighting them (and dying a lot). Think MMO raid bosses, except here you're on your own.The combat is the shining star of the game. Every enemy has their own movement patterns and attacking styles, which turns every enemy into a sparring match and a mental game of chess against the AI (which is impressively brutal). Learning enemy attack patterns is the key to succeeding (bosses included), and boss fights in particular challenge you to try new techniques.Your stats can be upgraded throughout the game and you will grow stronger. The armor and weapons you find can be upgraded as well in order to customize your character to your fighting style. Want to me a nimble rogue that dual wields daggers? A sorcerer in cloth armor that attacks with spells from a distance? A heavy armored knight with a tower shield and giant axe? You can build your character to be any of these, or any combination of these.The bottom line is that this isn't a game that anyone can pick up and enjoy. This is an extremely difficult game that is made for patient people who enjoy complex stat systems, experimenting with different play styles, and adapting to the challenges that the game throws at you. If you can handle it, Dark Souls 2 is a masterpiece that should be experienced by anyone who calls themselves a gamer. Getting through it, on the other hand, will test you in ways you haven't been tested before. You have been warned.Keep Calm and Praise the Sun.			"

												Welp it pains me to say this, do not buy this game. Now let me just say that i bought both and pre ordered the collector's edition and season pass and i honeslty think this is the best game of the year. Since day 1 I've poured 100's of hours into this i have such a blast playing this game that no other game compares and if it werent for the current situation i would tell everyone to go buy this game now.But heres the thing yesterday, they came out a trailer for Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin which at first glance seems like a game of the year edition of the game.  but unlike other GOTY games it dosent just include the game and all of the dlcs it includes content thats EXCLUSIVE to this new version of the game. the rundown is this :Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin will include the three previously released DLC packs - Crown of the Sunken King, Crown of the Old Iron King, and Crown of the ivory King - along with additional features.All versions of the game will include the following features (Existing Dark Souls II owners will receive a patch to implement these elements):Additional NPCs added for an enhanced story experience. Parameter adjustments for improved game balance. Augmented item descriptions. Improved online matchmaking functionality.Xbox One, PS4, and DirectX 11 versions of the game will include the following features (in addition to those listed above):Additional upgrades to graphics, sound, performance. Increase in maximum online players in single session (6 total).the other thing thats not mentioned here is that dx9 and dx11 versions will be on  SEPARATE SERVERS on pc which means people who own one version wont be able to play with the other. Ultimately splitting the community.Now heres the question thats comes to mind, what will come of the current owners of the game? the people who supported your game day 1 are you going to honeslty make those people who bought your game  and season pass buy it ALL over again? is this a joke? even if they offer some sort of discount its still extremely scumy regardless of how you look at it. The game is not even a year old let alone how long the dlcs came out. Talking about how the PC is thier lead development yet they downgraded the PC version because of the ps3 and xbox 360 versions of the game then making people pay more because of them making it on ps4 and xbox one when they should have had dx11 on release for free on PC.If you see this game on sale dont buy it you are getting a gimped version. i would go as far as saying dont get Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin too if it goes down the way its looking now. Why? because you are supporting something evil for the future of gaming. I love this game and i honeslty think its one of the best games i played in years but really its not worth it enough to give in into something thats such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. No game ever is. save your money don't give in.also if they offer the new content for free i will change this into a positive review and why i think its a very good game even if it has its flaws but untill then i will keep it the way it is now.

												Let's be clear. I love this game. But, if you buy this game now, you are only buying it to play a less complete version of the game four months early. In four months this game is going to receive a rerelease on PC that is differentiated as the ""DX11"" version. This version will match the next-gen console rerelease and will have new features that are introduced with those versions.Please wait. Your time (and money) is better spent building memories with a polished version of this game. Rather than a version that reeks of being thrown out the door in time for the end of the previous console generation.			"

												EDIT3: Looks like crashing and hdmi issues have been fixed with a new patch today. I will leave the edit in but will move it to the bottom.\I put 100 hours into the xbox version before waiting for pc to come out. The game is real good. I am biased though since I put over 700 hours collectively into the first.The game is very similar combat wise, however the flow and focus is slightly different about this game.  The game starts you off with the ability to go 3 directions and any of the paths will lead you to something you need to get to. Eventually the game get's more linear toward the end, almost the opposite of Dark Souls 1, which started somewhat linear and branched out at the end.  Other changes include the upgrade system, which has been streamlined, however I find it way more intuitive than the old system. Any normal weapon can be upgraded to +10, as long as you have the titanite.  Midgame, you find an ember which lets you imbue a weapon at any upgrade level to different paths including magic, fire, lightning, dark, poison, bleed, etc.Another big change is how bonfires and enemy respawns work.  You can now fast travel from any bonfire, and in the main hub you can level up from a woman similar to the first game, Demon's Souls.  Also, enemies now stop respawning after ~15 kills, and can be restored using a bonfire ascetic which kicks the area's difficulty up to NG+.  More positive things include the way duel wielding works, as well as bows being more viable.The first 2 Soul's games each had their own problems, and for each problem fixed in this, a new problem was introduced.  In this, the world is more like Demon's Souls in that it is not connected, it is linear paths branching out.  However unlike Demon's Souls, it hardly loops around and provides shortcuts.  Instead bonfire placement is very common which is somewhat lazy level design.  Some of the environment details are missing as well.  The scenery can look very ugly in some places.Boss design and boss music is also slightly lazy. Most are good bosses but a lot are just guy's in armor with greatswords.  There are less interesting fights than Demon's Souls and less memorable fights Than Dark Souls.  This also goes for enemy design.  The music is also very samey for most fights.Overall, I think it is on par with the other 2 games, and which you like more will depend on if you like better gameplay or better world building.PROS:-The new upgrade systems is very nice.-More Dark Souls!-Some very good looking areas-Fun combat-Harder than the first game-Way more content-More fleshed out/less useless covenants-SERVERS!!!!NEUTRAL:-New healing system is a combination of the other 2 games, which some may not like (I don't)-Fast travel from the start-Soul memory (helps stop twinks but also makes it harder to connect to people)CONS:-Weird hitboxes-Lazier enemy, world, boss, npc, and environment design-Lack of the original lighting system-Music-Some areas look very uglyThe game is a pretty solid mix between the other games, and it is definitely on par with them.  Whichever you like more will just depend on what you value more, atmosphere and world, or gameplayEDIT:After putting some time into the pc version, gotta say it's real good. It's a solid port, and infinitely better than the first one.  It supports any resolution, and at least 60 hz (I don't have any higher), and there are a decent number of graphical options.  The game's mouse/keyboard controls are better, and are rebindable.  However, the game is still better with controller, and the xbox prompts are still there instead of keyboard buttons.  Also to those saying the game is easier, you may be better than when you played the original.  Also I found it ""harder"" even though I died less because they throw a bunch more enemies at once, and backstabs, parrying has been nerfed which makes dealing with crowds harder.EDIT2: Looks like people are having issues with crashing and other things.  I will warn people about this, however I have had no crashing other than when I downsampled which was my own fault.  I'm sure this will be fixed but you may want to hold off for a bit.  That said, my review still stands.			"

												Having played Dark Souls 2 on Xbox 360 and PS3, I can say that the PC version now is definitely an improvement graphically, running at 60FPS opposed to 30. The textures are a bit more crisp and the game feels a lot smoother. I strongly recommend using a controller though as the game still doesn't feel very keyboard/mouse friendly.It also seems like some people are unable to start the game and have been experiencing crashes. I haven't encountered either of these problems. If it helps, I'm running an I5 3570K, 16GB ram, and a GTX 560TI at 1920 x 1200 resolution.Now here's my original review of Dark Souls 2, if it's too long to read, I've made a video version for your convenience:

			Praise the sun! After a long three year wait, Dark Souls 2 is finally here. Prepare to die with Nathan in this in-depth review of Dark Souls 2.		

While the narrative still unfolds in the nuanced manner that characterized past Souls tales, players will notice Dark Souls 2 features a more refined story. There is still much to be left up to player's interpretations with many details to be found in item descriptions and conversations with the various denizens of Drangleic. Series veterans will find allusions to the first Dark Souls with many subtle tie-ins. As is customary in the Souls series, cut scenes are limited, mainly used to introduce the lethal bosses that players will encounter, thereby never interrupting the pace and flow of the game. Dark Souls 2 attempts to make itself a bit more accessible by offering an early tutorial section that walks players through its combat and mechanics. While this easy tutorial feels out of place, it is wholly optional allowing veterans to skip it. After a brief introduction, players are left to explore the world where they will encounter an old woman who enables them to utilize an in-depth character creator to customize their avatar and select a class. Like Dark Souls, class determines the players starting attributes, items and spells but has little influence in the long run since the flexible leveling system allows players to specialize however they wish.While Dark Souls 2 does try to draw players in by being a bit more accessible, it would be foolish to think that the series has gone soft in an effort to sell more copies. Drangleic is quite a bit more difficult and unforgiving than Lordran or Boletaria from Demon's Souls and those looking for a challenge will be more than satisfied. As someone who has personally beaten both Dark Souls and Demon's Souls numerous times, I'm not ashamed to say that I died on more than one occasion in Dark Souls 2. Deaths can feel a bit cheaper and sometimes unavoidable; but the game manages to get away with it by offering an unmatched sense of reward, compelling players to continue even after the most egregious deaths occur.Upon reaching Majula, which serves as the game's hub area, (similar to Demon's Souls Nexus) players are given minimal guidelines and are left to their own devices; being simply told to seek the king and gather four powerful souls. The NPCs you encounter in your travels will congregate in Majula offering goods and services for sale as well as other means of upgrading your character. You're also forced to level up in Majula, as the option to level at bonfires has been removed. On one hand, this might feel a bit tedious as you're faced with an extra load screen every time you want to level, on the other hand, this makes the game feel more structured, and having a constant safezone to visit allows for a much needed reprieve from the harsh world.Once players decide to leave Majula, they can tackle the available areas in any order they wish, though clever design choices ensure that players are on the intended path without feeling as though they’re sheep to be corralled by the game's level design. Unfortunately, while the world in Dark Souls 2 is larger than its predecessor, it suffers from a sprawling design that leaves it feeling less interconnected and forces players to be more reliant on the fast-travel system.  You won't find as many of the clever short cuts as there were in Lordran and as such, Dark Souls 2 provides players with the ability to fast travel from the onset. There are some positives that come from this design choice however, the larger world makes exploration more exhilarating and there is much greater variety in the game's areas. The secret areas and items are more obscure than ever and require plenty of searching to find. The combat is fundamentally unchanged but is far more refined. Changes to various weapons and equipment provide more viable play styles than ever before. Shields are far less powerful than they were in previous games making dodging and rolling more important as well as making the temptation to dual wield or two-hand a weapon all the more appealing. These changes wouldn't mean much without a cast of dangerous and disgusting enemies to test your sword and board or casting skills against. Fighting even the lowliest enemy involves a bit of strategy and care, while groups of enemies provide the greatest challenge. Torches have also been added which are held in your left hand in place of a shield. They can be lit by any bonfire helping illuminate your way through dangerous areas.  Lamps lit by your torch stay lit for the duration of the game, and certain enemies will react differently to light as well. The boss fights are more intense than ever. While a lot of the bosses felt similar in past games, each of them feels unique and different from one another in this installment. The optional bosses add another degree of difficulty as they’re quite a bit harder than the final boss of the game. New Game + has also been changed, typically in the other Souls titles, once you complete the game, you’re given the option to start all over where all of the enemies health and damage have been adjusted to provide a greater challenge. New Game + in Dark Souls 2 has all of this but also includes new enemies that cannot even be seen on the first playthrough. The inclusion of additional items and souls means that you’ll be playing Dark Souls 2 for a very long time. That combined with the fact that the world and game in general is quite a bit longer than the first, makes this all the more welcomed.  The average playthrough will run you around 60 hours, without including pvp and leveling the various covenants.The innovative multiplayer makes a return as well. You can once again leave and read messages, allowing you to interact with other players. You’re also able to summon players to aid you in difficult situations, as well as be invaded by enemy players. This is no longer limited to being a human, as you can be invaded by hostile players at anytime with the only safe spot being Majula. The art direction has been improved from the other Souls games, relying less on the gloomy interiors we're accustomed to as the environments offer greater variety and feel more distinct from one another. Some areas are absolutely stunning though the tech powering Dark Souls 2 is still rather disappointing. Textures can have horrendously low resolutions in some areas and some really poor tiling is noticeable on certain structures. We don't play Dark Souls for the graphics though.By improving on the near-flawless combat system, adding new playing styles, more variety, and tons of content Dark Souls 2 manages to improve the legacy of its predecessors despite its quirks. It manages to be even more difficult than its forbearers and the changes to New Game+ as well as the covenants add more re-playability than ever before. Dark Souls 2 is one of the best games I’ve played in years, and one that I strongly recommend.Pros+ Incredible Combat+ Caters to different playing styles+ Challenging Gameplay+ Tons of Content & Re-playability+ Unique Multiplayer Component+ Great Art Direction & SoundtrackCons- Graphics aren't on-par with 2014- Minor Bugs- Latency Issues can ruin PvP- World lacks the clever interconnected feel of Dark Souls 1			"

												Spent an hour making a decent looking character, then played for 10 minutes and died. I now play as a fabulous looking zombieEDIT: WTF this is helpful?Now I feel obligated to actually write about it.In short, its third person hacky slashy ouchy dodgy game, it’s unforgiving, but the difficulty curve is much easier than Dark Souls 1. While I do believe it took a few steps backwards from the previous game, it still is head and shoulders above most games.For the Newcomers:Welcome! The franchise is a very humbling experience for the newcomers; very quickly you'll learn that your top priority is keeping yourself alive. While this is common in video games as a whole, it’s especially true here. Everything in the game can kill you in a matter of seconds, and your health/life is a precious resource. Whenever you die, you drop all your currently held souls at your place of death, but also lose a bit of your maximum health bar, all the way down to half. There are ways to mitigate this of course, but it is always in your best interest to be safe.All that being said, the game does reward exploration, and the world is very densely designed with plenty to be found. Be sure to take a good look around the skyboxes whenever you change areas, as you'll usually be able to see places you'll eventually go or have been before. This all helps the game build a great sense of atmosphere.The combat is some of the most satisfying of any game I've played. Remember how a few sentences ago I was saying how enemies can kill you easily? Most of them are animated to look like it. Everything in the game feels powerful, the swings and sound with the moves give things a great sense of weight and power. Souls Games use a lock on system, where, with the push of a button, the camera will focus on a specific enemy, and your character will face them. This means your movements are relative to it, and while you have to fight multiple enemies at a time, the system is at home in 1v1-3 fights. With larger fights, it can spiral out of control and enemies can stun lock you to death if you miss your escape. The camera controls aren't perfect, and with some bosses, it’s easier to fight them without the being locked on, but they function fine for the most part. For the Souls Franchise VeteransMultiple design choices feel like a step backwards, the limited enemy respawns, many boss fights being large humanoids in armor, and lacking the world that Dark Souls 1 had. What I mean is that Dark Souls 1 had a world that was essentially continuous, when the map files are put together, everything is mostly to scale, with distances, like being able to see several late game areas from the first bonfire. Here, the world feels a bit less so, some blatant ones like the distance between Majula and The Tower of Flame are out of scale, but none as bad as the transition to Iron Keep. These can be forgiven though. Something that I won't forgive nearly as easily is the boss design. While some are well done, Many of the later bosses, are multiple enemies or a boss with a few smaller helpers. This gets incredibly frustrating if you're playing solo, thankfully, there are npc summons for a few, but for some of these fights, the only challenge is patience as you run around looking for an opening between boring bosses.Another thing of note is that the atmosphere feels much less dark than the previous game, and that NPCs will not leave Majula. One of the things I realize that I loved was the NPCs of the previous games had a lot more emphasis on the Character part of the acronym. While people would come and hang out at Firelink, they would eventually leave, and usually encountered later. It gave the sense that they had goals of their own, and by the end of the game, it’s empty and lonely, as you are the last one there. The Majula NPCs seem much more NPCs in a MMO sense, they're here to serve the player, and once they reach Majula, they won't evolve further. It comes to a head in one instance where a father and daughter are less than 10 meters from each other, but don't ever reunite. It doesn't so much build or develop their characters as it does make you want to drag one to the other. (Emit Force won't work). In my opinion, especially so as a fan of the multiplayer (Sunbro by day, Bellfag by night), the most jarring change is soul memory (hereafter noted as SM). The SM system determines multiplayer matchmaking on a tier system, counting every soul that your current character has collected, ever. This means that there isn’t much incentive to stay at soul level range for PVP, and can make trying to connect with friends, especially those that have been replaying an area they've been having trouble with, a bit of a hassle.None of these are really deal-breakers though, and more than anything who off how well designed the first game was. We do get legal respecing though, finally.A Final Note on HardwareSomething to note here is that the game was coded to be run in 30 frames/second. This means that with a PC running it faster, the change can be a bit drastic. While the game does look better, there are issues with some enemies being significantly faster, and some even able to land attacks as soon as their animation starts. There are also a few issues with hit detection/tracking of some bosses. But the most significant problems that arise are weapon durability and dodging. The game gives you a set amount of frames during your roll animation that you are invulnerable during, also known as iframes. With double the framerate and no compensation means that you're only invulnerable for half the time as on a console. This is annoying, but not too big an issue as most rolls are for spacing, but can be annoying. The other issue is weapon durability. Equipment in the game degrades with use, but is refreshed upon resting at a bonfire. With weapons, they take durability damage whenever they're used. If they hit a wall or the ground, they take a small flat amount, the same as with console versions. Against enemies though, they take damage based on the number of frames that they’re in the body, more so if the enemy is already dead. This isn't too bad for most areas, unless using a fragile weapon, but there are longer areas that you’d want a backup to fall back on.As for controls, the Mouse and Keyboard controls aren't great, though a big step up from Dark Souls 1. I'm currently playing without a controller, but I would recommend trying one with it, it makes the attack input a bit more precise than the defaults, and was clearly made with a controller in mind.If you have any questions, just leave it it in the comments below and I'll get to you as soon as I can.

In Drangleic you can just chill and do whatever and totally relax. ""Take it easy"" is the Dark Souls motto, for example, that's how laid back it is there. Show up if you want to have a good time.

												Do not buy this game.  If you purchase this DX9 version you're buying version of the game that is soon to be made obsolete.  Bamco is releasing a new version that will supplant the original.  When the DX11 version is released it will have separate servers:  splitting the PC community.  This is a disgustingly greedy cash grab by Bamco in an attempt to make people buy the same game twice in order to have the complete version.  No thanks.			"

												**1/30/16 update**   After the HUGE pushback from the community fromsoft decided to do what every other game deveoper has done and has patched in DX 11 support. I still cannot support this game cause you dont simply forgive someone for trying to scam you when they apologize later, but it is worth mentioning that one point of contention has been fixed.First and formost. I F###ING LOVE THIS GAME. Everything about the game itself is great. It's not as difficult as dark souls 1 but this is a souls game and you can make it as difficult as you wish through the games own mechanics (I.E Use less armor, a bonfire estetic, or a weaker/non upgraded weapon)However Namco Bandai and From Software have went all EA on us and decided the people who have already bought the game have no right to play the game's complete version. They are now pulling the single scummiest move of 2015 thus far and are re-releasing the game and charging owners of the original for content that has NO reason to not simply be patched in.From Soft has spent the last year rebalancing the game, redoing item and enemy placement to make the game more challanging and fun. They feel that it is ok to withhold this rework of the game and not simply patch it into the existing game. They want to charge you again for a product you have already purchased. This is completly unacceptable.Many people are complaining about the graphical update as well, this I honestly could not care less about. While it is true there is NO reason the game shouldnt have shipped with DirectX 11 support last year aside from making the rerelease that much more appealing further down the line, people who get upset over the graphical fidelity of a Souls game are missing the point of a souls game.I played and still continue to play this game quite a bit. The game is very solid, but its very clear that the game has been missing something the previous souls games have had, real challange. So now from has finally decided to fix this issue and provide their players with the challange they expect from a souls game, and the message im getting is they feel the players who have supported their game and company from the release of this game dont deserve a real souls game. If we want to play what should have been shipped a year ago, we must purchase the game all over again. No thanks.Alot of folks are claiming this is no different than a simple ""GOTY edition"" for this game. NO, not even close. The game has been drastically changed with the new edition, going as far as to split the playerbase into 2 pools for co-op and PVP. Every single aspect of the new version can and has been patched in. All the gameplay changes are 100% game code and a simple update would suffice. Even the new DirectX 11 API can be patched in no problem, hell even EA patched DX11 into Crysis 2, and we're talking about ♥♥♥♥ing EA here people... There is NO reason any of the new or changed content couldnt be added through simple patches. Think of an MMO and how quickly and drastically they change even without expansion packs. This is no different and Fromsoft/Namco do NOT deserve money for what has been common practice since the ability to patch was created.So Fromsoftware and Namco Bandai willingly released a ♥♥♥♥ poor version of their game, waited till everyone who would have bought the game paid for it, then doubled back and said ""Wait wait, DS2 sucked at launch, if you want the REAL game you need to buy it again"". This is EA and Ubisoft level BS (again EA has patched DirectX 11 into their games free of charge).I highly suggest you refrain from buying the new edition of the game, lest you send the message that crap like this is acceptable. I for one will now go out of my way to ensure Namco Bandai and FromSoftware never see another dime of my money. But if you need a souls fix I would suggest going for Dark Souls 1 or Demon's souls. Since not only are they superior games (Hidetaka Miyazaki the mind behind souls actually made these [had almost nothing to do with 2]), but you can also buy them used for ps3 or xbox and still ensure neither the developer or publisher gets revenue from the sale. You guys done F*&^%D up.			"

												Dark Souls™ Too is a spinoff of the critically aclaimed Dark Souls™ One. Like Dark Souls you play a  young man starting out his first year in High School only to find everyone hates you, everyone is bigger than you and your quest (life) is meaningless and you're only a tool to be manipulated. To survive high school you once again must embrace the ""Dark Soul"" by downloading illegal k0rn mp3s off kazaa and wearing dark clothing. Due to the actions of your now senior xxCh0senDeadboixx who became Dark Lord the dark is the most popular it's ever been making it uncool so you must set off on your own path to decide, do you want to sell out and embrace The Dark or light the flame of mediocrity.I give this game 9.9 Umbasas out of Ten.

												A new ""enhanced"" DX11 version has been released that should have just been a free patch, but wasn't.An already small community has been further fragmented by two different, seperate versions of the game, limiting one of the best features of the franchise, the multiplayer.And all for a game that doesn't even live up to it's predecessor.Dark Souls is my favourite game of all time, and probably always will be, but I can't recommend this ♥♥♥♥. Not when a company screws their loyal fans like this.Well played, FROM.			"

												If you're looking to complete the campaign mode of any Call of Duty game, I would first recommend playing this game to completion. Call of Duty games are notorious for having insanely hard boss fights, no hand holding on how to build your character, and no map markers to tell you where to go. Dark Souls II, on the other hand, is a very easy game, and serves as a great warm up to playing Call of Duty games.			"

												I'm just going to say it: Dark Souls II isn't necessarily a better game than the first Dark Souls, but that doesn't change the fact that this one is also one of my favorite games of all time. Let me try and explain:The first Dark Souls had one big open world, where all of the level segments were connected to each other in an ingenious way. Dark Souls II has more linear levels and, while you still have the ability to go anywhere you want, each level ends with a bonfire that returns you to the main hub. The levels themselves have multiple routes you can take so they aren't strictly linear. There are also more bonfires so you don't need to walk big parts tens of times without making any progress. And you can teleport freely between these which should save you at least a couple of hours of aimlessly walking around.More (mini-)bosses have also been added so there's more of a challenge this time around, but the bosses sometimes feel like they were copied straight from DS1. Also, some of them look extremely cool while others seem more generic and lack a bit of personality. This also goes for some of their movesets.How to upgrade weapons and gear and use certain items seems to have been simplified as well. I wasn't a big fan of the upgrade system of the first DS so having one NPC (or several, depending on what you want to do) to upgrade your entire gear is a nice addition. Upgrading your character and Estus Flask happens by talking to a lady near the bonfire in Manjula (your main hub). Not necessarily an improvement over upgrading by using a bonfire but it allows you to visit other NPCs as well, so you are always properly prepared before heading back into battle.Covenants were poorly explained in the previous game and while some things still aren't 100% clear in DS2 you definitely know what each covenant is supposed to do now.The addition of servers instead of relying on P2P connections is a HUGE improvement. In DS1 you sometimes had to wait 10 minutes or longer to find someone to summon, in DS2 it takes mere minutes. And there usually are more signs so summoning 2 people shouldn't be a problem at all. Helping other people out is also tons more fun because of this.And maybe it's because I'm more familiar with the DS games now, but DS2 seems shorter. Well, 'shorter'; the main story can be finished quicker is what I want to say really here. It took me 40 hours to complete, as opposed to the 55 hours of the first DS. If you want to explore and do everything you can definitely double that number. And then there's still New Game+, of course. Plenty of content here, no worries.I also want to talk a little bit about the PC port because we all know what happened with the first game. It was a mess visually, but thanks to DSFix it still managed to look good. The textures, detail and level design in DS1 were absolutely amazing. Thankfully, FromSoftware gave us a fantastic port this time. 60FPS (and it *never* drops), visual effects that can be enabled, disabled or adjusted and the level design, textures and detail are again all simply stunning here and pure eye candy, I normally don't like being limited to 30FPS (like DS1) but as long as it doesn't drop below that number I'm ok with it. But having 60FPS really makes a difference. It all feels very different, and still the same, if you know what I mean ?To wrap things up: DS2 has some excellent improvements over the first game but I do miss that huge Metroidvania-connected world (maybe a bit of both for DS3 ?). The port itself is wonderful and the gameplay is nothing short of brilliant, as long as you have the patience and dedication.I'm definitely starting a new game soon, so that's saying something. I'm not quite certain which one I like best, but I hope to know by the end of my second playthrough.[Rating: 92/100]			"

												A new version of Dark Souls 2, supporting DirectX 11, is probably into development right now, it will basically add some minor improvements to the game, more specifically new graphics, but will ruin the online experience and give an slap in the face of every owner and fan of this game.First, the developers never made a proper port for the PC version, if it was not for the ""fixes"" released by the modding community, both DSII and DS would be unplayable in the PC. The game was limited on PC due to console restrictions. Now they will be charging for the game again with graphics that many PC's could handle all along and on top of that, both PC versions wont be compatible therefore splitting the online community.﻿ Yes you heard that right;Its not only the ones who will stick with the old version that will be prejudiced, those who will bought the DX 11 version will too. Why? Because basically this stupid decision will split up the DS2 PC community/players in half, perhaps even making the ""better online matchmaking improvements"" useless since there will be way less players now anyway.Both versions of this game (this one and the future ""improved"" one) will be separated and if you own one of them, you wont be able to play with people that owns another version.Not to mention that, just for minor tweaks, if you already own this game you will have to buy it AGAIN. The same game, AGAIN, in order to be able to perhaps enjoy the multiplayer.If they released the new ""version"" as some sort of DLC, with a lower price, then fine, probably the majority of people would upgrade. But no, and the game is essencially the same.﻿Whatever if you own DSII or DS or even none of them by now, please denounce these developer/publisher practises.There are some links, as some suggested, explaining the matter.YouTube explanation:

The great Soul Famine has wiped out most all of Dragon Lake's inhabitants, leaving only the Chosen Shepard to wrest sovereignty and freedom from the Shamrock Shrew. In his shoes, you will battle through hordes of leprechauns and befreckled woolen sweaters in order to free the land and claim the true Protestant Throne from the errant and unexpected Pinky Toe of Piedus, Banríon Nasiobhán.

												Dark Souls II is a fantasy third person action RPG game, developed by From Software and published by Bandai Namco, releasing worldwide on PC, 360 and PS3 in April 2014. The story takes place in the grim fantasy world from the original game, Lordran. This time around you visit different areas and play as a new character.If you have been on the internet at all in the past few years you will already know what Dark Souls is known for, gruesomely hard unforgiving game play. The original game was probably one of the hardest games I have ever played which tested my skill not only as a gamer, but as a person. Whilst the game play mechanics in Dark Souls II are basically the same comparatively allowing the player in full control of building the character they want to play due to a different levelling system being incorporated. Of course the most important aspect of Dark Souls is the combat and again it is done very well. A lot of the regular mob fights are interesting and varied, you do come across a slight repetition issue when you find yourself being killed by the same monster over and over again but it gives you that little extra incentive to progress.  Boss fights throughout the game are all extremely well-tuned and designed encounters – I’d say the boss fights here are more memorable than the original’s purely because the scale and size of them is gigantic in some cases. Another really key element to Dark Souls game play would be the exploration of the game world which is essentially entirely open for you to explore right from the beginning of the game; whilst it may not be the wisest thing in the world to go exploring the later stages it is possible if you want to though. I was more inclined to go searching for treasure and loot this time around too; whether it was because I was completely enthralled with the armour and weapon designs that I wanted to keep finding more, or because of how well the maps are designed.  The game does very little to aid you by telling you where to go which leaves you in a rut sometimes. I have to admit I did resort to using a walkthrough and wiki throughout my play through; I know I know, I’m such a wimp – I honestly don’t think I would have been able to beat the game without it though, so for the purpose of this review I’ll take one for the team here! Graphically Dark Souls II has been improved over the original, I tried to find the official game engine being used online but even so long after its release I’ve not been able to find a reputable source of an answer but all you need to know is the game does look much better than the first. There are still a few textures which are low quality, but character models, animations and scenery all look gorgeous. The little voice acting that is available is done really well; almost too well – you can really feel the deprived thoughts of the characters in the game through their monotone and dull voices which I found to be quite an immersive factor. It was a little off putting when characters were quite obviously talking that their mouths weren’t moving through which was a shame to see from a game of this standard. I have to say I found the original Dark Souls to be more of a challenging game compared to II – I think the main factor behind this is the fact that the PC port for this game wasn’t completely broken compared to the first. The controls work right off the back which is always a good sign.  That being said boss fights are fundamentally easier though; with some mechanics more clearly than others on how to combat them, or maybe it’s because I finally “gitted gud” at Dark Souls. You can also tell how less of a challenge I found it, given that my first run through of Dark Souls II took almost half the amount of time than the original game, spanning just twenty one hours – remember that I had a wiki throughout the run so if you are going for a true experience you are easily going to be pushing the fifty hour mark. You’ll also get plenty of replay ability from this title due to a new game+ mode being introduced this time around.  There is also a much improved multiplayer side of the game too; one element of this is the ability to leave notes and hints around the game world for other players to see, as well as being able to see people’s recent deaths around you too which is always amusing to see someone run straight off a bridge; it never gets old regardless of how many times you watch it.  You’ll also get other players invading your game world which is…well, a different experience to say the least. Like I said above, this is a much better PC port of the game; there is already native controller support which is brilliant as the game is played waaaay better on a controller compared to a mouse and keyboard. Whilst there are limited graphical options, I was quite pleased to see that I was able to run the game at 4k resolution and on full graphics the whole time and I was able to remain at 60 FPS the whole time. This wasn’t even running SLI so it is an extremely well optimized release.  I did find it slightly annoying that I wasn’t able to turn off the online though, you are able to opt out of it on console in the options menu, but it seems to be constantly online for PC – you can get round it by launching Steam in offline mode, but I still want to be online on Steam, just not in game as it does get annoying when someone ten times higher level than you keeps invading your world to poke you up your bum with his massive sword time and time again. Right from the beginning of this game I actually found it to be a worse Dark Souls game compared to the original due to it not being overly challenging, but that being said I had more fun playing this game than the original; I know it probably doesn’t make sense but this felt more like a finished product that works off the shelf and I was able to finish the game to completion within a matter of a week and I enjoyed every minute of it. I would have like to see the price drop a little bit over the course of the past two years but you are still getting a game that is a joy to play from start to finish here. It is also worth noting that there is a different version of Dark Souls II, in the form of Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin – whilst this is an improved version of the game, both graphically and technically, the game’s worlds are also slightly different. This review is for the original Dark Souls II release.

												4/5: A good game that mechanically is better than DS1, but design/lore wise is much weaker. If you like the genre just buy it.It is kind of like L4D1 vs L4D2 for me.L4D1 had a very clear focus on the coop campaigns, you could tell because of the finely tuned levels balanced around slowly moving forwards at all times- and the weird multiplayer scoring mechanics. Much like Dark Souls 1 and its clear focus on a coherent world and strong NPCs, with some odd balance in gameplay(pyromancy/dark).L4D2 had an almost singular focus on versus mode: the scoring system was much better, the new infected types were focused on making sure that there was no slow movement, but movement was done in fast bursts. The levels and events were also designed around this new focus, and it left the coop campaign section lacking(except hard rain-note how it forces you to stop and hole up more often, as well as pick movement paths much more carefully). But versus was much more interesting than l4d1 and I was fine playing that for a long long time.Dark Souls 2: it seems to be built around consensual pvp and coop. It is so incredibly easy to do consensual pvp in DS2- beat 1/3 of the game and you can do it all you want, in a few different settings(I do count the rat covenant as consensual pvp, probably doors of pharros as well because they are small optional areas). With the rings for helping summon your friends, along with the soul memory mechanic and no infinite invasion items, you can summon friends for anything anytime with nearly no reprecussions(especially once you learn how to abuse the life rings). One of the biggest plusses for me was the relative balance of most of the mechanics: no longer is mage an unstoppable juggernaut from halfway through the game, or pyromancy a nearly costless source of power. Everything had a price and many of the weapons were pretty cool to use in pvp and pve, as well as reworked poison and a distinct lack of high end shields from early game.I was amazed that they replaced the backstab-centric combat correctly, where now I could whittle down the opponent without having to resort to only having 2 hits matter.What has suffered in dark souls 2? World design- its been talked about before. Coupling their desire to gate out power(when do you get the primary seller for magic/cleric/dark?) with the super linear and non optional design- they have made it so that I never want to do the optional areas because they don't contain any lore I really feel like uncovering(ash lake), any interesting areas I feel like going to(ash lake!) or even any items I want to have(great ash lake barrier!). Add to this their desire to take out those nasty low level invaders(most of which people wanted gone were just straight up hackers) by again cutting non consensual invasion pvp.------I think DS2 is a mechanically superior game that lacked the amazing invasion pvp and world building that made DS1 great. I should be having more fun in pvp due to the plethora of weapons and builds and whatnot- except my character build does not seem unique or even a trade off, because when everyone is level 170 you can have 4 stats at 40. So unless you want some sort of hex dual wield falchion build, you can always have high weight capacity and hp.I am a huge fan of the non consensual invasions- it was the price of going human in DS1 and while it might be weird this time around(so how about that there blue protection covenant, thats probably a good price for blocking invasions) it is a sorely missed feature that has really cut down on replay value for me.------			"

												I never thought I'd play this game, let alone finish it with more than 80% achievements unlocked. Not to mention I'm still itching for more which made me go back to the first game. The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it ruined all other games for me. No other gaming experience out there feels quite as satisfying any more. If you have the patience to learn the basics on your own ( this game explains nothing. NOTHING!) and accept the fact that you will have to keep trying over and over again until you succeed, then you're in for one hell of a ride.			"

												I deleted my old review because of something that happened in the meantime. Originally I recommended the game and liked it enough to get 100% achievements in it, even though it's not as good as DS1. My current rating is because of absolutely detestable business practice by Bandai Namco, namely the upcoming reedition of DS2 titled Scholar of the First Sin. I could live with the graphical downgrade and some issues with the port, I was okay with DLCs coming out for DS2 (even though it was said there would be none), but releasing a new version completely incompatible with the old one - the old and new versions have separate multiplayer - with very little changes that should be either in a free patch or in the base game right from the start and demand full price for it, not even a full year after the original came out, is a slap in the face for the old customers.The game itself is fun, but please, vote with your wallet and show Bamco this is not the way to go.

												This is a great game. DS1 is probably my favorite game. But I can't condone the business practice behind it, that is currently forcing you to buy the same game again through new minor but desirable exclusive content, because if you don't, you won't get the complete experience. You don't even need to be a diehard fan to feel like you're missing out.So yeah. No more money from me. That means I'll be missing out, and that my online experience in the ""old"" DS2 version will be hampered, and I'll never get to play Bloodborne, or the new Zelda, or the new Sonic, or The Last of Us, but those behind this ""exclusive"" ♥♥♥♥ will be that less richer - maybe even ""missing out in the complete experience""...edit:since writing this I actually bought the game because my wife wanted to play with me, and there was a ""two for one"" kind of deal...

												If the laws of nature allowed it, I would have this game's babies.I would have this game's horrificly disfigured , mutant, abomination babies.When you play this game, you will die.A lot.A whole lot. Over, and over, and over again.The entire crux of the game is deciding where you want to draw the line between hope and futility, and how one can define either. It means traverseing a world on the brink of its own death, and learning that not only has the world been here before, but it has gone over that brink before.You will not be able to decide whether your greatest enemy is the world itself, the monsters that inhabit it, other PLAYERS, or maybe just yourself. You will have to decide if aiding others, preying upon others, or protecting others is the best path for preserving yourself.You will throw your controller.You will die ( a lot).You will wonder whether or not the Developers really, truly hate you-- not as a player, just you specifically as a person.You will realize that you DO hate other players.And if you don't give up; if you repeatedly throw yourself at a brick wall until it crumbles.You will know what it means to be the freaking BATMAN.

												Yes. Do it. You'll hate yourself, you'll hate the game, you'll hate that-was-obviously-the-controller-slipped. You'll hate everything until you're nothing but a hallow husk of desperation and loathing. And then, in a moment of absolution and exhausted elation, you'll win.If you're a fan of the Souls games, this is a Souls game. If you're new to the Souls series (Demon's / Dark 1 & 2) then this will be a glorious rage inducing how-could-anyone-like-this-omg-why-did-I-buy-this thing that you will probably give up on in the first hour or two. The trick is to come back in a week, or a month, or a year, sit down, and convince yourself you're finally going to figure out what the hell everyone's been raving about.tl;dr Dark Souls 2, get it and git gud.

												Note: Having just finished the game I felt I should go back and add a few things to my review. Read the edit at the bottom for my updated thoughts. Also, just to bring this to your attention because I only recently found out about it myself but the PC version has a pretty annoying bug where certain aspects of the game won't work properly when running at 60fps. For more info see this link http://steamcommunity.com/app/236430/discussions/0/540742399400360842/Dark Souls 2 is not a bad game but despite that I can't help but feel extremely disappointed every time I play it. As a huge huge fan of the previous game this was easily one of my most anticipated games in years. The end result has left me feeling let down. Let’s start with the most obvious flaw, the difficulty. Dark Souls 2 is easy. Even if this is your first Souls game, I can't see anyone having too much trouble beating this game. Sure you'll die a few times here and there but it doesn't matter because bonfires are like hobos in London in this game. There's one on every street corner. The game throws bonfires at you like they're going out of style. Remember that feeling from the first game? You're beat to hell, your weapon is about to break, you have no Estus left and you're miles from the last bonfire then suddenly you round the corner and there it is. That feeling is nowhere to be found in Dark Souls 2. The worst offender by far is Earthen Peak, where there are THREE bonfires mere minutes from each other. The enemies offer little challenge as they are dumb as hell. They will make a beeline straight for you and their attacks are all massively telegraphed. This problem is made even greater when you realise that Dark Souls 2's idea of upping the difficulty is simply to throw more enemies at you at once. Enemies bunch together in one big cluster♥♥♥♥ and try to Zerg rush you. You will walk round every corner thinking to yourself ""Gee. I wonder how many enemies are going to jump out at me this time?” I can see the planning sessions now.""Hey hey guys listen. Remember that one part in Dark Souls where we made them fight 2 bosses at once? Well this time, you're gonna love this, this time we'll make them fight... 3 BOSSES AT ONCE!""""♥♥♥♥ING GENIUS!""The environments are not much better. I honestly cannot even remember half the names of the areas in this game let alone the layout of them. It's pretty frustrating considering the original had extremely memorable environments. I know everyone loves to hate it but you will never forget the first time you went through Blighttown. My favourite level from Dark Souls 1 is the Painted World. So far, there hasn't been even a single level that has even come close to those two in terms of design and the bosses are even worse. Not only are they just as forgettable as the environments but they're also ♥♥♥♥ easy. I beat most of the bosses on my first attempt without even really trying. The only boss I really enjoyed was the Pursuer mainly because it's one of the few I can actually remember.Do you like using specific types of weapons? Well tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥s because the weapon distribution in this game is heavily biased. I like using dex weapons. Dex was my preferred build in the original Dark Souls so naturally I went with that for my first run through of Dark Souls 2. 20 hours in and I found ludicrous amounts of strength weapons and about 3 dex weapons.One thing that particularly annoyed me was that the pre-release footage they showed of the game was a blatant lie because the game looks NOTHING like that, even on PC. Granted, the graphics are a step up from Dark Souls 1 but compared to the pre-release footage, it still looks like ♥♥♥♥.All in all if you've never played Souls before and you're interested in this game then by all means give it a go. If you liked it then play Dark Souls 1. If you liked that then play Demon's Souls but if you're like me and you played the original Dark Souls to death then I really can't recommend this game to you. It'll just leave you feeling disappointed.EDIT: So after almost a month of on and off playing, I finally managed to drag myself through the game in the hopes that I would eventually have something nice to say about it. Unfortunately I now feel like I straight up dislike the game rather than just being disappointed by it. Remember when I said Dark Souls 2 was easy? Well that's not entirely true. There are some parts that are difficult and that's great right? Well no not really. The great thing about Dark Souls 1 was that it did a great job of balancing difficulty with fun. If you were smart, didn't play like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and took a step back to think things through, you would generally make it out ok. Dark Souls 2 on the other hand is incredibly cheap. Enemy placement is all kinds of ♥♥♥♥ed up. Remember how I mentioned the designer's 'more = better' design philosophy? Well it gets taken to ridiculous extremes later on. Huge enemies with massive health bars are just copy pasted around every single god damned level and you will, more often than not, have to fight more than one of them at once. This is bad because it encourages players to be as cheesy as possible when trying to take them out. Melee characters will have a considerably tougher time trawling through the hordes of giant enemies on account of Dark Souls 2's completely unnecessary change to rolling.Resistance has now been replaced by the Adaptability stat. This stat affects how many invincibility frames your roll has so now instead of investing points into something that's actually useful, you can now pour points into a stat that makes a basic combat mechanic work properly. If you're not willing to do that well then (thanks to the ludicrously oversized hitboxes) I hope you enjoy being vacuumed into grabs and being hit by things that are not even touching a single pixel of your character's geometry.If that weren't bad enough they also changed parrying. I understand this was probably so that DS veterans couldn't waltz through the game parrying everything in sight. I was somewhat proficient at parrying in the first Dark Souls but to me it just doesn't seem viable in DS2. The window appears to be so small that it just doesn't seem worth it making it more about guesswork than fast reactions. Or maybe I just need to git gud.So with rolling gimped and parrying nerfed, the obvious conclusion we can draw from this is that you're supposed to play this game as a ranged character? Maybe? I don't know.I'm not going to bother talking about soul memory because everything I wanted to say has already been said in a million other reviews. All I'll say is that it sucks and I don't like it.It really pains me to say this but I did not enjoy my time with Dark Souls 2. The hordes of enemies and completely bland level design made playing this game feel like a chore rather than a form of entertainment but I trawled through it regardless because I’m a masochist. I compared this to my first time playing Dark Souls 1, which pulled me in almost immediately. The first time I played that game it took me almost 4 hours to beat Undead Burg and I freaking loved every second of it. Now imagine if that was a Dark Souls 2 level. Replace all the hollows with those giant skeleton dogs from Tomb of the Giants, multiply them by 5 and stick them all over the place and instead of the rolling barrel trap, just make the floor spontaneously explode when you walk over it. Oh and place a bonfire where the Black Knight should be.So in conclusion I still can’t recommend Dark Souls 2 despite having finished it. Having been extremely excited to play this game ever since it was announced, I gave it so many chances to impress me in the vain hope that it would eventually click and I would start having a blast just like I did my first time through Dark Souls 1, but in the end it never did. I don’t like Dark Souls 2 and that makes me very sad.			"

												Where the downtrodden world on the brink of total death due to unclear forces once was (Dark Souls 1), this new landscape full of hope and potential arises to take its place (Dark Souls 2.) Unfortunately, this game is a sequel to what many consider to be the greatest game of all time. This means it gets compared to said game, and in that light, this game is clearly a failure on almost every front. Sure, the UI is improved, but that is almost the only thing. Movement is more sluggish and swimmy, but somehow it feels more fluid, so that's another ""improvement"" over the original. This game doesn't fail in the way the combat works, or the way that the surface game mechanics work, though, those were simply modernized to remove the inconvenient and lackluster elements from the first game. Unfortunately, the game that surrounds these improvements is a drastic downgrade from the original. The world is brighter, spread out, and less impressive. Dark Souls 1 had phenomenal level design. I'm a level designer, and I can only HOPE to someday create something that is even a fraction of the genius that was Dark Souls 1. It is beautiful, haunting, incredibly complex, and intricate on every scale. It's like a fractal where down to the smallest minutia the level design bleeds excellence. Sure, it wasn't as graphically impressive, but it was a masterpiece all the same. Here, it's much more generic. Sure, certain areas, especially in the DLC (to which almost none of my criticism applies) find that sweet spot between complexity, discovery, and the sudden thought of ""Oh, holy ♥♥♥♥, these areas connect!?"" However, most areas feel flat, needlessly spread out, and inefficient.That's hardly the most damning thing, though. Enough of the areas are quite beautiful in the way that only a Souls game can be. Heide's Tower of Flame, the outside of Earthen Peak, the iron bulls head in the Iron Keep, the Dragon Aerie, and the haunting skyline of Huntsman's Copse are all very beautiful and enchanting. However, they aren't outright unique in the way that areas like Ash Lake, where you finally see a gigantic tree that holds the entirety of Lordran up in it's stone branches (which is one of the greatest hidden areas of all time, simply for the visuals and perspectives it offers,) or Anor Londo, where the bleak, grimy castles and burgs give way to the most beautifully, brilliant white castle of the Gods ever concieved. It isn't the visual aspect that sucks, though, and I suppose my point here is that it isn't the surface of Dark Souls 2 that ruins it for me. It hurts the game, but what really damns it is the internals. It's in the guts of the game. The game play.The thing that Dark Souls was initially known for was it's unforgiving difficulty. It wasn't actually that difficult though, it just required a level of play that, in turn, required the player to grow and improve if he wanted to progress. The game made YOU figure out how to play it properly. It gave you all the tools you needed to succeed. Dark Souls 2 continues this trend, but it's so much easier. Even when you knew how to play Dark Souls 1, the enemies and bosses were still challenging. In this game, once you know how to play Dark Souls 2, everything is a cinch. Very few bosses offer any challenge what so ever, and they almost all feel haphazardly placed. Sure, later areas of the game do bring you to areas where the game slowly builds to an impressive fight, but that fight often can be cleared on your first try. Almost definitely on your second. I guess in a way that makes this game less frustrating for some people, but I needed something more. I needed and required a challenge. Every single boss fight felt too ""Hey, I'm a Dark Souls boss, swingin' a sword around hurp-de-durp."" In the first game, you fight demons a few times, but you fought a lot more interesting enemies, like iron giants, wolves with swords in their mouths (which made you feel like a terrible human, and forced you to question your own motives, another thing Dark Souls 2 NEVER does,) mutated dragons, and centipede demons. Here it's all big dude, big sword. Some bosses buck that trend, but given the quantity of bosses, it starts to feel a little copy-paste at some point. Plus, most of the games enemies are just some zombie knight with a sword, or a dog. It gets pretty bland, and even the extremely good DLC falls victim to this. Some areas don't follow this, of course, but by and large the game as a whole does.Overall, the game leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't place it for the longest time, but I think it's just Dark Souls fatigue. Trying to play this game now would make me feel ill. It doesn't innovate, and it doesn't improve enough. It's an outright failure that killed the once growing Dark Souls community. This game was the end of a dream, and the only thing that could bring about it's resurrection is a truly great third game. One that is better than the first.I'm not so sure that is a thing that can happen. "

The only reason I don't recommend picking this up is that, at this point, you should really be buying ""Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin"", which includes all the DLC and better graphics. They also reworked the existing zones in the game to make the game flow better and just be generally more awesome.

 Short version :  Dark Souls 2  is truly a worthy successor of the original  Dark Souls  in all aspects except visual style. - 9.5/10 Long version : I'm a hardcore fan of the series (unfortunately never got around to play  Demon Souls  ). Setting  : A lot of people may argue about the fact that  Dark Souls 2  lacks good story, characters, areas, and bosses.I will agree with the latter as the bosses were indeed dissapointing, I finished NG+ and NG+2 all under 10 hours, the area enemies and obstacles provide more of a challenge than bosses do.But  Dark Souls 2  has a strong narrative and lore, setting up an even darker plot for  Dark Souls 3  to continue. In order to understand the story completely, you need to play the original  Dark Souls  as well, because a lot of the characters and plot is vaguely mentioned throughout  Dark Souls 2.  Gameplay  : When it comes to gameplay,  Dark Souls 2  excels at it compared to it's predecessors and even it's successor  Bloodborne .  Dark Souls 2  is fluid in every way, including movement, attacking, defending, casting spells, and especially dodging.People say that playing the Souls series requires a controller, I am proof that it doesn't. Played both  Dark Souls  games using mouse and keyboard, my PVP win rate in  Dark Souls 2  is around 80%. That includes normal PVP and arena. So if you're one of those people who doesn't have a controller like me, don't be afraid to play this game, you'll be just as good as the players with a controller. Visuals and optimization  : Visuals are fantastic, and the game is perfectly optimized for the PC, runs smoother than my operating system does. But in terms of art style, it's not that grand compared to it's predecessor. But you'll certainly be fascinated by most environments. Online  : Where  Dark Souls 2  lacks, it CERTAINLY makes up for it's online system, you'll connect with people online very easily, as long as people keeps playing the game, you'll be able to PVP, co-op or troll / gank people.We all remember how poor the original  Dark Souls'  connectivity system was, and originally  Dark Souls 2  had a lot of issues with it's online system, but the devs fixed it with patches that added certain rings that makes matchmaking easier and removed some restrictions. Expansions  : The additional content released for the game are worth playing, the price tag is pretty big, but  considering the amount of new content it adds, including new gear, new characters, more insight on the story, new areas and ofcourse, new bosses, it's worth a buy if you're a fan of the series. Controversies  : A lot of the fans including myself got backstabbed by  From Software  for their cheap tricks at money making, with how they released a new and much better version of the game but something that you have to purchase even if you own the original base game. But it isn't fair if you rate the game poorly or not recommend it, just because the developers went for a dirty marketing system doesn't mean the game is bad, it's still superb!All in all,  Dark Souls 2  is a RPG masterpiece, players old and new to the series shouldn't miss out on this gem.

												I sunk over 250 hours into this game, and I absolutely adore it. While the story isn't quite as gripping as the first, and it suffers from generally less interesting bosses (DLC nonwithstanding) this game is my absolute favorite game from 2014.That said, don't buy this one. There's a newer version for DirectX11 coming soon, and it'll include all the DLC to boot. So buying the game now would be a huge waste of money. In all fairness it's a great deal for people who initially passed on Dark Souls 2. But for people who shelled out for the original release, and paid for the DLC? It's shady at best and absolute betrayal at worst.			"

I preordered it for the Xbox 360, bought Scholar of The First Sin for the Xbox 360, bought the PS4 version of Scholar of the First Sin, and even bought the pc version of this game.I probably have around 200 hours or so added up across all platforms.The combat is refreshing, the difficulty is crushing, and the online implementation is great.Just, don't buy this version. Buy Scholar of the First Sin.Scholar of the First Sin has all the dlc, updated graphics, different enemy layouts, another ♥♥♥♥ing boss, rewritten item descriptions, and even more addons to the online multiplayer.TL;DR, I love this game. You'd probably love this game too. Just, buy the Scholar of the First Sin version of this game. It adds some bang to your buck.			"

												Ok before anyone reads, know that I have never played Demon Souls, or Dark Souls 1.  DS2 was given to me as a gift or I likely would never have played this one either.  I had always heard that these games were very hard and I usually do not equate fun with hard to play.Anway...The first couple of hours on this game were a true test to my commitment.  I think I died in the first 30 seconds (fell off a cliff damnit!).  It was extremely frustrating, and challenging, to figure out how to safely move and how to fight.  I have never played a game where everything can kill you so easily and the environment is so deadly.As I said above though, this was a gift, and I was not going to waste someone elses generosity by quiting.CONTROL : It took me a bit to get used to.  Clumbsy turning, slow recovery from weapon swings, and more.  I would recommend to anyone picking this up for the first time, run around for a few minutes, get used to how your character moves.  Especially practice stopping and quick direction changing.Once you have it down, continue.COMBAT : The combat is every bit as hard as you have heard.  For a novice such as myself, it was extremely unforgiving.  However, once you learn HOW to fight, it is one of the most rewarding experiences in recent gaming memory.  Going back and totally dominating something that basically has humiliated me on prior attempts is nothing short of pure joy.And it only gets better.  As you adapt to the controls, and the enemie behaviors, you get bolder.  You get aggressive.  And, you get dead.  hehe.  The game will always remind you if you get to cocky.STORY : I will be honest, I focussed more on the gameplay than the story.  The story is good, but feels a little tacked on.  Lots to listen to and read though.GRAPHICS/WORLD : The world looked like ♥♥♥ the first time I logged on, but I got used to it and I now really appreciate the design choices.  It looks absolutely stunning at times, but then it looks like trash in others.  The monsters all look great, so that is what matters.OTHER : I could go on and on about this game.  So many weapons, so many armors, so many choices.  But I think the absolute best thing I can tell you is this....I got the game in mid June.  I put in 114+ hours into it since then.  I just beat the game 20 minutes ago, and I am now going right back into it.Nuff said. "

												A fun, albeit fundamentally flawed romp through a Japanese take on european high fantasy.  I have been a big fan of the 'Souls' series since first playing Demons' Souls on my ps3 so my thoughts may be slightly skewed in that direction.  One of the main reasons I enjoy the Souls series is the fact that 9 times out of 10 when I die, it's my fault, I messed up in some way.  Unfortunatley, in the majority of my deaths in DS2 this simply wasn't the case.  With enemies defying the rules imposed on the main character in order to get a kill.  For example, my sword pings off a wall, while an enemies weapon swings through it for a hit, being hit full force from behind a shield with 100% defence, being hit when clearly a few feet away from the enemy swing.  Artificial difficulty is also a major problem here too, as the combat engine and lock-on feature are geared towards 1-on-1 combat, and on far too many occasions you are beset by more than one or two enemies.Speaking of enemies, The Ai seems a little off most times, with foes plummeting to their deaths on more than a few occasions, also, just standing there, spinning on the spot as I take pot-shots at them with a bow and the hawk ring.  Not to mention being able to essentially cheese the Dragonrider boss in Heides Tower of flame area.  After taking a few enemies out around the area, I decided to look at the place you fight him.  Standing on the platform just after the third knight, firing arrows at him, only to find when I start the fight, my arrows actually hurt him, and I 1-shotted him with 1 swipe of a dagger.  They also need to re-jig a few enemies in my opinion too.  as later in the game I came across a few enemies with what seemed to be no stamina bar.  BASH BASH BASH BASH BASH (all this while spinning on the spot with the attrocius tracking), dude, take a breather damnit!  Time to range-cheese this fecker...The graphics seem to be a bone of contention among many people too, with what seems to be an ever growing munber of people citing that FromSoft blatantly lied about the game being built 'from the ground up' for the PC.  From what I can see here, this wasn't the case.  Yes, the game has many options for tweaking the PC graphics, but doesn't look anything like the demo we were shown in 2013, It seems to have been downgraded for last-gen consoles, and for me, that doesn't fly for a PC title.The world itself is a mixed bag of pretty places and downright ugly texture-dumps with no cohesive geography unlike the connected world of DS1.  Here, I found myself feeling a little confused upon going way down in a elevator from sea level, and appearing at a different place that was still at sea level...After looking at a few full map comparisons, I can safely say that continuity wise, the world of DS1 could exist, where the world of DS2 cannot, with areas overlapping each other a lot.  For me, this made the world feel more like seperately designed levels as opposed to a cohesive world.The sound design seems ok, with the usual bangs and clanks of weapons and armour, but the soundtrack is ultimatley forgettable, with nothing memorable like Sif, Ornstein and Smough, and Gwyns themes all still recognisable to me.  Nothing had the same impact in DS2.Enemy design is lackluster, with far too many bosses being large humanoids with a slam attack, swipe attack and gap-closer along with one 'unique' attack.  Again, as with the sound there was nothing memorable here.I wont go into the much vaunted pvp too much, suffice it to say that it's broken all to heck, with the same problems as above, lag-stabs from 20 feet away, wonky hitboxes etc etc...I'm still on-and-off enjoying my time in DS2, but the shortcomings are making me want to play less and less.Make of the above what you will, they are only my opinions and experiences within the game.  Hopefully with a few patches, a few of the above problems will be fixed, but until then, I wouldn't recommend DS2, and it hurts me to say so.			"

												Dark Souls 2 is forgettable. Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls weren’t. On paper Dark Souls 2 improves on many problems in the first two games. But at the same time it fails to capture the most important aspects that made everyone love the other games.Everyone gets hung up on the difficulty of the Souls games. As if that’s the only thing that makes them good. They’re more than that. There’s plenty of bone hard games out there, but none have the same devoted fanbase as the Souls games. There’s more going on here than the marketing or even the fans would want you to think. And that’s where Dark Souls 2 goes wrong. On the surface this is the same as the other two. But when you dig deep you notice there’s nothing there. Dark Souls and Demon’s Souls were rich. This isn’t.Here’s a comprehensive list of what the sequel gets right. The multiplayer is reliable. In Dark Souls 1 it’s a borderline unusable mess. You can now run the game at any resolution, and the performance is good. That’s the end of the list.It’s clear that the developers of Dark Souls 2 aimed too high. They tried to outdo the original game, with a team that was unqualified to even dream of doing so. They made a new engine with an improved lighting engine. In trailers it almost looked like a next-gen game! Unfortunately it was so slow they scrapped it before release. What you’re left with is a game that looks worse than its predecessors. There’s almost no contrast, the lighting is mostly flat, the art direction confusing. Words you wouldn’t use to describe the other Souls games.More importantly though there’s no cohesion to the world. The transitions between environments is nonsensical. There’s far too many locations, and they’re all too small. There’s no way anyone could live in this world. In the other Souls games the worlds were plausible. You saw the remnants of great civilizations, and you could believe in them. There’s maybe a couple exceptions to the rule in Dark Souls 2, but they’re in the minority. Almost every environment you pass through you reach the end and think “oh, that’s it? Ok..”.The DLC packs do their best to redeem the game. They’re an admirable effort, easily outdoing anything the main game did. There’s hope yet for this team. But after finishing the DLCs and returning to the normal areas one last time I’m not wistful or nostalgic for anything that happened during my journey. I look at the world and all I see is meaningless maps. This isn’t a world with history, where I connected with characters and went on a journey that I’ll remember. It’s just a game. A Souls game should be more than that.I’m split. Dark Souls 2 isn’t “bad” by any regular metric. But the more I play it the more disappointed I am in it. At some point I’ll replay Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls. I never want to play Dark Souls 2 again.			"

With FromSoftwares intent to kill this game, I would advise you NOT to purchase it.I am even more adament about advising you NOT to purchase the RE-RELEASE. Doing so would be sending a message to FromSoft that their shady business practice is acceptable as well as paying for the death of this game. I know we all love the souls series, so lets make sure to let Fromsoft know that we wont sit by and pay them to screw it up.The upcoming re-release is a paid fix for only a fraction of the things that are wrong with this game. Not only that, but every single ""new feature"" in the upcoming version could easily be patched into the current. This will also deal a huge blow to the games community. They will now be split bewteen to versions. Considering the community is already so small, this will make online play virtually non-existant for one or both versions. Good luck filling those 6 multiplayer slots with a total of 2000 people online at PEAK hours. All these issues could be avoided. Instead Fromsoftware feels they deserve to be paid again for doing little to no work fixing the mistakes they made in the first place. This is nothing more then an unprofessional money-grab by a developer who has clearly become full of themselves. They need to focus on fixing the version they just sold before moving on to a new one.The scam of the re-release is not the only problem with this game. The PvP is just in a flat out awful state. Peer2Peer lag ruins most matches, and Hackers run wild and free with no fear of punishment. In fact you are more likely to get banned for modding the game visually than you are for hacking to win PvP. Hackers aren't even afraid to gloat about their hacks. They know they will not be punished. In just the last week, I have run into 5 hardcore hackers. Had to completely abandon my favorite invasion locations because I didnt want to keep throwing away hours of cracked orb farming on these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. No sign of them being stopped. To put it simply, Fromsoft does not care. They got paid. They are about to get paid again. Why put in extra work fixing their game when they can just release a new version full of empty promises and the same problems? The fans will buy it.I can promise you this. The lag, the hackers, all of it will carry over to the new version as well. You will basically just be buying better looking graphics for a game the Devs have condemned.TL;DR?Fromsoft is about to launch a re-release of this game that will destroy the online PC community. It is a great deal for those who own a PS4 and XboxOne, but awful for the PC Playerbase. If you buy this version, you are buying a soon-to-be-dead game. If you buy the re-release, you might as well bend over and ask Scamco to screw you some more. We deserve a free conversion to Dx11. Its well within their power to do. They have made it very clear that they do not care about the state of the game, just how much money they can get out of it. It's full of hackers with no punishments in sight. You would do well to save your money and invest in a game developed by experienced professionals.			"

												I don't think Dark Souls 2 is better than Dark Souls but it's much more playable. It runs well and it fixed many problems DkS had. Though I feel like DkS2 goes for quantity over quality with its enemies. Luring enemies away one by one is not as possible as in DkS. Usually if you try to do so, you aggro all the nearby enemies anyway. Circling around the enemies is a waste of time since they turn 360 and their attacks do so as well.There are bonfires that reside right next to a squad of mobs. I never understood that either.The game is visually pleasing. I love the beautiful grim world and its jolly people. There's so much to explore and discover that you'll find yourself replaying it over and over again. To help with that, you can make so many fun character builds. Or cosplay Havel.Dark Souls 2 isn't a hard game. Like everything in life, you need to learn and master a lot of things. I switched from DkS to DkS2 and I had to learn new things. Once you know the game, it rewards you. Not going to lie though. It's a frustrating game at times.Also,Dying is a wonderful thing.Don't give up, skeleton.			"

												Two and a half years later, the sequel of Dark Souls got released.  You are continuing your journey with a desire to break the curse.  You came to Drangleic to break the undead curse, but you will end up following a path laid out for you by the  Herald The game has great lore, although it is not given to you.  Vendrick  seems to have been a chosen undead (Possibly YOU from Dark Souls ?)  Chancellor Wellager  says : ""He vanquished the four Great Ones, and built this kingdom upon their souls."" Very interesting indeed. It shares the same mechanics with some new ones. When it comes to challenge it is basically the same. NG+ will give you some new enemies and red phantoms, upgraded rings and better drop rate on certain items. The difficulty will increase until you reach NG+7 like the previous game. Soul Memory [Total souls collected] is a new thing and prevents low level griefers. The game will now match you up with people in your SM range. NG players will not be able to play with NG+ players no matter what their SM is. A rather good invention although I miss invading new people with high end weapons and gear... Multiplayer aspect of the game is getting better along with the patches. Unbalanced weapons, armor, rings and spells have been mostly fixed. Only major problem must be the amount of hackers and lag. There will be some lag depending on peoples internet connection. But there is of course something wrong when both players has decent internet speed and gets alot of lag. But overall a solid game and a must buy for RPG fans. 8/10 + Lore+ Graphics+ Gameplay+ Area and Enemy design- Lag- AI- PC controls [Highly recommended to get a Xbox 360 controller]			"

												Do not recommend, From Software not only charges 39.99 for this game before DLC, but will be rereleasing it in April 2015 with updated graphics and DX11 support as opposed to the current DX9 support. Those who buy this version (DX9) will not be able to play with those who buy the DX11 version, essentially splitting their player base in half between those who can afford to spend $60+ on the game for a second time, and those who can't or won't. Do not support these developers. This game is great, Dark Souls 1 is even better, and Demon Souls for PS3 is better still. From Software is a really talented group but their money grubbing tactics are throwing their fans under the bus by rereleasing a more complete game and requiring those who already purchased the game to buy it again if they want to receive updates and patches.EDIT: Here is my proof since some people can't be bothered to do the research themselves:http://www.darksoulsii.com/us/news.1.phpAnd here is the direct quote from that page:All versions of the game will include the following features (Existing Dark Souls II owners will receive a patch to implement these elements):Additional NPCs added for an enhanced story experience. Parameter adjustments for improved game balance.Augmented item descriptions. Improved online matchmaking functionality. Xbox One, PS4, and DirectX 11 versions of the game will include the following features (in addition to those listed above): Additional upgrades to graphics, sound, performance.Increase in maximum online players in single session (6 total).

												READ BEFORE YOU BUY:This company is planning a re-release in April that WILL NOT transfer saves or be compatible with the old servers (Yes, they did just release 3 DLCs and a season pass. I know, it's scummy.) My personal biggest gripes: 1: Split community. You will have less people to play with whether or not you buy the paid DX11 upgrade. FROM could fix this by making it a free, required upgrade, but they won't. The Souls games already have a niche community. 2: No save transfers. This would be relatively simple for FROM to fix, but they didn't care. They managed to transfer DS1 saves from GFWL to Steam, but they don't bother here. I've heard a lot of people say, ""Don't complain about the DX11 upgrade; you don't have to buy it."" That's not completely true; the DX9 community will slowly fade away as nobody will buy that version anymore, and many DX9 players will migrate. Eventually if you want to keep playing with an active community, you will have to buy the DX11 version. Kiss any DX9 progress goodbye. And who wants to play a ♥♥♥♥♥ier version of their favorite game anyway? What kind of company punishes loyal fans like this for profit? In my opinion, FROM was just waiting to gain enough money/popularity before they started acting like the scumbags they are behaving as now. Show them that's not okay. Have some self control and refrain from buying either version.			"

												If you are looking for a relaxing casual game with a light emphasis on story I would strongly encourage you to play this. This game creates a stark contrast to real hardcore games played by professional gamer's like Kaceytron (Mario Party 8, The sims 3, Lego Star Wars) and creates a soothing immersive enviornment. The gentle music and the guided story progression is very basic  and definitily oriented to the softcore gamer. The game comes with a pause feature,  pressing alt-f4 in the middle of any fight against a boss or just a normal enemy will imediatly pause the game, giving you time to asses the situation. Other players are very helpful and will often invade your world just to provide encouragment! You can change the games difficulty by opting to put all of your points into attunment. The game will detect this and will make the game even easier. Often times if you are having trouble with any obstacle you can remove all your armor and then bow to whatever is giving you trouble. If you bow enough times then the game will actually compleate that area for you. 10/10 would praise the sun again			"

												WARNING: A new ""HD version"" of this game has been announced. It will be an entirely separate game and include all DLC content. Most importantly, this ""old"" version (released May, 2014) WILL NOT update to the new version, which will be sold separately.The new version of the game will contain new enemies, events, multiplayer enhancements, and graphical updates not available in this version of the game. Furthermore, the two versions of the game will not be compatible with each-other for online play.It is worth noting a patch for the ""old"" version will include some of the new content, such as a new NPC and SOME of the new enemies and events. However, the remaining content will be exclusive to the new version.Therefore, it is my recommendation you avoid purchasing this game, as the new version will arrive April, 2015. I also strongly encourage you to scrutinize the business practices exercized by the developer and publisher of this game. To make a very long story short, it is my opinion we are being sold the same game again with minor, though desirable improvements. In most circumstances, this would be called a support patch.			"

												Dark Souls 2 is a visually and aesthetically impressive game that definitely builds off of the first dark souls in a good way as far as visual design and atmosphere. However this game lacks the core elements that made the first game so immersive and engaging. The combat in Dark Souls 2 misses the core ideals that the first Dark Souls created. The developers seem to have just made attributes of the bosses and the enemies more annoying in order to increase the ""difficulty"" of the game itself. The mobs tracking system is one example of this. Mobs will track the player until the very last moment that they attack even if they are wielding a large heavy great sword or mace. This defies one of the principles that the first dark souls created which was to create a weighty and realistic combat structure that focused on precise movements and smart defensive gameplay. The combat in dark souls 2 doesn’t really feel very weighty when fighting mobs because they do a 360 degree turn to hit you when they are using a heavy cumbersome item. I find this kind of lazy design in my own opinion. The story feels disjointed and pointless which i suppose goes with the apparent theme of melancholy and anomie that the game tries to push. I can understand the ambiguity of the direction in the game but it does nothing for me as the player. In the first game the story was equally ambiguous but at least there was some end goal, which was to fulfill the prophecy told to you at the beginning of the game. This simple request and then the subsequent requests to find the two bells of awakening and eventually succeed Gwinn were purpose enough to continue to explore the game world. In dark souls 2 you have to search for four powerful souls for some reason to get to the kings palace for some reason and etc. there is no motivation no dying man’s request to fulfill a prophecy. I felt as though my character was a pointless nobody just wreaking havoc for no apparent reason except to advance through the game.Overall this game lacks what I loved about the first dark souls and while this is its own game I still can’t feel a sense of annoyance and frustration for what this game could have been when I play it.

												To clarify, as Dark Souls 2 is the considered the odd child of the series, I'm only not recommending THIS version of the game since I believe the ""remaster"" Scholar of the First Sin version is better. Get Scholar of the First Sin instead of this. So instead of a full review of the product I will give a more detailed idea what SoTFS does better, but first I will need to go over the CONTROVERSY.For the uninformed, Dark Souls 2 has a rocky release history. The announcement footage of the game featured pitch black areas that required the torch, beautiful graphics with tons of pretty particle effects and shadows being cast off every lighting source. It was surprising that something like that could even run on last gen consoles.... but it was too good to be true. The release looked very little like that, the infamous LE PREPARE TO DOWNGRADE.Many people argue that there was no reason for this downgrade. I have a unique perspective on this as I'm someone who was able to play the original infamous demo version of the game at Comic Con. The game looked pretty yes, the dark rooms added tons of tension since you didn't know what was lurking ahead of you yes, but it ran very poorly. Many people argue that the reason for the poor performance with that version was cus they ran the demo off xbox 360 Dev kits that run games worse than the actual console. Now we will never know the reason for the downgrade Officially, but I think it's clear that the downgrade happened because it ran so poorly on last gen consoles. Now Dark Souls 2 has one area that is dark and you need a torch for, and you get to experience the tension there, but areas like in the demo that were dark were not dark anymore. Since there's this whole torch mechanic it's makes it basically useless now that it's gone. Why was it removed? Speculation, but since you need to hold a torch, people who mainly 2hand weapons would be at a disadvantage, theoretically. But being the whole point that you're gimped during these sections, and that you need to light these lighting sources to go 2Hand is a good tension in my opinion and removing it entirely and LEAVE THE WHOLE TORCH SYSTEM STILL IN THE GAME never made sense to me.This is where Scholar of the First Sin comes in. First of all it attempts to add more graphical fidelity into the game, and while it's basically just SWeetFX injected into the game by default that game does look better and less flat. And, areas are dark again! The torch system actually has a use in SotFS since there's various dark rooms again. Thus with an Attempt to amend the ""le prepare to downgrade"" graphics and re-add a, imo, important mechanic, those two alone make me recommend Sotfs.The last change is that enemies/items were rearranged. How it felt to me was that the difficulty spikes of the game got moved around, so some areas are easier but some are now harder. Nothing really soured me even though the pacing was changed, but a few areas were vastly improved. A late game level that was unnecessarily annoying was changed to be wayyy less annoying and for that I would again recommend Sotfs over the original release.For the final kicker, DLC is not included in this one, it's a seperate purchase. Sotfs has all the DLCs already included, and actually incorporated in the game instead of just giving you a key to the area when you buy it. Dark Souls 2 was created by the B-team of From Software while the main peeps were creating Bloodborne, but even as someone who preordered the PC copy and preordered the season pass, I never felt duped really. It's not a true Dark Souls 2, it's more of a side story, but I didn't hate the game because of it. Making Scholar of the First Sin a complete seperate purchase with seperate servers to split the community is when I felt duped as I saw no reason to do it. And it really should of been a free upgrade for all the people who owned all the DLCs already, but during one Steam sale the ""upgrade"" discount price for Sotfs was $5 which I bought with money I made from selling CSGO/TF2 stuff so I effectively got a free upgrade... Still the only thing to make me sour from all of this. So.. GET SOTFS OVER THIS.For anyone curious, I made a youtube playlist that chronologically follows all the versions of the game made public to see the Rise and Fall of HYPE and ""LE LE LE PRepare to downgrade"":https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKVtBlYzpU-CPHRe8kt6TDyffB3w0RN_6 "

												Dark Souls is one of my favorite games, and as such I've tried my very best to like Dark Souls 2 as well, but I just can't. So, if you're looking at this review wondering if you should get into the series with Dark Souls 1 or 2, my short answer is: absolutely avoid DS2.I got into the series myself with DS2, but it gave me such a bad impression that I didn't bother to try DS1 until over a year later, only because of somebody else's insistence. Yet fast forward to today, and I'm on my third DS1 playthrough (and am also loving Bloodborne), while I've never even been able to stomach half of DS2 -- and I've tried, over half a dozen times.DS2, to me, feels like more of a fan game than an actual sequel. I believe its main issues stem from the team (which was not led by the same person as DS1) wanting to uphold the series' misappropriated ""omg so hard"" image for some reason. To make this less rambly, here is a list of things.Things I liked:- Many individual levels have interesting and kinda cool concepts.- I really liked the lore, despite its issues with relying way too much on ""subtly"" referencing DS1.- The principles of the combat system are there and they are good.- Well-optimized PC port, much better menus, good character creator.- Dogs aren't literally satan.Things that ruined my experience:- Frustrating combat due to enemies' ridiculous movement tracking, annoying movesets, and your much less reliable rolls.- Over-reliance on multiple-enemy encounters, even in boss fights, removing all challenge in favor of a test of patience.- Plenty of weird level layouts with terrible flow, levels never loop back or feel interconnected.- Occasional trolly moments that you can't anticipate, that will very possibly kill you.Other things that I really disliked but can be ignored:- World layout is nonsense and devoid of personality; You take an elevator up from the top floor of a decrepid windmill, directly into the sky, somehow landing you in Bowser's castle in the middle of a lava land.- Nearly every enemy is a humanoid, probably a form of Large Knight.- The plot makes no attempt, NPCs are lifeless, and who even are the bosses? You get nothing like Sif, Seath, or Nito here.- Music is generally lackluster and unmemorable.That's about it. I think a person who has no experience with DS1 *might* still enjoy this, though I see no reason to recommend DS2 over it; it's not more accessible. If you've played DS1 and didn't like it, this is NOT going to be better for you. I can only recommend this game if you liked DS1 *AND* you're not overly fussy about the mechanics.			"

												What an amazing ride! Just as cruel and unforgiving as it's predeccessor was, Dark Souls is back and better than ever. Sort of.Sure, sure, there are some questionable design choices, some of them I liked, some of them I did not, the game seem to have a bigger emphasis on coop and multiplayer than the first Dark Souls, but in the end these didn't matter too much, the core of the game remained the same, it's still possible to solo through it and the game still has it's... soul. hehe.If you played Dark Souls you'll feel right at home, same gameplay, different setting, bigger and more varied world and of course lots and lots of enemies and challenges to overcome... and this time it actually runs and plays well on PC as well.A very strong contender for my game of the year 2014.

												Don't do it, wait for the 'new' version to come out. Getting slammed by From on the pc makes us feel appreciated. Aside from that, the game itself is horribly dissapointing compared to other souls games. Immersion is constantly broken from bad design, the story isn't there at all. Previous souls games have rewarded exploring the lore with answers, Dark Souls 2 lore just offers more questions in a vain attempt to re-capture the previous lore, when all it does is leave mediocre story telling at the front line. The gameplay itself is great though, very smooth compared to its counterparts. But you can get good gameplay from plenty of other games, stay away from this.			"

												Edit 2 (9/13/15): Scholar of the First Sin is currently on sale. For ~$10.00 USD, I can upgrade from DkS2. This, is a much more preferable price and it's perfectly timed as I've recently replayed Dark Souls 1 and am interested in Dark Souls 2 again at the moment.Edit: Well, Scholar of the First Sin is out now. They're asking $50 if you do not own the base game, $30 if you only have the base game and $20 if you have the base game and dlc (season pass required?). For me, personally, this is not worth it at all.If you do not have the base game, it is probably best to wait until the game lowers to a more reasonable price at ~$30 or less if you are very picky. If you have the base game and none of the DLC, it is worth upgrading just for the DLC content. Assuming you would like the DLC content.Original: A superior version of Dark Souls 2 will be re-released soon for PC. DO NOT BUY THIS SPECIFIC GAME. At this point in time, there is no reason to think that there will be a reduced price for pre-existing owners of Dark Souls 2. Having said all of that, Dark Souls is a much better game altogether with DSFix addressing the performance problems it has.			"

												Genre - 3rd Person Dark FantasyThis game stays true to its roots but adds a few different game mechanics, so be careful e.g. do not to burn Human effigys thinking it will make you human, and press Y at bonfires to light torches. The creatures you encounter will only spawn a limited number of times, but enough,  this encourages farming in different locales and throughout the game a bit of farming is very useful but still enjoyable as each fight could be your last. By choosing one of two covenants early in the game you can change the difficulty. I chose the Champion Covenenant by accident and soon learnt from my mistake, although the game was still enjoyable, I died a lot more! The multiplayer is greatly improved allowing you to call in allies and join other people's games without those Xbox Live connectivity issues. This is a great part of the fun, although in the Champion covenant you are not able to do this, if you were feellng really masochistic this is the covenent for you, there is a kind of scoreboard though. You can customise your character as you go and there are a few differnt classes to choose from at the start which allow different playthrough styles. I have spent many hours on this game and I hope to spend many more. I am taking my time and enjoying the ride, so there is no need to rush to that coveted New Game+. As usual though my balanced character seems under powered but with friends like you, I'll survive...sometimes...			"

												This is the only game that I ever bothered to go through and get all the achievements for.  I can't get enough of it.Edit:  I read some of the negative reviews on here and they basically read like this: ""I put SO many hours into DS1 and know it like the back of my hand.  DS2 sucks because it's not an exact clone of DS1.  I don't want to attempt to learn anything new I want an exact clone of DS1 with new areas to explore.""  So yea, if you want DS1, sorry this isn't it.  It's DS2...  there's differences.  I can say that with 300+ hours into DS2 and DS1 that I like DS2 better.  I'm in NG+5, got all the achievements and still enjoying the game.  As for the ""this game is too easy"" comments (complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t btw) it's got its easier areas and hard ones and each individual is probably going to find different areas easier or harder than other people depending on what type of character they build and what their play style is.  So IMO, that's subjective.  I beat DS1 on NG+6 and by that time it's not a hard game either.  All the people that wanna talk about how hard DS1 is compared to DS2 either didn't play it as much as they claim they did or they're just blindly biased against DS2 for whatever reason.  DS1 has a final boss you can parry/riposte to death easily on any difficulty and you can pretty much back stab your way through the entire game with ease (and lets not forget Manus, the final boss in the expansion who you can kill before you even zone into the fight with a ring of the hawk and a decent bow.  He'll just stand there and die, too easy).  There are plenty of enemies in DS1 that you can shoot with a black bow of pharis who won't move at all and just stand there and let you kill them.  As for bosses, Seathe was a joke, so was Nito and Quelaag and Iron Golem and Gwyn after you realized you could parry him.  Not to mention, if you had a crap load of hours put into DS1 then you knew what to expect going into DS2.  You knew the style of the game and what was coming so of course it's not going to be as challenging as experiencing that style of game for the first time.  DS1 was a great game, don't get me wrong but DS2 is a great game in it's own right too.  Don't pretend that most of the flaws that exist in Dark Souls 2 were non-existent in Dark Souls 1 cause most of them were there.  Nothing is perfect.  It doesn't mean they aren't awesome games.			"

Also please read warning reviews about the new version that will be coming out in april 2015 ""HD"" remake with copy pasted ""new  enemies"" and ""better graphics"" for full price. This version will not be upgraded. I condone these practices for a cash grab by developers. They do no seem to care about people who supported their game and I honestly feel cheated.

												Dark Souls II, following the previous game's path, it's a very fun and challenging game.While it might appear to be somewhat more linear from mid game up until the ending, it doesn't lose much when it comes to variety. From different enemies to strategies, to beautiful and dark themed areas.You will, most likely, find yourself dying very often.

												Alright, everyone I know is playing this and knows what it is and how it is different from Dark and Demon's Souls so I'm not going to retread old ground. Just wanted to post some specific impressions in more of a list form. There will be mild spoilers but nothing explicit:The game is definitely easier than Dark Souls 1 or Demon's. There's no O&S or Four Kings, bosses that you just dread facing. Espcially on NG+. The closest is a mini-boss in the Iron keep that gives a lot of people problems, but summoning an NPC makes the fight a joke. Yeah, summoning is always the easy way out, but in Dark Souls 2 it feels like an ""I Win"" button, where summoning an NPC in the DS1 bosses mentioned above definitely does not guarantee victory. DS2 does have a really hard optional boss, supposedly, but I was given a small hint that effectively breaks the fight. Yeah, again I would have struggled if I went in totally blind, but the hint I was given really isn't anything cheese-worthy or glitchy. I was just told to ""Attack the back foot"" and ""Run to the tail when he flies."". These 2 things alone allowed me to take on the hardest boss while taking very little damage. I didn't have to spec into anything specific for the boss or otherwise prepare for him. There's no such hint for any of the series' bosses in the other games, to my knowledge. No such strategy for Four Kings, to my knowledge. Not being on GFWL is awesome. I had an easy time summoning and being summoned. Never waited for too long for either. Had a couple server disconnection issues though. I loved writing messages and going back to them in NG+ to remind myself which were rated where to see which were more helpful to more people. I made sure to rate messages that helped me to return the favor. Having not played the other games in co-op to any extent, it was awesome to have a friendly phantom show me a secret bonfire, or watch him for a a little bit during a fight to see a response to a boss tell. Summoning typically makes the game very easy, but the ""jolly cooperation"" is still very enjoyable and well implemented.The game is massive. There are a lot of areas and a lot of different bosses. There is some re-use but less than I was led to believe. Going through on NG+ showed me the extent to which some areas were optional, either explicitly out of the way (Belfries) or simply something not required if you go another path (Bastille boss, No Man's Wharf area). I do agree with the complaint that the areas aren't really interconnected to the extent as they were in DS1. They feel more like different roads that intersect at Majula (the hub). There's no real moment where you end up back at where you were and surprise yourself by learning how various shortcuts connect previously separate areas. I don't really see this as an enitrely bad thing, though. Obviously, Demon's Souls was a series of disconnected levels and this just seems a little more like that. It would have been nice to see a greater degree of connectedness, though.The last part of the game was a bit obfusicated about what you had to do to wrap things up. I had to use a guide to learn what to do to take on the last boss. Though this isn't necessarily bad, it just felt a little bit like an unneeded step, or something that could have been done differently.Lastly, I didn't find the areas as memorable, and my reason why might be a little specific but listen to me here and see if you agree. A lot of the enemies and bosses are very ""humanoid"" Very few of the bosses are interesting monsters or creatures, or at least it felt that way to me. There were a lot of enemies that just felt like zombies in different varients of armor. And if they weren't humanoid, they were something uncreative like dogs. No manta rays or leeches or slimes or golems. Yeah, humanoid enemies being the most common isn't anything new, but it felt even more exaggerated here. Tied to this thought, a lot of the areas felt like different variants of ""Fortress"" or ""Keep"" or ""Woods"". This game doesn't have a ""Blighttown"" or ""Lost Izalith"" or ""Painted World"" or the last part of ""Tower of Latria"" or ""Valley of Defilement"" There's something resembling Blighttown, but it's very short, almost throw away, and plagued with a questionable design choice. It is one of the few areas with entirely un-humanoid enemies, though, which is cool.All in all, it's a very meaty game that I enjoyed a lot. It just feels a little luster-less compared to the other two games in the ""series"".			"

												The game is about as big as the first one despite having much more areas. This comes as the areas themselves are mostly smaller. There were weird transitions which didn't make much sense - totally unlike Dark Souls 1 - but I could forgive them as during playing the game it didn't take me out (I didn't even notice them very far in).From made some very good changes here. I have to laud them for that. Being able to go human at any point, health items, magic items, the revamped UI. All of them brilliant. I understood that even more after I started up Dark Souls 1 immediately after Dark Souls 2. Wow, the UI seems so unintuitive compared. The Co-Op part also feels much better as you can be summoned even when going very far from your sign (which totally hurts DS1 imo). Technically I find it astounding how much FromSoftware improved from their first game. Really, the technical department of From gets to little praise for that. The game runs so well, it's crazy. Bodes very well for inevitable sequels.Visually the game obviously has more to offer but I feel the torch mechanic wasn't as fully realized as it could have been. Having areas which absolutely force you to forgo shields in favor of torch would have made some pretty unique and tense moments but alas it was just a little gimmick I totally forgot after the first couple hours. About the areas again. It feels a bit disjointed at some points but it was still fun to go from a pirate-themed area to a castle-themed one. It was fun, so I can overlook that.There is a big part which disappointed me though which I can't forgive that easily. The bosses. There were generally speaking more bosses than ever but the majority felt like stronger regular enemies. Humans with lots of damage and health. That's not bad on its own but it was like this in just too many cases. I missed memorable bosses like the Gaping Dragon, Manus, Priscilla, Gwyndolin. Instead there were tons of sword-wielding human(oid) enemies like Throne Watcher/Defender, Dragonriders, Ruin Sentinels and even much worse, total rehashes like Bell Gargoyles, Sif and others (!). Very lame indeed. The ones that stood out were not that great either; Old Iron King, Nashandra, Ancient Dragon (most satisfying imo). I also feel they went a bit to overboard with taking influences from O&S - arguably the fan favorites from DS1. Too many dual bosses. I found O&S so memorable because they were the only boss fight with multiple bosses at once. In DS2 there were so many it just lost its uniqueness. Generally lazy boss design.That would be my biggest complaint with the game. All other things I could forgive as the game itself was still fun but the bosses just have to be special for me. That said, I still can totally recommend Dark Souls 2 to anyone - especially Souls veterans. It plays great and is a lot of fun which really counts.Even after 130 hours I have the urge to go back at it. I still don't have the DLC, so there will be at least 20 hours to come on top of that :)			"

												The best game i have ever played. Dark Souls 2 takes everything that was so epic about number 1 and smuggles it into this content jam packed world of Drangleic. This game is near to perfection with both pve and pvp extremely fun and rewarding. Pve this time is alot more visually impressive and runs smoother, but the difficulty level that made Dark Souls 1 so unique has been diminished in this game, Dark Souls 2 has failed to provide a genuinely gritty experience that would leave me feeling overwhelmed with the satisfaction of a hard earned victory as Dark Souls 1 did so many times. I believe this could have been done to expand the market audience by sending the game down a mainstream path of hand holding, motherly loving videogames, but by placing bonfires around almost everycorner and dropping summon signs like they were going out of style, i ended up watching the credits role and thinking ""is that it?"". I just remember emerging from the kiln sitting back and watching the credits role as Gwyn ""the boss who never stopped coming at you"" was finally slayed, Dark Souls 1 was a gaming accomplishment to be proud to have beat, but it seems like everyone is finnishing 2 with out breaking a sweat. There was 1 moment when Dark Souls 2 felt like a genuine souls game which was when i had to fight the Darklurker for the first time on ng+ bonfire aesthetic 3, making my way through those chasms filled with buffed up havels and ricards was a nightmare, just to fight a boss that was armed to the teeth with every sorcery, hex and pyromancy in the game. Slaying Darklurker was the happiest moment i encountered in Dark Souls 2 and i wish the entire Drangleic journey could of been like that. Aside from that subtle but important personal let down the game is a masterpiece, pve is amazing and addicting, the only concern i have about that is healing, basically if you chug that estus then taunt...go f**k yourself.I deffinitley recommend you play number 1 before you play 2. as always...praise the sun!

												Honestly, I wish I could personally recommend this game. In fact, I’ll start off by saying that if all you care about in a Souls game is the PvE, then this game is alright. It’s not as great as Dark Souls 1 in terms of the world building and how the areas are connected (and also not having an NPC that you must talk to enough times to unlock the rest of the game), but if you want additional challenge and more of the unique Souls combat, then this game will provide that. I also give FROM credit for making the PC port run silky smooth on my moderately-powerful computer – there are still ways to improve (like adding in keyboard prompts instead of Xbox controller prompts for those using the K+M), but it is a step in the right direction from the disastrous Dark Souls 1 port.However, my biggest gripe with this game and the reason that I do not recommend this game right now is that gimmick builds for co-op and/or PvP (which I enjoyed very much in the last game) are a thing of the past. Why?It is all because of Soul Memory. While it is a solution to a problem that existed in the previous Souls games, it creates a whole bunch of new problems that really bog down the experience of either smashing bosses for other players or just smashing other players with a giant club.The problem soul memory was intended to fix was the issue of twinking. To be fair, I can understand why this issue needed to be fixed. In Dark Souls 1, people could legitimately get the red eye orb at a low soul level, equip maxed-out weapons, and face stomp new players who happened to be human in the starting areas. This was an issue that needed to be addressed, especially since in THIS game you can no longer hide from invaders as a hollow.As such, instead of co-op/pvp summon ranges being based off of a percentage of your current soul level, the amount of souls that you have collected over the entire game is used to determine what tier you belong to. By the way, when I say “collected”, I mean that whenever the soul counter increases, so does your Soul Memory, so if you die and drop 100k souls and then go pickup said 100k souls, you have an additional 100k souls added to your soul memory. As your soul memory increases, so does the tier that you belong to. The last tier is at 15 million souls, so once you reach this tier, soul memory no longer plays any factor. You can be invaded by people with 30 million, 100 million, or even 999 million soul memory, and they probably spent most of those souls leveling up to do everything and anything on a single character!This is why Soul Memory is such a terrible solution to the twink problem: it destroys the idea of creating unique characters that are designed around a specific level, a set of gear and maybe a selection of spells. You can't even create gimmick characters for specific areas at specific soul levels since once you gain enough soul memory, the chances of getting summoned in that particular area plummets. Do you want to create a silly gimmick character that helps newbies out by punching things for them? Well too bad, because you’ll eventually be forced to move on from the newbie areas.Do you want to create a low level character to fight in the arena, to invade other low-level players in their worlds, or to protect these low-level players as a blue bro? WELL TOO BAD!In the arenas, you’ll be matched against higher level players that are much better equipped than you. One time, my SL 35 character got crushed by someone who was SL 110! Great matchmaking, FROM…Invading players is limited to cracked eye orbs, which require farming said orbs from the arena (home to high-level players) or monsters (who give out souls whenever you kill one, so enjoy screwing up your soul memory). Sure in new game plus, you can buy the cracked eye orbs, but they cost 10k souls a piece, meaning that you will have to greatly inflate your soul memory if you want to keep a stack of cracked eye orbs on hand.Protecting players requires the invader’s target to be in a specific covenant and that you must wear a ring to be potentially picked as the blue bro who will assist. Adding in the fact that invasions are a rare sight early on and you are really lucky if you even get the opportunity to assist someone…hopefully they don’t die before the level loads for you!I could go on about a lot of other issues (stone ring & poise, weird hitboxes) – those I hope will get fixed or balanced out sometime down the line. However, I really hope that the DkS2 team at FROM is really looking at ways to fix their matchmaking system to combat twinks while also preserving the concept of builds. If they can fix this issue of soul memory, then I will likely change my current recommendation status. Until then, I just can’t recommend this.			"

												Following up to the massive success of Dark Souls I, the game takes a massive step back. The world is not only boring, and plain bland, but it's not immersive in the slightest. The geography of the world pales in comparison to Dark Souls, where you always felt you were ""close to home"". This time around we got towers reaching to the sky, with elevators inside it, going ten floors up only to leave us in a lava filled area with a NEW sky. There's 0 coherence in the game, and it's just... boring.This is not a Dark Souls worthy successor in any way, shape, or form. It's simply the same IP used to try and create a successor, albeit failing miserably. The boss fights this time around are easy as well, and ranging from pretty much multi-enemy fights, to a singular enemy wielding a big weapon, that has a 3-hit combo and an overhead swing of different variations.Nothing stands out as memorable, there's nothing comparative to Ornstein&Smough, Sif, Gwyn, or any of the characters from the first game. This is not even mentioning the fact that the plot is completely ripped and rehashed from Dark Souls.In short, it's still a ""good"" game, but it's definitely nowhere near of what it should have been considering the legacy that preceeds it. I'm well aware what game I'll remember in 10 years, and it's not Dark Souls II.5/10 disappointed to hell and back.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played, hands down. I lie you not, this is by no means an overexaggeration. Let me start off by countering the most common misconception about this game. Many people claim that Dark Souls series has no lore hence no actual proper storyline - that is far from true, both the lore and a very well written, unique storyline are there but they are not given to you on a plate - you have to be able to look for all the small hints that are spread throughout the game. Because of this, the game's world, the so called Drangelic, is surrounded by this mysterious, dark aura. If you lack the wits to put two and two together, you will discover only a small portion of the game's storyline. You have to be able to connect the dots and all the pieces out there (the overall feeling while struggling through the harsh world of Dark Souls reminded me of The Walking Dead TV series which I absolutely love).That being said, while the story of the game is of very high quality, it is by no means its main, most appealing trait (at least to me that is). The game's combat system and level of difficulty are unlike anything I have ever experienced when it comes to single player games. Compared to all the other games that are being released these days, Dark Souls 2 is the most challenging thus rewarding, by FAR. There are COUNTLESS bosses in this game, each and every one with unique, complex mechanics and stunning visuals (I will refrain from spoiling but some of the abilities that the bosses use in this game left me simply speechless. Same goes for the bosses themselves). And that is not all. Multiplayer is also present but not as a separate mode - it is strongly linked to the single player experience,  allowing us to interact with players as we progress through the game's main storyline. Let me explain - after first few hours or so, you will obtain an item that will allow you to summon other players, the so called phantoms, into your world. Something to keep in mind though - remember that defeating bosses in Dark Souls on your own will grant you the biggest satisfaction. With phantoms (other players) at your side, some of these fights are simply not as challenging. Your world can also get invaded by the so called 'dark spirit' - an evil entity i.e other player that came to your realm with one sole purpose - to kill you and make you lose your souls. The adrenaline rush I experienced while PvPing in this game is undescribable. The game's replay value is also something worth mentioning. After beating the game for the first time, you will unlock NG+ which stands for New Game Plus (and after beating NG+, NG++ and so forth). Going into NG+ will make the game even more challenging at certain aspects, pushing you to your limits even further. New enemies will lure around every corner, waiting for the perfect opportunity to leap at you from behind and deal a killing blow. As far as I know, the current limit one can reach is NG 10+ but don't hold me to that. Dark Souls 2 has one downside though - it was designed for consoles and the default controls for PC are somewhat lacking thus it is recommended that you get an XBOX 360 PC game controller. Don't get me wrong, the game is definitely playable with the use of mouse and keyboard if you set up your keybinds properly but playing on a console pad feels so much better.If you find this game to be too hard for you, give it some time. You are supposed to die numerous times, that is the way of Dark Souls. I can tell you with an uttermost confidence that you will fall in love with the game and won't be able to get your hands off it. After spending over 200 hours in Dark Souls, I am pretty sure that I will come back to this title over and over again.PROS:+ The game is extremely hard in comparison to other games released these days and thus feels very rewarding.+ Numerous unique enemies (including the bosses with stunning looks and differing abilities).+ The story is well written and quite interesting.+ The game is sorrounded by this mysterious atmosphere, it is dark and creepy hence feels very mature.+ While this game is definitely not a sandbox, there are tons of secrets for you to explore making it far from linear. Ther is no such thing as a minimap and the exploration feels very satisfactory.+ Game's audio is of a very high quality, the voice acting is quite solid, same goes for the amazing soundtrack. CONS:- It pains me that this game was initially released for consoles. This might come as controversial but I can't comprehend why people buy consoles these days. I mean I I know whey they do but it is so silly of them - PCs are better in every aspect. Anyway, lets not stair away from actually reviewing the game. As I have mentioned earlier, controls for PC are somewhat lacking.- Graphics are below average - don't get me wrong, some of the bosses look absolutely stunning, same goes for certain locations in the game. The problem is, the game engine makes them look quite... oldish (I can't say bad cause they definitely do not look bad).. Did you see the Witcher 3 trailer? Compare these graphics to Dark Souls, the gap is colossal. Suprisingly, the game engine for Dark Souls 2 is quite new (at least according to the game developers). To me, it seems like they slightly revamped the original DS1 engine, nothing more.Final Verdict: This year's best game without a doubt, 9.5/10 is a note I am giving to Dark Souls 2, the 0.5 being reserved for a truly perfect game (and Dark Souls 2 comes as close as it gets).So what are you waiting for? If you haven't played Dark Souls 2 yet and consider yourself a fan of the RPG genre, waste no time and seek souls... larger, more powerful souls. Seek the king. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY! Lest this land swallow you whole. As it has so many others.			"

												If you are a fan of Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and you absolutely enjoy a hardcore challange then this game is for you.This game will punish you as your grind your way to the top by killing evil monsters as you cosume as many souls as possible to level up, buy things, reinforce your weaponry, etc.You are not alone in this world though. There are others who are enduring your hardships in other universes. Bloodstaines reveal the last few seconds of another unfortunate soul before they are decimated. Luckily you have the ability to summon or be summoned to other worlds to show great companionship by defeating bosses and receiving rewards in the process. You may also invade other worlds to practice your combat skills against other players.Persistence is what really counts in this game. You can die as many times as you want while going through the game, but once you get that satisfaction after defeating a boss, it's a breathtaking experience and you will release a great sigh of accomplishment that you usually never feel in other games.If you are a casual gamer then this game is not recommended and it is going to be extra tough for you.My level is 147 and counting.

It's like we got early acess game for some moneys but when the 'final' version goes on release everyone will have to buy it again instead of just upgrading.

												It’s quite safe to say that Dark Souls 2 is one of the more polarizing games in the franchise. Back when it first came out, people flung their poo at it and called it a disappointment compared to the previous game and while most people now still do, I have to admit that I was among them at first. I thought that Dark Souls 2 had tried too hard to copy its predecessor, resulting in a fanservice-riddled mess of a game that couldn’t decide whether or not it wanted to be a worthwhile addition to the franchise or a shameless rehash of what we’ve already been through. Thankfully, Dark Souls 2 is mostly the former.Bad news first: This game is indeed sprinkled with shameless fanservice. As an example, you will run into Ornstein as an early boss with no real justification as to why he’s there and you’ll get the same weapon from his soul that you did from the last game. There’s also the Great Lightning Spear miracle which directly references the “grossly incandescent” line that the internet loves so much in its description.The worst part about this game is probably how it, like every other game in the franchise, gets off on killing you as much as possible. There will be a number of occasions where you’ll run into another bonfire not far away from a boss, but there is still a gauntlet of enemies you’ll need to get through in order to actually reach the boss which will likely cost you some healing items and durability on your equipment.Speaking of durability, all of your weapons seem to be made out of butter in this game. Standard weapons like the Broadsword might last you through an area or two, whereas the more fragile weapons like the Malformed Skull won’t even last you through a single boss fight. There was also a bug that originated in the PC version where your hitboxes were tied to your framerate, and the PC versions had a framerate of 60 over the 360/PS3’s 30, so every weapon you swung broke twice as fast. This was fixed after the Scholar of the First Sin remake came out... eleven months after the PC version was released. Design in general is lacking. Enemies don’t have as much variation as they did in the previous game. A fair few of them are humans with regular weapons and some of them are humans with variations on what weapons and armour they have and in varying sizes. Bosses are also mostly large armoured humanoids with greatswords and don’t show much variance there and if we’re including DLC, then in Crown of the Old Iron King, you’ll run into a reskinned Smelter Demon that now creates an AoE explosion when it powers up its core and can now slow down its attack animations to throw off your roll timing. There’s also the Crown of the Ivory King DLC where you’ll run into one new boss, then later on you’ll encounter the same boss again, but you’ll have to fight two of them at once and they have a fun new self-buff ability when one of them dies. They’re accessed through what has to be the most tedious area in the whole game and possibly video gaming history, the Frigid Outskirts. It takes at least five minutes to rush through the area and you’ll have horses shooting lightning up your rear end the whole time. There’s no bonfire any closer to the boss fog, either.There are also a few strange design decisions thrown in, such as a weird, pulsating bloodstain overlay texture appearing on your screen during every pre-boss fight cutscene. There’s no good reason to include this. I can see the giant armoured humanoid with a greatsword in the cutscene, thank you. It’s an eyesore and adds nothing positive to the game and if there were no fog walls mid-stage, there would be absolutely no possible reason to include this.Now, the good news. There are a handful of good game design decisions that make Dark Souls 2 a more player-friendly experience. For starters, you no longer have to venture into the seventh circle of Hell to get to a blacksmith just to ascend one weapon to Fire or something, then upgrade the next four levels later on at a bonfire but only if you have a certain key item like you had to in the previous game. As soon as you find the Dull Ember, you take it to one single blacksmith and he will handle every single one of your weapon’s infusions. He can also upgrade your items just the same as the one in Majula can. You can also swap between weapon infusions and your weapon will retain its upgrade level, instead of having to downgrade your weapon to its +10 standard upgrade path then infuse it into its new upgrade path and wasting all of those upgrade items.For those who find the game too hard, you have the option of using a Ring of Life Protection to prevent yourself from losing your humanity and your souls at the cost of the ring breaking. Unlike the Ring of Sacrifice in Dark Souls 1 and 3 which disappear after use, these rings can be repaired for a few thousand souls each and are very useful for those who either wish to make the PvE easier, or hosts of PvP worlds who do not wish to use their more valuable human effigies should they die. Conversely, there’s the Company of Champions covenant which you can join if you feel like the game is too easy. Joining this covenant will disable your ability to summon phantoms into your world for co-op, make enemies dish out and take more damage and your reward for this is the occasional Awestone drop, which can be traded for a few unique rewards, including a ring which increases your bare fist damage by a lot, making it a very feasible weapon for the whole game. There is also no penalty for abandoning any of the covenants.For those who prefer to play their games in co-op, you’ll be pleased to know that this is easily the best implementation of it that the series has ever had. In the previous two games, you had no direct method of control for who saw your summon sign. Here, a new item called the Name-engraved Ring allows you to pick between ten different gods to favour, then while the ring is on, only people who have also picked that same god can see your summon sign and receive yours. I live in Australia and I have been able to connect to people who live in the US and Canada and it's never taken longer than twenty seconds, compared to Dark Souls which has taken half an hour and Bloodborne, where a connection couldn't be established after a full hour.While this one may be subjective, I feel that it’s worth mentioning that there is also a noticeable degree of absurdity in this game that sits quite well with me. If I can find a weapon in the game that’s both practical and aesthetically pleasing, I’ll use it. There’s the top half of a dragon’s skull, a giant melted lump of iron and a straight up beam sword that all have their uses depending on what you want to build, plus they’re fun to use, very creatively designed and balanced well.While the Souls games have been generally renowned for their ability to be the video gaming equivalent of throwing cupcakes at a wall to knock it over until you eventually do which people seem to perceive as “difficult, but fair”, Dark Souls 2 does have enough good points to contrast against its flaws to the point that it gets a content single thumb up from me, rather than two enthusiastic thumbs up. There are still problems with it, but it’s absolutely serviceable as a video game and while I wouldn’t recommend picking it up at full price, waiting for a decent sale will at least soften the blow if you find it disappointing at all. It may leave a bad taste in your mouth at first with its shoddy art and enemy design, but it’s worth trudging through in the end for the gameplay, weapons and even co-op.			"

												I am a fairly new Dark Souls player, but the hype got to me, I pulled my pants up, finished DS1 and got into the sequel. This game obviously isn't for everyone, but I get the impression that the difficulty has become the key selling point here, which is a bit of a shame for me. Dark Souls 2 will murder you without mercy, but if you can take it and overcome it, you'll feel like the ultimate badass. The game is more polished, bettel looking, has better mechanics and overall is na improvement over DS1 in those terms, but is a bit lacking in terms of story and lore. If you liked theprevious Souls games, this is a must have.However, there are some things that make DS2 fall short. First of all, it seem like they went to extremes when it comes to crancking up the difficulty. If you play this just becasue it's hard, you will love it. For me it feels a bit disappointing. Contrary to Dark Souls 1, this game is less fair - enemies attack in groups, bonfires are not always safe, there are some f*** you style traps that you cannot avoid and enemies in general hit you in situation where in DS1 they wouldn't. I get the impression that the first Dark Souls was hard, but wanted you to overcome it and that made is satysfying, while the second one is just kicking you butt to live up to the hype. The location are also more linear and less impressive and the open world is not as brilliantly interconnected as in DS1 if at all. It seem like FromSoft focused more on gameplay and difficulty, rather than the genral design and lore here and for someone whole loved DS1 for those aspects, it will be disappointing.The lore and story is inferior to DS1 IMHO. Dark Souls was an epic yet sad story about a dyning fantasy world, while DS2 seems to be more focused on the protagonist, and being Dark Souls, there isn't really a consistent plot. This makes it feel bland and the whole story/lore thing seems like something  not on par with the first part. A lot of stuff is just taken straight out of the previous game and one cannot help but feel the devs went all lazy in some parts. Linear levels, a less gripping story and a lot of reused concepts might discourage the people who loved DS1 for the atmopshere.All in all a great game, but if you have never played Dark Souls, you'd be better off starting with the first one, than watch some opinions on YT and decide for yourself, if part two is something you want. If you're a hardcore Souls fan, you'll get it anyway. This is one of those sequels that take a step forward in some aspects and a step backwards in other.			"

												As someone coming from playing over 200 hours of Dark Souls 1, and recently finishing Dark Souls 2; this is my opinion on the title.The world is fairly large and some areas are justly frustrating. Some of these areas are very scenic and draw you in. However, they don't seem to have the same lasting pull as the first game. But to be fair some areas do leave a strong lasting impression. It feels very hit or miss. The game is pretty long though, like the original. Maybe a bit longer.The combat is the same as Dark Souls 1, so you will feel at home here if you are coming from the original. Most of the old weapons make a return, with quite a few new ones. If you are all about stat crunching, they did change them around a bit. At the time of this review the jury is still out on some of the math.PVP is pretty good. In a PC sense... Way better than the original. It's easier to connect to players. It just sucks when you end up fighting a 3v1 sometimes. But overall it holds true to its roots. Not much has changed.Difficulty. Probably what most people are eyeballing. Is this harder than Dark Souls 1? Personally... Yes and No. Some locations are insanely frustrating, wheras other areas are a walk in the park. If you liked the way the original played out, you'll probably like this one. If anything the game feels very much the same, just a new world with the same engine. Which is nice and refreshing. If anything, I want more.One thing I would like to bring up is the Soul Memory system. Instead of gauging multiplayer on soul level, it is now done off of something called soul memory (Which is akin to the total souls you have gathered). It can make things a bit annoying at times, especially if you are a sunbro and want to help newbies out. I feel the game is pretty good. Especially if you like the atmosphere and playstyle of Dark Souls. I feel I got my time and money out of it, and I still am playing it. I've always had fun rerolling characters and trying to make a perfectly statted character for a certain weapon or playstyle.TLDR: It's Dark Souls, and if you like the original. You should give this one a chance. It's pretty fun.			"

Would I recommend this game overall? Yes, definitely.Would I recommend this edition of the game? No. If you are considering Dark Souls 2 as your potential new game, go for Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin edition.			"

												Here's a smal disclaimer before reading my review. If Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition was never made, and this was the first ""Dark Souls"" game, I would have thought this is the best game ever. Dark Souls II was a long anticipated release for me. I was aboard the hype train the second it was announced. However when I played it I was immediatley greeted with disappointment. The level designs didn't flow or connect well at all. The bosses weren't actually hard, and the ones that were hard were either a damage sponge, or fromsoft just decided to put more enemies there, instead of making it challenging. These aren't even the worst offenders. What really offends is the story. In Dark Souls 1 we had an enviornment very literally DRIPPING with atmosphere that told a story of its own, just as we explored the bowels of its cruel world. And some of that is true for Dark Souls II, but the bits of story it actually gives you seems to make little sense, and has no real meaning. Perhaps that's what they were going for? I'm truly still unsure close to a year later. But this wasn't how Demon Souls or Dark Souls was made. The Covenants were nice if they ever worked, not to mention the whole lack of penalty for leaving a covenant. The new Parrying system was absolutely pointless, they had it right in the first game, and this one just seems to want to break up the action. I liked the idea of degenerating health upon death, however there were simply too many ways to avoid it. Combat seemed fine enough and that is a core mechanic of the game, but I fail to see any saving grace for it, when the developers ""balanced"" the combat.  The game isn't a PVP experience first, it's a PVE first, and you don't need to mess with that. I suppose the best parts about this game for me were actually the Expansion Packs. The Areas flowed well and kept my attention, but this was after the fact and it felt like a new team worked on them. At the end of the day, Dark Souls II was a good game if you didn't play Dark Souls or Demons Souls. But for those of us returning to the series, we have nothing to find but disappointment and hand holding. 10/10 Game of the Year "

												A poor sequel to the fantastic Demons Souls and Dark Souls. The game was very clearly put together by a B-team whilst the core talent worked on Bloodborne. Areas, enemies, items and plot are bland and disjointed, the excellent art of the cutscenes does not translate into the game particularly well outside of a couple of areas.Probably the best example I can give would be to compare Sif (a boss from the first game) to ""the rat authority"", a boss from this one. Dark Souls 1 has a beautiful white wolf with a legendary greatsword in his jaws, leaping around an interesting terrain, which slowly gets less effective as he weakens and becomes injured as he fails to protect the grave of the long-dead Artorias, which makes you feel absolutely terrible, echoing Shadow of the colossus. Dark Souls 2 copies and pastes the moveset onto a rat model they've blown up by 800% until it looks terrible, then puts it in a square room with grey walls and a grey floor. Then goes ""whoops, this fight sucks"", shrugs and pastes a few small rats in without much thought. Still a bad boss fight? I know, let's arbitrarily stop the player from summoning co-op partners in that area! Job done and onto the next. Half the game feels like walking through a poundshop and laughing at the brazenly copied (but infinitely inferior) off-brand tat.			"

												Over all this game is a rather disappointing sequel to Dark Souls. A great example of when developers misunderstand what it was about their game that made it so popular, this game seems so focused to let you know that it is ""hard"" and ""not for casuals"" that it misses the allure of the previous souls games. First off, is that this game is rarely ""hard."" What you have to do is generally obvious and simple, the only difficulty comes more from the realm of cheap, than hard. Hidden enemies inside of walls that blow up with know way of you knowing they are there, rooms filled with too many enemies to realistically fight yet they are easily skippable as you merely run past them, and a whole mess of over tracked attacks. You are more rewarded for just running and skipping enemies than fighting them, as levels make such an insignificant difference to the power of your character and there are no items worth finding, that you just chain bosses from start to finish. The bosses are all incredibly bland in design. They are, for the most part, merely tall humanoids with 3-4 hit combos which you merely circle as they do them and attack them in the back until they die. Should you actually try rolling out of danger the attacks will nine times out of ten turn into your character as you are rolling. Blocking is often not a great option as many boss attacks will pierce straight through your shield, though that was not absent from prior games either. Just as bland, are many of the areas through which the game takes place. The ease of the fast travel system and how early, the begining of the game, you get it. Makes each zone feel seperate and completely eliminates the interconnected feeling that Dark Souls gave the player. That interconnectedness gave the feel that it was a real area, that these places were in many spots connected and interacted with each other. Dark Souls 2 instead gives a closer feeling to a Mario game of each bonfire being merely 2-4 of a completely self contained area. Thus despite Dark Souls 2 being a larger game, it's world feels much smaller.All in all this game is not really a bad game and as a result whether or not to recommend the game is difficult to classify as a yes or no. The main issue is that it's just so wholly disappointing that it leaves one with a bad taste in their mouths. This rendered the game incompletable for myself as the whole time I just wished I could be playing Dark Souls, a game with interesting characters, a deep and well thought out plot, and an impressive world. Not a bland action role playing game where my only objective is forward and my only reason for forward is because forward.Overall rating: 3/10			"

												Dark Souls has proven that even in an age when games tend to spoonfeed the player, a niche game can still attract a reasonable following. Its blend of simple yet engaging combat mechanics, fantastic visuals and unforgiving difficulty is a rarity in the industry nowadays that managed to wow players all over the globe, especially those longing for a challenge. Despite that, it was a bit rough around the edges - edges that the sequel smoothened out to some extent. Still, if you loved Dark Souls, you can't help but feel slightly disappointed about this one.At its core, it's Dark Souls all over again: You roam bizarre fantasy environments, fight monsters and upgrade your gear in order to fight monsters more effectively, interrupted only by the occasional invader who is after your hard-earned souls. The differences are in the details.Take the combat, for instance. Essentially, the mechanics remain unchanged, only now your character's moveset lacks Dark Souls' distinctive sluggishness. As a result, combat in Dark Souls 2 feels more fluid, slightly faster and more direct. Unfortunately, it also feels rather weightless. What I always liked about Dark Souls was that its sluggishness conveyed the feeling that the player character's gear actually weighed something. Watching the character struggle when swinging his greatsword gave the combat a certain grittiness - a grittiness that is mostly absent in the sequel.The PC port of Dark Souls is notoriously bad and thankfully, From Software has taken steps to avoid another shoddy porting job. Dark Souls 2 features all the good stuff a spoiled PC gamer is used to. Still, the game manages to be somewhat underwhelming visually.A lot of that comes from the inconsistent art design: Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's lackluster. And sometimes it's just plain awful. A giant castle decorated with spikes within a sea of lava? This is just a few steps above Super Mario World.The environments in Dark Souls are wondrous places and mostly bizarre variations of established fantasy designs like ""old castle"" or ""mysterious forest"". And yet, they possess the quality of making the player stop whatever he's doing and simply enjoy the scenery for a moment. Dark Souls 2 has those environments as well, but they are more scarce. Despite the higher resoultions, the texture work is surprisingly bland and makes repeating textures even more obvious. Many environments suffer from looking washed out and rather grayish. Better lighting and shadowing could have improved the atmosphere.The enemies share a similar perceived blandness in design, in addition to some of them seeming like mere copy and paste jobs from the previous game. Despite its unforgiving nature, Dark Souls rarely felt cheap. Now Dark Souls has turned into the posterboy for ""the hardcore game"" - something that even From Software acknowledges in their promotion material. If you died, it was usually your fault for adapting poorly to the situation. However, much of the difficulty in Dark Souls 2 feels cheap and inflated. Most of the time, it seems that the team knew no other way of providing a challenge than pitting you against multiple enemies at the same time or turning enemies into damage sponges. This is especially painful considering that Dark Souls had quite imaginative and challenging boss fights. Not that the game wasn't guilty of taking a shortcut every now and then, but in Dark Souls 2 it's more of a bad habit.Speaking of shortcuts: The areas aren't interconnected anymore, making Drangleic seem less of an ""actual place"" compared to Lordran. At the same time, it's getting rid of the sense of wonder when discovering a new route into a previously explored area.All of this may sound pretty negative, but it's just nitpicking, really. Dark Souls 2 is weaker than its predecessor (even the soundtrack made by the same composer seems like a step back), but it's still a phenomenal game since the aspects that made the first one great are still present, although slightly fainter. In fact, you should have a blast with this game if PvP was your focus in the previous one. There are far more options that allow you to help other players, fight them or to flat-out turn the game into a glorified griefing engine.Dark Souls 2 is an exceptional game and a good sequel, even though it's lacking in some areas that made the first one great.

												Dark Souls 2 strays away from what made the first game good, but is still fun to waste a couple hours on. The base product is well done, it would be better if they didn't cut out what eventually became the three overpriced DLCs, but the base game is still entertaining. The lore is not as deep, nor as relatable as the first game, but it's still there. If that's what you're into. It's intersting, the first game started linnear and then let you loose as they rushed to meet the release date deadline right after Anor Londo. In this game, it does the exact opposite. Completely letting you off the leash straight from the start. This does well in the beginning, seeing how it's near impossible you won't find a path way to go. Though this system is not without fault, since there are multiple directions, when you finally exhausted mostly every path, it's easy to get lost, forcing me to look on the internet how to get to the next part of the game. An act of which I heavily try to avoid in any RPG related game. Another issue, the game is easy as hell. The only boss I had problems with was ""The Ancient dragon,""  the only reason he was hard was because he killed you in one hit. I saw this to give a false, cheap sense of difficulty when the only reason a boss is hard is not because of their multiple attack patterns, but the amount of damage they dish out. The game also seems to treat you like a child at times when bosses eventually become average mobs. I'm talking about the Rat boss, and the Pursuer. The last issue I have with this game is that the world isn't held together like it was in the first game. In Dark Souls 1, the world constantly had backgounds of where you once were, and new pathways which allowed you to make your way back to that area. In the end, the whole world was connected, which added heavily to the realism of the game, and it's ability to suck me into it's dark and dangrous world. This game is held together by loading screens, and next to no reminder as to where you were. If I looked at an overhead map of the game, I would have no idea where anything was because none of it fits together in a way I could recognize.The Graphics were quite acceptional, the frame rate barely slowed, though there were times where it did. Light reflects off the armor you wear, and sometimes even your weapons, and the cloth areas of your outfit flow in the wind in a very believable fashion. Now comes the treatment of the consumer. B team treated fans of the Dark Souls series like ♥♥♥♥ with the release of it's long awaited sequel. Making PC consumers wait one month for its release, (which seems to also be being done with the third game.) lying about the ""there will be no DLCs"" part, and openly admiting that the day one release version of the game was the ""beta version."" Makes me quite sick to the stomach that I even bought this game.The only good things about the game is the combat, which felt very good and well paced with the enemies, it's ability to entertain, and sometimes even surprise. As this games ability to hold its own against the first game, it doesn't even come close.Also, the story is nonexistant. People will argue there's lots of it. That's a lie though, no one truly knows the story except the creator himself.Gameplay: 8/10Story: 2/10graphics: 8/10Consumer treatment: 4/10Overall score: 7/10 ""Not a true sequel, but entertaining""			"

Dark Souls™ II does everything it's predecessor did, but it does it better, bigger, and even bolder.The Good:· It's Dark Souls from start to finish. You'll collect souls, die, and do it all over again until you've reached your goal, and it's still as addictive as ever.· Simply everything has improved. I'd list all the things here, but that'd take me ages. Better customization, better enemies, better world design, better combat, better immersion, better atmosphere, overal better everything. · Rarely did any game involve me into its story as Dark Souls did. There are little checkpoints (that come in the shape of Bonfires) and enemies grow tougher, stronger and larger in numbers as you progress. This makes for a hardcore and unforgiving experience that won't just glue your fingers to your controller or keyboard and mouse, but one that'll suck you in and drown you in its vast and beautiful dark fantasy world.The Bad:· For some people it may be a bit too hardcore. When you die, for example, you will lose a chunk of your maximum health that can only be restored with human effigies. I personally found this a bit too punishing for newcomers, but I've played countless hours of Dark Souls on Xbox 360 to know the satisfaction it brings when you finally push through one of the many hard moments this game brings. · Even though I personally think the PC version is superior, I'd still recommend a controller. Mouse- and keyboardsupport works just fine, but somehow using a controller made me feel more connected to the world.The Ugly:· Dark Souls™ II is filled with detail and perfection that makes this world one of the most beautiful ones I've ever seen in a video game to date. It's large, open, filled with threats, the textures and lighting is much sharper than the original and the game runs at a solid sixty frames per second. Absolutely beautiful.Final verdict:· If you like a challenge, you'll love Dark Souls™ II. Simply one of the most addictive games I have ever played and a huge improvement over every single aspect of the original Dark Souls. May the lord have mercy on my soul(s). 9.5/10 "

												Other than in sheer size and amazing cloth physics, DaS II doesn't even seem to try to improve on the previous game...Most bosses feel uninspired, the hitboxes are really messed up sometimes, the lore isn't as interesting as it was in the first one and the story feels lacking... Who are the owners of those 4 souls and really, why am i to kill them? The exposition is lacking...Despite all the problems the game does have, overall it's still pretty great, and this time they put some real effort on the PC version, making it the definitive one out of the avaliable 3. If you liked DeS and DaS you'll definetly want to play this. It's not the best of hte series, but that means very little, and if you never played a Souls game before, this is a good starting point, since it's ♥♥♥♥ easy compared to the other two...Fashion also plays a much larger role in this one, with the help of the afforementioned cloth physics and brand new armours. How doesn't like some good ol'Fashion Souls?			"

												I played the original Demon Souls a long time ago and gave up after the first couple levels (I think I beat the first boss! Yay!). After skipping Dark Souls 1, I reckoned it was time to try out Dark Souls 2 see if it had changed at all. I can't say if it's more difficult than Dark Souls 1, but it's still definitely a fun game. Remember, this is coming from someone with little experience with this hardcore RPG genre :P I'm advancing through the game at a surprisingly fast pace, and so far the real challenges for me have been understanding the different stats about which weapons work and which don't. Then understanding the right tactics for fighting certain enemies and managing your consumable potions and stamina. Dark Souls 2 focuses so much on ""core gameplay"" and that's why I think so many people love it. It's not about grabbing a sword and slashing things apart, it's about understanding when to slash and when to not. Might sound a bit basic but it's more complicated than it sounds! You will die a lot, but you'll also have a lot of fun along the way!			"

												A deep yet (somewhat) accessible game that rewards the patient and the experienced. Its believable atmosphere of a ruined and decrepit land is coupled neatly with the grueling combat, constantly pushing players to the skin of their teeth, forcing them to learn from every mistake as they venture through the seamless world of Drangleic.The low amount of NPC interactions in this game is one of the game's noticable traits, but it does little to detract from its quality. With the hallowing journey the players have to go through, they tend to treasure every moment spent with tranquility, justifying the previous design choice.Drangleic is a sprawling world filled with secrets and loot, but not everyone can reach their prizes safely without effort, for the combat system forces you to strategize with every move you make - one false attack can cause a chain reaction that results in your death, and Undeads revive with a steep cost.

												A fairly decent ""sequel"". This time it's not a rushed console port, at least.I can't find any reasons to consider it better or worse than its predecessor on anything but gameplay/technical aspects, which have been greatly improved. Considering it bad because it's not from the same director is just dumb.There's some small annoyances, like just how much time and effort you'd have to waste trying to rank up on two specific covenants. I had enough with maxing out my devotion on the company of champions after an entire afternoon of farming, but 500 victories each on brotherhood of blood and blue sentinels for rank 3? no thank you. I can also understand why some people are upset about the whole stunlocking thing (no more ""poise tanking""), but oh well, it's just a matter of knowing how to play, it's not like you'll always be stunlocked to death.The combat is pretty fun, I still haven't quite got the hang on this ""PvP"" thing, but I've been in some pretty entertaining fights (didn't care about losing some of them). Coop is also very fun. (I hope you don't hate the word ""fun""). I'm aware that quite a lot of people are on some sort of crusade against the introduction of soul memory, but to be honest, I don't find it so bad, in fact it makes online play at higher levels not feel ""dead"" unless you restrict yourself to a very specific level.I got into Dark Souls not very long ago, hated it at first until I actually stopped being a whiny kid and got good. I'd say it's one of my favorite series now, it has kinda inspired me as a developer sometimes, and I think I might just do a cute little fangame one of these days.Of course, I recommend both games to everyone.PS: The ENB idiots can just kindly GTFO back to their waifu simulators. This game does NOT need that filthy unfixable undebuggable garbage written by an incompetent homophobic luddite programmer with awful tastes. GeDoSaTo gets the job done AND on top of it all, it's FOSS, so I approve.			"

												Around five years ago, Demon's Souls arrived in North America. That is when I started playing this series and have fond memories of the story, world setting, armor designs, and weapons. The entire package had me drawn in. The feeling of exploration and fantasy, victory and defeat, hanging out with the blacksmith when he fixes my sword, and meeting fellow explorers during difficult times. It was also one of the first games that crossed my fingertips where it could start all over in what was known as a new game mode.Years have passed since then, and I almost wonder if my memories have faded. With no longer any access to a gaming console I thought the ability to play a Souls game would remain only a memory. Then I ran into Dark Souls 2, for PC. From a technical perspective the game runs fine. So far no crashes and the performance seems okay. Lost connection to the online component here and there, and the game is really made for a controller but this should not be a surprise given its roots.As it stands however, this iteration of the game has not left any fond memories. The more I play it, the less I want to continue, not to mention revisit in another timeframe or as NG. The game deserves credit for getting me to take care of some items and chores long overdue on my todo list, as it was more appealing to do work then to play the game, oddly. This is not fun. And the thought of new game mode has me remembering that most of what I played was off, in a wrong kind of way. Not enjoyable at all, to put it simply. The line, whether it is believed to be a fine one or not, has been crossed in a big way.Every step you take in this game has to be checked and then re-checked. You will learn to peek around every corner, and look down at every floor tile. You will learn to keep a stack of 999 arrows in your backpack when you reach the next writing on the floor that reads sniper spot/ranged attack. Then you will spend the next ten minutes chipping pixels of health off a few of the many enemies that exist in the next encounter. All of which can stunlock your character until you fall over. You will find archers/mages with homing arrows/spells placed all over the game world specifically to make melee based encounters massively frustrating. Often times these are in place in narrow areas with fall-to-your-death opportunites right at your side.You will discover that you have a favorite weapon, and then a pile of non-favorites to use when yours breaks on the third enemy away from the bonfire. You will discover that you can be staggered very easily by enemies, and that you can take most of their health away while they do not stagger once. You will discover that enemies do not follow the same game world rules as you do. While your weapon bounces wildly off objects and walls, they can melee through objects and through entire corner sections of walls after you run around for cover. As a result, you'll learn that sipping estus flasks around corners is a massively bad idea. You will discover you have nearly no stamina, and that enemies appear to have unlimited stamina. You will find that no matter how far across the display your health bar reaches, two or three hits always seems to defeat you. The point has been made, I think.These things I know by heart now, due to all the hours spent in this game world. For some reason, continuing on the hopeless journey to find fun. Maybe that was the entire point the game was trying to convey? What I remember to be fun in Demon's Souls does not exist here at all. Entire map sections are created specifically to be the most tedious and boring experiences I've spent in any game to date. You learn to solve every encounter based on 1s and 0s rather than by being immersed in the world and using strategy. My fault for not spending time reading reviews and instead being blinded by a previous experience. I'll try not to make the same mistake next time. Not recommended.			"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh7sVefeu-4After three long years of scouring every nook and cranny of Lordran in anticipation of conquering a new crumbling, pestilent fantasy world , Dark Souls 2 has arrived and we are prepared to die again... and again. While this entry in the Souls franchise takes place in Drangleic instead of the familiar Lordran, players will still take control of a chosen undead to rise up and light the bonfires to stave off another age of darkness. Standing between your humble avatar and the salvation of the damned landscape that surrounds you are numerous terrifying monstrosities and unnerving NPC's who are prone to articulating unnerving and ominous warnings.In foul and crumbling Drangleic where Dark Souls lays it's scene, King Vendrick thrust his kingdom into ruin after declaring war with the Giants across the sea. Using their souls to construct his castle, Vendrick earned the ire of the giants and plunged his kingdom into chaos with the survivors of the fray turning into undead who must fight to maintain their humanity lest they turn hollow. While the narrative still unfolds in the nuanced manner that characterized past Souls tales, players will noticed Dark Souls 2 features a more refined story. There is still much to be left up to player's interpretations with many details to be found in item descriptions and conversations with the various citizens of Drangleic. Series veterans will find many allusions to the previous games and a few subtle tie-ins. As is customary in the Souls series, cut scenes are limited, mainly used to introduce the lethal bosses that players will encounter, thereby never interrupting the pace and flow of the game. While Dark Souls 2 does try to draw players in by being a bit more accessible, it would be foolish to think that the series has gone soft in an effort to sell more copies. Drangleic is quite a bit more difficult and unforgiving than Lordran or Boletaria from Demon's Souls and those looking for a challenge will be more than satisfied. As someone who has personally beaten both Dark Souls and Demon's Souls numerous times, I'm not afraid nor ashamed to say that I died on more than one occasion in Dark Souls 2. Deaths can feel a bit more cheap and sometimes unavoidable; but the game manages to get away with it by offering an unmatched sense of reward, compelling players to continue even after the most egregious deaths occur.Veterans will also breath a sigh of relief upon realizing that Dark Souls 2 has not been made more linear to increase it's mass appeal. Upon reaching Majula, the game's hub location, players are given minimal guidance and are left to their own devices; being simply told to seek the king and gather four powerful souls. The NPCs that you encounter in your travels will congregate in Majula offering goods and services for sale as well as other means of upgrading your character. Certain actions can also result in slight upgrades to the town area in Majula an incentivize return trips. These features add a sense of community to the harsh and lonely world and each change to Majula feels like a milestone in the progression toward the game's conclusion. While having a constant safezone to visit as a reprieve from combating the monstrosities inhabiting the games locales is welcome, the tedium of being forced to return to Majula to level up isn't exactly among Dark Souls 2's strongest additions. Once players decide to leave Majula, they can tackle the available areas in any order they wish though clever design choices ensure that players are on the path that they need to be without feeling as though they are a sheep to be corralled by the game's level design. Unfortunately, while the game world in Dark Souls 2 is larger than it's predecessor, it's suffers from a sprawling design that leaves it feeling less interconnected and forces players to rely on fast travel much more.  You won't find as many of the clever short cuts as there were in Lordran and as such, Dark Souls 2 provides players with the ability to fast travel from the onset. There are some positives that come from this design choice however, the larger world makes exploration more exhilarating and there is much greater variety in the game's areas. The secret areas and items are more obscure than ever and require plenty of searching to find. Rather than simply having illusory walls that you have to strike to open, the inclusion of walls that need to be activated by enemy attacks, or explosions make them all the more difficult to find.Combat is fundamentally unchanged but is far more refined. Changes to various classes provide more viable play styles than before. Shields are far less powerful than they were in previous games making dodging and rolling more important as well as making the temptation to dual wield or two hand a weapon for more powerful attacks while foregoing a shield altogether more appealing. These changes wouldn't mean much without a cast of dangerous and disgusting enemies to test your sword and board or casting skills against. Fighting even the lowliest enemy involves a bit of strategy and care and groups can really be a test of skill as you manage your stamina and methodically butcher them. Torches have also been added which are held in your left hand in place of a shield. They can be lit by any bonfire helping illuminate your way in dangerous areas.  Lamps lit by your torch stay lit for the duration of the game, and certain enemies will react differently to light as well, such as a certain long-armed monster that will run and hide when approached with a torch or act far more aggressive towards players without one. When an epic orchestral theme starts to play in favor of the normal ambient noise, it's likely that you will find yourself standing toe to toe with one of Dark Souls numerous and varied bosses. The boss fights are more intense than ever showcasing the game's unique game mechanics. While a lot of the bosses felt similar in past games, each of them feels unique and different from one another in this installment. From requiring quick reflexes to killing enemies in a specific order as well as positioning and memorizing attack patterns, there is no shortage of new and innovative challenges in Dark Souls 2. The optional bosses add another degree of difficulty as they’re quite a bit harder than the final boss of the game.The art direction has been improved from the other Souls games, as the environments offer greater variety and feel more distinct from one another. Thankfully, this entry relies less on the gloomy interiors of previous titles and features some brightly lit locals that maintain the atmosphere of loneliness and desperation that characterizes the series but aren't as fatiguing to travel thought. Games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill seem to have an influence on this installment as well, as visiting a village filled with crazed villagers and traveling through a foggy forest are quite memorable. Some areas are absolutely stunning though the tech powering Dark Souls 2 is still rather disappointing. Textures can have horrendously low resolutions in some areas and  some really poor tiling can is noticeable on certain structures.If you’ve never experienced the frustration, wonder, and excitement of the Souls games, now is as good a time as any to start. Bertolt Brecht once said, “Do not fear death so much but rather the inadequate life.” and we here at Analog reviews say, “An inadequate gamer is one who has not experienced Dark Souls.”			"

												This Game is a teriffic, You'll get a great sense of discovery as you piece together the layout of each new zone, and having the ability to warp between the checkpoint-like bonfires right from the start is a godsend. The result is a port that looks markedly better than its console cousins, even at standard 1080p on modest hardware. Textures are sharper, while character details are easier to make out but Dark Souls II is, like its predecessors, brilliant, beautiful, and absolutely essential. "

												A sequel to one of my favourite games of all time, Dark Souls II is pretty hard to put in words, because even though it still makes me have fun nowadays, it lacks in the most important parts. The game kicks you in the nuts and says that you're an undead being attracted to a decaying realm with the same story as the first being followed like its some kind of monster hunter, Same formula, wrong decisions. Its just even more vague than the first one, where we grasped to find answers and link the storyline together, this one tries it again, but ends up lacking, as if they rushed the game to give a sequel along with the great hype that the Artorias of the Abyss DLC left.I am hugely disappointed with from for releasing an unfinished game. When they announced scholar of the first sin, it changed my view completely, and now I will only recommend this game when the first sin is out, and if by then it is as polished as a sequel to dark souls should be, I'll change this review. Until Then, If you're going for this game, be prepared for disappointment in terms of story. None of the Characters have more than two layers of depth in development. They're all untoasted pieces of bread that deserved a single release, which could've been What Scholar of First Sin might be.Why release a unfinished game, from? It's a question that still lingers my mind every day.So, here's my verdict:Dark Souls II is an enjoyable game, but with a disappointing aftertaste.PS: they didn't fix the game.			"

												Not even -THAT- dark.Does not surpass it's predecessor by any means, the small improvements let it have its own appeal, however it lacks in terms of level and enemy design. No cleverly placed shortcuts like in Dark Souls 1, too many big, humanoid guys in plate armour for bosses and a general focus on making areas DIFFICULT instead of INTERESTING, which ultimately fails to work, since you are given pretty much infinite amounts of healing items, making the game less enjoyable overall.However, beeing LESS enjoyable than Dark Souls is nothing shameful, given how amazing it was.

												//    This review is based on a first experience with the franchise and focuses exclusively on PVE!    //Dark Souls II was a pleasant suprise after I finished the game, despite it leaving a sour taste in my mouth the first time when I started playing it. No wonder, this was my first time playing with the franchise and the learning curve was a bit huge.But as I explored the world of Drangleic and fought more enemies, I slowly learnt the game's mechanics, and I got hooked up into the game. Yes, Dark Souls II is hard and it will punish you for every mistakes, but if you put enough time and effort into it, you will eventually finish the game. And nothing feels better than finally beating a boss, that has been murdering you over and over again.The concept of the Dark Souls II is simple, yet extremely addictive:You play as a cursed undead and set on a journey in Drangleic to save yourself and lift the curse. As you travel you defeat enemies and absorb their souls.Souls serve as both EXP and currency to purchase new items or upgrade your current loadout.But here's the catch: if you die you will lose your unspent souls. All of them. If you can go back to the location where you have died, you can reclaim them, but if you get killed again before you can do so, your souls are lost permanently.Furthermore, each time you die your maximum HP will decrease a bit and you become a hollow. This HP punishment keeps going on with each death till your max HP is 50% of the original. This might sound extremely harsh, but that's the way of the game communicating with you and teaching the error of your ways. The process can be reversed by using a Human Effigy. This item restores you back to max HP and gives you back your humanity. As a human you can summon NPC-s and fellow players to aid you on your journey, while you can't do that when you are hollow (basicly zombie mode).As you discover new areas you will come across bonfires, these will be your checkpoints and your fast travel stations.As you get deeper into the game the curiosity will lead you further and pushes you to progress: - Can I survive the next area?- What's behind that gate? - How to get THAT treasure over there?- This didn't work, but what if I try something else?I often just started up the game to make a small progress in the game and ended up spending hours, so believe me when I say it's addictive.The multiplayer is also an essential part of Dark Souls. There's no exact multiplayer mode, but it's nicely integrated into the singleplayer: as you travel you will see the spirits of fellow players, who are still in the same area, but in their own game session. Players can communicate with each other by leaving messages to help or hinder others, and if someone dies during the game they will leave a bloodstain behind. Interacting with the bloodstain will show the last few seconds of the player before he passes away, sometimes it helps alot as it warns of the surrounding danger and sometimes it's just hillarious to watch how others die. During the gameplay other players can invade you and kill you, while others can be summoned to help you.Graphics wise the game is average, it doesn't look bad, but it's far from looking great too.However the level design is extremely well done, there are plenty of secrets to discover, and the every section is well connected to another.Not much to say about the sound design. The game doesn't have any music most of the time, only in boss battles. However the ambient sounds, the voice acting and the creatures' sounds are very well done.Overall, I have to say I really enjoyed the game, and would highly recommend it to anyone, who's looking for a challanging game. PROS- Hard, but fair game: if you die, it's your fault.....well most of the time. But when you make a huge progress int the game, it feels rewarding.- Dark atmosphere and the constant pressure the game puts on you.- High number of story and optional boss fights.- Interesting story and lore.- Satisfaction and freedom of exploration: the game doesn't tell you much. No waypoints, no map, you discover everything on your own.- Solid voice acting and sound design.- Performance wise the game is well optimized. It runs well on weaker computers too with solid 50-60FPS.- High replay value.CONS:- Hitboxes can be a bit off.- Graphics are average. Not bad, but far from amazing too.- Control-wise it's a lazy port. Can you play it with keyboard and mouse? Yes, you can. But you will need to remap many keys, as the mouse doesn't really work as intended for many actions such as jump attack and parry.- Some bosses are too easy.			"

												Já que o Witcher 3 foi adiado para 2015, definitivamente esse aqui é o Game of the Year com folga. Se você jogou Dark Souls, com certeza vai gostar do II, embora alguns digam que ele é mais fácil já que possui facilidades que o primeiro jogo não tinha, a dificuldade é a mesma basicamente, com exceção do início, que na minha opinião é bem mais complicado do que o primeiro jogo. A não-linearidade permitida a você nos primeiros 75% do jogo é muito bem desenvolvida, e com o novo sistema de Soul Memory ao invés de Level, é muito mais fácil encontrar outras pessoas para Co-Op ou PvP, independentemente da área que você escolheu ir primeiro. Recomendo também jogar pelo menos o primeiro New Game +, com novos inimigos, que usam novas variedades de ataques, é como se o seu primeiro playthrough fosse nada mais do que um treinamento para o NG+, onde o jogo realmente começa.

												Like the first one this game will keep you busy while having fun and raging a bit for the deaths you will make. In the main story you will die less and find it a little bit easy compared to the first one  but it is still challenging and good. With the Crown DLCs that have been released in the past months you will see how the game changes in difficulty : traps, more harder boss fights, strong enemies specially in groups that will require you to be a little bit more tactic and carefull (one mistake and you are dead) and of course more deaths.The only cons of this game is that there is no cloud save for it so be very carefull and make a back up copy of the game save once every week to be safe so you don't have to start all over again!Graphic is good and combat system for me looks a little bit better than the first.In the end I would reccomend this game spent over 290+ hrs on it 8.5/10.Ps : sorry if there are any grammar errors!

												After logging 350+ hours on this game and conquering it several times I have to say this is one of the better RPGs this year.  If you haven't learned from others already then let me break it to you, if you don't like death or game overs, this game is not for you.  You will never, at any point, utterly destroy enemies.  You will never, at any point, have an easy time.  You will never, at any point, become so skillful that the game is a joke.  This is not a hack and slash, this is survival of the fittest.  This game plays off of fear and bravery, choice and death.  Almost every ""character build"" is viable for beating the game, as long as you have the skill necessary.Dark Souls 2 shines in PVP and PVE.  In PVE the game developers shoot you at difficult enemies, only when you learn their attack patterns and how to fight Dark Souls style will you ever survive.  The bosses are difficult, certain bosses being easier than others depending on your build, but atleast one will challenge you like no other.  And there are several!  Several more bosses than Dark Souls, though a few do seem less designed and cared about than their former works of art.  None of them gave me the fear in my gut that Dark Souls 1 did, but yet if you let your guard down, for even one second, they will punish you.  PVP is a complete different story.  The hacking will never be completely fixed, the community just needs to understand that.  Out of 100+ duels I have only seen a hacker twice so it's not as common as they would have you believe.  PVP is a mountain in this game, the learning curve is STEP.  Playing another player in a fight to the death is the most adrenaline filled experiance I have ever witnessed.  One mistake, just one, and it's over, no second chance.  After the initial character buffing it normally takes less than 10 seconds to decide the victor, it's that quick.  Player skill is in high demand in this area, your cookie cutter copy paste build that you gathered from online sources all over Google will not save you.  If your good enough you can win with no armor and just a dagger with all your stats in faith.  Or you can have the build that beat the entire game fail within the first blow given.  Just because you beat the game doesn't mean you can beat a phantom.    When you are locked underneath the planet, without souls and humanity, with no one around but the constant moan of the cursed, remember you signed up for this.  You signed up to die over and over again.  And deep inside you love it.			"

												If you truly loved and understood the first game Dark Souls II will be a massive disappointment, it was made by a newer development team and its clear much of it was rushed and unfinished.  The defining sin for this game is that it does not match the consistency of combat that the previous game did with enemies having incomprehensible hit boxes at times and over track your movements sometimes turning as much as 180 degrees and hitting you with the tail end of an animation after you've dodged behind them.  Its pretty disgusting, even the pvp is worse in this game the soul memory system pushes everyone eventually into the exact same build and theres just as much lag and hacks ruining pvp as in the first game.  If you are only interested in pvp I guess get it, but if you actually appreciated the world that dark souls created this game is spitting on that legacy i'd reccomend you avoid.  Its in almost all areas a downgrade from the previous game, even the graphics are very inconsistent, level design is terrible, enemy design especially bosses are awful seemingly they just came up with a bunch of ideas they thought would be cool and then slapped them haphazardly into the environments they came up with the same way.  The game doesnt look anything like what we saw with the demo's that came out at TGS or whever, realy really disappointed.  Shame on you from soft.			"

												Dark Souls II is the (worthy?) successor to the game that was known for not holding anyone's hand and spit at your face at the same time when you ♥♥♥♥ed up, each death was your very own fault after all.So how much did change? Is it an upgrade to its predecessor? Did it remain challenging after so many people were complaining about its difficulty? Let's see.First of all a relief to all souls veterans among us, yes Dark Souls II did retain the difficulty of its predeceessor. The developers did exactly what they have promised, they made the game more accessible while maintaining its well-known artificial difficulty.Players that were new to the souls series had a hard time in Dark Souls as there were no hints where one should proceed and there was merely a 33% chance to pick the right (and only) path that wouldn't screw you over from the beginning on, many mechanics of the game were a mystery until one searched the wiki for information - All of this isn't the case in Dark Souls II anymore. People who aren't completely new to games should be able to make perfect sense of the mechanics present in Dark Souls II within their first few hours of playtime.So what does make Dark Souls II an upgrade to its predecessor?Just one word, functionality. People who ""tried"" to play the multiplayer part of Dark Souls will know what I mean by that, for those who didn't, the multiplayer part of Dark Souls was barely playable. If you were lucky you would connect to a random player in 1 out of 15 cases, connecting to friends was basically impossible without using the proper mods, and even by using them it still felt a lot like gambling.In Dark Souls II everything works as it was intended, summoning other players works in 99% of the time, also the developers added a specific ring to the game which makes playing with your friends a lot more simple.So functionality is a big plus in Dark Souls II in direct comparison to Dark Souls, but are there any downsides?Yes, unfortunately. Everyone who has played Dark Souls will remeber bosses like Smough & Ornstein and The Four Kings known for their high difficulty and uniqueness, also most people will remember the complex and fascinating level design from Dark Souls. Sadly none of these aspects made it to Dark Souls II.As a matter of fact, most bosses in this game look rather boring and unoriginal compared to the bosses in Dark Souls. Same goes for the level design, don't expect the same magnificent level design from Dark Souls, you won't find it here. Also the way of how some areas are connected to each other just gives me the headache, it feels like they were designed seperate from each other, and then just ""somehow connected"" when they were done. Best example for this being the transition from Earthen Peak to Iron Keep. Seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥ From Software? Even with that elevator it's still completely absurd.Okay, so which game is better?Well, none really. In my personal opinion I would say that Dark Souls is better in terms of level and enemy design, while Dark Souls II is the more functional game. Does that make one game better than the other? Not at all. Both games are amazing and people who enjoyed Dark Souls simply can't go wrong with Dark Souls II. I had 700 hours of playtime in Dark Souls and +200 hours in Dark Souls II (still going) at the time I wrote this review, for those who care.			"

												Rating: Solid 9/10Dark souls 2 is an unforgiving and mysterious combat driven game. It's all Dark Souls 1 was and more, but slightly less. First off, the PC Port is great, it isn't the trainwreck that one was and fully playable, the summoning works too; about 5 second waits between duels in the Iron Keep and constant co-op in most areas.Compared to one, the art style is less of itself, the hollows that would shake their broken weaponry at you at mach5 speeds are now actual hollows, dead soldiers in armor, simply succumbed to the curse instead of some tattered prisoner. It's beautiful in it's own right, yet not as charming as it once was.I hold no doubt in this being the more accesible and enjoyable Dark Souls game. New players will quickly find their place in Drangleic and begin to piece together what they are.Combat---Combat in Dark Souls 2 is truly amazing, there is 186 weapons between the 19 categories; Great swords, Katanas, Spears, Axes, Whips, Bows, Catalysts, etc. Each have their advantages and disadvantages between the many variables such as Move set (how you use it in combat), durability, special attacks, speed, power, poise break damage, reaction to shields and the like.To go alongside this huge arsenal is 106 armor sets with their own effects and looks, as expected of any good Fashion Souls game.A good man at arms will be handy with a wide variety of weapons as a good mage will be handy with a wide variety of magic and hexes. There is no lack of weapons to upgrade, infuse and try and as a result stays fresh even after the fourth playthrough.PvP is a big experience, its highly accesible and truly fun against people close to your skill level and higher, it has evolved in the community to have its own generally known events and etiquette from fight-clubs to duels, all have their own kinds of players. For example, in the arena of the Brotherhood of Blood, you will find that players play to the covenants theme, cut-throat and mercilessly.Story---I wish I could say a lot about this, but I'd just end up rambling and spoiling. Dark Souls chooses to not notice you as it simply sits there and lets you play it compared to other games in which they will tell you what is happening, why its happening and maybe throw in a few plot twists. This is not a souls experience. The mysterious story telling seen here is simple, you piece together what you are and go from there and make your own story from ingame notes such as Item Descriptions, things you notice by chance and sudden realizations, example! In  The Majula Mansion Basement you will find shards of the long forgotten Lord Vessel from DS1. In Drangleic? Perhaps its a coincidence, but not in dark souls. Perhaps its a hint to Lordran and Drangleic being the same place. Are we simply reliving the past, losing grasp of what really happened with each part of the series? This is possible as the games do share their similarities in NPC's and presentation. Or do you have your own theory? Yes? Good, thats what the story is all about, taking what you want and sharing it with the community. Not a single person is truly right about the story and with that comes a great community effort to build whatever is true. Remember who you are, don't lose purpose and maybe you'll make it to the end without going hollow.			"

												Good game as always, but DS2 borrows too heavily from the past games to make itself unique. There's beautiful visuals and fun gameplay that's challanging is most areas however there's a lot of extremely familiar boss fights, environments and characters  with extremely familiar enemys and weapons. I really wanted a whole new cut of the Souls experience but I feel like I'm playing Dark Souls + Demon's Souls all over again no new experiences really. The experience would be a lot better from the perspective of somebody who'se brand new to Souls games; However if you're a ""vet"" of the franchise then it's going to be a little mundane and you'll constantly be thinking you've done this and seen this all before - because you have. Underneath all of that though it's a solid game with solid characters - solid mechanics and solid level design with the as-always mysterious plot and setting - but it's just not as engrossing as the first 2 games of the series, it's just far too familiar to be as interesting as they used to be. The Music isnt very memorable this time around either, none of the songs I've heard really caught my attention apart from the Majula background music. I still recommend this game however as it's one of the best I've played in months - just not as memorable as the last titles.			"

												Don't believe the metascore. From software very cleverly hid all of the problems in the game in the later parts so as to avoid them being reviewed (as reviews are usually based on a few hours of play).Firstly: They literally false advertised the matchmaking features of the game, ""Soul memory will match players based on a lot of complex factors including character level, areas visited, and gear being used."" This is a blataint lie, the soul memory system merely counts the total number of souls you have obtained in the game and places players into extremely wide brackets based on this total. They completely ignore character level, gear, and everything else they stated but very cleverly made it so the lower brackets (the ones you spend the first 10-20 hours in) are so narrow you can't be matched with a player massively overleveld on you. after you break through the roughly 30 hour barrier tho you are guaranteed to be paired with players who massively outlevel you (200-300 levels higher than you if you are lucky.)Secondly: The netcode is atrocious in this game. google ""dark souls 2 phantom hits"" and have your self a laugh. Certain weapons are particularly poorly coded. Players like to say ""if you swing a katana in new york, you'll hit everyone in california"".I understand lag is an issue but these hitbox problems occur duirng SINGLE PLAYER and OFFLINE. Even if it were unique to multiplayer it would still be no excuse. The infinately superior dark souls had virtually no problems with hit detection or even lag. There are a lot of other issues having to do with balance but those are minor gripes and could easily be overlooked if the core of the game was even half as solid as it's predecessor.If you're on the fence about buying this game you can get off now. If you own it do everyone a favor and don't buy the dlc, do however continue to play it (it costs from money to run the servers and it seems to be the only thing they care about). I love steam but this is one time i wish i had bought a box copy so I could have returned it. I do still recomend the orginal dark souls.			"

												If you're a casual / are using keyboard controls, the first hour is going to be hell for you. (moreso for casuals.)GraphicsThis is dark souls. You're here to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by it, not to look at pretty skyboxes. Just understand that its not running on the crysis engine, so on max settings most computers will run it quite comfortably.Storyline - What storyline?This is dark souls. You're here to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by it, not to fall in love with drangleics history. Just understand that everything that isnt you needs killing, so kill everything and you'll progress quite comfortably. No really. Just kill everything that comes at you, get boss souls, kill great bosses to get great souls, then progress to new areas with said great souls. Then spend souls to get new weapons which will assist you in getting souls, not to mention upgrading weapons to improve their soul reaping capabilities. Just assume the storyline is get souls buy stuff get more souls with new stuff, wash rinse repeat.Character Builds - Heavily customisable.No character build significantly overpowers another, and are very flexible. If you want to be a cleric (healer, man o' god sorta bloke) sporting two ultra greatswords you're more than welcome. It's very lenient towards how you want to play. For newcomers its recommended to have some competence with a form of ranged attack, just so fighting multiple enemies at once is slightly easier. Be careful with levelling up though, as you cannot respec until much later on.PvE - Good, but can be rather predictable.You'll initially be met with reasonably slow enemies, and its quite good for new players to get settled in. In order to make the game much easier for you later on, get used to dodging these enemies rather than using shields. Shields seem appealing, but the first boss isn't far in, and if you haven't got used to dodging you can have a real hard time with him. For most players the games difficulty will scale in tune with your own skill at it, and in most areas you're able to get two players to assist you should you need them.Bosses - Not too tough if you're competent with dodging.Though their size may be intimidating at first, all bosses have a set list of moves they can make, with occasional add ons to some of them. The lack in complexity to kill some of them them is often off-set by the massive damage they can deal in a single hit, so dodging skills are crucial. Its worth trying to kill them alone first, as even if you die multiple times you know you'll have improved when you finally succeed. Having phantoms do everything for you will not help you improve.PvP - Will become the bane of your existance.You'll learn to hate this when you first start, but it'll slowly settle to the point where you'll just accept it as a mechanic. Once you're through a sizable chunk of the game, you'll occasionally be invaded by another player, and he's there to kill you. Most players will refer to an ""honor"" system whilst invasions occur, and is generally the following :-1) No healing items. ""buffs"" that do this are fine.2) No running away. 3) No phantom summons.4) No hiding.5) Do any of the above and you are subject to the humiliation of a sassy no-no taunt.Plot twist - do whatever the hell you want. This code only applies when the offending party is winning. Soon as you land a crushing blow on them, they'll run behind an npc and heal. Very few phantoms abide by this code of honor. The games not exactly renowned for being fair - why should you be?DLC CONTENT - And you thought the stock game was hardComplete the main game before you even think of entering these areas. Dark souls doesnt give any warning about the difficulty of these areas, but they really aren't easy areas to solo, experienced or not.The most important part of this review - No really.Keyboard users -TO JUMP, RUN FORWARD AND PRESS C. THAT INFORMATION ALONE WILL SAVE YOU A F***** HOUR TRYING TO REBIND IT.Speaking of which... DON'T TRY TO REBIND. ITS MORE PAINFUL THAN THE GAME ITSELF.Solid 9/10. Gameplay is what matters most and in most instances it is fluid and entertaining. Only problem (disregarding hackers and such) is that some hit registries are a bit off. Regardless, well worth the money. That applies to the season pass... Apart from a particular boss just being reskinned.			"

												As of writing this, I have not played the game with any DLC or patches released with them. However, I cannot wait to go back and get beat down over and over once again.Dark Souls II is a brutally difficult RPG and unlike it’s predecessor Dark Souls, it runs fantastically out of the box on PC. The combat, environment fidelity, boss design and user interface are all massively improved from the original. In my experience, the Souls titles provide some of the most rewarding experiences in gaming. Every move you make requires thought, planning, skill, patience and perseverance. Each obstacle you overcome feels like a true accomplishment and that thrill of conquering an impossible boss just drives you to push onwards. Dark Souls II in my opinion is one of the great games of a generation and is a must buy for fans of the genre.			"

												An excellent single player game that will challenge and push you to the limits of your patience yet reward you in ways other games cannot. Beating this will feel like an accomplishment for most people and it really is, for the most part, an excellent experience.On the multi-player side of things however, if you:- don't live in JapanYou will fight laggers, laggers, laggers, some more laggers, oh and the blatantly obvious hackers who seem to take pleasure in winning fights with infinite HP, modded weapons, or some other stupid abuse of the atrociously poor connection system. Oh you live in Australia? Here are all these Russian players looking for a fight... Then there is FROM software who seems unable to balance a small group of weapons/armor which you will now end up seeing absolutely everywhere. The lack of working region lock simply destroyed this game for me. 5/10.			"

												One of the most hosed up games I have ever played in my entire life. Other players can basically get into your game and sabotage your playthrough. It's bad enough you have deal with the whole army of undead freaks and satan cumming lava on your head. Then comes this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trying to pick your toes with poisonous arrows. You have enemies that look like NPCs and NPCs that are monsters. Game tries to screw you at every opening. You leave your guard for one second, BAM! The ground vanish, you fall in a dark pit full of spiders and skeletons but your are already dead due to the long fall. We got Russian dolls that spit acid at your face. We got treasure chests that tries to eat you. Like some guy once said a monster could spring out of your butt and it wouldn't be too surprising! This is what Dark Soul feels like. You can't progress beyond the beginning if you don't fully commit yourself to the game. Understand the mechanics, know the locations of NPCs and most importantly embrace death. For death is nothing but another step on the path of exploring this hellish ♥♥♥♥ery. For those who know it, this is Dark Souls. For those who don't, I think you are going to need some lube.			"

												The first summarized feeling that I can express is that it seems to be bigger and a bit longer than original; but to my suprise Steam's statistic shown nearly exact same number of 66 and 62 hours for sequel and first installment respectively.Before we go further I must warn you, that this comes from PVE-carebear who finished this game once and has no intention to do all those crazy NG+ stuff like many hard-core fans seemingly would. I died… well I can't really say a lot, but that's mostly because I summoned two phantoms for every boss and high-faith-lightning-spears-throwing build seems to be incredibly overpowered for beating AI. And I switched to it immediately after things got a bit tough. Before that I approached the same leveling as I did in first game: lots of strength and relying on heavy two-handed weapon (I bouth Pursuer's Ultra Greatsword). That was halfway through the game if you're wondering. I already killed Old Iron King, did both Belfrys, and made it through the Warf, Forest and Bastille. I even finished Grave of Saints. Anyway, it was a pure-melee character. And I encountered those flaming lizards, you know them, if you finished the game. It doesn't matter if you know them, if you didn't. They were hard for me. Like really hard. I did little to none damage to them, but a few tries and that rolling around did the trick: I killed the first one, and then the second one. Third one stomped me. The narrow passage, the death-bringing fire spits, the horros, the wrong time to drink Estus. You know how this happens. The whole way back from the bonfire I hoped that they are treated like mini-bosses, and don't respawn. They did. I realized that either I can spend another hour trying to beat what seems like the hardest challenge I met in the game or I can visit them later. Some poison-arrows, some ranged stuff, which I was lucking. And that's where things got interesting. Rather than finishing later there is third option in sequel, one which original lacked. You can just redistribute your spents souls. And my inventory was crawling with all kind of stuff suitable for caster. And in a thirty minutes I was newly-born battle-cleric.That sweet feeling of smartly overcoming the problem is good enough for me. It may be not as challenging in terms of perfect reaction, precise directional control and ability to automate sequences of same movements, but it doesn't matter for me. What I like in metroidvanias is that little hidden secrets left by developers. And in that sense Dark Souls is a proud member of the genre. Hidden walls, locked doors, smart usage of enemy attacks for opening new passageway, vulnerabilities of certain enemys — and most of those things not only present you with another glimpse of actually rich lore but make you more powerful or capable with dealing with some problem. And that's it, you just have to think and look for clues.Second game's world became a bit more widespread, more star-shaped like with a central hub, that's it. It feels slightly more sensible or easier to decipher, but and in a many ways sequel actually is. Ability to change character build was already mentioned. And then there's less-restrictive weapon upgrading, and special rings that increase your chance to be summoned by your friend rather than stranger. It never goes as far as forcing you to navigate through complete dark area with deadly cliffs all around. That was what first game did. And while I admire this non-compomising approach of the developers, it was not fun. Yes, you could actually find a source of light before heading there, but that was so obscure, that I didn't. And I seriously doubt anyone on first playthrough without a guide would. So Dark Souls II changed a lot of stuff, that wasn't fun. It still sometimes isn't, but at least it doesn't irritate, and that's good. It's steal hard to the limit, that I felt satisfaction beating it. It required time, dedication and work of thought. And it was worth it. It still is in a lot of ways beautiful. With that oblique beaty, that you won't find on the first look. This style develops with progressing in the game, rather than trying to blaze all guns at you at the first second. Of course it's technically crappy, and some locations look even horrible, but the overall design atones it all. It comes a long way from minimalism to grotesque staying true to itself and game atmosphere. And despite all transformations it never looks like an eclectic mess.This post-apocalyptic fantasy world is still deep, depressing and has a lot of history it doesn't really want to share. Or at least it won't if you won't work for it. But that's okay. That's how metroidvanias work.			"

												Dark Souls 2 was the first Souls game I really played. Now, much later, I feel like that was a good thing. The rest of the series has so far felt way more punishing, harsh, complex... you name it. I jokingly call this one the ""babby's first souls game"" among my friends. Not that it'd be easy, but at least I'm pretty decent in it, which is something I... really can't say regarding the other Souls games.I don't want to talk too much about the other games, but Dark Souls 2 is definitely one of the more, if not the most, straightforward and simple games in the series. Not once did I feel overwhelmed by the bosses, the lore, nor the areas. There were moments when I felt frustrated, but that was a rather refreshing kind of frustration, rather than being annoyed and wanting to ragequit. The AI definitely was dumb at times, but that didn't really make the game any less enjoyable — especially as a dumb AI is sometimes actually harder to predict and plan for.The atmosphere of the game is incredible. Not all the characters were all that interesting, but the areas looked beautiful, or scary, or calming... some really giving a strong impact. The first time I entered the gutter, I was legitimately scared. That thumping sound, the all-consuming darkness... I swear it took me a few minutes just to take my first step into the area.In the end, I went ahead and got all the achievements (which, too, was rather easy compared to the other games in the series) as I wanted to keep playing even after defeating the final boss and playing the NG+ for a while. NG+ definitely had a lot of replayability, as even the small changes gave the second run a fresh feeling to it. This game really ended up sucking me in, and now I'm stuck playing both Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, and about to start Bloodborne. Yet I don't feel like playing any of them all that much, as I'm afraid they'll make me feel bad in games. Woe is me.On another note, Dark Souls II: Scholar of the Sin is a thing, too. It's somewhat more difficult, but nothing special. I'm, of course, playing that one too, as Dark Souls II became more or less my favorite Souls game, as it's the one that introduced me to the series. Now, I know that it's not even considered to be a part of the series, especially the lore, but I don't mind. I already know this, I just like the game, and I like the other games, too. It's just, the first one is always the first one, and you can't change that.			"

												If you look through all these reviews you'll notice many thumbs down for the same exact reason. Fromsoftware has greed money f#%ked  everyone who bought this game before announcing The Scholar of The First Sin. Don't buy this, or that version, because f&%k them. It's a descent game if you're not a filthy casual.Oh yeah, and use an xbox controller. Fromsoftware is too incompetent to actually make games that go on PC I guess, so if you're using a mouse and keyboard good luck doing parries, guard breaks, and pretty much everything else. Also: hitboxes appear to be at least twice your size (against npc's) and the size of the map (against other players), so don't be upset if you die a lot in-game from enemies attacking objects nearby you. Protip: if an enemy player has stopped moving, he's lagging, and attacking his stationary body will still deal damage to him. (Trust me, I'm a rank 2 Blue Sentinel)			"

												Dark Souls II is a distant cousin to Dark Souls. The stories are subtly related, but the Dark Souls II is noticeably inferior. In Dark Souls II you find yourself thrown into a disconnected world with little guidance and no real purpose. This contrasts the elements of Dark Souls, in which the player found himself or herself immersed in a very connected world with a purpose but with little direction. The distinction may sound minute, but it drastically diminished the quality of the sequel. Without a true purpose, or at least without one you're able follow, the point of the game becomes ""kill bosses, kill enemies, kill other players."" Which is fun for a while, but the longevity of gameplay is significantly reduced by such monotony. In your purposeless wanderings in the course of the game, you will wholeheartedly feel like you are in a pieced together video game as opposed to a created world. You might ascend in an elevator at the top of an isolated tower only to suddenly find yourself... in a volcano... with other volcanoes as far as the eye can see.  With a world devoid of cohesion, the artistry that is existed is DS has been lost in its sequel. Player vs. player interactions have been diminished in some ways and augmented in others. Connectivity is drastically improved, but the method the game used to connect players (soul memory) is undeniably flawed. You suddenly find yourself especially frustrated to die before reaching your bloodstain (which causes you to lose your acquired souls -- a faux currency for the game) because you now essentially have greater soul memory yet fewer souls. Additionally, players at soul level 200-300 can easily find themselves paired against a player at the maxed soul level of 838. The online gameplay itself has been altered in drastic ways as well. Shields have become essentially useless, more likely detrimental with the replacement of the kick attacked to a foreword stepping, shield swiping cartoonish attack. This is another change that, while seemingly small, drastically affects the game in a negative manner. Dark Souls was game, so by its nature it was outside the realms of reality. However, it carried a sense of realism in an alternate world, which is impressive because this realism was semi successfully merged with outlandishness (like using a massive two handed dragon tail sword the size of the person wielding it). Dark Souls II, however, tends to favor more the outlandish, fantastical side. Magic is stronger while physical damage is weaker (compared to DS); ""quality builds"" are a thing of the past regarding viability. In reality, a naked man wielding a pocket knife is not very likely to kill another man of equal size armored in chain mail and wielding a sword and a shield. Yet this is the ever present case in Dark Souls II player vs. player. Light armor is clearly favored over heavy armor by the developers, as is magic clearly favored over faith and dexterity is favored over strength (for PVP)Overall, every change from DS to DS II seems to be an obvious attempt to expand the game's demographic by absconding features that made DS notoriously challenging. Reaching a new audience is fiscally savvy, but tends to alienate core fans. Personally, I doubt I will be purchasing another Souls franchise game (including Bloodborne). "

												I should start by getting the obvious out of the way: Dark Souls 2 is a great game. Dark Souls 2 is such a difficult title to write about. After spending an hour or so staring at an empty box, one in which is usually filled with a review, I watched dozens of Hatsune Miku music-videos. Surprisingly, this didn't give me the inspiration I needed to write. At this point, I didn't dare consider just playing more Dark Souls 2. Whenever I do that, entire days just disappear into the ether. All I really can do is will myself to push forward, and hopefully I can somehow slam enough words together to create a coherent thought.Ugh...This is a terrible idea, I just want to keep playing DS2. The problem is that I have other videogames that need attention. Part of the reason I got into reviewing was so that I wouldn't just play the same games over and over again. So that's why I'm here today. I want to get this review over and done with so I can move on. This is not a knock against Dark Souls 2 - I have plenty of those on the way - I'm doing this out of interest in my own sanity.Speaking of sanity, was From Software crazy when they came up with DS2's world? Since the days of King's Field, I've always appreciated From's attempts at creating cohesive worlds. Even with the knowledge that DS2 suffered through development-hell, it's still shocking just how little anything makes sense. The startling difference between Earthen Peak and Iron Keep has been mentioned before, but I'm also concerned with all of the one-way paths, narrow corridors, and overall sense of linearity. The world-design issues result in an over-population of bonfires. This causes a loss of tension, since you rarely lose progress when you die. Without tension, there aren't any areas that I truly dread. Dread is a good thing, especially in this series. When you overcome the situations you fear the most, it feels all the more rewarding. For me at least, there were far too little of these situations in Dark Souls 2. There's no Sen's Fortress, or The Archers of Anor Londo, or even Blighttown. Actually I take that back, DS2 has the quasi-Blighttown aka The Gutter. DS2 has a lot of what I consider to be ""portions"" of what could be great areas. If these portions were expanded upon, or added to, they could become fantastic. Instead, most of the areas in this game feel like a piece of something greater, which doesn't make for a very fulfilling experience. It should also be noted that even tiny tiny areas like Black Gulch have two bonfires. However, DS2 does have some great areas that are thoroughly expansive, or at least offer some interesting qualities. The Iron Keep is thoroughly solid, Drangliec Castle is good, the Shrine of Amana is amazing, and so on. It's still inconsistent, but I suppose it's better that the poorly-designed areas are interspersed throughout the world, rather than mostly at the end like Dark Souls 1.Since I'm already knee-deep in the DS1-2 comparisons, I guess I'd better talk about the bosses. I consider most of the major encounters in DS2 to be middling. They're not incredible (Ornstein & Smough) but they're not horrible (Bed of Chaos). The only aspect where the fights are truly lacking, is that they don't really stand out. There's no significant impact aside from ""I gotta kill this guy because he's in my way."" On the other hand, this is one of those issues that feels like mere nitpicking after several dozen hours.For me at least, Dark Souls 2 is a game that gets better the more I invest into it. If all I do is concern myself with surface-level aspects such as the plot, lore, and world-design, I could very well find myself disliking the game. As the hours pile up, I discover that Dark Souls 2 works because it is different, and being different can be great sometimes. The multitude of builds are welcome, along with the enormous selection of weapons, combinations, and stances. For players that are fond of experimenting with move-sets and mechanics, there's a lot to explore here. I've yet to even create a magic, hex, or faith-based character. While builds aren't anything new in the -Souls franchise, I think the level-design, more varied covenants, and overall larger emphasis on multiplayer give gamers more opportunities to see builds in action, and determine their worth in combat. There are numerous subtle elements that exist to draw more players into the online elements of -Souls, and that's a really good thing. Playing online is simply a fresher and more dynamic experience. Granted, invasions can be a headache...but well maybe I'm biased here. In DS1, I lost literally everytime I was invaded. It felt like I was always out-played and/or out-geared, and it just became a nuisance. In this game? I've actually won a fair number of duels. As I said, I've yet to test spell-casting, so my lack of dimension is still a factor in my losses. It's something to consider, but as of right now I'm doing well, better than I ever have. I'm not sure how much of I can actually attribute to this game, but whatever, I'll take it.The PvE elements are fine as well, but some enemies (like the seemingly infinite-stamina giants in the Dragon Shrine) are a headache. Also I wish From did something aside from exploding undead and the occasional wyvern in Dragon's Aerie. It is a mostly optional area, and the only reason to hang out there is farming all of the sweet ore. There are also those rare moments where the enemies just pile up. This is a fairly common complaint, but I don't know. Scholar of the First Sin fixes a few of these sections (like the series of turtle-soldiers in one optional section of Forest of Fallen Giants) but ignores others (the soldiers in Lost Bastille). I'll go more in-depth on Scholar later on.At this point I think I should post a warning. This isn't the end of my Dark Souls 2 review, not by a long-shot. There are still the DLC areas to write about, thoughts on the various covenants, and so on. Since 2015 is almost over, I'd like to do one truly massive review to end the year on.			"

												Don't buy this game now. There is a remake coming out in early 2015 that is essentially a collector's edition with additional NPCs and multiplayer characteristics. If you want to experience the game at its fullest, just wait a few months instead of waisting your money now. I really did enjoy this game, but it dissappoints me that the developers of this game would pull a stunt like this. They were very giving to the community considering that they didn't plan on making DLC, but because the community wanted it, they gave it to them. I am honestly suprised they are doing this to us PC players. It makes me mad I spent over $70 on this game and now I have to pay full retail price again to get these feautures? The least they could do is offer it to us at a discounted price.  "

												I love this game but DO NOT BUY IT. The new version they have announced completely alienates those who have put money in to this previous version. It includes all dlc, new content and everything else you would expect of a GOTY version with DX11 support added in...the kicker is that this new version runs on an alternate server forcing PC players to rebuy the game to keep with the influx of new players.

												Do not buy. It's a good game, but soon enough a ""new version"" will be released. This ""new version"" makes some minor graphical tweaks, but most importantly, it splits the community in half by putting each of the two versions on seperate servers ending populated online gameplay for good. No upgrade will be availible for those with the previous version. This product should be boycotted until the servers are joined or an upgrade is made avalible.			"

												i DO recommend dark souls 2, just not this version. it's not compatible with the newer, updated version so the online community for this version is relatively small and presumably shrinking over time. i love dark souls 2-both versions, but i can't recommend buying this version when scholar of the first sin exists. i'm not sure why this version is even still available. don't get me wrong, it's a great game and you can get 100% achievement completion without playing online, but the online aspects are like half the game. invasions, summoning, and pvp are a huge part of why i play the dark souls franchise. that, and they're the best games ever made.

												People often recognize Dark Souls by terms as ""Frustration"", but it's a game about becoming good at it and it feels powerful when you master your combat style, that being said : I love this game, It was the first one that I got every achievement. Let's beginThey supposedly fixed the input problem the first game had on pc, but playing on a keyboard is still uncomfortable, I highly recommend an xbox 360 controller.Visually speaking, graphics are way better! it's not the mess the first game was, no mods required here. Characters and objects get a blur effect whenever they are near the screen edges, flames are prettier and particles are all over, I love when you finish off a boss and he vanishes into a million pieces, check my screenshots later! Textures are fine, except for dlc 1 boss-weapons, what the hell was that? Lights and shadows are pretty good, even if they're not the E3 promise. GeDoSaTo do the job for you if you're up for graphic modifications.Character animations and combat, all improved in a way it couldn't have been done better, It works perfectly. I wish more games took Dark Souls 2 character/combat fluid animations as a role model.the Difficulty is one of this saga's identity, but in this game everything comes easier to you : being able to fast travel from the beginning felt a little ""too casual"" for some people, also, coop make some fights easy but you can always go for the champions covenant and play solo. speaking of which, some covenants in this game reward you with unique spells and gear. New game plus is still here, obviously, and there are some unique encounters on your second playtrough, as well as player invasions and co-op system that separates new players from NG+ ones, best part is that you don't struggle to coop anymore, there is a ring working as a filter for connections, making coop quick and effective, no need for Dsfix this time!The Lore is there, mostly hidden and open to our own interpretation, I'd say Dark Souls 1 had more impact in terms of story, but they are making this right on the second game with the DLC spisodes. Level design...well, It fails sometimes, environments are diverse, but transitions lack cohesion. I noticed several points where one area has no logic connection to the next one, there are also Bonfires with enemy spawn points right next to it, it's just stupid.Equipment extends from magic to steel, allowing players a great variation of builds, Soul Vessels make character respec possible, this was a very good addition to this game.Combat against enemies (PvE) feels fair at all time, it also depends on you skill and equipement management, the problem is the online community, hackers have been all over in the last few months, expect auto-backstabs and undying foes during your online play, thankfully, Dark Souls has a Moral code that diverges from other games and sometimes, you'll be in a fight so fair and honorable, that dying only makes you want to shake the other player's hand and thank him for the fight (be that guy!)This game runs pretty good on any computer, I even play it on my notebook sometimes ( i7 3ºGen, HD4000, 6Gigs ), but mostly maxed out with enb/mods on pc ( i5 3570, GTX650ti Boost, 4GB 1600 ) Doesn't go lower then 50fps.If you enjoy a challenge, Dark Souls is an exhausting and rewarding experience! tl;dr+ Amazing co-op experience+ Combat mechanics+ Replay value- Devs don't mind hackers, apparently - Level design - PvP Grind for covenant spells			"

												A step down from the original in every possible way. Is it bad? Not necessarily a bad game, but seriously, just play the first one again and pretend you're playing for the first time.In a nutshell, Dark Souls 2 is what happens when you try to develop a game to be hard rather than develop a game that happens to be hard. In addition, they took feedback and swung way too far in the other direction. O&S was one of the most memorable boss fights, so they made half of bosses in the form of multiple enemies. Parrying was easy once you got the hang of it, so now each enemy and each attack has a specific and particular time to parry given wind-up time, meaning that unless you're playing with a guide/spreadsheet you're not gonna parry. Backstab baiting NPCs was also a viable strategy thanks to invincibility frames, so From made enemies that can spin right round like a record to avoid it. Which wouldn't be a problem if they hadn't arbitrarily broken rolling because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why, now dump precious souls into ADP to make up for us gimping you. Speaking of being gimped, stamina drains ridiculously quickly especially compared to the original. You want to block those magnetic attacks? I bet you do. Damn shame, eh? Now go enjoy getting Beybladed by 2 ruin sentinnels simultaneously so you can't block it all and you sure can't roll under it all. But hey, roll a caster and be OP as hell so there's no problem taking them on. Then get a batstaff and dark fog and be prepared to be overpowered in PvP. Which is just as well, since PvP really barely exists anymore. You have a covenant for ganking, a covenant for grinding for enough items until the map can do your job for you, a covenant that summons in case you get invaded (you won't), a covenant that invades after spending a ridiculous amount of time grinding for orbs (and don't even bother trying to rank up in that covenant), a covenant that invades those who invade (meaning you do absolutely nothing), and a few others that are so inconsequential that I can't even think of them at the moment.Edit: Soul Memory needs no critiquing. Everyone else in the reviews has done so sufficiently, really nothing I can add in that regard. However, what I disliked the most was the finite upgrade items, and in fact the finite items in general. In DaS, you were never once forced into using a weapon you didn't like. You could grind souls anywhere, buy infinite upgrade materials from blacksmits, and change your entire combat technique with relative ease (short of converting to casting). In DaS2, you'd better be damn sure of what weapon you want to use, because one you use the materials you happen to find lying around, you're pretty much boned until the end of your playthrough. Just as well (you'll notice a recurring theme here), since you can't reliably grind on enemies anymore due to despawning after somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 kills and your only other options consist of getting summoned or getting ganked by the bellends (and that ain't happening either if your SM is too high).So to summarize: just play the original. If you've already played the original, play it again. DaS2 may be worth 20 dollars, maybe even 30, but don't you dare even give those incompetent morons 50 full dollars for this thing.Edit: Please disregard my previous notion that it would be worth purchasing for 20 dollars, as it has recently been revealed that the real version is not coming out until spring on consoles and who knows when for PC.

												Dark Souls 2 doesn't actually exist. This game only displays the title, but it isn't a sequel to Dark Souls.A sequel, in my opinion, is supposed to be a game that improves and expands upon the original, while still retaining the original's basic feel. New mechanics may be introduced, but they have to be interesting and also fit into the game's world and design for them to work.This game doesn't do any of that.What it does, is put a bunch of Dark Souls and Demon's Souls references in a world that feels more like a (bad) attempt at recreating TESV: Skyrim, rather than being its own, original idea.Honestly, the level design in this is pretty forgettable. The bosses have multiple similarities between them, to the point where you have a hard time distinguishing between them (giant guy with giant weapon, unformed disgusting blob, random decomposing monster, etc.), and are really easy to beat even solo, except of course for THOSE bosses where, just for the sake of making them hard, there are a bunch of enemies together with the boss, constantly running towards you, that you have to deal with in addition to the main enemy.About the multiplayer. The PvP is bad, there's just no other way to describe it. Those far away hits that in Dark Souls only happen while playing against distant people with unstable internet connection? Here happened all the time, every single time. Those sudden teleportations, once every year in Dark Souls? Here it's been one out of three matches.You have to wonder how the netcode got worse, three years later...Now for the funny part.The store page for Dark Souls warns you that it is strongly recommended to be played with a controller, yet it's perfectly playable even with mouse&keyboard, after rebinding some keys to your liking.This game, which ironically doesn't warn you of anything, is exhausting to play with m&k, first because of the natural (intended?) unresponsiveness of the controls, but mainly due to massive input lag generated by the (completely useless) double-click setting. Even though that can be disabled in the in-game options, the setting doesn't actually save between playing sessions and needs to be reset everytime the game is launched. I'm not kidding.At the end of the day, this is a pretty bad game. It destroyed what makes Dark Souls an interesting game, it didn't improve upon the things Dark Souls lacks.I think the reason nobody plays this anymore is because only someone who is new to the series (and to the genre) would actually like this and keep playing after the first time. Or maybe it's because the Scholar of the First Sin remaster killed the playerbase by splitting the community... yeah, that might be it. Lol.			"

												Despite all of the wonderfully elaborate reviews proclaiming ""I died, 100/10,"" there's a bit more to this game that urks me.Dark Souls 2 comes off, to me, as a terrible fix to any and all issues in Dark Souls 1. I am going to indulge into Dark Souls 1's problems so you understand exactly what From has done to ""fix"" them.From Software made Dark Souls 1, and even patched and balanced a few things in it that were a major issue, though this took a long, long time. The fixes made me happy. The PvP imbalances at the time were put to rest, but there were still issues. ""Twinks"" (Players upgrading their weapons and gear without levelling up, resulting in them invading lower-leveled, unskilled players and destroying them) were an issue, though they were few and far between. The invasion covenant, though difficult (in my opinion) to get to, allowed players an easy way to absolutely wreck other players, whilst the lawful covenant saw little action. There were also things such as grinding that people dealt with. All in all, Dark Souls had its problems, but it was such a beautiful and great game with great combat (ignoring infamous ""backstab fishers"" and ""lagstabs""), a good PvP scene with an even more amazing PvE environment that truly felt connected as you walked through the land.Dark Souls 2 does not contain this.From has tried to correct many issues by making them the exact opposite of what they were. In essence, they've made previous problems worse in completely new and exciting ways.1. Poise, the system of how-many-hits-you-take-until-you-flinch, was nerfed into the ground. It is no longer viable as you can get stunlocked by daggers wearing heavy armor. Daggers.2. Twinking has been ""fixed"" by the horrid hellspawn, Soul Memory. Soul Memory is the new way you connect to others, not Soul Level like the previous game. Basically, when you kill an enemy or a boss, whether you spend those souls or simply possess them, you have increased your Soul Memory. The higher your Soul Memory, the higher the tier of players you will be matched with.    You cannot help someone on a boss forever like Dark Souls 1. Neither can you invade the same area. You are leveling up whether you choose to or not.3. The invasion covenant requires you to rank up points in an arena where your losses make you lose points if you want to get the item to invade other players. However, you are going up against min/max genius SmelterHavels or Havelyns because the arena doesn't care about whether you're NG or NG+ like normal. You can be stuck in a permanent limbo unless you upgrade the difficulty of the bonfire area and buy the orbs for obscene prices, and even then, if you get too many souls, you are forced to level up and move on instead of stay in an area and act as an obstacle for a player. Because making the game difficult is From's job, not yours, kids. Except it's not difficult.4. Grinding and Difficulty has been dampened. If you kill an enemy X amount of times, they will stop spawning unless you upgrade the difficulty of the bonfire. This would make grinding a terrible inconvenience, but sometimes it doesn't even make the enemies too much harder, removing any actual NEED of putting a kill-limit on enemies! It also allows any old fool capable of killing at least a single enemy a certain amount of times the ability to pass and join the ranks of actually decent players.5. Fast Travel right off the bat. I had an issue with Dark Souls, I admit it. The land was damn huge. You had to walk to every here and there, miles upon miles, until you got the item required to Fast-Travel. I have enjoyed Dark Souls 2's Fast-Travel, but I now realize how terrible it is to implement it so early. You do not appreciate your environment. In Dark Souls 1, you walked through the entire land, looking at surroundings, understanding the key points, where enemies were, how to surpass them, all the way up until you got the Fast-Travel item. Even then, it didn't warp you EVERYWHERE. But in Dark Souls 2, the world becomes a series of Bus Stops. You're no longer looking around you and enjoying the sights, but travelling from A to B as if hurrying to work. It becomes mundane, and any flair in the world surrounding you becomes futile as you can simply pass it by through the simple act of lighting one of the millions of Bonfires scattered around everywhere.There are many more problems involving bugs and glitches that are yet unfixed that allow people to pass certain blockades without the requirements, as well as cheaters that either cheat to troll or simply cheat so they can surpass the utter nonsense of Soul Memory's constant oppression.Buying this game was a terrible choice, for I feel it may never be fixed, yet I wish I could play it. Please reconsider your decision of buying this game unless you can live with a dampened PvP scene, a dampened PvE scene, and a disappointing sequel. I am honestly sorry I have to type this, because I really, really want to play and love this game, but at this point, I just can't.			"

												Not as good as Dark Souls 1. Has some nice improvements (like controls and graphics) and some new features are cool (new stats, torch) but I'm disappointed in the covenant system (broken) and the overall looks and level/character design of the game. By no means I feel sympathy, or hate, or even ""fear"" of any single NPC in this game so far. Bosses are pretty much all the same, and *extremely* easy if you summon people to help (it was awesome fun in DS1).Great and complete (although a bit long) review:

												A lot of people don't like this entry in the series. It's easier than 1 and 3, less inspired, the bosses are usually disappointing. I suppose that's all somewhat true, it really is. The bosses ARE mostly easy and uninspired, many taken straight from tried fantasy tropes (a woman with a scorpion for a body -- a woman with a snake for a body). On top of that, some of the earlier bosses are absolute jokes as far as difficulty is concerned. Some of the later ones too. And yes, a lot of the rooms you'll be exploring are pretty unadorned, just stark cubes with enemies in them. Uninspired environments. So that's all true, so why am I recommending it? Well honestly, the most major way in which the game didn't disappoint was in the massive choice it gave you over the path you take through it. From the starting city there are multiple paths you can take through the game at any point, and this only grows as you continue to explore. If you're stuck on or bored with an area or a boss, you can take a break and explore someplace else. Not only that, but the different areas of the game are, in my perspective, very well differentiated. They're mostly very visually unique, each with its own feeling and challenges and secrets to figure out. They also all fit together nicely, lending a very cohesive feeling to the game.So yes, as I said, there are disappointments, but when I think about games that have stayed interesting playthrough after playthrough, this is near the top of the list.

												Amazing game, albeit rather difficult even for the experienced player. It's challenging nature really provides a sense of achievement for both the casual and serious player.It combines both tactical, and smooth combat  for both PvE and PvP combat, and is perfectly suitable for those with either preference.The game is visually stunning, and any that plays this game is bound to either love it immediately or grow to love it. It is an amazing addition to the souls series, and certainly reaches the high expectations set by its predecessor.PS - Perfect dodging, and don't bother with a shield - they will only let you down.EDIT :: This was a review drafted after my first playthrough of the game. Since, my outlook has drastically altered. I will not deny that it was enjoyable my first time, but the more I have played DS2 the more of its shortcomings I have noticed, and the more downfalls I realise it has. It is still a good game, but not as good as the above review would indicate.If playing with a Mouse and Keyboard, the controls are clunky, and you have to deal with mouse delays of an entire second. You'll have to remap most of the bindings to suit playstyle, and be able to somewhat bypass the clunkiness.Many of the areas, despite looking 'aesthetically pleasing', are wholly lacking innovation and the same applies to the world design. Much of it doesn't even make geographical sense, many of the areas overlap (and not in the intertwining sense of DS1 - but instead should actually be on each other.) I would give examples, but I don't want to 'spoil' the game.A number of the bosses are unimaginative, and are even redesigns of bosses from DS2's predecessor. Yes, it's difficult to come up with new and exciting bosses, but when the vast majority are just your typical humanoid with a big sword; it would be nice that when you finally encounter a non-humanoid boss, it didn't happen to be a boss you fought in DS1 just with a different skin. Expanding on that -- lack of variety in enemies.Most of the enemies in DS2 are humanoid soldiers. Swordsmen, archers, mages, the occasional big thing with a heavy weapon. Other types of enemies are few and far between. Also, enemy placement. Gosh this is a pain. Many of the combat scenarios in this game are a chore - using crowds of enemies to overwhelm the player instead of using strategically placed enemies to provide a challenge. The DLC solves this to an extent, but has a massive downfall in that it gave most of its enemies HUGE or almost infinite poise -- which means they cannot be staggered. Even when you're 2-handing a UGS and use the strong attack, and they just walk through it and smack you for half your health. It encourages you to wait for an opening, yes; but when this game favours scenarios where the player is attacked by multiple enemies that can't be staggered and can kill you in two to three hits, it becomes a little artificial.

												Great game, but you already know that...The reason for the negative recommendation is because Namco Bandai are reselling a 'remastered' edition for full price in May 2015. Thats right, not all content included in patch, nor dlc, but a whole new re-release. Not only that, but bugfixes and game design choices, that should have been in the original game, are being locked to the full-price re-release. They are also seperating the online communities, so 'old version' players cannot play with new version players. All this after charging almost £60 for the poor sods who bought both the original and all dlc.Now, I generally do not like complaining, but this is completely unacceptable, to put it lightly.Essentially, if you buy it now, you are buying an inferior version of the game.Its downright fraud. The type of crap I expect from EA/Ubisoft.I implore you to vote with your wallets, Steam users, and not buy this game in the current situation. Don't tolerate bullcrap guys, even when its attached to a great game.I will change this recommendation if Namco come to their senses and - at the VERY least - change the re-release to a dlc for PC users. Such a shame...			"

												Now, in some aspects Dark Souls II isn't as good as the first one. Those are mainly the world design, lore, and the lack of memorable NPCs and enemies. However, what it makes up for it is a far more balanced combat system, more streamlined gameplay and far better multiplayer mechanics.  The areas and convenants are obviously designed to make co-op play more accessible and the summoning system is far more refined than the first one. I've seldom had trouble finding summoning signs nor do I encounter the constant 'Summoning Failed' messages of the first one. Graphics wise, the game runs in silky smooth 60 fps which is a pleasure to the eyes.In all, Dark Souls II took a giant leap forward, albeit a few steps back.			"

												To begin with, i've tried beating this game to write a proper review, but the problems with this game just pile up to the point where it's not worth finishing. To begin with, this game is leagues worse than the first one from game design to reusing enemies to overall terrible feel. The games art and atmosphere is fantastic. Top notch, but that doesn't substitute for gameplay. This game takes 10 steps back for every graphic they improved. The combat is sloppy. Bosses that used to relay tactics are gone, its just luck of the draw, and hope that there's a phantom to help you absorb these arbitrary attacks, no hit detection. PVP is botched beyond belief. Countering is really useless now. Shields don't even have a purpose, other than to look cool. Attacks mostly pierce your shield and do damage to you and your stamina. Dark Souls usually complimented its tone with a decent story, yes it's about killing things, and dying (clearly) but a response or feedback of what you're doing is a MUST. The story makes absolutley no sense. You have no sense on what your purpose is, why things are the way they are or what you're gonna do to make it better or why you're doing things. The design of ""worlds"" makes a massive dissconnect from the rest of the game, it's not about feeling as everything is connected and lead to a single focal point as in Dark Souls 1 with the Firelink Shrine. You just go from here to there, teleport there, die, teleport here to farm things and hope you can kill them. It just defeats the purpose of having a world. Why not just have a level select? As stated the graphics are phenomenal. But Dark Souls could do so much better. I consider myself a hardcore gamer, but the Dark Souls that made it your fault that you died, doesn't exist anymore, this game is literally botched PVP, reused enemies that don't give a sense of what their attacks are going to be. The game. For graphics alone I would give this point a 4/10. For gameplay and story and feeling: 1/10 Would not recommend.*Edit* After beating the game and finishing one DLC, I still stand by my review as this game being botched. Nothing has changed, and no signs of From Software trying to fix any issues.			"

												Worst Souls game to date; improves on a few things, screws up the spirit and feel of the Souls games. Doesn't make it a bad game, though. If you haven't played a Souls game before, you'll have yourself a grand old time, but people who spent countless hours in the depths of Lordran or even Boletaria and experienced what this game is lacking tend to go back to Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, from what I've seen.

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Whether its the single player , multiplayer or the coop , dark souls II offers a unique experience, just like before the game is hard , fun and full of secrets that you will enjoy and test your skills to discover. the graphics and the controls for the PC are optimized and doesn't require any fix or modding . Sure the game doesn't look visually like the pre release but it still looks pretty good and worth getting it.			"

												Its a very good game. It tests your patience and tactics, and continuously eats em up. Its up to the player on how he will finish his enemies, but rewards and satisfaction awaits on the other side.This game is not as difficult as many make it out to be. As long as you have a strategy to take down enemies and can learn to parry, roll, and block attacks with a shield, you should be fine. An important thing to note is that if you are a human and die, you become a hollow (a zombie-esque creature). Not only does that start to shrink your maximum health, but you are no longer be able to summon phantoms to aid you in battle, so becuareful with that.PS: DON'T touch the red summon signs. I'm warning you right now.Overall, an amazing game with really good lore attached to it. If you get the chance to play this game, listen to the lore and you will be amazed.			"

												All in all a 6.5/10 game, inferior to DS1 in points of online play, balancing, boss fights etc. Stat scaling is extremely horrible in this game, which renders pure stat builds almost useless. Graphics were a HUGE lie, as they suck hard compared to the promised ones in pre-release status.Now comes the problem, which is why I deeply urge you to NOT buy this game, or any future games of this developer, until it has been fixed.There will be an updated version of this game in spring 2015, with lots of bug fixes, multiplayer fixes, and THE PROMISED GRAPHICS FROM THE PRE-RELEASE STATUS. Which is again great in itself...>>>>BUT: THE GAME WILL NOT BE RELEASED AS AN UPDATE, BUT RATHER A NEW GAME. THIS MEANS YOU WILL HAVE TO BUY IT AGAIN COMPLETELY, THE DLCS ASWELL, IF YOU OWN THE 'OLD', UNFIXED VERSION. THIS IS A HUGE MIDDLE FINGER TO EVERY LOYAL CUSTOMER OF THIS GAME. ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST MIDDLE FINGERS I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME FROM ANY DEV. DO NOT BUY A GAME FROM THIS $$$-HUNGRY-DEVS UNTIL THIS IS ADRESSED.			"

												Dark Souls 2 is a very good game. At least compared to other action RPGs. However, it's somewhat of a disappointment compared to the first Dark Souls game. Note: I don't think my Steam statistics are correct (possibly due to playing offline). I've actually played over 100 hours Dark Souls 2. Also, there is a new 64-bit version of Dark Souls 2 (Scholar of Sin) with improved graphics and new enemy and item placement which supposedly makes the game more difficult. However, if you can get the old version on sale ($20 or less) which now includes all DLCs I would recommend that. For one thing, I've heard that it looks just as good as the new version if you use mods. On the topic of mods, I have had a game-breaking bug with GeDoSaTo, but it seems to be rare. If you are considering which game to play first I would recommend Dark Souls 1. If you own a PS3 or PS4 I might even recommend playing Demon's Souls and Bloodborne before Dark Souls 2 (although I have only watched, but not played those games).Dark Souls 2 improves on graphics, performance, and certain elements of the stats system such as attributes and weapon upgrading. It fails in regards to combat, controls, NPCs, and overall atmosphere.My PC can barely run Skyrim and Dark Souls 1 so I wasn't sure I'd be able to play Dark Souls 2, but on low graphics settings and low resolution Dark Souls 2 runs around 30-40 fps (although it probably looks worse than console with my graphics settings).Just a side note about frame rate. There is a bug (which still hasn't been fixed after a year of release) which causes weapons to degrade twice as fast at 60 fps compared to 30 fps (PS3/xbox 360 version). I found this awesome whip. Or so I thought....After killing half a dozen enemies it was already more than halfway towards breaking.It seems that weapons degrade faster even without the bug, but the bug just compounds things. Another change in regards to gameplay is the amount of fall damage you take. If you're used to Dark Souls 1, Demon's Souls, or Bloodborne you're going to die quite a lot due to fall damage.The weapons upgrade system has improved since Dark Souls 1. After watching someone play Demon's Souls I was saddened to realize how few positives carried over into Dark Souls. However, I believe that Dark Souls 2 has the best upgrade system. It offers many more options than Dark Souls 1 and yet the process is streamlined and simplified at the same time. There's even an upgrade path that scales off your lowest stat which is useful for people who like playing a character that does a little bit of everything.In terms of aesthetics (which is somewhat objective) there are things about both games I like, but Dark Souls 2 falls short in terms of atmosphere. There are times where it approaches Dark Souls 1 like No-man's wharf and a certain area in Shaded Woods, but in general things feel a bit off in comparison. It's something almost at an unconscious level which is hard to put into words and something that isn't noticeable until after playing for a period of time.While not perfect, the attribute system is somewhat improved although it does seem to encourage min/maxing to a certain extent. At the very least, they've done away with the resistance attribute which was worthless in Dark Souls 1. They've also broken up endurance into two stats which is a good thing overall because it was so overpowered in the first Dark Souls. Instead of making a new stat (and confusingly calling ""vitality"" and renaming vitality from Dark Souls 1 as ""vigor"") they should have made endurance only have a minor affect on equipment load and instead made strength have more of an effect on equp load.The reason why I make this suggestion about strength is that weapons are still unbalanced in Dark Souls 2. The heaviest weapons are almost never the best choice due to the game mechanics and stats system. They're still viable, but nowhere near optimal. It's something I might do after my 1st or 2nd playthrough after I've gotten good at the game. Another change which I consider an improvement is how they do rings and enchanted items. There are many more pieces of armor that have some sort of special enchanment which makes getting new loot more enjoyable. While I haven't had a chance to thoroughly test out the magic system, it does seem to be more balanced compared to the first game. At the very least, there are many more options including hexes which is sort of a dark magic. Great for a necromancer roleplay.Rings are also more balanced. Instead of having 2 ring slots and a few very powerful rings, there's 4 rings slots and less powerful rings. Some rings have a more powerful variant which you can find much later in the game which gives you a feeling of progression rather than the first Dark Souls where you can get the most powerful rings in the first half of the game.There has been a huge debate over the difficulty in Dark Souls 2. Some say it's easier than the first and others who say it's as hard (if not harder) than the first. I'm one of the people who feel that it was at least as hard as the first. While there were cheap things in regards to difficulty with both games, I feel like the difficulty overall was handled better in the first Dark Souls.My biggest annoyance with the first game were the platforming challenges. I don't necessarily mean jumping, but rather dying due to fall damage. Despite what I said earlier about fall damage being worse in Dark Souls 2, there were a lot of areas where falling meant instant death. Sometimes the fall was provoked by enemies in the area and other times it was purely environmental.In Dark Souls 2, the biggest issue with difficulty was the enemies themselves. First of all, there were often too many of them which led to a lot of kiting and hit and run tactics. Or relying too much on ranged attacks. Don't get me wrong, there were many occasions in Dark Souls 1 where I was overwhelmed by enemies, but with that game it always felt more manageable. Part of that was due to how poise worked and the enemies' AI. Because of the changes to poise, it's much easier to get stunlocked in Dark Souls 2 even if you're wearing reasonably heavy armor. The other thing is that Dark Souls 2 enemies have the ability to track you with their attacks so that it much more difficult to gain a tactical edge without retreating. I admit that it was too easy to backstab enemies in the first Dark Souls, but this ""fix"" seems lazy. It might have been better to eliminate backstabs altogether than this which just feels unfair.The NPCs in Dark Souls 2 were another big disappointment. They just seem kind of dull in comparison to the first game. I'm not sure if this was intentional as a way of showing the hollowing process, but it didn't work for me. In Dark Souls 1 the NPCs were full of life. Even the despicable ones who would screw you over were preferable to the bland ones in Dark Souls 2. Even Lucatiel,  my favorite NPC from Dark Souls 2 is kind of meh.All in all, the gameplay changes are a mixed bag. It really depends on who you talk to, but for me there were some improvements and some steps backwards. I've heard mixed things about PvP in terms of which game is better, but I haven't tried it myself. The issue that seems to be the most common source of disappointment is that Dark Souls 2 feels like it's missing its soul (please excuse the pun). I've heard many reasons people give for disliking Dark Souls 2 and many of them seem very nitpicky. While gameplay is probably my biggest disappointement, I feel the issue which affects most people is that Dark Souls 2 is missing the very essence which makes Dark Souls a ""souls game"". Which is one of the main reasons that I'd recommend Demon's Souls and Bloodborne (both made by the developer as Dark Souls) over Dark Souls 2 despite having not played either of them.			"

												The follow up to Dark Souls. Is it as good as the first game? Well no, but it's far from a terrible game.This time arround the PC port is much improved, Keyboard and Mouse actually work, no modding required this time, same with the graphics. Still plently of room to prove but this port is defenantly much improved over Dark Souls port, and since this is only the second PC port From has done, I'm ok with letting the few minor issues slide. Rome wasn't built in a day after all, and one can not expect a develuper to suddenly turn out 'the best PC ports ever' after one game.So what all is diffrent with this port. The menus are all mouse driven, the keyboard controls are all set up in a manner a normal human would use, for the most part. There's still no slotting items and spells to the number keys for quick use, probably never will be ether due to balancing reasons, and theres just a lot more options for settings and such then before. all in all not the best port, but again, a good couple sets above Dark Souls.Now, what about the game it self? Well, it's kind of a mixed bag. Combat remains largely unchanged, all the skills and habbits you picked up in Dark Souls will translate, for the most part, unmolested, to Dark Souls II. For the most part, charging in and trying to face tank things with get you dropped in a hurry, and a good shield is still your best friend as is being slightly paranoid while playing. One thing they changed is what enemys spawn in groups. In Dark Souls, the much tougher enemys spawned alone  and far enough away from every thing else there was little to no chance of drawing in more enemys. In Dark Souls II this has been changed so that those tougher enemys, like the Mastadons and Everything in the Dragon Shrine spawn two or three deep. This applys to the bosses as well, as there are FAR more boss fights that involve more then one boss monster at a time, or bosses that spawn more enemys in general. The problem is, the Combat system is still only designed for one on one combat, which makes these bosses and enemys more harder then they needed to be. That said though, the game is actually easyer then Dark Souls. This has to do with all the healing Items avaible to you, as there are ten diffrent items that restore HP in Dark Souls II, as a frame of refrence, there are only two in Dark Souls, three if you count the item that gives a temperary HP boost. No only are there a lot of diffrent healing items, most of them are in abundence, some being buyable in infinute amounts after certain points, same applys to the ores needed to upgrade equpiment, though to a far lesser degree. another thing that makes the game easyer is the 'genocide' mechanic, as I've taken to calling it. What it does is put a respawn limit on enemys, meaning if your farming souls to level up or what have you, you WILL run out of enemys to kill, after around twelve times or so. There is an Item you can use to get another twelve respawns but that also puts that area in NG+ mode, so care needs to be used lest you screw your selfAnother area which is mixed is the area designs. While the all look good and carry a good atmosphere befitting a Souls game,  some of them feel ... generic, and worse then that, they have no flow to them. Most noteable is the transition from Earthen Peak to the Old Iron Keep. (you take an ELEVATOR, from the top of a broken tower/windmill with nothing around or above it, into an active volcano.) or Aldia's Keep to Dragon's Aerie/Dragon Shrine, which also makes no geographical sence. mInd you, the areas all look nice, but that lack of geographical continuity took a lot away from the game for me, however I belive this issue is the direct result of two choices. 1) Dark Souls II isn't an open world like Dark Souls, its a hub world like Demons Souls (minus the teleporting to the areas to get into them intitally) 2) You can warp via the Bonfires right from the start, unlike in Dark Souls where you where most the way into the game before that unlocked.Enemy designs are  lack luster, with WAY to many of them being some veriant of 'guy in armor', normal enemys, the tougher mods, even bosses, are, for the most part are just 'a guy in armor', granted, some of them, like the Black Dragon Knights, look awesome, but if your like me you'd be tired of seeing some guy in armor long before the end of the game, and the lore of the game does little to improve things. It has it's bright spots to be sure, and like Dark Souls it is fertal grounds for debate, it's just not up to the bar set with the first game.Another misstep is PvP, while it 'works' better mechanically, it's actually a worse system. First of all, if your not into PvP, tough,  ether deal with the invasions, or go offline, those are your only options. This is because you can now be invaded as a Hallow as well as human now which can be something of a pain in the ♥♥♥. Another issue is the match making. while I'll freely admit I don't understand how it works, I know it's got to do with your Soul Memory and not your Soul Level, like in Dark Souls and I know a lot of people where complaining about having issues finding some one in PvP because of it, I don't think its been corrected yet ether so just be aware if PvP is your thing. A more personal issue that is likely to REALLY ♥♥♥♥ new players off is how easy it is to stumble into two PvP zones. The Saints Grave and Doors of Pharos are both set in such away that if you don't know those are optional zones, your very likely to wander in and then you'll have to deal with the PvP 'fun' of the Rat Coven, again, if PvP isn't your thing, be aware.Speaking of the Covens, if your not into PvP, most of them will be worthless to you, if you are, well, only some of them will be if only due to the rewards not being worth the effort (unless your talking about the Blue Sentinals, in which case your better off killing the Coven leader because he drops the armor you get for metting the rediculous requirments to max it out), and even then, there no penalty for abbandoning one for another which kinda makes only being allowed to be in one Coven at a time silly. Over all, as a Successor to Dark Souls, it fails to live up to the standard set. That said. As a video game devoriced from Dark Souls. It is still a very good, well built game that most every one seeking a challenge and a game that doesn't hold your hand can enjoy if they have the right mind set for it.			"

												There is nothing to say - absolute masterpiece in Action/RPG genre.Well actually things I personally didnt like, comparing to DS1: 1) More linear level design - much less alternative routes, ability to teleport between bonfires from start of the game=>locations almost not connected to each other). Remember Depths, Blighttown and Sen's Fortress from original DS - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mazes2) Bosses - like more than half of them are knights, yes - well designed, but fights with them too monotonous.3)And maybe soundtrack not so memorable with exceptions of Majula, Vendrick's theme, Nashandra, Credits music and 2 or 3 bosses.But the rest is at the same high level and even better. Gorgeus Atmosphere, level design. Difficult and deep lore. Interface - much more convenient to use. PvP and ""Jolly Cooperation"" - even more fun and addictive.9/10			"

												if they were not re making this game with updated graphics and extended game play i would not write this.this is my favourite game of all time.the most fun, the most rewarding.so hard and not so easy. so fun and so challenging.great amount of options ingame to make replayability a huge desire.everything is just done perfectly.then they announce to re creation over haul of the game, that will NOT overwrite previously purchased pc editions.this is madness...so deffinatly buy this game once its redone, because if this edition is your purchase, you will have an empty community and less bang for your buck.the re creaction/overhaul will have all the insanely awsome expansion packs included in the game.so wait, only a few more months away...if your really keen and only want a solo run, with origional graphics and no extensions, then buy this edition of the game.its awsome and alot of fun. i for one will be re buying and replaying all over again... why?because Dark Souls 2 is a great game, maby the greatest RPG to date.

												I don't just ""not recommend"" this game ; I strongly recommend against buying it.  If you buy this game, you will be stuck with an obsolete version of ""Dark Souls 2"" that has no upgrade path to the new version that is coming in April 2015.  The newer version of the game will have an updated graphics engine (using DX11 vs DX9), support 6-player multiplayer, and it will include other changes to the game that won't be made available to owners of this ""Dark Souls 2"" game.  Savegames & achievements will not transfer from the old version to the new, and the online will be totally separate for the two versions.  The fragmented online will hurt both versions, but I think this version will suffer the worst as nobody will be buying it anymore.It actually never occurred to me when I bought this game that I could end up being stuck with an obsolete version of the game that's completely cut off from the newer better version.  If you haven't bought this game, just keep it that way & you win.			"

Congratulations, DARKSOULS II exists, and it's available on steam so you can have mom-argument-difficulty fights for hours on end, except this time you have a chance of winning.  Use nothing but your wits, dodges, hundreds of weapons, and magical swag to fight enemies that want to take all your health more than a hobo wants a 4 course meal.

												For Anyone who has played Dark Souls 1 and enjoyed it, I would say to just keep playing that.  Dark Souls 2 dissappoints in many ways, and the story is just 'go here kill okay you're done'.  Filled with artificial difficulty (tons of enemies, lots of health), this game feels like it was just thrown together and tries too hard to be 'hard' like the original.			"

												This is the best action role-playing game since Dark Souls.What I LikedEasy to learn, hard to master: Weapons can attack one-handed or two-handed, right-handed or left-handed, quickly or forcefully, and they have special attacks after running or rolling. Attack combos are never more than two button presses. Shields, bows, and catalysts work like weapons, but block, shoot, or cast instead of attacking. Regardless of what you wield, you can run, jump, roll, and use items. That's pretty much it; Dark Souls 2's actions are simple and intuitive. However, using them effectively requires much more attention than is needed in far more complicated games. For example, in Tekken 6, once a long combo is started, muscle memory can do all the work for a good five seconds. In Dark Souls 2, every single action must be carefully chosen, timed, and placed.Ernest Hemingway: ""If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them."" Dark Souls 2 applies this idea to its story and setting, and the result is quite compelling. Even the significance of the final boss is something you probably won't immediately understand—but there is at least one good explanation for that and for just about everything else in the narrative. You can find that explanation if you take the time to find all the clues and put them together. (And if you don't care to do so, there are plenty of good lore videos on YouTube to do it for you.)Massive replay value: There are countless possible variations for player characters, both aesthetic and mechanical. The eight classes are each tailored to a different combat style, yet even they don't represent every viable style (e.g. pyromancy and hexing don't have dedicated classes). It may be illustrative to note that of the 650 hours I've spent on this game so far, the most I've spent on one character has been 150 hours.Originality: Feel free to design your character as the typical JRPG protagonist (long-haired, pale-skinned, improbably young)... You will spend much of your first playthrough as the hideous green walking corpse of that character. Dark Souls 2 defies many tropes of both Western and Japanese RPGs (perhaps because it's a Japanese take on Western fantasy). It's not entirely a Darker and Edgier[tvtropes.org] Deconstructor Fleet[tvtropes.org], though; rather, it intermixes strongly contrasting elements—beauty and ugliness, light and dark, benevolence and malice—in a way that makes these extremes more striking when encountered.Well-balanced items: There are heated discussions in the Souls community about this or that overpowered weapon, armor, ring, or spell. What I've noticed, however, is that in my encounters with other players, there's plenty of variety in equipped items—which suggests that there are very few truly dominant items.What I DislikedSome assembly required for KB&M: Keyboard and mouse are quite usable (unlike the unmodded first game), but onscreen button prompts display Xbox 360 buttons instead of your key bindings. The default bindings are also not very good, so if you're a KB&M enthusiast, expect to spend your first hour setting up bindings, and expect to spend your first few hours getting used to them. Important: In order to detect double-clicking, the game waits a half-second after each mouse click before executing the associated action. You can use the ""Disable double clicking"" option to remove this delay, but as of Version 1.07, this only works until you quit. Each time you restart the program, you must turn ""Disable double clicking"" off and then on again for it to take effect.What I RecommendConsider playing the first game: You don't need to play Dark Souls to understand Dark Souls 2, but the former is an equally great game. Each has strengths and weaknesses, relative to the other, but the only real reason to right now play Dark Souls 2 instead of its predecessor is that the online community is somewhat more active in the newer game (as of November 2014). If you do play Dark Souls, and if you use the keyboard and mouse,  DSfix[www.nexusmods.com] and DSMfix[pages.cs.wisc.edu]will help a lot.Don't read walkthroughs during your first playthrough: Many of the challenges in Dark Souls 2 are greatly diminished if you read online about the ideal tactics. It's much more satisfying to win a fight through your own wits than to apply someone else's methods for an easy win. You can get some hints from the in-game messages left on the ground by other players, but these are limited, so that they rarely give you the whole solution to a problem.Other CommentaryHonor in PvP: By design, most PvP is asymmetric: In an invasion, the host can heal and summon help, but the invader can hide behind monsters. In Rat King Covenant PvP, the summoner can use the entire level against the victim, but the summoner is also the only one with anything to lose. Because PvP is so rarely fair, honor is rarely appropriate. If you really want an honor duel in Dark Souls 2, here's the best way to go about it:  Go to Iron Keep and use a dragon sign (or place your own). When the opponent appears (or when you're summoned), move to just inside lock-on range and bow. If the opponent bows in return, start drinking your Estus and see if they do the same. Once you both have used up your Estus (as signified by the ""no more Estus"" animation), an honor duel can begin. It precludes an honor duel if someone uses a buff or moves to an advantageous position before the duel begins.	Soul Memory: Nothing is more intensely criticized by the Souls community than Soul Memory—the quantity of souls your character has ever possessed, which is used for online matchmaking. There are two common criticisms.  Souls can be permanently lost but still contribute to Soul Memory, so that two characters of vastly different power levels could be matched, because one has permanently lost far more souls than the other. One cannot maintain characters optimized for multiplayer against a specific boss or in a specific area, since one's Soul Memory will eventually surpass the range of most other characters fighting that boss or in that area.	I tend to think both criticisms are blown out of proportion. Dark Souls 2's logarithmic power curve makes it so even someone who's permanently lost half their souls is only at a small disadvantage against someone who's permanently lost none. Also, if characters could stop their Soul Memory from increasing—even if it meant making their saved games essentially read-only—this would allow too much optimization for specific circumstances, making these ""locked"" characters far more effective than those moving normally through the game. Soul Memory is not a perfect system, but early-game invasions are much more manageable in Dark Souls 2 than in its predecessor, and I'm pretty sure that's because of Soul Memory. "

												Some of my favourite things about this game:-Co-op is almost always successful-PvP works alot better-PvE was done really well-many new items and many classicsThings i didn't like:-PvP (Alot of people seemed to use magic thus resulting in less sword PvP)-The Map itself (It was terrible and alot of things out of place)-Barely any shortcuts-Bonfire warps instantly-Dumbed it down from dark souls one so more people would enjoy the game-Again, the map lacked that dark atmosphere that dark souls 1 hadSo in conclusion,If you played demon souls or dark souls 1 you will find this game less apealingIf you havn't played any souls games you will most likely love it-I think all round dark souls 1 is the better game but this is a dark souls 2 review so,this is still a great game and ive finished it 3 times on NG+ thus having enough experience to judge this game.Grahpics: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Atmosphere: 4/10			"

												Love this game. Just like Dark Souls and Demon Souls before that, this game is brutally hard. The new bosses, new enemies, new characters. (A couple are forgettable though) Overall, an excellent game.There's more story here than in previous FS titles, however it's still abstract enough to weave your own tale from. Also, the option to postpone a NG+ is awesome, since you can use that time to finish off any optional bosses you may have missed.Pros:+ Excellent sound and design+ Excellent soundtrack. The music is really good! Outdoes any of their previous work+ 60 FPS is awesome. No need for mods to unlock it. The experience is awesome, even without modding the ♥♥♥♥ out of it+ PVP duels. PVP is still here, but you can now dual people from your covinant. A really nice featureCons:- Still has some crazy glitches- Some bosses are way to predictable and offer no real challenge. (Thankfully just a few. The majority are still hard)- Parry/Reposte and backstabs. WTF? Backstabs are still OK to do, but parrying is rediculous. I prefer DKS1 system betterAll in all, if you're a Souls fan, this is a must own. The replay value alone is enough to satisfy your need for masochism. I can't recommend this game enough!			"

												Dark Souls 2 is more accessable compared Dark Souls 1 in my opinion, still, I think the first game is better.However, the singleplayer experience is great nonetheless. Your potential Weapon arsenal is huge, as well as the amount of armor sets and single pieces.You don't need to worry about spending your levels wrongly as much as in the first game. You get the opportunity to respecc with items you can find in a limited amount in each playthrough.The DLCs offer new challenges and interesting new equipment, though some are more fun to play than others, again in my opinion.If you don't care how much money you spend or your friends play it, buy this one plus season pass.The ""new"" version (Scholar of the first Sin) costs as much as the original version(this one) however containes all  expansion dlcs, I recommend SotfS more than the base game in terms of Money/content			"

												After playing the PS3 version since it's release I have to say that this pc version is great, IF you play with a (x360) controller.The game looks much much nicer ""straight out of the box"" and the loadingtimes are so much shorter. To me, the game plays exactly the same as on the PS3, though I've noticed a small flaw here and there (like a mousecurser popping up every now and then when using a menu, even though I use a controller). But those are small issues that either will be fixed or I can live with.The biggest problems everyone seems to have with it are:1) The graphics aren't the same as in the trailers. From Software already responded to this, but people still seem keen on mentioning it and asking for a refund.2) The mouse+keyboard controls aren't working properly? Or at least they complain about the game giving them x360 buttons onscreen and in the menu's instead of keyboard buttons.3) Some pc users refuse to use a controller for several reasons: they feel the game should be able to play well with kb+m, they don't want to pay extra for a controller to play a pc game or whatever.4) Some people haven't gotten their pre-order bonusitems. Most of them bought the game at a ""discount cd-key shop"", which is the main reason they didn't get the items.5) Some people are getting errors when trying to start/play the game. This is probably due to software issues (not updated graphics drivers?) or hardware issues (hardware not sufficient to run the game?). I play on a 3 year old gaming pc and had no trouble running it in the highest settings. 6) Some find this game too easy. But some find this game too hard. As a ""veteran"" of the Souls-series I find this game has some easier parts (especially in the beginning of the game) and some hard parts (later on). All in all this is a great game with a few bugs, which will probably be patched or fixed with a community-made fix. I feel this game fits perfectly in the Souls series, having both elements from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. I love playing it and if you're interested, it's totally worth a try. You might want to wait a few days until the first patch has been released though, to make sure most of the bugs have been fixed.Enjoy ^^			"

												There is a great game trying to happen here but its marred by bad design choices and poor experties by Fromsoft. the overall feel of it is lacking, no real plot what so ever, the best i can come up with is your in drangliek because you are, why are you killing these bosses and progressing through the game, because its the only thing to do, who are these bosses the answer is mostly some dude in a suit of armour or a monster.The coding is screwed to the extreme, there is no way this is a lead platform when changing the fps to 60 changes how enemies move or attack, an example is alonne knights or the dog things from the gutter with their 360 bite attack which hits you halfway throught he animation or maybe the spider zombies in brightstone cove which can hit you just as you kill them.The stats have been changed alot and for the worse. The names why is my equip load called vitality but my health is vigor? In fact why did they split the gain of weight limit and stamina gain into 2 diffrent stats? Iframes from rolling must now be bought via adaptability, and you will be rolling because you wont use a sheild for 70% of the game as only about few are worth actualy using not that turtling behind a sheild would have been usefull as there is a guardbreak move to stop that.Now the locations are good looking but not in anyway coherent, travel through a poisen area up a tower then take a lift to a castle on a lake of lava, where did this lift take me why is there lava above a tower. The locations may look cool the best one is drangliek castle after you go through the shrine of winter, the feel and atmosphere is great. But others are small rooms or single areas which just require backtracking or frustrating paths.The bosses are okay and lets leave it at that becuase the developer must have been told capra, O and S and four kings from Dark Souls 1 were the hardest boss battles so to make the bosses harder in this game we must add more of them prime example is gargs in belfry luna, dark souls 1 = 2 gargoyles and the second one spawns with half health dark souls 2 = 5 gargoyles all with full hp and then the total hp reaches a certian point more spawn mostly when you have almost killed one another will join. Or the prime spam boss Dear Duke's Freyja, the most dangerous things in the boss room are the small spiders i could kill the big one in my sleep its the small ones which are most dangerous.Soul memory i actualy like the idea of and how its implimented, would i like an option to swith between soul memory and soul level connectivity yes but its not that bad. The signs are a great idea as well small signs for short summon times or if the boss has been killed and big for longer times and if the boss is unkilled.AH but how are the builds you think, well they are rubbish strength is great fun as the lowest defence is strike for most enemies, dex is nerfed doubly by only getting half the paramater bonuses that strength does and durability being so small its horrible to play with some weapons. And most people who have played Fromsoft's games know they have a hardon for magic especialy dark magic and hasn't nerfed it at all since the game came out, also dont bother with faith as they ruined that build with the second dlc.DLC meh didnt try it the main game is sub par so its most likely subpar aswell, from what i have seen and heard is more gangs of enemies swaming the players, reusing bosses from the main campaign as literal copy pastes with pallet swapping from some.Overall a 5 or a 6 out of 10 worth getting if you want it but otherwise dont bother get dark souls 1 its better in every aspect, also lost izlith is better then some areas in dark souls 2 and they didnt finish lost izlith.

												Its the cynical by-the-numbers sequel we were all secretly expecting. Dark Souls 1 is the better game in most aspects, but DKS2 triumphs in a couple places.1, the new game+ has seen a lot of hard work and theres chunks of content you cant even see until youve beat the game several times.2, secrets are way more prominent, be they the new super-hidden false walls or inaccessable parts of old areas you can revisit.3, there was a revamped lighting system planned in development, where you could forego your off-hand to carry a torch and illuminate dark areas. The lighting plan was more or less ruined by release, but theres still a good 2 or 3 levels where a torch is viable, and those levels tend to be pretty awesome (except for shrine of amana, for unrelated reasons).4, dks2 is a better PC port than dark souls, with steamworks instead of GFWL, passable keyboard controls and a less insulting options menu.Otherwise, you get more for less by just getting the first game. Lore, combat, exploration, enemy variety, level design, bosses and multiplayer; whatever 2 actually improves upon, it simultaneously breaks so much that it may as well have not bothered.If you loved dks1 and just want more dark souls, this product more or less performs as advertised.

So now Namco want's 55 dollars from me to play the game i already own the way it was meant to be played. I will never purchase a from software or Scamco Scamdai game in the forseeable future.			"

												The Dark Souls genre is without a doubt the best thing ever done in games. At first you hate it, we all do, but then once you get the hang of it by learning from your mistakes (what this game is all about) you will love it. Experience the sweet joy of beating a boss or an enemy you kept dying by. Experience the joking around with friends (which is easier in Dark Souls 2) and the intense pvp. There might be some hackers, there might be flaws, but still the game that was worth every penny.10/10 experience, would play time and time again, build after build.			"

												One of the biggest let down in a game I have ever bought. I was so ready to love it, so ready to be immeresed in a story that would enthrall me like those games from which it came. But...something must have happened in its developement.There are many reasons this is. Going through 2 loading screens to level up, levels that look beautiful but are basically a hallway with a for in it, varrying levels of quality, puzzling map design (go up elevater of tower that is nowhere near volcano or mountain, appear in a castle on top of a castle), pvp got gutted, it feels.....hollow.There is no fear, there is no attachment, there is no love like I had with the others. It isn't a bad game, but it isn't a great game. It isn't a game I would sink tons of hours into. This is a dumbed down version of its brothers. It could have been so much more, it had potential, but it stumbled. I have never felt sad about a game falling short before, but anger or indeference. I felt sad for this game, I felt sad for what this could have been.			"

Please, take notice that if you're buying this game now, you'll be buying an OLD VERSION of it, as the newer version with all the new DLC's in it will be released in 4 months with extra content. The new version will split the community in two parts which will lead the the end of DaS2 Online play.If you're buying this game now, you'll have to spend 50€ for the next-gen version. More information coming from FromSoft end of this month. Game is good, but wait for the next gen one to come out.PRO's:- Exciting game, easy to coop if you start playing at the same time. ( Due to the addition of the Name engraved ring )- Has a high skill curve PvE wise, some mobs are weak to x weapon, you'll have to adapt yourself to the game making it a challenging game.- Hours of fun, your first playtrough should take 30 - 50 Hours And then there's NG+ Which adds even more content.- Dlc's are good.- Some references to DS1 if you already played the first one.- You get rewarded if you finish the game without dying or resting at a bonfire.CON's:- Not much lore, but they're fixing it with Scholar of the first Sin.- PvP is repetitive in high SM as you'll be facing the same people using the same meta ( Current meta being chaos katana, havel, jester, etc. )- Some bosses / Invaders have ♥♥♥♥ AI and will just fall to their dead if you know how to do it. ( Which does offer speedrun routes! )- Bad servers, making cooperation & PvP laggy.- You'll have to buy a controller, or else you won't be able to guard break, leap attack or make a correct use of all the small things the controls have to offer. ( This game is a port from Xbox, an xbox controller is recommended )- Farming will be necessary if you want to try out everything.			"

												This time around From Software did a decent job porting the game to the PC graphically speaking, with the game running much more smoothly compared to their consoles counterpart. Unfortunately in other areas, such as control scheme, the problems found in Dark Souls I is still present here. GUI menus are still labeled with XBOX controller layout. And whichever employee came up with the bright idea that mouseclick and doubleclick should be bound to two different commands in combat should be fired. Oh you clicked the mouse button a nanosecond too fast? I am sure you meant to do strong attack instead of a combo so here, have a strong attack! HAHA! Oh you want to unbind the doubleclick command so you won't make this mistake anymore? Well, that means when you doubleclick, you just want to stand there doing nothing while that monster wails at you, right? Sure, we can do that! HAHAHA! Oh, now you want to bind both mouseclick and doubleclick to light attack so you can pull a simple combo without throwing your mouse at the wall in frustration? HAHA NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT! These control scheme problems are easily fixed by plugging a gamepad to your PC so I hope you have one! Otherwise, have fun with all the silly control scheme issues the game have. Shame because the game itself is excellent provided you have a gamepad, but it is nigh unplayable using a keyboard and mouse.tl;dr:Excellent game provided you have a gamepad for your PC, annoying Chuck-the-mouse-at-the-wall-and-headbutt-the-keyboard-in-frustration problems with GUI and control schemes without one.

												What a great game 9/10 for sure. It's hard, very hard but dont give up and keep practicing with your rolling and blocking skills. Most deaths you get is because someone is to eager to strike again. You need patience in battle.So far done 5-6 bosses and everything solo. Some were pretty hard but mostly after 15-20 tries i got their attack patterns so figured out it worked without a problem.would seriously recommend this game to anyone up for a challenge.			"

												Alright. I've heard many people saying this game is a pile of excrements and you really shouldn't play it. These people are mostly Dark Souls 1 Players who can't go with their favorite game being altered a little here and there.So, before I state my opinion, have some facts about me and the Souls franchise:-I played both Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, but I haven't played Demon Souls. I didn't even watch a lot of gameplay or anything.-I really liked Dark Souls 1, but was scared of the New Game+, so I had 2 NG playthroughs.-I'm watching a lot of YouTube about DkS1 and 2 (going to abbreviate from now on) and really enjoy it.-I'm not a noob in DkS1/2, but not even close to some people I've me, and I still use the wiki a lot for locations of keys or certain rings and stuff like that.-I own a gamepad!So here's my opinion about DkS2:YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THE GAME IF YOU-Don't have a gamepad and are not willing to buy one (!)-You're looking for a game that leads you through the plot and ""takes you by the hand"" as many people say it-You can't deal with the sadness and rage that come with every death-You are a casual gamer and don't have the motivation to finish a game that doesn't make you happy at some point-You're an idiot who needs a great deal of explanation to understand a gameSo, if you don't fulfill any of the criteria above: Congratulations, you might enjoy this game!I think it's a pretty good game. It has the possibilities for some really interesting and cool Multiplayer/Co-op fights (that DkS didn't have due to the devils spawn that goes by the name of ""Games for Windows Live"") and I was so pumped for more lore after finishing DkS that I really enjoyed the main plot itself.If I had to compare this and its prequel, i'd say DkS1 is better, which doesn't mean that this is not worth playing though.I've had a couple of NG playthroughs and 1 NG+ (which really ♥♥♥♥ed me up at some points) and I own all the DLCs and played them (watch out for a large dificulty spike thoughout the Iron Crown one ._. ).Lemme give you some stats now. Criteria Score Why? Graphics6/10Not amazing or some special art style besides dark-and-old-ishGameplay8.5/10Really hard at the start, but gets easier and more enjoyable after some timeLore9/10I love the way DkS1/2 tell a story and the plot is really interesting and dark (You might want to look up some lore if you can't get into it or don't understand it (-> https://www.youtube.com/user/VaatiVidya)Difficulty Level and Distribution7/10Some areas are pretty easy while others feel unbeatable. Its an enjoyable difficulty level though and after some practice, you'll probably also get through the hardest areas----> My conclusion is -RECOMMENDED- for people who played DkS or like this kind of genre.I hope this Review helps someone at one point and for anyone who bought it: Have fun with the game! :)			"

Genre: RPG/Open worldI know that the multiplayer is practically dead, but I still wanted to review this game because of the awesome memories I have, since this is the game I've played most in my life and it's one of my favorite games.Review for people who are familiar with Souls franchise, comparison with the first partI must say that aside from multiplayer and maybe gameplay, first part of the series is better in every aspect of the game. However this is still a great game. Gameplay is smoother, but I am not sure if it's better. It's just feels smoother. There are no instant backstabs anymore. Bosses are not that memorable, 4 big bosses are pretty disappointing, lore is pretty boring, whole atmosphere is so friendly totally opposite of the first part of the game, since there are NPCs everywhere, and areas are kinda not that gloomy. I kinda prefered the gloomy atmosphere of the first game, and that feeling of loneliness. DLCs are pretty good however. As for multipalyer, well I think it's way better(at least it was when people played it), since there is no instant backstab anymore, so people are not fishing for backstabs that much, however many weapons are/were broken. I really had a good time with a mutliplayer of this game, where I spent over 500 hours just playing multiplayer in one location of the game. Overall this game is pretty good, but not as memorable as the first game, a bit disappointing pve wise, but amazing pvp wise. In my opinion, Dark Souls 2 had best multiplayer ever, even though it was a bit broken.Regular reviewDark Souls as a franchise is very unique. Many people who are thinking about buying this game, have probably heard stories about how Dark Souls is a brutal game. Well it is really hard at the beginning, but when you get used to the game, and when you get better armor and better weapons, it gets way easier. So how the game works? Every time you die, you lose all your souls(Dark Souls money). If you go back to same location where you died you can collect your souls, but if you die again before collecting souls you will lose them forever. You can use those souls to level up and then upgrade stats, to buy stuff, etc. You can obtain souls by killing enemies, or collecting souls through items. Now, enemies. You have normal enemies, and when you first start playing the game, you will realize that there are no trivial easy enemies. After a while you will get used to it. Aside from normal enemies there are bosses, and killing the boss in Dark Souls franchise is one of the most satisfying things you can do in gaming, since they tend to be really hard.In this game you can play melee, you can cast magic or miracles, all depends on how you wish to play. Gameplay is pretty smooth in Dark Souls 2, kinda weird at the beginning, since it's littler slower than in other games, but it's amazing like in every Souls game. You need to worry about your equip load so you don't roll slowly or move slowly. There are bunch of weapon classes, and bunch of weapons. Swords, greatswords, ultra greatswords, axes, whips, shields, daggers, etc. Many miracles and sorceries too.Multiplayer works like this. You can invade the world of other player with some special items, and there you can kill them while they are playing through game. You can play co-op with another two players, or phantoms. You can also post red sign on the floor and if someone calls you can duel with them. In invasion people usually don't play fair, they use enviroment, but in duels you play 1vs1. But that all depends on the player and on how he/she feels. Sometimes I played fair even in invasions, but sometimes I just wanted to have fun. In my opinion, Dark Souls 2 had best mutliplayer ever, even though it was a bit broken.Personal rating: 9/10 "

												NOTE: This review is from someone who has not played the original Dark Souls.This game is hard, very hard. Is it the hardest? No. Definitively not. But it is hard. Death will be common. But if you keep powering through, you will get better, and then it really gets fun. The weapons in this game allow almost, I repeat, ALMOST   any weapon viable, the exceptions being mostly joke weapons and the pickaxe. Casting is useful in both PvE, and PvP. Sadly, most PvP matches end up with you fighting the same weapon over and over again *cough* Chaos Blade *cough*. Also, the armor in this game lets you have a lot of freedom with how you want your character to look. I've personally seen many cosplays in-game, while making a few myself. I've seen characters ranging from Zero from the Mega Man franchise to The Miner from Risk of Rain. Personally, with the amount of hours I've put into this game, I find PvE not that difficult or interesting, what holds me to this this game it the PvP. Now the PvP is flawed, definitely. Laggy players end up one-shotting you with magic or a backstab, backstabphishers are everywhere, and hackers run rampant. Hackers in general are a major problem. Its very simple to do it, and you can really get screwed by them. Firsthand, I have seen plenty of hackers, I've seen infinite health hackers, casters that can cast huge AoE hacks impossibly fast, and, my personal favorite, a person who invaded me, backstabbed me into an area (since backstabs teleport you to where it connected on their end) where I couldn't kill myself, and proceeded to enter the safe haven Majula, which is not invade-able, and has the only merchant that sells you healing items and never runs out of stock and a merchant that sell you an infinite supply of most upgrade materials. Killing other players' NPCs is also not possible legitimately. Even after all that, I still love this game. Its probably in my top 3 favorite games. Just know what can happen. Also,please use a controller when you play this game, the keyboard controllers really bad, in my opinion. Also, just want to say this at the end, make sure you can run this game. Just saying. Don't be like me, the player who doesn't have a good enough graphics card, and plays the game without being able to see particles, including, but not limited to, summon signs, bloodstains, and all casts, excluding crystal magic. If you're asking how I play the game, most casts have a drop shadow under them, so I use that to my advantage. Still have no idea when hexes are happening, unless I see them cast it, since most of those don't have drop shadows. Still I play this game almost religiously with this problem.If you love a good challenge, and you have hours you want to spend, buy this game.			"

												I'm not really sure where to start with this game, it's amazingly well made for a person to start into the series.Of course, people who have already played the previous games may find it a little more easy than I do, because of their experience on what to do, what not to do, and how difficulty ramps up.But what I can safely say, the combat is very rewarding and rarely ever have I died unavoidable deaths, well, besides one sort of death, falling. It's unavoidable because no matter how hard I try, I will get caught in the heat of the moment and die. But at the same time, it is usually the least punishing death, as you can, most of the time, retrieve the items you lose on death and thus lose no progress whilst trying to avoid the spot the next time.On other notes, the games multiplayer is also, by what I've seen so far a very diverse experience, from co-operating with other people to invading them and instead, attempting to make their game worse whilst improving your own so to say.I'd rate Dark Souls as one of the hardest games I've played in a while though, that definitely. I have died so many deaths from being stupid and dodging too early, or too late, and thus getting the full blow of an enemy's attack which then either staggers me, takes half my health, both of them, or simply instakills me because I play a very squishy build.But all in all I can say, the game looks pretty, it plays well, even without a controller ( unlike the first, I tried it  but I couldn't continue) , has AMAZINGLY rewarding combat in my opinion.The only negative I find in it is Soul Memory, really, due to how it can mess up matching in PvP.

												The other night I had to choose between Dark Souls II and anime. Before I flipped the coin I said to myself, ""Both consist of crying and death, but one consists of more crying than death, and the other consists of more death than crying."" The moral of this story is: Praise The Sun.			"

												Souls are dark but not very. Sometimes you lose souls, sometimes no. But dark is maybe the lose of souls only. When you are dark then is lose but sometimes you dont lose the dark of very souls. They say all souls are lost but then what is dark of souls. Nobody knows this darkness of souls not very.			"

YouTube™ Video: Dark Souls 2 Critique 

			Views: 840,426		

			After finding myself let down by Dark Souls 2 I wanted to talk about many of the problems I had with it. This is a critique, not a full review.		

____My playtime for DS1 was about 110h.I gave DS2 a several tries and finally completed brining a total playtime to 67h.I guess in the end there are two major fractions of the Souls fanbase:* The fans of the game (this group complains about stuff like lore and immersion)* The fans of the metagame (this group very notably demand you to have at least 200 hours in the game to be able to voice any kind of opinion).For the second group DS2 is on pair or maybe even better than the DS1 with better fps, better pvp, larger variety of weapons and overall better mechanic. I think they don't really care about the game itself as the artistic product, but merely as a medium for their metagaming experience. Convenience is all about metagame and DS2 is definitely more convenient.For the first group DS is all about the game experience and the immersion. And from this point of view DS2 is absolutely abysmal. Every single design decision of the DS2 is simply not working in favor of game. What's worse, every bad design decision triggers a cascade of other problems and they snowball.* Levels are poorly connected, and often make no sense thematically.* NPC are completely uninteresting and too verbose.* The lore and story are virtually non existing.* Bosses are repetitive, often use the same movesets and are mostly recycled versions of other enemies.* Soul memory is not really working in favor of local coop.* Closely placed bonfires break immersion.* You have to go back to hub to level up which breaks immersion even more.* If you are using rings of protection you are completely deprived of any sense of challenge.* If you are not using ring of protection, you are faced with extremely limited human effigies and inability to farm them (as monsters are limited in this game).I can go on and on about it, but I guess you can get my point.

												Yes, there is a version of this game with DirectX 11 coming out, and yes it's supposed to be superior to this version. edit: it also includes all the DLC.Should that stop you from buying this version? Definitely NOT.Dark Souls 2 is a refreshing change of pace from most games that are typically being released (with the exception of a few games, ex. Wasteland 2, I also recommend that game!) with the idea of a combat heavy RPG. What makes this game different than the rest? I would personally have to say it's the detail and variety that goes into everything, like the lore, there are so many hints about some whatever scattered around in item descriptions, dialouge, and even the area you are in. There is also a ton of variety and originallity to be had with the surplus or weapons, armor, and rings the game will supply you with to keep you playing. In fact, there is so much variety that ""Fashion Souls"" is an actual thing, and AWESOME.  Everyone should know by now that this is supposed to be a hard game, and it is. It can be very tough on a beginner especially, but do NOT fret because it may be hard, but it's not unfair. The game will give you the advantage of being able to observe your enemy, learn their moveset, or they will give you an opening to go through to make things easier, give you a shortcut every now and then. Something like that. So the point is to not let the difficulty stop you from playing this game, because it can be overcome with some simple strategy.  The PvP is flawed, but not bad. You will run into jerks with a rapier that shoots magic and then spam you with it, yes there will be people wearing the Jester's top to prevent backstabs then spam attacks, but you will also meet a lot of people who use original builds or builds that will inspire you to maybe change up your build. Overall I would have to recommend this game to anybody who is looking for a fun game with an active community, or just anyone that wants to be challenged. I know there will be people who say this game is awful for the reasons of PvP or PvE, in fact I met someone who quit this game because L3 was jump. Do not be like that guy, because he used petty reasons to not try something DIFFERENT.			"

Always be careful, u never know when dark spirit will summoned to your game! INVADERS ARE EVERYWHERE! U'll hate it. :D And never try kill enemies fast u know, have patience. Best way how to survive!  Good things at this game :+ Graphic+ Controller needed (I love when games are betters with controller, muahaha)+ Enemies+ NO HOPE difficulty all the time+ A lot of spells, weapons, armors+ Story+ PvP+ Stages are beautiful + Create your own character  Bad things at this game :Here are not a lot but..- Lag at PvP if connection is not well (u'll just see after while how have you died)- A lot of holes where u can fall down (u'll hate it xD)- Soul Memory (if u want play with friend who have a lot higher or lower soul memory than u do, u will be not play with ur friend)			"

												As much as I want, I can't recommend this game on its own. After playing Dark Souls: Prepare to die edition, Dark Souls II felt incredibly stiff and slow. It wasn't like adjusting to a new, better game but to an older version with better grafics. I expected much and most of my expectations weren't satisfied. The story and the enemies are sure great, but it just doesn't feel like Dark Souls anymore.The best comparrison is the fight against the boss Old Dragonslayer, who's clearly based on a boss in Dark Souls I. There he was a real challenge, fast, agile and powerful, while in DS II he is slow and predictable.I don't want to say that you shouldn't play DS II at all, but the 32-bit version isn't worth your money, especially as you have to buy the DLC's seperatly from the game. Try Dark Souls II: Scholar of the first sin for the better gaming experience.			"

												Ruined expectations: The game. Where do I begin? The PvE is okay but nowhere near as good as in DaS1 or DeS: bosses are forgettable, most NPCs are there only for the purpose of buying items and nothing more, the OST is lacking, the ending was terrible and so was the final boss.The PvP is outright broken, ""great"" mechanics such as Soul Memory allow SL838s and SL150s to fight each other just because they have gained enough souls to be in the same SM range. It ends up with everyone using the same build since holding back on leveling up will leave yourself in disadvantage. Full Havel's/Santier's/Avelyns/hexes/monastery. Where's the fun in fighting that and just that? Not to mention that full Havel's makes your damage a joke. The PvP in the Souls series was always all about creating new imaginative builds and learning how to handle them with skill. In DaS1 or DeS your armor didn't really matter as much as it does here. An SL1 could beat an SL500 with a certain amount of skill. Not here, because the new engine makes controlling your character nowhere as good.I finished DS1 in 80 hours and the rest were put in PvP because there was always fun in making and fighting different builds. I don't have the motivation to continue playing this game. It's not possible to have fun while soul memory is a thing. I have many doubts that it will go away but we can only hope that it does.Only worth purchasing on a sale for PvE. In its current state it's not worth buying if you're willing to buy it for the PvP that comes afterwards.			"

												Yes, very recommended but...only for those who played Demon's Souls or Dark Souls and want some more without high expectations about the story.In general terms I really loved Dark Souls II. First Souls game with native HD and beyond resolutions for PC. Also the 60 FPS was a very important ""must"". The plot and lore are not that great as Dark Souls PTDE but it has his own good moments. This new entry is full of new items and some other little interesting mechanics like the coffin of Things Betwixt, the life gems and some new covenants. It was fun to discover them through the game. The humanity thing remains but this time is easier to handle. In general Dark Souls II has a lot of things to make the difficulty of newcomers easier (wich I recommend you don't abuse if you played a Souls before).About Souls and leveling this time you do it between Emerald Gerald in Majula. Similar to the Maiden in Black from Demon's Souls Nexus.About visual and sound...mmm... Visually is not mind blowing but is an step forward from PC Dark Souls with DS Fix. The art looks fantastic in lighting terms. Maybe is different in it's style in terms of environments and enemies design. A lot more cliche but enjoyable. Oh! rag doll is off in this game...and the lighting and assets from it's first gameplay shown to the world ¬¬ The sound design (foley etc) is good. But the music score is something I recommend you didn't expect to be better than previous games. But is good!...Take listen to Demon's Souls for instance. It has some interesting flutes and leitmotifs wich are missing on the next game. I find the Intro, Phalanx or the adjudicator one the most memorable ones. In Dark Souls there's a great variety of styles and there's even more memorable songs. And unfortunate for those who love the music of this games Dark Souls II is kind of flat...epic but flat. That doesn't mean i doesn't have it's moments ;)About the important thing...Gameplay. It's almost the same but more responsive and smooth. The kick was replaced for the shoulder push. But there's a lot more weapon styles even bare hands styles. I find my self on PvP with players with very strange setups xD and of course two hackers in a few months (I'm not very expect on the PvP thing). The only downside here is that ""Soul Memory System"" wich is not optional. The co-op. Now you can summon two players the NPC of the area you're (if it's available) and an internet player. This can make the game much easier. I don't recommend this much. I find myself solving some bosses with this method and then feeling horrible haha. But never again!Mmmm Boss Fights...they're not that interesting as the areas they're on. But there are some of this friends wich you'll hate at the same level as before.I think Dark Souls II is not a bad entry at all (BTW Hidetaka Miyazaki just supervised it but it wasn't it's director). We can't say is a bad game. Maybe a transition. I think it's better than have a hole until Bloodborne is released and of course it deserves it's price ;)			"

												While sticking to it roots Dark Souls 2 is a phenomenal sequel. Combat is addictive, the dungeon crawling is addictive; and the aspect of if you can't beat a certain boss, go to a different area and level up and gain new items and then return to the boss that once brought you such great misfortune. I'll simplify it this wayPros:It's still a souls game +PC controls are much more adequate than the last +Storyline is very intriguing +No class is better than the rest (Balanced) +Cons:Game feels linear late game (Compared to DS1) -Hitboxes go wonky once and a while and wont register (luckily they sometimes wont register back) -Too many bonfires - Message rating system isn't as convient due to trolls (I don't count this as a big negative, just an annoying scenario)Side notes:I don't as many games as I used, so this definitely satisfied my cravings for the time being, it's possible the only single/multiplayer hybrid game I've restarted played after beating.

												So I've just acquired 100% of the achievements to the game, and although it was totally unnecessary, I feel I'm qualified to write a review now.First of all; I started the game and I finished the game with keyboard and mouse. The default keybindings I found pretty terrible to be honest, and the game using Xbox controller key prompts made it all the more frustrating. After having played with a controller and changing the keys to my liking though, I have to say that I couldn't bring myself to go back to the controller.Dark Souls II has fairly decent graphics, but falls short of triple A releases. It makes up for that with a smooth 60 frames per second which is absolutely vital in a game like this which requires you to patiently learn enemies moves while dodging death by the breadth of a hair. Fortunately you don't need a beast of a PC to run it either, with my average (or below) set up of an AMD Radeon HD 6780 + four gigs of RAM I experienced maybe three or four frame drops through my ten characters.The game itself is really quite challenging. Casual gamers I'd imagine would have a hell of a time trying to adapt and I'd highly reccommend searching for the hidden attributes in some stats and what they fully affect, while Hardcore gamers will have plenty of room to trip up as well. Don't fret if the game feels too intimidating, failing is a large part of every Souls players first experience, it's the ecstacy in beating the jerk after your tenth try for some sweet revenge and coming back later in the game when you're more experienced to take the time to torture them.As far as Online Play goes... You'll find a lot of fantastic people willing to engage in jolly cooperation, but keep in mind that there are no rules in the Dark Souls universe, in a broken and decaying Kingdom it's every man for themselves and some people just want to watch the world burn.

												Dark Souls 2 threatens to be more of the same. That's great if by ""more of the same"" you mean, ""more of the same awesome hardcore, frustratingly satisfying experience."" That's what this is, more of the same. The only neg I have is that the bosses are less memorable that in previous From Software titles, and overall the game feels a bit easier (offset by more Adventure Game mechanics that toughen up progression) but it is by no means an easy game - it's still VERY very difficult.Enjoy the revamped multiplayer too.

												一通りクリアしてみて久しぶりに国産の良作を遊ばせて貰いました。難易度はかなり高めに設定されていますがwikiを参照したり白霊という他のプレイヤーを呼び寄せて共闘したりするとクリア出来ない箇所は無いと思います。豊富な武器や仕掛けに凝った地形、インパクトのあるボス戦の数々、それぞれに違った攻略法がありそれを見出して攻略していく楽しみはこのタイトルのならでは。攻略中に闇霊として他プレイヤーがホストを倒すために侵入してくるシステムはゲームに更なる緊張感をもたらします。ただ他プレイヤーを倒すだけを考えると装備がある程度決まってしまうのですが勝ちだけに拘らず多くの魅力ある武器で勝負してくるプレイヤーさんも沢山いるのでこのゲームはお勧めです。ダークファンタジーの代表作！			"

												This game will hand you a flimsy bit of wood, a broken bit of metal, then point you at a dude the size of a house, with a mace bigger than your whole body, and tell you to go kill him. You will die. A lot. And you will LOVE it! This game is brutal, infuriating at times, but incredibly satisfying when you finally kick the ♥♥♥ of that one boss that was throwing your ragdoll all over the boss cavern. There's nothing quite like it anymore either. Games have become far too easy. Far too ""casual"" to use the vernacular. This game is the counter to that. It starts hard and you can increase the difficult as much as you like either by starting New Game Plus (NG+) over and over, getting harder each time, or you can use items at the game's bonfire's that will increase the difficulty in that specific area permenantly. There are advantages to doing this, however, and many items / spells etc will only drop / become available on harder NG+. The community is also one of the more helpful that i've found. It being a mainly single player experience, but with the opportunity to do some ""jolly co-op"" by summoning allies to help fight difficult areas or tough bosses you feel you want a hand with. You can also go help others in order to gain various benefits. There is also the option to be a dickbag and invade other players with the sole purpose of killing them and stealing their humanity. Either way it's all tied together with the fantastic combat system.The gameplay is brutal but fair. Even fairly ""basic"" enemies can still kill you far into the game if you mess up your block or dodge or parry. But equally you can read their patterns and learn how to deal with them without taking any hits once you're practiced. There is so much to explore, so many side quests to uncover, secrets to puzzle out, hidden walls and illusions to find. You can play as a high strength / dex blademaster build then change your mind and respec to a full on fire throwing lightning slinging magic user when you feel like it using a (somewhat) rare consumable. On the topic of magic.... spells in Dark Souls are JUST as punishing as weapons. If not MORE so. There are some insanely powerful spells in the game and the limited uses per spell before you need to rest at a bonfire allows for them to be balanced. The sheer insane variety of ways to play and different builds available makes it a game i'm STILL not bored of, and STILL discovering more and more about. I've not even started the DLC's yet and i'm over 150 hours in on my main character. Sadly bows are somewhat lacklustre in the Souls universe which i attribute to balance reasons. They tend to require a lot of stamina to shoot compared to similar weight melee weapons, and their damage is pretty limited for the most part. There are some greatbows that launch treetrunks at people and can do heavy damage, but are so slow to fire and in pvp will leave you an easy target. I've always loved archery and all things bow related in my games, but even with the limited power of bows in Dark Souls II i'm happy with my Hunter's Blackbow +10's damage output. It's the fastest firing bow and takes less stamina than most. I combo it with poison arrows and can poison 90% of enemies in 1 volley (how many arrows i can fire before out of stamina) which is extremely useful in certain areas. Even with my love of bows, and normal preference for ranged classes, i don't find myself caring in DSII. The melee weapons are so varied and satisfying to use that i'm perfectly satisfied to use a mix of ranged bow shots to pick off tougher enemies / thin the pack, before taking out the rest with my swordplay.The whole game just feels so incredibly satisfying when you get good, and even when you ""think"" you're good, there's always the other player invaders to show you how wrong you are :P  "

												Note: My Steam hours recorded for Dark Souls: PTDE do not represent my actual playtime, I played the game back on xbox and don't care to continue on PC.That out of the way, I really like Dark Souls II a lot.  If you played the first Dark Souls and enjoyed it, pick this up.  Personally I prefer the second game but can see why others could choose the first.  Fast, brutal combat paired with wonderful design and world-lore define Fromsoftware's ""Souls"" series.  Prepare to die as they say, it's going to happen.There is a rerelease version of the game ""Scholar of the First Sin"". If you're looking to start playing, buy that instead of this.

Listen, this took me awhile to get my head around but there are two versions of Dark Souls 2.This is the original and then they re-released it in an act of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ary with better graphics and with some of the wrinkles ironed out. That version is called Dark Souls 2, Scholar of the First Sin. So I bought this version and it wasnt bad in fact it was quite addictive. I sum up this game as being stuck in a bad dream because its all just so crazy but surreal at the same time.The only thing it doesnt have going for it like the first Dark Souls game is that all the levels dont link up somehow. So you are reliant on bonfire travel to get around. Not a dealbreaker but you dont have that sense of awe when you come into a space that you have been before but through a door you didnt initially know how to get through.Highly recommend the game, its just up to you to decide whether you want this version which is cheaper or the slightly more expensive version.

												I was told i should review this...... I have 250+ hours on this game... And that's not counting 200 separate hours i put into Scholar of the First Sin...I only have 200 hours on DS1, and only about 100 on DS3... soo that's my review...Seriously, give this game a GOOD try, don't give up.Awesome environments, amazing combat system.The dodge timing is perfect in this game. (DS1 was too quick, DS3 lasted WAY too long making it too easy).PvP was best here of all 3 games, not too chaotic (like DS3) and not too limited (like DS1).Difficulty level is much more reasonable for new players than DS1.And get a damn controller!! But also, unlike DS1, this one actually plays ok with mouse+KB... and doesn't require 3rd party mods to fix awkward gameplay problems...And all the expansions were great.This is why i don't review games i REALLY like. I don't have anything constructive to say, except PLAY THIS GAME ALREADY! "

												Just buy the game. Seriously, just do it. Dark Souls 2 is everything and more you want from a sequel. It is fun, frustrating (what did you expect?), and challenging.However, you people love listing pros and cons, so here we go:Pros:- Graphics are beautiful.- Gameplay is awesome.- Challenging, slightly increased difficulty from Dark Souls (1).- Varied monsters, combat and scenery.Cons:- The PC controls. It is a bit tricky, I had some trouble adjusting to this part. However, for me it was easier to change the following:- Some bosses are overly influenced by the previous game.Left click - Attack right weaponDouble Left click - Strong attack, right weaponRight click - BlockDouble Right click - ParryQ - Use itemE - InteractFor more advanced players who might enjoy PvP:R: Strong attack, left weapon (parry).V: Attack, right weapon (if combined with W, this makes a shoulder push).Hope this helped, and have fun!

												Playing Dark Souls II reminds me of old video games like Into The Eagles Nest and Ghosts and Goblins where the technology was so limited that enemies were ultimately fair, tutorials were non-existent, and I didn't mind playing the same level over and over memorizing and perfecting it.  Dark Souls isnt exactly fun all the time, but it is engaging and satisfying.  Its more like a challenge, keep that in mind as you calibrate your expectations and you can get over the initial steep learning curve.  I died at least 4 times before the tutorial section even started.  But the tutorial was actually effective if you pay attention and attempt to apply it as the game continues.  The story is very light and absorbed through infrequent NPC character dialogue so it is importatnt that you aren't expecting a strong story or character driven narrative.  The difficulty ramp has been even over time, with the exception of bosses which are very short and brutal until you get the hang of that particular boss.  As you progress, the enemies become more varied so to encourage varied tactics from encounter to encounter.  This is not a game with which you can check-out and just enjoy.  You have to focus on the enemies actions and responding appropriately.  There are no exclamation points to warn you of an incoming attack.  The game requires that you use all of the available mechanics, first order optimizations will only lead to frequent deaths and frustration.  The enemies have access to all of the same abilities as you, the player.  In this way, it is scrupulously fair.  Ambushes are always detectable if you are paying attention.  No monster closets or enemies popping into existence because you crossed a threshold. It is a game to focus on and feel satisfied when you succeed.  So far, I am really enjoying it.  Note: I didn't play Dark Souls or Demon Souls.  I havent engaged in any multiplayer, though it exists in a coop form where friends can help you with boss fights and a PVP form where presumably frustrating people do frustrating things.			"

												The way ahead is completely covered in darkness. Apart from a few points of light in the distance and the orange glow that comes from the bonfire behind you, you can't see anything. You decide to light your torch, which casts its light over a small area around you. You don`t have much oil left to keep it burning, but it will have to do. Cautiously, you start moving.After scouting the location a little, you realize you are at the top of a big rock overlooking a dock. In the far distance, an immense ghost ship lies floating in the water. Somehow you feel that's where you are supposed to go.The path from the rock to the docks leads you through an abandoned village, now inhabited only by the undead. Creeping from every corner, they lunge at you from the darkness. Street after street and house after house you make battle with them, getting each time closer to the docks. The voyage takes more time than you previously expected though, and soon your weapon begins to degrade from beating against the metal your enemies were wearing at the time of their deaths.Soon, you find yourself with just an almost broken sword, no more healing items and a torch whose light is about to fade away. You are, however, much closer to the ship. You can see it more clearly now, its ragged sails wavering in the wind, calling you. Taking a deep breath, you go for the final stretch of the journey, hoping your now depleted inventory will be able to get you there in one piece.You find the bell that calls the ship to port just as the light of your torch finally dies. This is it, you`ve made it. Now all you must do is board the ship and hopefully a bonfire will be waiting for you at the deck. What you find inside though, is disappointing: more enemies. They are dispatched quickly but that doesn't do any good to your already worn off sword.You find the stairs leading to the ship`s quarters. That has to be it. By the end of these steps you hope only to find the long awaited bonfire, a place where you can rest, recover your healing items and fix your gear. Step after step you descend anxiously, turning the camera at the end to explore the room at which you arrive.The room is empty, except for a table, some chairs and... a fog door, which indicates a boss fight is imminent.  That's all you didn't need right now. Without any means to recover your health and carrying only a dull blade, the terrifying prospect of having to walk through that entire dark place all over again starts to creep up on you. Without any other choice, you buckle up and cross the damned gate.The vision that greets you is terrifying. A pair of giant skeletons, bound to each other like siamese twins, each armed with a pair of blades are already walking towards you, their feet chirping in the water that covers the floor of the flooded room. Without any items to recover your health, you know you can't afford to take even a single hit. So you raise your shield and keep your distance, studying the movements of the beast. After avoiding a few of its attacks you start feeling confident and are able to deliver them a few hits when their guard is down.The fight progresses slowly, as you only attack when you are sure it's safe to. The boss' movements are easy to predict and it starts to feel that victory will be yours, so long as you keep your strategy going.The skeletons' health drops to its half. Again they move to deliver the same pattern of attacks they've been doing since the beginning of the fight. You know how to react: just roll to the right, wait for them to raise their blades again, roll again to the right... and unexpectedly get hit in the face by a blow that totally shouldn't have gotten you. What happened? You were able to dodge all of their attacks so far, but this last one hit you despite you having done exactly the same movements as before.As you try to gain some distance from the creature, you notice you are moving slower. Why is this happening? The fight that was almost a sure victory has become a real nightmare. As the monster lifts his blades in the air for yet another blow, you realize in terror what has been going on: the water level in the room has been steadily rising since you entered the area.Welcome to Dark Souls.

												So a little insight on the world of Dark Souls 2. You begin the game with little to nothing and learn your way through twist turns and many perils. After figuring out what the heck you're doing you realize, ""This is pretty easy!!"" then you walk through that misty gate and Dark Souls 2 reminds you that you are worthless. All the work you just put into that area is gone like the blink of an eye! All in all, it's probably the best game you could ever invest your time into! DEFINTELY recommend!			"

												So i've recently been asked to write a full review of this game while completely ignoring that its a part of the souls series. As such i'm going to do just that.While the game is not a bad game it is flawed in many ways. Allow me to explain why.1 - Being hardNow, i say that its hard, but I'm not complaining about it being hard in the traditional sense. I'm not asking for an easier game either since in my opinion that'd be 20 kinds of dumb.I'm complaining about this because, while i enjoy a good challenging game, this game is hard just for the sake of being hard.Allow me to exemplify. There is an optional area in the game where the boss consists of 4 minions and the boss itself. The boss is untargetable until you attack one of the 4 minions, meaning you can't weaken him before commencing the fight. As for the minions, the second you attack one of them the remaining 3 immediately become agressive and attack you giving you around 5 seconds or so to dispatch them before the boss drops into the area and begins attacking you as well. This would be fine if the minions didn't inflict a status effect that deals a large ammount of damage over time with a mere 2 hits. This means you have to deal with the 4 minions, as quickly as possible, without getting hit twice and possibly have to deal with the boss itself should you fail to dispatch the critters in time.This is not what i'd call challenging, but as a gigantic pain the the neck instead. This isn't the only fight where this happens, but i'd rather not delve too much into it.2 - CombatWhile combat itself is pretty okay, i have some problems with it. Call it nitpicking if you will but there are just some things that don't really feel right.The hitboxes feel off sometimes, there's no other way to describe it, while playing i'll sometimes  see the effect caused by a weapon clearly hitting my opponent without it actually happening, and it makes me wonder if something is actually wrong with either my game or my computer.Another interesting little thing is that enemies never grow tired. The game itself has a stamina mechanic that forces you to think before you act, but enemies can dish out a flurry of attacks even though (from the story's/game perspective), they're in the same pseudo-zombified state as the player, the same can be said for their attack tracking ability, by this i mean there are certain enemies that will literally turn 180 degrees while in the middle of an attack just so they can attempt to hit you (in fact this was so bad in one specific enemy, that the developers actually had to reduce the tracking capabilities on said enemy's projectiles).This feels a bit off, and dare I say, makes the game harder, just for the sake of being harder.3 - Covenants.This'll be a short one. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. That's it. when you interact with someone or something that allows you to join a covenant, you get no information about what you're getting yourself into. In fact this occurred to a good friend of mine. While he was playing he found an object that allowed him to join a covenant, simply asking him if he's ready to face a bigger challenge. He then found out that by entering this covenant his damage was reduced and that he was unable to summon any NPCs or players into his world for help.I may be mistaken, but there are several several possible outcomes when one decides do say that something will result in a bigger challenge. Usually people who decide to face a bigger challenge know what sort of mess they're getting themselves into.This isn't the case.4 - NPCsInteraction with NPCs isn't really anything to write home about in most games, but some things in Dark Souls 2 annoy me. Allow me to exemplify. In this game you are only allowed to level up by speaking with one specific NPC. Now instead of opening the menu and letting said NPC talk while you're navigating through the menu you are forced to skip 4 dialogue segments before you are finally allowed to level up.Now, in this game you'll be interacting with this NPC quite a few times, seeing as this is the NPC that allows you to increase the number of innate healing items you possess in your inventory along with allowing you to level up. The result is that these ""interactions"" become extremely annoying extremely early in the game. Truth be told this is not something that should happen when you're dealing with an ""important"" NPC, or any other NPC for that matter.5 - PvPLast but not least, we have PvP. An addition to the game that should be fun filled, challenging and overall allow the player to enjoy him/herself even more.If it was actually balanced that is.Now in PvP (or Invasions) your goal is to either defeat the invader or the invaded (depending on whether you're invading or being invaded), but lets talk about accessing PvP first. there are 3 main PvP covenants within the game. One of them grants you a ring that automatically summons you into one of two areas in the game where you must face off against the player that set foot within that area. As a reward for this you get titanite chunks, which are relatively hard to come by and allow you to reinforce your weapons and armor.The remaining two covenants make mostly use of cracked eye orbs (although one of these covenants gives you a ring that allows you to aid players from another covenant while said players are being invaded). The thing is, in your first playthrough, you are only given access to a limited number of orbs, making invasions during your first (and possibly even last) playthrough limited as well. Please note that these covenants require an immense ammount of invasions for the player to rank up (requiring a total of 500 victories for the player to achieve the third and final rank).As for a way of replenishing eye orbs the player is given two options. Duel against players from the same covenant or buy them for a ridiculous ammount of souls in New Game +. Dueling on its own is a pain because you have to consume a different token for each covenant (these are obtained by either using eye orbs and defeating an invaded player, or by aiding another player as a phantom). As a result, invasions during a player's first playthrough are extremely rare should you decide not to venture into the area protected by the 1st mentioned PvP covenant.That aside there is also the case of extreme unbalance. The game features spells that can easily instantly kill a player for a measly soul cost or buff already hard hitting weapons along with weapons with a ridiculous attack speed or maybe even phantom reach (meaning that their reach is longer than it actually appears to be).My main issue with this is that some of the builds that focus on using these spells/weapons, are relatively easy to make, and as a result my PvP experience went downhill at an astonishing speed.Weaponry aside, invaders are unable to recover HP without resorting to spells. Making it so that even if the invading is actually fighting well, and in a fair way, nothing is stopping the invaded player from running away/hiding so that he/she may recover HP and then rush back into the fight without almost any form of punishment whatsoever. This just helps make PvP even more unbalanced (not to mention the fact that a player may summon 2 other players to their aid, turning the fight into a 3 vs 1 where the opposing trio has the ability to regenerate health).6 - ConclusionPlease note that these are my opinions and that people are free to disagree with me, its also likely that its just me who's just bad at the game in which case i've been trying to git gud for a very long time, but the game as a whole has several blatant design flaws once you take a very good look at it, and while it is good on its own, it could have been a much better game in the end. So while i do recommend this game, i'd wait for a discount.			"

												Dark Souls II is an amazing game. I really can't recommend enough. It's not quite as good as the first in MY OPINION. But it's still a fantastic game that deserves a purchase. I have over 100 hours on it and I still have not found my self wondering what to do to waste time. There's always something to do. The PvP is a lot of fun with a lot of variation in combat. The same goes for PvE. Although the PvP is still flawed with the netcode, it's still a blast. The PvE in this game is superb, there are many different builds you can create and they can fit any play style. ♥♥♥♥ the ancient dragon/10			"

												Don't get me wrong by this recommendation. I love Dark Souls 2 (and I think I'm one of the few that like it better than Dark Souls 1). But......If you are new to the Souls series, or don't yet own Dark Souls 2 for the PC, don't buy this game. Wait until Scholar of the First Sin comes out in 2015 (currently slated to be released in April). It is purported to be a vastly improved experience, with new enemies, NPCs, and quests - along with improved graphics. It will run in DX11, so make sure your computer will be able to handle it.I DON'T like the fact that they will make the people who already own Dark Souls 2 re-purchase a game that is essentially an updated/patched version. It would be one thing if it were a DLC patch. But buying the entire game again and (most likely) losing all game progress? Not to mention the two games will be on differnt servers and thus unable to play with one another, thus splitting the already-limited community. What the hell, From Software? That's an incredibly unethical business practice if I've ever seen one. It makes EA, Ubisoft, and Activision look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed consumer-concious by comparison.Sigh. Not sure if I'm actually going to buy the new game or not. I want the better version, but I don't want to support a blatant cash-grab that is clearly just aiming to milk our wallets. Purchase it, or don't. It's entirely up to you. I probably won't.			"

												So i've recently been asked to write a full review of this game while completely ignoring that its a part of the souls series. As such i'm going to do just that.While the game is not a bad game it is flawed in many ways. Allow me to explain why.1 - Being hardNow, i say that its hard, but I'm not complaining about it being hard in the traditional sense. I'm not asking for an easier game either since in my opinion that'd be 20 kinds of dumb.I'm complaining about this because, while i enjoy a good challenging game, this game is hard just for the sake of being hard.Allow me to exemplify. There is an optional area in the game where the boss consists of 4 minions and the boss itself. The boss is untargetable until you attack one of the 4 minions, meaning you can't weaken him before commencing the fight. As for the minions, the second you attack one of them the remaining 3 immediately become agressive and attack you giving you around 5 seconds or so to dispatch them before the boss drops into the area and begins attacking you as well. This would be fine if the minions didn't inflict a status effect that deals a large ammount of damage over time with a mere 2 hits. This means you have to deal with the 4 minions, as quickly as possible, without getting hit twice and possibly have to deal with the boss itself should you fail to dispatch the critters in time.This is not what i'd call challenging, but as a gigantic pain the the neck instead. This isn't the only fight where this happens, but i'd rather not delve too much into it.2 - CombatWhile combat itself is pretty okay, i have some problems with it. Call it nitpicking if you will but there are just some things that don't really feel right.The hitboxes feel off sometimes, there's no other way to describe it, while playing i'll sometimes  see the effect caused by a weapon clearly hitting my opponent without it actually happening, and it makes me wonder if something is actually wrong with either my game or my computer.Another interesting little thing is that enemies never grow tired. The game itself has a stamina mechanic that forces you to think before you act, but enemies can dish out a flurry of attacks even though (from the story's/game perspective), they're in the same pseudo-zombified state as the player, the same can be said for their attack tracking ability, by this i mean there are certain enemies that will literally turn 180 degrees while in the middle of an attack just so they can attempt to hit you (in fact this was so bad in one specific enemy, that the developers actually had to reduce the tracking capabilities on said enemy's projectiles).This feels a bit off, and dare I say, makes the game harder, just for the sake of being harder.3 - Covenants.This'll be a short one. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. That's it. when you interact with someone or something that allows you to join a covenant, you get no information about what you're getting yourself into. In fact this occurred to a good friend of mine. While he was playing he found an object that allowed him to join a covenant, simply asking him if he's ready to face a bigger challenge. He then found out that by entering this covenant his damage was reduced and that he was unable to summon any NPCs or players into his world for help.I may be mistaken, but there are several several possible outcomes when one decides do say that something will result in a bigger challenge. Usually people who decide to face a bigger challenge know what sort of mess they're getting themselves into.This isn't the case.4 - NPCsInteraction with NPCs isn't really anything to write home about in most games, but some things in Dark Souls 2 annoy me. Allow me to exemplify. In this game you are only allowed to level up by speaking with one specific NPC. Now instead of opening the menu and letting said NPC talk while you're navigating through the menu you are forced to skip 4 dialogue segments before you are finally allowed to level up.Now, in this game you'll be interacting with this NPC quite a few times, seeing as this is the NPC that allows you to increase the number of innate healing items you possess in your inventory along with allowing you to level up. The result is that these ""interactions"" become extremely annoying extremely early in the game. Truth be told this is not something that should happen when you're dealing with an ""important"" NPC, or any other NPC for that matter.5 - PvPLast but not least, we have PvP. An addition to the game that should be fun filled, challenging and overall allow the player to enjoy him/herself even more.If it was actually balanced that is.Now in PvP (or Invasions) your goal is to either defeat the invader or the invaded (depending on whether you're invading or being invaded), but lets talk about accessing PvP first. there are 3 main PvP covenants within the game. One of them grants you a ring that automatically summons you into one of two areas in the game where you must face off against the player that set foot within that area. As a reward for this you get titanite chunks, which are relatively hard to come by and allow you to reinforce your weapons and armor.The remaining two covenants make mostly use of cracked eye orbs (although one of these covenants gives you a ring that allows you to aid players from another covenant while said players are being invaded). The thing is, in your first playthrough, you are only given access to a limited number of orbs, making invasions during your first (and possibly even last) playthrough limited as well. Please note that these covenants require an immense ammount of invasions for the player to rank up (requiring a total of 500 victories for the player to achieve the third and final rank).As for a way of replenishing eye orbs the player is given two options. Duel against players from the same covenant or buy them for a ridiculous ammount of souls in New Game +. Dueling on its own is a pain because you have to consume a different token for each covenant (these are obtained by either using eye orbs and defeating an invaded player, or by aiding another player as a phantom). As a result, invasions during a player's first playthrough are extremely rare should you decide not to venture into the area protected by the 1st mentioned PvP covenant.That aside there is also the case of extreme unbalance. The game features spells that can easily instantly kill a player for a measly soul cost or buff already hard hitting weapons along with weapons with a ridiculous attack speed or maybe even phantom reach (meaning that their reach is longer than it actually appears to be).My main issue with this is that some of the builds that focus on using these spells/weapons, are relatively easy to make, and as a result my PvP experience went downhill at an astonishing speed.Weaponry aside, invaders are unable to recover HP without resorting to spells. Making it so that even if the invading is actually fighting well, and in a fair way, nothing is stopping the invaded player from running away/hiding so that he/she may recover HP and then rush back into the fight without almost any form of punishment whatsoever. This just helps make PvP even more unbalanced (not to mention the fact that a player may summon 2 other players to their aid, turning the fight into a 3 vs 1 where the opposing trio has the ability to regenerate health).6 - ConclusionPlease note that these are my opinions and that people are free to disagree with me, its also likely that its just me who's just bad at the game in which case i've been trying to git gud for a very long time, but the game as a whole has several blatant design flaws once you take a very good look at it, and while it is good on its own, it could have been a much better game in the end. So while i do recommend this game, i'd wait for a discount.			"

												Is it as good as the first game? Actually, yes. The mechanics in this game are refined and flushed out in lacking areas, while fat was trimmed from flawed areas (like weapon upgrading) in the prior titles. This game has issues, just like Dark souls 1 had, but they are different issues, and while they bother some individuals (like myself) more than the issues of the first Dark souls game, others may find this game a refreshing step forward for the franchise. A worthy purchase, especially if you can catch it on sale. If you are looking for a populated multiplayer experience as your main draw, however, I will point you kindly to the playstation version, as that community will assuredly remain the most active in PvP			"

												I haven’t played Dark Souls 1 or its predecessor Demon Souls so I can’t speak to how similar Dark Souls II (DS2) is to either of them. I can say however that if the previous games are as hard as DS2, I probably don’t want to play those either. I only played this game for a few hours so keep that in mind when weighing my opinion.In DS2 you start the game as some sort of undead being. You are warned about the dangers of becoming “Hollow” which I guess is a kind of damned spirit. The game’s narration has the feel of a dream where you’re not entirely sure what’s going on but you have an idea of what you’re supposed to do. The game follows your progress towards reaching “The King” (and probably fighting him). Obviously I didn’t get far enough to see how that works out. There are a number of neutral people that you meet on your quest that you can talk to or interact with, but large portions of the game world seem uninhabited. By the way, some of the people can be hard to see since they blend into the environment very well (people kind of sit around in random places). I’m used to games where objects and people have some sort of highlight around them to improve visibility.I was a little disappointed in the game’s graphics to be honest. I thought that being a modern game DS2 would have slick high definition gameplay, but actually the textures are similar to older games such as Darksiders 2. I’m not saying it’s bad (it’s still pretty good), just that I expected a 2014 AAA title to be amazing. One bright side to this is that my 3 year old computer didn’t have any problems running the game. The game is clearly a console port so playing on a game controller is strongly recommended. Since I have very little experience using controllers (I don’t own any consoles) I first tried Keyboard + Mouse. This didn’t work out so well since performing even basic actions would require combinations of keys. For example, the “action” button would be shift+left click. And when using keyboard + mouse, the on-screen prompts would be for controller keys (Press A button to pick up item). After a few hours play I still haven’t figured out how to put items on the “quick use” belt.When people describe the Dark Souls games probably the first thing mentioned is usually the difficulty. The game is very hard because you have no “advantage” over any of your enemies. It takes them only a few hits to kill you just as it takes you a few hits to kill them. You also have a stamina bar which limits how often you can swing your weapon. This means you can’t just dive into a battle chopping with your sword and hope that you make the first strike. There are no “weak” enemies; everyone can all kill you in seconds if you’re not paying attention. And if you die, you lose ALL your money/experience and respawn with lower max health. The money/experience of the game is counted in “souls” which are used as both currency and experience for leveling up. You have an opportunity to retrieve the souls you drop on death, but if you die again before picking them up (happens a lot because enemies respawn), they’re lost permanently. I can only imagine what some of the later boss battles must be like. Pros:+The game can be immersive and is actually fair. Every time you die you’ll kick yourself because you know that if you had done it “right” you wouldn’t have died.+I like how the money and experience is combined into “souls” which are automatically gained on killing an enemy. I get easily tired of looting corpses in RPGs.+The game is challenging and I’m sure you’d feel like a god if you actually beat it.Cons:-Dark Souls 2 is too hard for me. If you didn’t have your life bar shrunk with every death I wouldn’t mind doing some grinding, but as it is the game just gets harder and harder as you die.-The controls (even with a controller) can be hard to master if you’re not experienced with this kind of game. The platform jumping was especially annoying for me since it takes a combination of buttons to accomplish a simple jump. And if you fall, you die.-The level up system is not very well explained. You start at around level 12 depending on what class you chose and you’re not told very clearly how many souls you need per level up. On level up you get to increase 1 stat, and it’s not clearly explained what each stat does. I’m sure I could read up on it online before playing the game, but I don’t like having to research a game before playing.-The game has no “objective clues” or game map. You’re just given this large game world to explore at random.Overall I’m not going to recommend the game unless you’ve played the previous ones. All of the cons I mentioned would probably melt away after you’ve played through the game at least once. I thought the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games were weak too but I enjoyed them after playing through at least one time. Then you’d know where to go and what you need to do (including what order you should explore areas in). If you’ve never played the previous Dark Souls games and don’t like super challenging games, stay away from Dark Souls II until the price drops. The game has a meta rating over 90% so most people must love it. If you really must try it, gather your patience and do a lot of pre-game research.			"

												Well, this was expected wasn't it!To preface this, I am playing this with Keyboard and Mouse, and it is not advised to read this if you're not okay with minor spoilers (they're tagged as spoilers, so just don't hover of them), as they're hard to avoid. Dark Souls 2 is one of the games I've enjoyed the most, I am about to wrap my first playthrough up as I enter the end game, spending nearly 50 hours on it already.In comparison to Dark Souls 1, this game does a lot of things right, and a few things wrong. This review consists of four headers, the things that went wrong, the things that went good, the things that I do not have a strong opinion of and the conclusion.Things gone wrongKeyboard and Mouse default configurationWhoever designed the default settings for keyboard and mouse wasn't doing it right - they're just nonsensical and dumb. I had to readjust a lot of keys, and the keybinding system is mediocre, but I managed to find settings to my pleasing. And once set right, the experience was smooth.TrapsThere are a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized traps that you just can't see coming, like boulders, monsters suddenly breaking walls, and breaking floors that lead to oblivion.Although these things are part of the game, I feel like, especially when dying to them, these things should have been introduced differently, in perhaps a more forgiving away. As it's not a thrill introduced to you, it's just plain bull.Introduction Cinematic, and entirety of the plotThe plot feels edgy to me, you're intructed to do something, but are never told why -- except for ""That you really don't know why you're doing this"". The concept is silly, and you're really only doing this for a silly item. I'm sure there's more to it, but the essense of the plot really rolls around to finding a certain item, so you can use it to open doors.I really liked the plot in Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2 did not give this feeling to me.NPCsThe NPCs in Majula just don't give me the feeling that they're really alive. They remain in the same position and don't do much else. Their dialogue is mostly the same and they don't change a lot.Leading me onto one of the most annoying NPCs. -> The Green Maiden  I can practically dream her dialogue, she is one of the more important aspects of the game, and you constantly talk to her (i.e. to reinforce your Estus Flask, or to level up), and she always has the same dialogue.What also slightly bugs me is that the mouths never move as they talk, but that's a minor detail.PVP is unfair in certain areasIn some areas, you're forced into an area to fight another player, this other player belongs to a certain covenant. They have the clear advantage in these areas, like extra enemies, or a watery environment slowing down movement.(too much) Focus on difficulty of the wrong kindBoth a flaw and something slightly enjoyable, but I feel that the way they introduced bossfights with multiple bosses at a time is wrong, it can be right, but there are a lot of bosses that come in quantity, and lack quality. There are less unique movesets, and some are just copies of previous bosses. I don't mind multiple bosses in a bossfight, but I had hoped to keep it at minimum. To quote someone who made a review video: ""You are fighting your lock on more than you are fighting the boss"" Things gone rightThe PC portI'm really pleased with the PC port, it's not super-amazing, but it's well done. I've experienced no frame drops and the graphics look okay. They're not amazing, but this is a souls game. Graphics is not what it revolves around.The ExperienceIt really dragged me in, although there are many minor flaws, everything else just is good. It's not perfect, it's good. I had fun, I felt serveral emotions through (mostly agony, fear and happiness), and met some fantastic players with Jolly Cooperation. Not many games know how to ace a game where you can't communicate with eachother, but Dark Souls does it fine.Communication, Co-opAs said before, the Co-op system is great. It is like Dark Souls 1, only now it works, and it works amazingly. And it's fun.Worth for your moneyMany games are completed within serveral hours and don't have much replayability. I'm currently 50 hours in, haven't even completed it yet and am already planning ahead for my next few play throughs.Things I do not feel strongly against or forMusicI am pretty unsure of this aspect, it felt okay, but not good, nor bad. I definitely think a better job could be done on this department. But I do not remember any negative aspects of it. Therefore I do not have a strong opinion of this.ConclusionDark Souls 2 is a great game with flaws, but as does any game. I hope they fix it over time, but as it is right now the game is rather solid.The game may not be for everyone, but that's okay. If you're interested, do some research, find out if you like it. Perhaps decide to wait for it to go on sale, but I would definitely recommend this game, especially to people who liked Dark Souls 1, or people who do not get infuriated with games quickly and are okay with a learning curve that may be steep.I personally rate the game at 8.5 points out of 10. Although the bad may look greater in number; it's easier to note the things that are bad, and most of those cases are very minor in comparison to how big the Dark Souls II world really is.			"

												SPOILERS AHEAD: One of, if not, the best game I have ever played. It is detailed and brilliant in so many ways. It provides nerve racking experiences aslong with a side of endless frustration, and rage inducing anger. But without that, it wouldn't be a Souls game. The strongest points of the game are its story, which is never really fully explained in the game itself, and how unique the game is and the experiences it gives you. From seeing the character you have worked along side for hours and hours, finally take his place on the Throne of Want. And seeing the once been towering ex-king of Drangleic walking slowly in repeated patterns in the god forsaken Undead Crpyt. From the struggle to beat the last giant, to finding that set of armour you want, to taking your place on the throne. This is a game that you build your own story with, and have a hell of a lot of fun doing it. I am in love with every nook and cranny of this game. 10/10 extremely recommend it.			"

												Punishing,  Unforgiving yet so Addictive !Oh, Dark Souls 2 where do I begin. Having spend more than 1000 hours from earlier titles by FromSoftware such as the Tenchu series, Demon souls, Dark souls and now Dark souls 2. I am happy to annouce that Dark souls 2 definitely lives up to the hype shown in last year's E3 as well as all the trailers lurking around the internet and our anticipation buidling up for the april pc release.One of the biggest difference between the console version and the Pc version is that this time around, FromSoft constructed the PC version from ground up instead of porting it over which means that the graphics can be adjusted depending on the computer spec and that the experience is further enhanced by 60fps running constantly on most pcs. Textures is also much more detailed than dark souls 1 thanks for the improved game engine. Furthermore, the features provided by convenants and items all work well and match making seem to work constantly without the need to idle in the same location just to wait for an opponent.The unique match making mechanic found in dark souls 2 is also different to the first game and instead of using soul levels as a measure of player strength, the game uses soul memory (SM) so that this way it can be more balanced in both pve and pvp.The StoryOnce again, player takes on the role of a nameless hero who became the bearer of curse and arrived in the plagued and dying land of Drangleic. Only by acquiring powerful souls of the ancient, the player will be able to confront the King and the Queen which will inturn free the hero from said curse. On the surface, dark souls 2 does not provide you with 'up your face' insight in what is going on around you as well as the lore and the background. However, smart players will soon find that all the information you seek will be found by talking to npcs scattered around the world as well as reading the description of every items found in the game. This provide enough solid fact to construct an excellent rpg and enough myths left for players to interpret. GameplayFirst of all, I recommend players to have a game pad in order to play this game because keyboard and mouse control is awkward and often involve pressing keys located faraway from each other or unusual for video games. In terms of control I would say that the core mechanics is still solid and similar to the first game with minor improvements made but that is actually a good thing for veteran players and new players alike because it is intuitive in ways of switching weapons/shields and tools or spells. You only need to press the matched direction button on D-pad to allow switch of equipments. Dark souls 2 also introduced a equipment durability bar even thought it also existed in the first game. In dark souls 2 banging equipments against the wall will repel you and at the same time it will damage your equipment getting it low will be risky and lower its efficiency, breaking it will rendering it useless and require souls to be repaired by a black smith. Similarly, using heavy attack has also proven to degrade equipment at a fast pace.GraphicsBefore you go on and say anything, I know that buying a souls game for its graphics is not what the developer wanted us to do and im not saying dark souls 2 graphics is bad. In fact, it is great. Dark souls 2 features some of the most amazing visuals I have seen in recent years. From the mountain peak of Dragon Aerie to the land scape of Drangleic Castle and to the decaying undead crypt, it shows historical traits of traditional medieval fantasy perfectly and authentically portrayed in a video game. In addition to the graphic, the music is also really well composed from the intense and dangerous boss fight sound track to the grand, majestical and beautifully orchestrated music of a royal palace, the game really mixed and blended two features really well which will often get you pump and feel the sense of achievement after defeating the seemingly unbeatable bosses. Moreover, Dark souls 2 also features original voices given to the npcs of the game from the honorable knight of Mirrah to the traveller of Jugo as well as the lowly merchant of Volgen the game is really trying to create one hell of a unique and immersive experience for the player at every turn.DifficultyFromSoftware is notorious for creating difficult games that torment players and punishing them for little mistakes at the most important moment. There has also been rumours that Dark souls 2 is easier than Dark souls 1 and many features were dumbed down to make it more accessible to new players. In some way it is. However, what dark souls 2 provide with players is more freedom in what they want to do. For example if someone finds the game too easy or not challenging enough, they can use an item called 'Bonfire Ascetic' to increase the damage and the health of the enemies at the same time it reduces the amount of damage dealt by the player and if that is not enough, you can burn Bonfire Ascetics 8 times to cap the difficulty. If you wanna be even more hardcore you can also join the convenant of champions which will add another layer of difficulty and disable the co-op function to make the game solo only.VerdictOverall, I think that darksouls 2 is the best game of 2014 with amazing production value, replayability and accessbility. However, it could also be one of those game that only caters to a certain crowd of gamers.Finally, If you enjoyed the first game, you will enjoy this game even more and if you enjoy S&M you will love this game10/10			"

												This game is by far one of the BEST Rpg games I've played. Prepare to Die, Prepare to know your skill, Prepare to Improve. I cannot stress enough on how fun this game is. The mechanics of the game are made to counter the Hack-and-Slash point of view. (That means slashing like crazy with no bad side-effects) Where as this game if you don't plan your attacks right, if you don't try to out-think your opponents you will die, or be punished harshly. When I started playing this it made me realize that there is a MAJOR SKILL-CAP to this game. Of course there are multi-player functions, but you'll be soloing more often on mobs.AndThe PvP in the game is FORCED! This means that you'll have some really good npc's that are very player-like that will hand you your head on a platter if you don't think through what you're doing, and players will INVADE your game. This makes the game much more fun and adding a sense of ""OMG I DID IT!"" When you get your first player kill. Although there are some really bad sides to the game. Such as the Bell Tower. If you go in there prepared to be invaded by 3 people. So it's best to get a squad of your own before you enter the area to fight the gargoyle (optional boss). Worried about hackers? - Most of the main areas before bosses have been developed to knock off hackers with infinite hp, but they're a very small portion of the community and it isn't likely that you'll encounter one. Over all the time I've played I fought 1 hacker in the undead crypt. He ran at me with infinite hp and I shot him off the cliff using a giant arrow.This is a 100% purchase for people who want to be tested on their ability. When you start a quick suggestion is to think ""Hey what type of class do I want my person to be?"" Look up some guides for things like that. I also suggest a PARRY GUIDE. Especially for those people who love dual wield. Becoming good at parrying helps a lot (not for bosses though). Notes: Take your time. And there is one difficulty : DIFFICULT  But you'll get use to it quite fast.and in the words of Illidan, if you are not ready to experience a skill-check as well as having a fullfilling satisfaction then... ""YOU ARE NOT PREPARED!""  And prepare to die... and have fun!			"

												Compared to Dark Souls; this game is harder, feels more responsive, has more content, and is much more visually impressive.The only thing I disliked about 2 compared to 1 is that many of the areas in Dark Souls 2 are linear, with some areas so small you could finish it in 10 minutes. Dark Souls 1's world was more open and interconnected.Other than that, this game is solid. The 3 DLCs add a huge amount of content and has large, non-linear areas that require lots of exploration.Definetely recommended, especially with the 3 DLCs.			"

												A very fun and challenging game,most of the time if you die it is completely your fault,the other part is gravity. The game has a very well timed system of attacking,blocking,and/or rolling. Storywise unless you are willing to dig into the lore in the items and the world itself you will find it lacking. The enemies and world design are great in this game and the boss fights are fun and challenging. A new player will have a bit more difficulty then the experienced player,but even the experienced player messes up and can die. The PvP in this game is my one quarrel with this game,it is very unbalanced and needs work especially the arena,I promise you that most of the time it takes me forever to find someone to play with,and even when you do connect to someone it is usually a very cheap build that doesn't take very long to make while someone else tries to make a fun build that takes forever that will only be shot down online. Otherwise very great game that I play pretty regularly. 9/10			"

												After leaving the tutorial and talking with every poor soul in Majula, I made my way to Heide's Tower of Flames and died for the first time, thrown out of the map by a giant man in armor.The second to ninth deaths, in the same area, in different ways, are not worth talking about.With my health bar cut down by half, I decided to try new waters and went forth to the Forest of Fallen Giants. After falling down a hole and making my way back, being skewered by a hollow and coming back again and being dog-pilled by hollows and deciding running away is a perfectly valid strategy, I reached a bonfire, allowing me to test the waters and clear the area after dying a dozen times and going up the stairs to a more open area.Fighting for my life against three enemies and a distant archer, I accidentaly hit a man in armor that refused to talk to me. He then proceeded to demonstrate how sharp his blade was and I died once again.10/10 will play until I go hollow			"

""I've given you up for dead by now.""Second installment of the game that was loved by some, hated by the others, for the same reason, the unforgiving world and difficulty. Even players who mastered first game were meeting with sad truth of how feeble we still are. Story takes place thousands of years after the ending of the first game. Once again we are told nothing and once again we die over and over again while pushing through this quest. Good part is that game didn't change it's style, no quest indicators, no holding hands, but unlike the former installment we can get more information out of NPC dialogues where to go next but then YOU DIED. PvP part of game created mostly by community is aswell great place to be, codex, honor... or none at all, it's YOU who chooses your role, bloodthirsty invader or helpful sentinel who bows to his opponent, or maybe combination of both. In this game it's safe to say: play your way, you will die anyways.			"

												as of 4/26/2014 due to a VAC Ban on my Profile - I have to go over to my Alt account and family share in order to Access the game online - The downside is that I am going to be unable to play that main character on this account - Although I made two characters on this account in the exctremely boring ""OFFLINE"" mode - Dark Souls II and the use of Multiplayer is 10000 times more important and implemented for pure strength; unlike Dark Souls 1; which from launch (Me and my buddy TRIED invading eachother; we TRIED getting in touch with eachother in game; but .... Games for windows Live sucked and we couldn't connect to eachother no matter what we tried - Thus I never completed DS1; I loved it - but in comparison to DS2 - I'd go as far as to say that DS1 was highly over-rated... Dark Souls II is the real deal.- As a PC owner you have a few different options for even prettier graphics than it launches with as well (it launches quite nice looking; and far better looking than the console versions - (Thank god Form Software figured a lot of things out and did them RIGHT this time) - With Nvidia Inspector you can use the Diablo 3 Ambient Occlusion profile; you can set up REALLY great looking AA and add FXAA with it; and you can set up HBAO+ (Gotta Love being an Nvidia User :D) - Then software allows you to DOWNSCALE RESOLUTIONS! So I set mine to 7680x4320 (Resolution; thus upping the resolution of all the textures --of everything-- to 7680x4320 then downsampling down to my Monitor's display resolution of 1920x1080 which = GORGEOUS BEYOND BELIEF - Doing this while ALSO adding the Ambient Occlusion, AA and HBAO+ is stunning (and trust me; you really dont even need Anti-Aliasing when you are Upping the Resolution on all the textures 4-5x times what ""Highest"" would be; - This is brilliant; and with my SLI 780 ti's I've never dipped any FPS due to having it at 7680x4320 - It runs 100% smooth and never dips out in large fights or multiplayer interaction - I believe this is the highest I will go for now; I will see it if actually supports higher texture resolution downsampling than that... if it does - then hell.. Why not!!??The game itself is just plain addiction; it is the Heroin of game launches (thus far this year atlesst :P ) - It may not be as ""Hard"" as some people make it out to be; but I got my self stuck in a situation where I kept dying over and over (and lost 2.5K souls; which at the time was two level ups >.< where the Tough (but pretty darn easy) mosnter was right next to the Camp; so I'd just farm him and goto the fire - reset; then to my surprise he was //No Longer Farmable// - (This was unlike DS1) - So I pushed on and got whooped at the second enemy after him due to a wrongly timed dodge; and an embarressing jumping strike that did make contact but also sent me flying 1,000 feet to my death; I can imagine all the players around that area at the time clicking on my bloodstain and seeing that; just laughing outloud - Speaking of which; The descriptive abilities for ""Helpful Tips"" from other players are actually ""helpful"" now; as you can type whatever in a longer amount of characters - You'll also find some trolls with (Honestly, amusing!) notes near the edge of cliffs ""Jump down and hug the left side for treasure chest"" I see about 10 bloodstains and watch these people just fall to their deaths.... Obviously no treasure - and I get quite a laugh out of it; ""Tools"" -rapid screenshotting-Co-op with your buddies changes DS2 for the Better 1000%; and invading other worlds with them and ganking is more fun in DS2 than in any RPG I can think of - Also with the ""Jedi Knight Multiplayer"" style ""Honor system"" people will bow prior to engaging in an actual duel; and allow themselves and the enemy to buff up (this is mostly end game from what people told me as I partook in these rituals; although doing it at an earlier level starts the great ""PVP Community"" mindset; With that said; I'll still gank someone who is not in it for the duel; but in it for why I'll gank them - just to appear and grab the kill while I am in the middle of a fight; thus why I chose to go with the starting item that has any mob near me aggro the outside; What can I say? Dark Souls II was MORE than WORTH THE WAIT for the PC Version - I do own a PS3; and for titles such as The Last of Us etc I will grab those excellent AAA titles that won't see daylight on PC - With Dark Souls II just as in any other title that has a release date on PC MONTHS after the console release date; I'll just wait it out - I have a friend who did not; and now aside from myself; other people he reguarly gamed with all have it on PC; and he is thinking about getting it on PC - I just sort of think the initial waiting was worth it; as we had plenty of new games to fill the time on PC prior to the DSII launch (Diablo 3 RoS for example if its the RPG funny bone that needs to be tickled) - More than worth the wait - and as nearly every reveiw states...""This is the ULTIMATE DARK SOULS 2 EXPERIENCE"" or ""This is now the only Dark Souls II version that gamers should buy"" ""The Definitive Version of Dark Souls II"" - ""Makes The Dark Souls II I loved on my PS3 feel 10 years older"" - etc :D10/10 A+ - Wind0wned.What do I use to play? - I initially was using Keyboard and Mouse (after downloading the Input Lag Mouse Fix so I was able to actually time things correctly -laughs-) my buddy wanted me to try the Dual Shock 4 PS4 controller that I had Purchased for games that..... Only can be enjoyed with a Controller (NBA2K14 for example, Street Fighter X Tekken etc on steam) - So I ended up trying it out for him; and now I pretty much am using the DS4 70% of the time; - but either with K/Bmouse or (I prefer the Dualshock 4 to any other controller; aside from the Nvidia Shield which is the aboslute GROOVIEST experience with this game) The wind is storming in.

												1. The game is designed for Consol gamers, anything related to Keyboard and mouse needs to be revised to work appropriately. They took no time to convert the controls over, very sloppy and lazy.2. While the game can be fun at times, expect to die a lot early on, which is no big deal, but once you figure out how to avoid everything, it becomes stupid easy and boring. The honeymoon phase is short lived.3. Bosses are only ""hard"" for the sake of it, given you know how to get around it, you will feel more annoyed than happy when you defeat a boss in a fight, or relieved it's over, not like you achieved something great.4. The story is non existent.5. The locations are strung together, and it isn't really open world like I prefer, so if you like an open world like skyrim, just pass on this.6. Every area you go to, is more or less like a maze and mindless wondering, only to be engaged in PVP randomly or rekill the same things you killed 4 mins ago prior to your death. In that light, it turns into grinding, and if we're just going to kill things randomly, why not just play an MMO?7. The Games graphics are a controversial topic, for PC it is great, for consoles, I wouldn't really say they are either , it's just meh.8. The combat itself is really clunky in my opinion, but that isn't inclusive of the other variables like having a delayed response due to the lack of input or foresight of keyboard and mouse use, so aside from this point, I will say the combate is annoying. Locking on to a target should not be necessary, while swinging a weapon should not be mindless slashing praying you hit a target. For PC the combat is horrible. Unless you are a spellcaster and you just spam spells and get all the XP anyways, it becomes relatively over powered and not really fun which destroys the entire purpose of the game itself and what it is founded upon from the prior dark souls. I won't say don't get the game, aside from all that, its a good time waster if you're bored and need something new, and you may even actually come to love the game, but with the points listed above, I can not say anyone who likes Skyrim or other games, will like this game for points mentioned above. I would give the game a 7/10, But it is more average in content than anything else. If it comes down to it, buy it when it is on sale, save your money for something worth while.			"

												This is a fun and enjoyable game, with more content, fun filled pvp combat and a vast improvement over the original that is plagued by some problems and technical issues that could make you love it or hate it.A great improvement over the original game, I really do enjoy this game very much in fact so much I've spent 300+  hours on it in the console version of the game that I had to rebuy the pc version to experience all over again.I was  disappointed by some of the things  because of the fact that its still felt like a port and not really a huge graphical improvement that I thought it would be/have. Bad controls on keyboard and mouse, and missing alot of the lightning and features I wished was included which was talked about in videos. Also hackers are annoying and yeah they still exist when ya kill them and get  millions souls outta nowhere as a new char and that can really screw up YOUR game because of soul memory system.. I had to go through some trouble on getting my  controller to work well. Vac bans is useful but still useless at the same time,The game starts you off in the middle of nowhere just to venture into the hut of the witches to understand your path, the game feels very branched out in the beginning where you can go and have to go and what you can explore then it gets very limited on what you can do once you reach close to the end it just starts being limited in where you have to go. There are however many things you can find and discover, weapons to upgrade, souls to fight, people to kill. Once you beat the game new game + changes the challenge up again by adding new foes and new enemies thus getting harder. This time around if you run outta enemies you can summon them using bonfire aesthetics.Other than that,  the game this time is a huge improvement over   the original due to what is being offered which is  more content, more covenants, weapons , and very much of the very similar gameplay that you are used to. The soul memory systemt his time stops the twinks from happening so you won't encounter players that are OP and twinked out that will completely rip you apart.This is a fun game for those with the acquired taste, You'll die, have your ego crushed on by a steamroller while being axed by a gnome but you will still press on. however the story is still weak and the at least there was an attempt at it, Also there were videos of the game looking great with lighting and the graphics that was shown from the beta version which was taken out of this game making it look uglier than it's supposed to be, there are tons of videos about it online and its very upsetting this was done but at the end of the day dark souls II is what it is, a challenging game that is focused on pvping other players down and having fun.+ Game is harder, but only because they throw alot of enemies at you otherwise...+ New content, LOTS of new content+ Combat feels more fun+ New game plus after beating the game actually includes more unexpected mobs, and becomes harder, its actually a ng+!+ covenants that are useful and categorized well, Pve/pvp/pve invasion/pve helping/pvp evil etc. + Good larger open areas gorgeous views in certain areas.+ Fps is smooth game runs smooth doesn't look the best but smooth is good+ Finally runs well on the pc due to the support. Especially the display+ Pvping/combat is so much fun. I love to gank and fight legit players+ Using Steam vac bans, not the best way to ban people but better than nothing.+ Good variety of weapons to mess with, upgrade and stat up.+ Mod it up! but you'll have to play offline just in case because of vac just in case.- Story still weak- Its hard to know if playing online will get you banned or not due to modding, so do it offline- Expected better quality graphics and shadings, things that was shown beta phase didn't make it they took it out, Alot were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. You've been gearboxed.- Having some connection problems, this is due to soul memory matchups- Some fight mechanic needs rebalancing- Bosses are not as memorable as dark souls- Game need to be made by pc for once so we can experience true quality, I shouldn't have to mod my game to make it look amazing- Even though keyboard and mouse is cutomizable I cannot find it likeable for this game best to use controller, its still horrible!- Enemies AI are still stupid, bosses are unmemorable- Cheaters really ruin the pvp experienceOverall - I still recommend this game for what it is and what it offers, I looked past the incredible amount of negativity i've experienced because I really do love this series. I really do hope capcom really put thier act together for the next game. The pc version had me clocked in less hours than the console versions due to cheaters and because I burned myself out.Video review from console about the game-

												Dark Souls II is a sequel to the cult classic Dark Souls game and it unfortunately lacks every subtlety that made the first game such an intoxicating experience. To explain these subtleties would be to ruin what makes the discovery process so fun, but I will respond to anyone who wishes to know what I think in a personal Steam message.As a story telling experience, it lacks the reason to be it's own story (The DLC sort of corrects this problem.) As a combat experience, it lacks the tight mechanics that made the first one fair and engaging. The hitboxes are not as the appear at all, there is input lag on movement, and a well-designed mechanic -- rolling -- is hidden behind a stat called ""Adaptation."" Its level design is good, but lacks the metroid-vania style *world* design that makes it replayable. The game feels nearly as linear as a game like Darksiders does. Forgettable bosses that are just 2/3rds big armoured people with formulaic attack patterns. Dark Souls II is a pretty good Souls-*like* but pales in comparison to its predecessor. I couldn't, with good concsious, reccomend anyone looking to understand what souls is *about* by reccomending this game. As a personal aside to establish what my opinion might, or might not, mean to a review reader, I purchased the original Dark Souls four times. Once on console, twice more for friends looking to get into the game, and once on PC. I pre-purchased the deluxe edition of Dark Souls II on console and afterwards the PC version. With collectively 700+ hours into the souls series (1, 2, 3 and Bloodbourne) I still don't reccomend Dark Souls II. I would reccomend Dark Souls II *last* if you want to know what Souls is about. May the flames guide you.			"

												Dark Souls 2 is a decent game, but it is inferior to Dark Souls.Dark Souls 2 has managed to become a reptitive game to play, in comparison to Dark Souls. In Dark Souls 2, areas are smaller and more densely packed with enemies. In some cases, there are far too many enemies to take on without backpedaling and turtling, making getting through an area a slow process. There's many more respawn points put throughout the game, so you won't have to backtrack far if you die, but the sheer volume and tankiness of enemies makes short distances seem much longer. There's also less alternate routes to take while progressing through the game; many more of the areas are unskippable, which exacerbates the problem of enemy-saturated areas. Unlike Dark Souls, starting a new game with a character that has finished the game (called new game+, or NG+) will spawn new enemies and surprises for you to deal with. This is a nice addition, and it keeps the game fresh for a bit longer. However, many of the new enemies the game will throw at you are just very tanky and further repeats of those areas just take longer than they did before.Multiplayer in Dark Souls 2 is a straight downgrade from Dark Soul's multiplayer. In the Dark Souls series, you level up using the game's currency, ""souls"". You get souls from killing creatures in the game world, and it is inevitable you will get souls by progressing through the game. Previously, the level of your character determined what other players you could be matched with in Dark Souls. You could go through the game at a low level and still be able to connect to players near the beginning of the game; this allowed for overpowered co-op partners who could take out bosses very quickly, or overpowered enemy PvPers who could one-shot you. Late game, players stopped leveling at a community-decided level cap that allowed players to continue connecting to one another. The level cap encouraged players to optimize their character builds within these constraints for maximum specialization toward whatever role they wanted.Because of the imbalanced early-game PvP in Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 has adopted a new system for matchmaking. Players are now matched according to the total number of souls they have collected, not their character level. This has a few effects, some desired, some not. Early game, players do not know how to initiate PvP, or they have little motivation to because their character builds are not complete; this makes early game PvP a rarity. As the player progresses through the game, they will have more PvP opportunities and encounters, and PvP is relatively balanced because players haven't progressed much further than each other. Late game, the total number of souls a player as collected is no longer representative of their character's ability; a character may have stopped leveling up at some point, or a character may have never stopped leveling up, and some characters may have lost a great amount of collected souls by dying. The only available option for players who wish to stay competitive in PvP is to continue leveling their character, which takes away any need to optimize or specialize one's character build. Though this new matchmaking formula fixes unfair early game PvP, it ruins the fairness and depth of late game PvP.Due to the repetitive PvE and unfair late game PvP, the game's longevity is hurt badly. There are a few other glaring issues with Dark Souls 2 that I won't go into, but despite it all, it's still a game that is above average in quality. I can't fully recommend Dark Souls 2. As a fan of Dark Souls, I've been able to keep myself interested in Dark Souls 2 for a while, but a person with more discerning taste would not tolerate Dark Souls 2 for long.Play Dark Souls before you touch this game; Dark Souls is much better game.

												I really tried to like DS2, it was the first souls game i tried and i didn't liked it at all the first time; after I played [and fell in love with] DS1 i pushed myself to retry DS2, but it's no use.DS2 is a mess, the levels are not connected in a huge environment as in the first game, most of the bosses are just regular enemies x5-20 in a small room trying to give the illusion of challenge when in fact makes it unfair as you cannot keep an eye at all of them at the same time.There is not a single well developed NPC, i started two NG and almost made it to the end on both runs and can't remember ONE name, because they have no impact on the run, they are not interesting, they are just so boring.The same can be said about the stages, they're way too linear and have nothing that makes them special, they try to force Majula as an interesting location by making EVERY important merchant/mage/level booster/npc be there, but it has nothing of interest, and i don't even know how that is posible when the FIre link Shrine of DS1 is more interesting and that's just a half blown castle.To sum up, play DS1 and DS3, don't waste your money on this one.

												Dark Souls is not for the faint of heart, and not quite like anything you've ever played before. There are no easy enemies, no easy areas. Every battle can be your last, every corner a death trap. It's brutal, but fair. It stands as testament that a true challenge makes the whole experience so much more satisfying, when you battle the biggest, baddest enemy you've encountered yet and finally best it.Great atmosphere, great gameplay, huge replayability and some brilliant dynamic multiplayer interaction which seamlessy blends into gameplay.

												A shallower learning curve than previous FROM games, but still quite challenging, Dark Souls 2 is a worthy successor.  The mechanics are a bit more fine tuned this time around for both pve and pvp, making for a great experience.  Even with improved keyboard and mouse support, a controller is still preferred for many, but having a viable choice now is a good thing.  Unlike Dark Souls 1, this port got a lot of loving, and the PC delay was more than worth the wait.Highly Recommended (though not for everyone).			"

												This game is truly wonderful, there's a lot of hard practice within the game and you can't just always rely on one tactic to win. Every enemy has been balanced along with the weapons and armour to always give that feeling of struggle, no matter how high in strength you are. PVP however is where this game is let down, mainly because the players who play this game like to make use of the cheapest tactics they can manage in order to win. Here's just a list of what to expect if you try doing Dark Souls 2 PVP:Channeler's trident with any magic buff and poison infusion while spamming heavy attack to drill hit you and just stack poison? Check.Infinite HP hacks? Check. (I've encountered at least 46 different players doing this so far)Poison/Bleed estoc to bypass shields? Check.Infinite stagger caestus build? Check.Prebuffing and then using poison fog/toxic mist/dark fog/acid surge as you are summoning in so you get poisoned/have your armour and rings broken before you can even act? Check. (watch out would be dragons, this happens to you a LOT)Prebuffing and then trying to backstab you as you are summoning in? Check (Dragons again...)Waiting right by where you appear and spamming fire tempest or other AoE spells so you have no time to act when you summon in? Check. (dragons especially)Abusing rolls to ensure no form of magic will ever hit them? Check. (Oh yeah, if you roll? You can't get hit by most magic unless it's a flat out hit. Not a fun thing if you get forced into PVP and you're a caster of any form).That's just a short list of the cheap tactics I've seen being put to use while I have played Dark Souls 2. Players will not try to play fair and as a result, it ruins the experience for the people who are trying to play the game fairly. Most even take PRIDE in this factor and you can find tons of builds to accompany these tactics so as to 'pwn maximum number of noobs' as one person put it.I will complement Dark Souls 2 however as it has made co-operative play (especially with friends) much, MUCH better than Dark Souls 1. You get a name engraved ring you can buy that allows you to connect to players using the same 'god' that you choose using the ring. There's a large selection of gods and goddesses so you have little risk of being summoned by someone who you don't want to be summoned by. There's also two forms of aid you can do: Shades (which last a certain time and vanish when they've either killed so many enemies or have been there long enough, you can tell if a shade's about to vanish because they start turning black) and phantoms (Just like Dark Souls 1, they vanish when you beat a boss usually). A nice thing they've made sure to note is while there are areas where phantoms can't be summoned, shades can still be summoned in some of them, allowing for you to still recieve aid from your friends if you need it (and some areas you really DO need it.For those travelling alone, From Software hasn't forgotten about you. Almost every single boss has a NPC phantom or two somewhere nearby that can aid you if you are unfortunate enough to have the dark souls 2 server lose connection or if you lose connection to steam. What's more, some of them have storylines that grant you their equipment if you accomplish them.Overall, there's plenty of nice things in Dark Souls 2 that I would really want to praise. There's a vast array of weapons, armours and items to help you on your journey and it's possible to make all kinds of playthroughs (I've even seen someone playing a run as a character named after and tooled up exactly like Simon Belmont from castlevania. That was funny to play along with!).If anything, it's Dark Souls 2's PVP that lets it down in the long run and a lot of the covenants make use of PVP to rank up so you are kind of forced to face it at some point if you want the most out of covenants... though thankfully you can switch covenants freely in Dark Souls 2, which is a god send.There was one other thing that disappointed me though (and this is more a personal nitpick than anything else)... the weapons while vast and arrayed... well, it doesn't exactly have the same kind of fantastic variety that Dark Souls 1 had. I thought it was neat when I could get a sword made out of crystal or the dark sword from the darkwraiths (I was pleased the armour was back but COME ON FROM SOFT, why no sword to go with!?) which all had really unique designs and stood out. Granted, there are a few nice and unique weapons but I just feel it's lacking there. Who knows? Maybe the DLC coming out will provide us with some more really neat tools of destruction? I sure hope so!Would I recommend Dark Souls 2? Yes, VERY MUCH YES I would recommend this game. But there are things that you need to be aware of when you pick this game up and I hope this review will help those who are considering this game for various reasons to consider before picking it up. From Software is making constant balance checks with this game so maybe they might see some of the problems and deal with them but in the meantime, thank you for reading my review and I hope it gave you all information about Dark Souls 2 that will help you decide to buy the game.Good luck, and hope you're prepared to die all over again. You'll be doing it a lot.			"

												A sequel , that PC player deserved. I have heard about the start trouble for some problem and I know it is not a good thing , but do not judge the game for having these problem, but the Developers. I did not have any problem with the PC version after the release.The PC version is far better than the console version. 60 FPS, better textures and a great Network connection.You can run this game with a mid-PC on High/Very High with stable 60 fps, which surprised me.There are problems with the Keyboard and Mouse controls, but when you get used to it, it is not that bad.But yeah, they should have worked on KB+M more. The atmosphere and the music fits perfectly in that game and there are many places to explore. Some locations even remind you of the prequel.Dark Souls 2 is a mix of Demon's and Dark Souls, which makes the gameplay so good.The beginning of the game is very good for beginners of the Souls series, but when you are a Veteran , you can skip the tutorial. Most of the Boss fights are good, but I do not recall a ""great"" fight. So you almost forget about most boss fights, sadly. The game is still challanging , which is good, but sometimes the challange gets too hard, which can frustrate you.The lore itself is as mysterious as DeS and DaS and it keeps you wondering , what happened in the past.I really enjoyed Dark Souls 2 and I hope From Software will take care of this game in the future.I can really recommend it to everyone, who likes to have a challange in games or who are still unsure, if they want to buy the PC or Console version and of course for Soul-Series fans.

												I didn't want to write a review on this game until I had beaten it at least once, so I didn't contradict myself in my review.Now that I've beaten it, let's talk about Dark Souls Dos.Dark Souls 2 brings a lot of new elements to the Souls series, without poisoning the Souls experience. A lot of the new features are good, whilst some are a bit... eh, but they're not terrible changes.Some of the changes are actually necessary for this game to be good, like the bonfire teleportation. Since you can't level up at bonfires, you have to go back to the main hub. In some areas of the game, this is impossible since you have to take a route that makes sure you can't walk back.The bosses in Dark Souls 2 are a tad bit stale when in comparison to Dark Souls 1, but they're not terrible bosses. Yes, a lot of them are ""Dudes in heavy armour"" but if you actually read through the story of Dark Souls 2, you'd know why. There are a fair share of tough bosses, along with simple ones but all of them are unique in some way (excluding boss duplicates.)The main gripe I have with this game, however, is the level design. In Dark Souls 1, it didn't feel like a chore getting to each boss because you memorized enemy spawning patterns, traps and room layouts. However, in Dark Souls 2, I mostly just ran through entire sections of the game because they were tedious as ♥♥♥♥. Heaps of enemies just before the boss area does NOT mean it's good level design. Yes, I know Dark Souls 2 is supposed to be hard, but when you're faced against a plethora of enemies just before you enter a boss room, that's a bit unfair. Yes, I know that enemies can de-spawn, but you have to kill them 12 times. That's twelve long trips to the boss area that I can just sprint to and ignore everything.The PvP in Dark Souls 2 is vastly superior to Dark Souls 1. Less lag, better connectivity and you can talk to players that you're helping. A lot of people dislike the voice feature, but I think it's great, because you can warn the host of traps coming their way before they kill themselves and boot you out of their world.Is Dark Souls 2 worth your time? Yes.Is it better than Dark Souls 1? No, but it's not terrible in comparison.			"

												When I saw that Lord Gaben had put this game on a 50% sale, I had to buy it, seeing as I had already spent a lot of time with it on the Xbox 360, but had never had an opportunity to play the multiplayer, due to my Xbox not being connected to the internet and whatnot.Many notable things have happened throughout my playtime of this game. I shall tell of a few of them.-put down summon sign in front of smelter demon fog gate to farm sunlight medals-got summoned-praised sun 5 times-walked toward fog gate-walked off cliff-died instantly-did not get sunlight medal-invaded person's world in harvest valley-found person-person did not move-backstabbed person-person took no damage-backstabbed person 7 more times-person took no damage-person began to move, lagging all over the place-followed person-severe lag spike occured-lag spike ended-found that i had been backstabbed and slashed several times-died-touched red summon sign in old iron keep to initiate pvp-began to fight-was doing pretty decent-windows notification minimized game-frantically unminimized game-saw that i had been killed-asked why gaben had forsaken meAll joking aside, this game is incredible, and you shouldn't hesitate to buy it.

												This game is absolutely fantastic. It's hard as hell, but thats the fun of it. When you die, you can usually tell that it was your own fault. Firm but fair. The combat is great and it's mechanics are well designed. The level design is great too, with many little secrets hidden around each area. when you explore, you are rewarded for it. I also like the mutliplayer features. teaming up to fight bosses is really fun, as is invading other players and killing them. You can join covenants, which are factions dedicated to a particular aspect of the game, such as PVP and co-op. These flesh out the multiplayer aspects a bit more. Best of all, it's a decent port this time. It runs at 60fps native, and doesnt look like a slideshow any more. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG's and is up for a challenge.			"

												Dark Souls is not for the faint of heart, and not quite like anything you've ever played before. There are no easy enemies, no easy areas. Every battle can be your last, every corner a death trap. It's brutal, but fair. It stands as testament that a true challenge makes the whole experience so much more satisfying, when you battle the biggest, baddest enemy you've encountered yet and finally best it.Great atmosphere, great gameplay, huge replayability and some brilliant dynamic multiplayer interaction which seamlessy blends into gameplay.

												For this review i will go into probably too much detail about my comparisons between Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2 as well as a little piece on the whole Scholar of the first sin issue that has arisen.Firstly, If you are planning on buying this game just wait, you'll get the DLC and an upgraded version of the game (DirectX 11) with improved graphics and a few other bits and bobs thrown in for good measure in April (2015). You could buy this version if you wanted as it does already have the multiplayer ""improvements"" which the new version will have but then you will have to buy the season pass as well, Chances are the new game will split the community so yeah.. just get the new one, save yourself some grief.Even if i knew about the new version coming out (Scholar of the first sin) I still would have bought this on release as im quite an impatient person, so i'm not sure why people who have the game already are moaning e.g ""If i knew this was gonna happen i'd have waited for SOTFS"" (Gonna say that as it's easier to type). I can see what they mean though as SAVE GAMES are not compatible with the new version. Which is rather strange as i'd find more people would buy it if they allowed Cross Saves on both versions and to allow players from the DX9 and DX11 Versions to play together... but i digress.Anyway.. Dark Souls 2, I can't recommend this game enough as the atmosphere and general feel of the game is far better than it's predecesor, Dark Souls 1 was no Masterpiece but was a good game in it's own right (Owned it on Xbox 360 Originally) but i felt like a lot of the issues Dark Souls 1 had were addressed, on the PVE (Player Versus Enviroment) side of things anyway.Bosses feel a lot better in the sense that you don't feel quite as cheated a lot of the time as i felt in the first game, DS1 would make me shout out at ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t things like being hit by Bosses attacks which were infact nowhere near you, Hitboxes seem a lot better on Bosses and i don't feel like the Difficulty of the game is actually coming from issues with Bosses or the Enviroment. More just my own over confidence at times getting me killed. The bosses were well presented Graphically and were an enjoyment to fight even Ancient Dragon (Not a nice fight as Melee).PvP on the hand is a different matter entirely if you want to just go playing the game and Continuing on to NG+8 (New Game + Is when you play the game over again but slightly harder after you've finished it) then by any means ignore this paragraph as the PvP in Dark Souls 2 is god awful. Latency issues and Hitbox ""extremists"" are rife in this game, Many a time i've been killed by players using weapons which have a long range/reach. The weapon only goes so far but then the hitbox goes even further due to whatever reason which i can't seem to figure out. Halberds and Lances are the worst of this. Making PvP more of a use the cheapest tactic possible to win.The game looks great at high settings still gritty and slightly saturated but all the games in the series have had that look and it is well optimized (I even had it playing on my Microsoft Surface Pro 2) which is a feat on its own, The dark areas don't seem too dark that you can barely see what is happening infront of you, No more Blighttown from DS1 :). Overall it is a much better port than DS1 ever was even with DSfix. As well as Controllers not being the only option you have a Keyboard and Mouse which is just as fine a way of playing the game as any Controller is! Praise the Sun!I've yet to come across any game breaking bugs or any sort of hacking (That i know of) Bar the lag and the hitbox issues when fighting other players i don't have a lot of bad things to say about this game. I feel a lot of the hatred it gets is from people who played Dark Souls 1 and loved it and can't quite get to grips with the second game changing a few of the core concepts of the original. Most people just straight up don't like change.The Characters in the game have interesting Dialogue and do help you out with little hints a long the way incase you do get lost. You WILL get lost and go to an area much harder than what you should currently be at, everyone does it so don't worry, All the Souls games have had Zero Sense of direction i.e it won't hold your hand and show you where to go quite like other games but that's half the fun.If Dark Souls 2 came out before DS1 i would still prefer Dark Souls 2 for its better overall polish. Dark Souls 1 was never meant to be a PC game and was ported in a rush. Which From Software can be blamed for because from Dark Souls 2 and what i've seen of Bloodborne their games can and do overall look well polished.No doubt i'll get some stick for saying DS1 was never a Masterpiece but it had its really good times in PVP and most of its PvE but it had a lot of issues that really needed addressed before it was ever made available to the PC market.If you like a game which allows you to slam your balls into a wall over and over again, yet you never question ""Why?"" and just keep going till the wall breaks or your balls do then Dark Souls 2 is a game you must try.. or atleast Scholar of the First Sin.(Chances are i'll add to this review as time goes on)			"

												This is my review without playing DS1 before . At my first time play through,because of terrible port. I almost ditched this game but on a second thought, I gave it another try by overlooking bad port and poor graphic. This time I really enjoyed the game. I  played it till the end and still want to play more so I would like you guys to read my review first, you will understand why this game has a lot of lovers and haters at the same time, and whether this game suits your taste or not.Let me start with the bad port first. As many negative reviewers said, this game has a abysmal console port EVER !. If you have controller, you will not have the issue. Nevertheless, if you have only keyboard + mouse, You will have to spend 1-2 hours learning how to play with keyboard. Even after you know how to do every moveset, you still have a delay. Anyway, you still can play this game with keyboard + mouse. Me too struggled at first but now totally fine.Second, the Graphic is unacceptable if you compare to PC RPG game nowadays. So even without keyboard issue, this game cannot get perfect score. No zooming to the face when you talk to NPC, NPC mouth is shut. Character creation is bare bone. Begining cinematic is a lie. You will not see cinematic like that again in the game. The only cinematics left are seen when you fight a boss, which most of them are mediocre.Third, there is a very little story in this game, or I could say this game has no story at all, no quest or whatever. You just have to put yourself through the end of the game, that's it. This game is pretty much like a hack&slash game if you ask me.However, even with these very poor features, this game still has its huge merit, that is THE CHARISMA of the game. or in another word, THE CHALLENGE, which is very unique if it is compared with most RPG games in the market. EVERY TIME YOU DIE, THE GAME WILL PUNISH YOU, this concept adds the unique tense that I never had before in other games. Every death will decrease your maximum HP 5 - 10% per time and If you die again before getting to the spot that you just died, you will lose all your souls accumulated, which can be a huge loss since you have to use souls to up your lv and spend stuffs. Of course, you cannot save your game. This rule will force you focus on the game and be cautious to every corner, traps and enemy. ""I must survive ! I must not die"" these are what you will chanting in your mind while playing the game. There are checkpoints (bonfire) available though, however many times checkpoints are far from each other, so if you die along the way, you will have to run from the start again.Game Mechanic is also very awesome. I blamed it in my first review but that was because of my inexperience. This game when you click attack button, it means you just committed the attack, you cannot cancel it and you will be vulnerable at that time. This force you to play more carefully. Most of enemies in the game can be defeated only by skill not by your lv or equipment. You just need to understand its attack-pattern, dodge and attack at the right time. Boss's fights are so epic and super excited. I still remember how hard when I fought will Last Giant, the first boss and Pursuer, the second boss first time. I spent more than 2 hours to beat them. I died a lot, many times I made mistakes just when I was about to finished them off ( wanna cry). I even almost gave up. However, after I defeated them, I felt very satisfied. The feeling that you conquer the game on your own perseverance will emerge.To me, there is no game giving the winning feeling as big as this one.Multiplayer, another thing that I must mention no matter what. This game has a VERY GOOD MULTIPLAYER, which I've never expected from RPG games. PVE, you can summon your friends to help you fight or can go to help in your friend's world. Thus, if you feel like the game is too hard, you can summon help anytime. More importantly, PVP IS THE BEAST, fighting the others is very fun. A lot of weapon have its own moveset, making the fight very diverse. There is no best weapon nor best armor in the game. Moreover, you can invade the other's world forcefully by using items, ambush poor guy while he is busy with his monsters, or be invaded yourself, or even become a helper who helps newbie fight with invader. However, for me, in a high lv 200+, the game will start to be less fun in PVP since everyone will use the same style due to the stat soft cap and soul mem matching is unreasonable.In sum, I have a lot of fun with this game but I cannot give perfect score because those bad aspects. So here is my quick brief reviewIF YOU WANT THE GAME WITH AN AMAZING GRAPHIC, EXCELLENT STORY that has various of choices and memorable NPC. This game is absolutely ์NOT for you.However, IF YOU WANT A INTENSE CHALLENGING GAMEPLAY and GREAT PVP, this game is a must try !. I hope DLC will come soon :>			"

												The great feeling of finally beating the boss you've been trying to kill for over 10 times, doing so with wit, skill and some experience from all those previous deaths. To pile up your own corpses to finally reach as high as the bar of difficulty that a boss requires. And interesting combat system that is responsive, fair and most of the time entertaining to partake in. Blocks, parries, rolls, magic, archery, basically all you want from a medieval fantasy world. The story is barely non existant, as well as it should be as you're not there for the story. Your accomplishments come from overcoming hurdles, not learing about the character development of various people in the game. You get a few tid bits from there and there, enjoying what little they give you without taking away from the focus, the game is difficult. The combat is most of the time fair, however a lot of cheap moves from bosses and other difficult mobs make it sometimes frustrating when a insta kill move come out of nowhere, dying because you've not faced that enemy just yet. Assuming, requiring you to die to learn a certain move set by a certain mob is unfair in its combat system and that is what my main complaint about the game is... To my taste, it's something that is rather cheeky, an attempt to keep the ""You will die"" idea up by forcing it onto you. The game is a single player focused game, and please, if you buy this as I recommend, then do not engage in the multi-player pvp. It is rather atrocious, the delay between the host and the invader are quite long, often seconds which leads to you getting backstabbed in the front, getting hit by a slash that is 3 feet away and so forth. Forgetting that, the frustrating behavior of the Dark Souls 2 community is childish and elitist. You will not meet not a single person who have not mim/maxxed their character, looked up builds from the internet and copy pasted their 'own' creations from someone else. Stick to the single player and you will skip yourself a lot of pain inducing rage that comes with the bad latency, poor behavior and non-creative &½@-buckets.			"

												If i recommend it? If you are a masochist, yes. Most definitely then. We all know those passages in games, where you just play and play and die and die all the time. In Dark Souls 2 you will experience like 100 times more. The good thing is, you get even punished for that. The game will reduce your health points for every death you encounter. At some point you will only have half of your health points left. You can only change that if you becoe human again and the items for that are rare and costy. So you have to choose wisely. The enemies are strong and unforgiving. A lot of traps and huge bosses who punish one wrong move with insta killing you are awaiting you. Every time you die the enemies respawn. Other than in Dark Souls 1 they won't respawn forever. After 10 times they are gone forever. So no Souls farming.Aprospos souls. The soul mechanic are still llike in Dark Souls 1. You kill enemies and get souls. It is basically the currency for everything. You want to increase your strength? Spend souls on it. You want to buy a weapon or ring? Souls! You need to repair? Souls. If you die. You lose your souls. It is up to you to go and collect your souls where you last died. If you die on the way. You lose them forever. So you better be careful :)The combat is kinda simple. You can lock on to enemies and then it you can choose from 4 different attacks. one hard and one fast hit for each hand. If you wear a shield you can either block or bash. All the different weapons (there are a ton of them and all upgradable) have a different move set. You should experiment with that. Not always the weapon with the most damage is the best choice. The load is important as well. You can be the tank that wears big armor and big weapons, but that makes you slow. YOu can be also be the rogue or something in between. You can dodge then instead of block. You can also be a mage. A lot of possibilites there.The story... *sigh* I admit i'm not the best in English, but i guess even if i were better i would never really got it. Maybe i'm just stupid- Don't know. It is a mystery to me tho. The NPC's are decently voiced and well written. The dialogue is very good most of the time. The sound overall is pretty simple but it feels right this way. Loud music would have destroyed the dark atmoshpere. The Bosses are impressive. A large variety lies ahead of you. Each needs a different strategy and all have dirty tricks in their sleeves :)The graphics... yea. They are old. If you are a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ you should look for mods. The game doesn't look that bad, but you can clearly see that it isn't the newest nowadays.The Multiplayer. The fact that you can stop the invasions of other players in Dark Souls 2 is a great feature. Invasion means, that other players can invade you and you have to fight them. But that is not all. Friends can always help you or sometimes strangers over their help. This is a good part. It is up to you personally if you like to fight other palyers or if you completely concentrate to explore the world. There are also PvP arenas. Overall the MP isn't a must anymore, but if you have friends who need help or who could help you or if you like to show you are the strongest it is a nice option.Can't really criticize anything on this game. Had no crashed or other bugs while playing. The lack of Journal makes the traveling or the quests a bit confusing, but nothing you can't handle. You just need to pay attention to what your NPC friends say :)So if you like a real challenge and you can handle frustrating moments. You should buy it.			"

												Dark Souls II. Sounds pretty Baddass right? Trust me, it is. Think of it as Skyrim's Ridiculously hardcore Cousin --twice removed--. This game is literally ALL about grinding, sure, there's some really nice puzzle elements to it, but what you really end up doing is scowering the world for loot, and collecting souls to level yourself up, and become even more badass. Thing is though, you ARE going to die, A LOT. There'll be the ""how the hell does that work?"" 's and ""wow, how did I not notice that""'s and eventually, you'll have nothing left but your trusty sword/hammer/mace/spear/lance/Halberd/GIANT PIECE OF METAL and the Beautifully crafted armour on your back.

												I was impressed from the moment I launched Dark Souls 2. If you played Dark Souls you will immdieatly feel at home with the UI and controls (for the most part). If you haven't played Dark Souls, well then you are in for a death filled treat! While Dark Souls 2 does not hold the oplayer by the hand it does start out slightly easier and the initial player builds seem more well rounded. The changes made to the player stat system also force the player to make more meaningful choices when leveling up and tend to force you into a more focused build. The coop has really been fleshed out, the game now allows players to more easily group with other players by using a special ring and there are covenants that are focused on aidding players who are invaded. I gotta say there is nothing like getting summoned to someone's world when they are getting invaded and double teaming a guy that thought he was going to get an easy kill haha. Dark Souls 2 is PACKED with content, loads of bosses, weapons, armors, and spells to find. Graphically Darks Souls 2 is far superior to Darks Souls, in fact the graphics were so clean that I found it jarring after getting used to gritty stutter filled maisma that was Dark Souls.

												Dark Souls II. Sounds pretty Baddass right? Trust me, it is. Think of it as Skyrim's Ridiculously hardcore Cousin --twice removed--. This game is literally ALL about grinding, sure, there's some really nice puzzle elements to it, but what you really end up doing is scowering the world for loot, and collecting souls to level yourself up, and become even more badass. Thing is though, you ARE going to die, A LOT. There'll be the ""how the hell does that work?"" 's and ""wow, how did I not notice that""'s and eventually, you'll have nothing left but your trusty sword/hammer/mace/spear/lance/Halberd/GIANT PIECE OF METAL and the Beautifully crafted armour on your back. But hey, This is Dark Souls; ""whatever kills you makes you stronger""			"

												This is my review without playing DS1 before . At my first time play through,because of terrible port. I almost ditched this game but on a second thought, I gave it another try by overlooking bad port and poor graphic. This time I really enjoyed the game. I  played it till the end and still want to play more so I would like you guys to read my review first, you will understand why this game has a lot of lovers and haters at the same time, and whether this game suits your taste or not.Let me start with the bad port first. As many negative reviewers said, this game has a abysmal console port EVER !. If you have controller, you will not have the issue. Nevertheless, if you have only keyboard + mouse, You will have to spend 1-2 hours learning how to play with keyboard. Even after you know how to do every moveset, you still have a delay. Anyway, you still can play this game with keyboard + mouse. Me too struggled at first but now totally fine.Second, the Graphic is unacceptable if you compare to PC RPG game nowadays. So even without keyboard issue, this game cannot get perfect score. No zooming to the face when you talk to NPC, NPC mouth is shut. Character creation is bare bone. Begining cinematic is a lie. You will not see cinematic like that again in the game. The only cinematics left are seen when you fight a boss, which most of them are mediocre.Third, there is a very little story in this game, or I could say this game has no story at all, no quest or whatever. You just have to put yourself through the end of the game, that's it. This game is pretty much like a hack&slash game if you ask me.However, even with these very poor features, this game still has its huge merit, that is THE CHARISMA of the game. or in another word, THE CHALLENGE, which is very unique if it is compared with most RPG games in the market. EVERY TIME YOU DIE, THE GAME WILL PUNISH YOU, this concept adds the unique tense that I never had before in other games. Every death will decrease your maximum HP 5 - 10% per time and If you die again before getting to the spot that you just died, you will lose all your souls accumulated, which can be a huge loss since you have to use souls to up your lv and spend stuffs. Of course, you cannot save your game. This rule will force you focus on the game and be cautious to every corner, traps and enemy. ""I must survive ! I must not die"" these are what you will chanting in your mind while playing the game. There are checkpoints (bonfire) available though, however many times checkpoints are far from each other, so if you die along the way, you will have to run from the start again.Game Mechanic is also very awesome. I blamed it in my first review but that was because of my inexperience. This game when you click attack button, it means you just committed the attack, you cannot cancel it and you will be vulnerable at that time. This force you to play more carefully. Most of enemies in the game can be defeated only by skill not by your lv or equipment. You just need to understand its attack-pattern, dodge and attack at the right time. Boss's fights are so epic and super excited. I still remember how hard when I fought will Last Giant, the first boss and Pursuer, the second boss first time. I spent more than 2 hours to beat them. I died a lot, many times I made mistakes just when I was about to finished them off ( wanna cry). I even almost gave up. However, after I defeated them, I felt very satisfied. The feeling that you conquer the game on your own perseverance will emerge.To me, there is no game giving the winning feeling as big as this one.Multiplayer, another thing that I must mention no matter what. This game has a VERY GOOD MULTIPLAYER, which I've never expected from RPG games. PVE, you can summon your friends to help you fight or can go to help in your friend's world. Thus, if you feel like the game is too hard, you can summon help anytime. More importantly, PVP IS THE BEAST, fighting the others is very fun. A lot of weapon have its own moveset, making the fight very diverse. There is no best weapon nor best armor in the game. Moreover, you can invade the other's world forcefully by using items, ambush poor guy while he is busy with his monsters, or be invaded yourself, or even become a helper who helps newbie fight with invader. However, for me, in a high lv 200+, the game will start to be less fun in PVP since everyone will use the same style due to the stat soft cap and soul mem matching is unreasonable.In sum, I have a lot of fun with this game but I cannot give perfect score because those bad aspects. So here is my quick brief reviewIF YOU WANT THE GAME WITH AN AMAZING GRAPHIC, EXCELLENT STORY that has various of choices and memorable NPC. This game is absolutely ์NOT for you.However, IF YOU WANT A INTENSE CHALLENGING GAMEPLAY and GREAT PVP, this game is a must try !. I hope DLC will come soon :>			"

												The great feeling of finally beating the boss you've been trying to kill for over 10 times, doing so with wit, skill and some experience from all those previous deaths. To pile up your own corpses to finally reach as high as the bar of difficulty that a boss requires. And interesting combat system that is responsive, fair and most of the time entertaining to partake in. Blocks, parries, rolls, magic, archery, basically all you want from a medieval fantasy world. The story is barely non existant, as well as it should be as you're not there for the story. Your accomplishments come from overcoming hurdles, not learing about the character development of various people in the game. You get a few tid bits from there and there, enjoying what little they give you without taking away from the focus, the game is difficult. The combat is most of the time fair, however a lot of cheap moves from bosses and other difficult mobs make it sometimes frustrating when a insta kill move come out of nowhere, dying because you've not faced that enemy just yet. Assuming, requiring you to die to learn a certain move set by a certain mob is unfair in its combat system and that is what my main complaint about the game is... To my taste, it's something that is rather cheeky, an attempt to keep the ""You will die"" idea up by forcing it onto you. The game is a single player focused game, and please, if you buy this as I recommend, then do not engage in the multi-player pvp. It is rather atrocious, the delay between the host and the invader are quite long, often seconds which leads to you getting backstabbed in the front, getting hit by a slash that is 3 feet away and so forth. Forgetting that, the frustrating behavior of the Dark Souls 2 community is childish and elitist. You will not meet not a single person who have not mim/maxxed their character, looked up builds from the internet and copy pasted their 'own' creations from someone else. Stick to the single player and you will skip yourself a lot of pain inducing rage that comes with the bad latency, poor behavior and non-creative &½@-buckets.			"

												Just like the first one this game will make you sweat and work for your victories, but the catch is, it's even harder! You lose part of your health everytime you die. The game is trying to tell you to be careful, you can take its advice or be dumb and rush in head first. In anyway this game is just as great as the first maybe even better (Since they fixed the framerate problems). Anyway I rate this 10/10 Would Die Again.			"

												This game is too satisfying~Is good~It's likeI want to be summoned? I place the white soapstone signCan't even count to ten before I'm summonedIt's amazingSpecially compared to the 8 minutes from Dark Souls 1And it runs so smooth~~I'm in love with this~ <3Get it, it's worth all the penniesBut for the players of 1, just beware the very very beggining (like, first 10 minutes) will feel wildly different from DS1's late-medieval decaying urban setting from the first few areas.Now, I just hope someday From Software at the least takes the multiplayer netcode from Dark Souls 2 and pretty much just copy pastes it into Dark Souls 1, so co-op/PVP in that will be easier.

												The easiest way I can review this game is to say that it is to Dark Souls as Street Fighter III Third Strike was to Street Fighter II Turbo.They are games in the same series, and they share similar mechanics and features, but they are each different games in their own right.Honestly, I enjoyed parts of DS 1 more than I did DS II, and vice versa. I preferred the beginning areas of DS 1, but I prefer DS 2's middle and ending areas more.I preferred DS 1's humanity mechanics to DS 2's, but I prefer DS 2's covenants, invasions, summons, and overal online interactions. I didn't play DS 1 until 2013, so the community had begun to wither by then. Being able to interact with so many people in DS 2 is just incredible.I prefered DS 1's NPC interactions more, but the NPC characters in DS 2 are just as engaging and do a great job of painting the narrative picture of Drangleic. I greatly prefer DS 2's upgrade systems, combat, and variety of weapons. All in all, it is a great game, but vastly different from DS 1. DS 1 has an ethereal sort of charm to it, a desolate beauty. DS 2 has more of a hopeful, nomadic feel to it, but in the end both games are incredible and I'd highly recommend DS 2.			"

												The first review I wrote about Dark Souls 2 was very negative, because of all the pointless deaths.New Review below.After getting tired of dying all the time on my Knight, I tried out a Cleric, which didn't do the trick for me either.As I found out the hard way, you really need to just find a class that suits your style of gameplay.After 4h of ""Soul Searching"" I came to the conclusion that Swordsman was the way to go for me.If you're sick of dying, try and find a class which suits your playstyle and just delete the others for now.Combat:Very difficult even at this point, reason being I did not play the first Dark Souls.The bosses aren't too bad, except for the trio bosses which literally took me 3-4h to do with co-op.The mechanics behind the Combat system are quite good, it's an improvement if you're comparing Skyrim and Dark Souls 2.Smoother gameplay, less glitching and more blood.8/10Sound:The game and environment soundtracks are quite beautiful to listen to.8/10Graphics:One word: ""Amazing"".The graphics in this game are very nice compared to other games I have seen this year, I hope to see more franchises pick up these kind of graphics as examples (one of the few i've seen is Tom Clancy's The Division (Scheduled release Dec 31 2014) which show bullet hole lights and other kind of real-time light effects.9/10Overall opinion:Frustrating game to play unless you found the class that suits your needs.Even though I say frustrating, that doesn't change the fact that after I rage deleted the game, I promptly re-installed it within 2h because of addictive urges.8/10.I Recommend this game for anyone that loves games like Skyrim and has enough RPG experience.If you haven't, I suggest trying out Dark Souls's first installment in order to get a grasp on the combat system, I took a peak and it's quite simmilar.Feel free to comment below.

												If you are a Dark souls and demon souls addict you cant miss this one, the combat mechanics remain the same as before, but with some additions, for instance the manual aiming is more accurate (cause in previous dark souls  aiming with the mouse was horrible the crosshair would make jumps instead of moving smoothly), and now you can dual wield the crossbow and manual aim with it while doing so. Also we will see some changes in the health system, as an example now you will have at your disposal health gems, very usefull to regain health in case you run out of estus, and if you die constantly not only you will look like you need a lifting but also your health bar will decrease to a minimum of a 50% of it.Bosses will be challenging as always, that is until you either find the correct technique to beat them or some assistance from other players thanks to the multiplayer upgrade.Yes you heard right the multiplayuer now works just fine mainly because now the players are allocated in a server (not using bloody p2p anymore), also you will find some filters at your disposal to make playing with your friends possible, first of all you can limit in options the region of the players you will encounter, and in-game you will be able to use ""channels"" (or should i say gods?) with a ring a merchant will sell you in the first village, and if doing all that is not enough you can always hide the saponite singal away from those curious eyes that are in huge need of your assistance.This my nomenee for the custom catergory for infuriating/frustrtion reasons			"

												I was impressed from the moment I launched Dark Souls 2. If you played Dark Souls you will immdieatly feel at home with the UI and controls (for the most part). If you haven't played Dark Souls, well then you are in for a death filled treat! While Dark Souls 2 does not hold the oplayer by the hand it does start out slightly easier and the initial player builds seem more well rounded. The changes made to the player stat system also force the player to make more meaningful choices when leveling up and tend to force you into a more focused build. The coop has really been fleshed out, the game now allows players to more easily group with other players by using a special ring and there are covenants that are focused on aidding players who are invaded. I gotta say there is nothing like getting summoned to someone's world when they are getting invaded and double teaming a guy that thought he was going to get an easy kill haha. Dark Souls 2 is PACKED with content, loads of bosses, weapons, armors, and spells to find. Graphically Darks Souls 2 is far superior to Darks Souls, in fact the graphics were so clean that I found it jarring after getting used to gritty stutter filled maisma that was Dark Souls. With so much to find, the great graphics, and the motavation to try out new characters builds Dark Souls 2 is well worth the price of admission, and just like a good movie I suggest you bring a friend. 9.5/10			"

												I'm in a love/hate relationship with this game. The content of the game itself is amazing, I love it as much as Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, but the technical issues that comes with it makes me want to strangle and drown it in a bathtub... and then become Herbert West and attempt to revive it. I love playing around with different characters, killing bosses over and over, engaging in jolly co-operation and all that, but every now and then, the game will give you the finger with its glitchy-at-best mechanics. Phantom hitboxes, cross-region restriction not actually working (in a couple hours I invaded / was invaded by a bunch of koreans, chinese and americans, and only 1 European (yes, I am in Europe)), lagstabs left and right (the only thing it does better than Dark Souls 1 with online play as opposed to GFWL is being able to connect to others, the ridiculous lag is still present because the cross-region option does not work for ♥♥♥♥), button presses suddenly refusing to register (with and without a controller), disconnect messages are more common than successful invasions, RNG jumping mechanics (you either jump short distance or long distance, completely inconsistent, annoying for when you shortjump 7 times in a row to get the ember, will quite often also tell speedrunners to go ♥♥♥♥ themselves), animations locking in place rendering your character unable to do anything until you accept your fate and die. The list goes on and on. I think I might have stockholm syndrome.			"

												If i recommend it? If you are a masochist, yes. Most definitely then. We all know those passages in games, where you just play and play and die and die all the time. In Dark Souls 2 you will experience like 100 times more. The good thing is, you get even punished for that. The game will reduce your health points for every death you encounter. At some point you will only have half of your health points left. You can only change that if you becoe human again and the items for that are rare and costy. So you have to choose wisely. The enemies are strong and unforgiving. A lot of traps and huge bosses who punish one wrong move with insta killing you are awaiting you. Every time you die the enemies respawn. Other than in Dark Souls 1 they won't respawn forever. After 10 times they are gone forever. So no Souls farming.Aprospos souls. The soul mechanic are still llike in Dark Souls 1. You kill enemies and get souls. It is basically the currency for everything. You want to increase your strength? Spend souls on it. You want to buy a weapon or ring? Souls! You need to repair? Souls. If you die. You lose your souls. It is up to you to go and collect your souls where you last died. If you die on the way. You lose them forever. So you better be careful :)The combat is kinda simple. You can lock on to enemies and then it you can choose from 4 different attacks. one hard and one fast hit for each hand. If you wear a shield you can either block or bash. All the different weapons (there are a ton of them and all upgradable) have a different move set. You should experiment with that. Not always the weapon with the most damage is the best choice. The load is important as well. You can be the tank that wears big armor and big weapons, but that makes you slow. YOu can be also be the rogue or something in between. You can dodge then instead of block. You can also be a mage. A lot of possibilites there.The story... *sigh* I admit i'm not the best in English, but i guess even if i were better i would never really got it. Maybe i'm just stupid- Don't know. It is a mystery to me tho. The NPC's are decently voiced and well written. The dialogue is very good most of the time. The sound overall is pretty simple but it feels right this way. Loud music would have destroyed the dark atmoshpere. The Bosses are impressive. A large variety lies ahead of you. Each needs a different strategy and all have dirty tricks in their sleeves :)The graphics... yea. They are old. If you are a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ you should look for mods. The game doesn't look that bad, but you can clearly see that it isn't the newest nowadays.The Multiplayer. The fact that you can stop the invasions of other players in Dark Souls 2 is a great feature. Invasion means, that other players can invade you and you have to fight them. But that is not all. Friends can always help you or sometimes strangers over their help. This is a good part. It is up to you personally if you like to fight other palyers or if you completely concentrate to explore the world. There are also PvP arenas. Overall the MP isn't a must anymore, but if you have friends who need help or who could help you or if you like to show you are the strongest it is a nice option.Can't really criticize anything on this game. Had no crashed or other bugs while playing. The lack of Journal makes the traveling or the quests a bit confusing, but nothing you can't handle.

												This game is too satisfying~Is good~It's likeI want to be summoned? I place the white soapstone signCan't even count to ten before I'm summonedIt's amazingSpecially compared to the 8 minutes from Dark Souls 1And it runs so smooth~~I'm in love with this~ <3Get it, it's worth all the penniesBut for the players of 1, just beware the very very beggining (like, first 10 minutes) will feel wildly different from DS1's late-medieval decaying urban setting from the first few areas.Now, I just hope someday From Software at the least takes the multiplayer netcode from Dark Souls 2 and pretty much just copy pastes it into Dark Souls 1, so co-op/PVP in that will be easier.

												First, I must say that I have played numerous hours of Dark Souls I, so my review may be partially biased. Also understand this review is for Dark Souls II, and none of the DLC is being reviewed. That being said, Dark Souls II is a fresh look at the Dark Souls series brought to us by the sadistic FromSoft for their pleasure mostly I'm sure. Even though I feel DSII is not as brutally difficult as DSI, it does have its moments of pain, struggle, and as souls fans know, death. The visuals are very pleasing to the eyes, with a smooth feel throughout the entire game. It is not perfect, as mobs and bosses can get glitchy and that alone can cause for some frustrating moments. As great as the game truly is, there are times when it feels they just copy pasted the same boss again and again. However, there are many unique mobs and bosses to be found. I just feel they were not as unique and exciting as DSI. I enjoyed the storyline, and though I'm not big into PVP, I felt the bit of PVP I did play was fun and exciting. Overall DSII is a wonderful game, with hours of content to give you your money's worth, but I have a special place in my heart for the original and always will.I give the game 9/10 pants.			"

												Dark Souls II. Sounds pretty Baddass right? Trust me, it is. Think of it as Skyrim's Ridiculously hardcore Cousin --twice removed--. This game is literally ALL about grinding, sure, there's some really nice puzzle elements to it, but what you really end up doing is scowering the world for loot, and collecting souls to level yourself up, and become even more badass. Thing is though, you ARE going to die, A LOT. There'll be the ""how the hell does that work?"" 's and ""wow, how did I not notice that""'s and eventually, you'll have nothing left but your trusty sword/hammer/mace/spear/lance/Halberd/GIANT PIECE OF METAL and the Beautifully crafted armour on your back. But hey, This is Dark Souls; ""whatever kills you makes you stronger""			"

												FROM SOFTWARE have out done themselves with this absolute gem in the souls series. The Puzzle Adventure genre has been lacking in good games and it's great to play such a innovative and interesting new way to experience such a beloved genre. This game will have you literally spending hours working out the easiest way to lure out each enemy 1-by-1 in the current area you're stuck in. What's really great about this is that you are adequatley punished for messing up a puzzle, by having to confront an absoutely ridiculous number of really tanky, hard hitting enemies that seem to only be limited by the amount of mental torture the player can endure before inevitibly playing a better game (like Runescape or something else that's usually considered really bad).Also ""people"" (vince) moaned about some graphical issues (?) but you can just download a stupid ENB mod to make your game look like it's being played through some over the top instagram filter anyway. 11/10 - Me			"

												After playing a good chunk already on PS3, I thought I would give the PC version a quick run and see how well it performed. Now this will pretty much be a cheesy pros and cons list to make it relatively fast. Pros: -Bonfire travel is no longer limited to after one point in the game-Life gems comebined with estus are REAL nice considering how much more valuable estus are in this game-LOTS of content -Relatively smooth gameplay/combat-Variety of locations and enemies-Scarce on the surface but rewards those who explore-Story might be more approachable but plenty of hidden lore-Lots of Dark Souls references and even some Demon's Souls references. -PVP is relatively fine, a lot smoother than Dark Souls I'll say that much-Way better PC port this time around-Nice smooth start for beginners but still offer the challenges veterans seek-Ways to make the game harder-Bonfire Asthetics-Variety of playstylesCons:-Hitboxes go out of wack every now and then-F***ING SOUL MEMORY -Staggering is either way too easy on most enemies and you also stagger fairly easy-Boss difficulty and spread feels inconsistent -A few levels feel poorly designed-Game feels a bit more linear near Drangleic Castle -Method of obtaining certain gear Pretty much this game is Demon's Souls with a Dark Souls paint but still a solid game that a Souls fan or intersted player should pick up. **UPDATED NOTE THAT I FORGOT TO INCLUDE**While you can use a keyboard and mouse, it is still a pain in the ♥♥♥ even though you can tell the controls are more functional. Even after rebinding you will still find the controller superior.			"

												By far my favourite game of the year. The fantastic qualities of this game far outweigh the flaws. Don't listen to the angry tryhards complaining about soul memory or the lack of invasions in NG. Sure, Soul memory isn't a perfect system, but i've adjusted to it, and didn't let it effect what a wonderful game this is. This game really starts to shine in NG+ though, when the invasions really kick it up a notch. If you're not interested in waiting that long just hop into the bell tower or rat king covenants! I'd stay out of the arenas if I were you...			"

												I'm sure many of you by now know all about how Dark Souls 2 didn't live up to it's expectations as a sequal. And you're right. There are so many things wrong with this game that it wouldn't even be worth identifying them. You can find everything elsewhere. I'll mention a few, but this isn't a slag-fest. As a stand-alone game itself, DS2 is actually quite fun. The game controls have been improved since DS1 and the game runs much more smoothly. The stats etc have been streamlined and over-all it feels more coherent than it's counter-part. Gameplay in DS2 is superior, as is the online match-play. No more will you have to wait around for an hour+ to find your friend's summon sign and invading other players is a much more common occurance. Weirdly, of all the 3 Dark Souls games, DS2 is the game I return to the most. It's easier to pick up and play than it's other 2 titles, perhaps due to the level design? DS1 was a game you really had to concentrate on and be very wary of your surroundings. It had an atmosphere which couldn't be ignored, and you felt in constant danger. DS2 doesn't have that unfortunately, and instead encourages the quick run-through style of play. The inclusion of Soul memory baffles us all, and as a gameplay mechanic doesn't work whatsoever. Invasions and co-op should just have been left with regards to your over-all soul-level. It's much simpler. Plus, for some reason, From Software don't ever seem to be able to do covenants right. None of the covenants in DS2 are particularly worth joining (with exception to the Sunbros), and the way in which the game forces the player into PvP arenas to rank up in a some of them is just aggrovating. The biggest downfall of this game however is level design. The levels are too short, too easy, and aren't coherent with an open-world game. Levels also feel very linear. The story is almost non-existent, though this is conclusive with other games of the franchise, and it jumps around all over the place, hoping to cover it with the often repeated line ""...without ever knowing why"".Despite all these pit-falls, and there are many more things that weren't mentioned here, I would still recommend this game.

												TL;DR: If you liked the first one, get this game no doubt. it's no quite as good as the first one, but Dark Souls II is still an amazing game, challenging, rewarding and has nearly everything that made the first game great.First of all, lets be straight: this game isn't as good as it's predecessor, but it's still an amazing game and a worthy sequel and most of the elements that made the first Dark Souls so great are present here.well, the game itself is pretty close in mechanics to DkS 1, although some minor tweaks have been realized, the combat feels a bit better and the adition of the power stance (you can power stance dual weapons if you have 1,5x it's stat requirements) finally makes dual wieldieng viable. the weapon and armor variety is still great, the game is long and if maybe not as hard as DkS 1 it is still pretty challenging, also the game was made a bit friendlier (not that it's easy or ""casual"") to new users with the addition of healing stones and a little better tutorial than the first one. also the addition of Soul Vessels for reseting your stats is really welcome since the balance patches can be an issue becouse they can mess with your build pretty bad (happened in the first also, but no way to reset).so... Whats the bad thing about it then? well, the level design is not quite on the niveau of the first Dark Souls, thanks to the teleporting between bonfires now available from the beginning, the world seems to have lost some of it's cohesion and seems a little bit scattered and even unlogical at some points. the design both aesthetic and mechanic wise of the bosses also isn't quite on par with the first game. also now the enemies stop respawning after you kill them x times, I suppose that it is to limit farming and/or make it easier for new player, but I think it wasn`t a good choice... also making life saving rings repairable kind of takes out some of the risk of dying...but still... great game and worthy sequel that everyone who enjoyed Dark Souls or Demon Souls should get.

												Absolutley one of my favorite RPG's i have every played, still not as as great as its predecessor but still amazingly made. I remember the countless hours of frustration and anger that Dark souls 1 caused and this game is not different. The souls series  was meant for gamers who seek a challenge in games that have no ""easy way"" around it. I feel like many modern games are very cinematic and have countless cutscenes which takes much time out of the game where as DS2 does not. The very few cutscenes that DS2 does have are very beautifully animated and almost feel real. Soundtrack is amazing as well. The community is also very active and hilarious at times and at other times can be a pain in the A**! The multiplayer is great too whether it be co-op or PvP because of the dedicated servers unlike DS1. Player who have played and finished a Souls series game feel a great sense of accomplishment and i strongly recommend this game as one of those players. 10/10			"

												Game: Dark Souls IIScore: 8/10Recommended? Yes, but not THIS versionWorth a buy at full price? No, buy Scholar of the First Sin, insteadWARNING: BUY SCHOLAR OF THE FIRST SIN, NOT THIS VERSIONThe new version of this game came out that uses DX11 graphics is bundled with all of the DLC. Saves from this version of the game do NOT carry over. Do NOT buy this version unless you want to spend more money and waste time.Now that that's out of the way, here's for the real review.Dark Souls II, more challenging than the first, still is very enjoyable. The game still retains difficult enough combat to be considered a souls game, and if you've played the first game, you will for sure enjoy this one.For those of you new to the series, I would recommend you pick up a copy of the first game while you wait for Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin to be released. It will be a good gauge of whether or not you will like this game, and it is only $20 instead of $40.Gameplay wise, the game is much smoother. 60fps and 1080p is a HUGE improvement. Movement feels much more fluid and controls more responsive.Creativity wise, the game is OKAY. It is not as bad as many claim it to be; that said I still think the first game holds much more value in creative boss/enemy design and lore, as far as the story goes. The majority of bosses in this game are some variant of ""humanoid in armor,"" and with a friend, can be easily conquered.There are many more weapons and armor in this game than in the first, which I also consider a nice touch. It's fun being able to swap looks whenever you decide to change things up.In PVP/Coop, the game is somewhat unbalanced. Rather than basing matchmaking on soul level (the level of your character based on the attributes you choose to upgrade), the game bases matchmaking on soul MEMORY, the total number of souls collected. This makes for fights where your opponent may have much, much higher/lower stats than you, depending on how they spent their souls collected overtime.That said, I haven't seen nearly as many hackers/cheaters/glitchers as in the first game. Many players have a finite amount of health and can be beaten if fought correctly.Conclusion:I recommend this game to others as a good entry in the souls series. However, for the love of all that is good in this world, DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION OF THE GAME. Go grab the remastered edition, Scholar of the First Sin, instead.			"

												This next chapter in the Souls series is just as good as the previous ones. The gameplay is rock solid and the difficulty is just as soul-crushing despite what some people are saying. Certain things take getting used to, like the new durability and health systems. But overall the changes are great. Co-op works great right out of the box. Once you get a certain item, co-op with friends is a cinch. You don't have to deal with GFWL anymore, thank god. Oh and the game is quite beautiful as well. You'll definitely stop and take in the view in a couple areas. The framerate is solid and and smooth as can be. If you liked the other Souls games, you'll like this one.			"

												Most games reward you, or congratulate you in some positive way when you defeat the final boss.Instead, Dark Souls 2 (much like the other souls games) throws out a big old kick in the shins, and rewards you with the option to start again, with 2x more nemies, 2x more health on enemies, and 2x more damage coming from the enemies.You can kill men, women, spiders, giants, massive dragons, 'Balrog' from LOTR, and even little piglets (assuming they dont kill you first). Yet, you cannot however, even manage to put a scar on a talking cat that sells rings for some reason.You will cry a little, maybe even contemplate turning he game off and having a rest, but no matter how much you want to, you are still going to spend 4 hours just trying to kill the Smelter Demon, only to have the ability to kill in in 1/2 attempts once you kill him for the first time ever.And if the game itself doesnt kill you, you will probably get invaded by a player wearing rocks, and an onion head that is wielding a 1000m long katana somehow described as a washing pole, and throwing magic at you using a frog stuck on a stick.11/10, would visit psychiatrist again			"

												For those who haven't played a Souls game, you are missing out. Gameplay that doesn't worry about caterring to a casual crowd but instead changes the way you look at and play games makes this series unique among others in the action rpg genre. That being said, Dark Souls 2 is a farcry from what it was in Demon's souls and Dark souls in terms of care and attention to detail. While the core of Dark Souls 2 is the same, it feels largely more artificial and self aware. Difficulty was always present in the series, but not as a marketing gimmick, rather a tool to immerse and amuse the players in ways not done before. These games never hold your hand, but make you adapt and increase in skill through trial and error. Dark Souls 2 feels too much like an attempt to feel difficult, to the point where some bosses and areas are just ridiculous. Approximately half of the bosses are just ""let's throw as many enemies into one room as possible"" and have multiple copies or enemies pot shotting you. While the older games did this, it was in small doses. That is not to say its a bad game, in fact its very good. Graphics are quite nice and some enviornments are very well done. Weapons are still as fun to use and unique to eachother that allow every player to tackle the game differently. Nobody wants to feel like all challenge and reward are pointless and absent. DS 2 definitely delievers a quality challenge and rewards patience and skill. Just be warned, Dark Souls 2 is not the defining chapter in the Souls Series. Give it a try, and then experience the older titles to get the full experience.			"

												I was gifted the first game about a year ago and it quickly went from completely unknown to me to being one of the best games I've ever played. This game contains all the things that made the last one great, along with an entirely new set of areas, hundreds of new weapons, armor, and spells, and nine new covenants (which are most usually a sort of player faction in pvp). There are also ~30 bosses, each with a different kind of design and backstory. Speaking of the story: it is one of the most interesting ways to present one. Most of the story is uncovered through such simple things as loot placement, area design, and item descriptions. NPC dialogue shouldn't be glossed over either: it can be easily skipped over or ignored, but it usually contains important (or sometimes blatant) hints towards your next objective or to the lore itself.The level design is still incredibly well done. You are almost always capable of choosing between 2-4 choices at a time when deciding where to go next. This non-linear model is contrasted against the more linear design of the individual levels, which allows them to fine tune the path through the area for the best gameplay experience.The combat itself is quite good as well. All actions deduct from a regenerative stamina bar, which means you must be strategic in order to plan out your actions. This usually means that the PvP involves exploiting mistakes that your opponent makes. The wide variety of weapons (anything from a katana to a scythe is available, with multiple weapons usually taking up each type of weapon moveset) allows for some specialization in a fight, as well as the four different branches of magic.Online play involves PvP or co-op, where you are capable of either helping someone else along through their game as a phantom, or invading their world as a dark spirit in order to fight them. Covanants alter these two main components of multiplayer into many different forms.Many of these features I've described may seem like it should be a standard feature of a game, but I've found that at least some of these can be done away with or poorly executed in many games.One notable detriment is that the default keyboard/mouse controls are quite bad. However, they can easily be rebound to a more familiar layout in-game.Features like NG+, multiplayer, and completionism can make this game's replayability last fo days yo.21394567/21394567 would recommend			"

												I sank all my time in the original dark souls, and now i will sink all my time once more into this new epic of a game. Everything in this universe we came to call dark souls, is a grim dark, lushious and gothic setting of a dying world, and this is no different in dark souls 2. From the tiniest details to vast landscapes, the scenery once again amazes me, with enough innovation to come up with new areas while still keeping that oldv grimdark feeling dark souls 1 imposed on you.There are not enough words to express how much i fell in love with this series all over again. The brutal, punishing nature forces one to hone their skills and become better players, learning from every mistake they make, overcoming insurmountable obstacles and all done in such a way that it's fair. It's not crippling rage that grips you when you make a mistake, but a sense of enlightenment, as you now know what that particular scenario will do to you. You overcome and adapt anything the game throws at you in due time and looking back you will find yourself wondering why the start of this adventure was so harsh. This is why dark souls is magic and will go down in history for that exact concept.This game deserves all my money and all my time, and i highly reccomend it to everyone and their unborn children.

												Less creepy than DS1.Easier to start and to get into.60 FPS cap feels totally different from 30 fps. Everything is more smooth and fast.More comfortable than DS1. Interface is improved and controls are more manageable.Less memorable locations than in DS1. No graphics they showed on E3. Invade is now possible even if you are hollow, but I was invaded only like twice through the whole game. Maybe it's not that bad luck, but it's little weird, isn't it.Soul memory. I don't like it. Because if you lose your souls, you become underleveled. You buy stuff instead of leveling up, you become underleveled. You can't make a special build for special coop assistance fun, because more you help to kill a boss, more you get out of range people usually fight this boss at. Idea may be good in theory, but seriously now you really should worry about dying and buying stuff, because it can affect your game in the future.Kinda different experience from DS1 overall. Atmosphere, tension, story. All are different. So it doesn't try to be better than DS1, but it tries to coexist. And this is good. "

												what if dark souls didn't have interesting lore, a plot that made any sense, unique bosses and enemies, weapon variety, a good atmosphere, careful character building, or gfwl, and instead had functional online and cloth physics? it'd be dark souls 2.i can honestly only recommend this game if you're just a real sucker for the kind of game that it is like i am because it really doesn't have that much going for it. even then you might end up not liking it. i spent over 200 hours trying to enjoy this game and hated it for most of them.demon's souls and dark souls are two of my favorite games, and dark souls 2 is a huge step down from them and a testament to just about everything wrong with the modern game industry.

												The game is incredible and the PC port of Dark Souls 2 is the definitive version with better graphics and substantially higher framerate and incredible online play. The perfect sequel to an already amazing game Dark Souls 2 sticks with the Souls series formula while adding tons of new weapons and spells and more, the combat has been optimized from Dark Souls and is more fluent and nuanced. For anyone who loves Action RPG's and high skill cap games this is a must buy!			"

												“so that they know that is a totally new game, to be able[sic] have a whole new set of challenges and to curse and throw the controller at the screen.” - Daniel Markoff, localization producer at Bandai Namco Games.For everything Dark Souls II does right, it does something equally wrong.You now have a dedicated jump button so jumps are now tiny hops.All players are always online to reduce hacking so now you can never play in offline mode.You can now run up/down ladders so pressing B will make you jump off a ladder usually killing you.Weapons auto repair at bonfires so weapon durability very rapidly decays.Spell casting is faster and now scales with attunement so you get less casts per spell unless you level attunement.I could easily go on but the bottom line is this; Dark Souls 2 is the sequel to Dark Souls 1 so chances are you played the first game and you know what you are signing up for anyway.I could and should rate this game down but if you knew nothing about this game you probabaly wouldn't be buying it anyway and if you are reading this review then you probabaly played the first game in which case this almost is the same god-awful, fustrating and repetitive experience that you love except they now swarm you with enemies instead, so go ahead and buy it.Because I know you like to cut yourself at night, their will be a patch soon that you have to pay for regardless of if you bought this game and it's season pass and/or all the DLC. The DirectX9 version of Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin will sell for $40, while the DirectX11 version will be $50. If you already own Dark Souls II on Steam, you can upgrade to the DirectX11 edition of Scholar (since the current version is DX9) for $30; if you own Dark Souls II and all the DLC, you can upgrade to the DX11 version for $20.Got it? I hope so, because we're not done yet. The DX9 and DX11 versions will have separate pages in the Steam store, so you'll want to be careful about which one you buy to ensure that you don't either shortchange yourself, or end up with a version you can't run. Furthermore, the two versions of the game are not compatible for multiplayer action: If you upgrade to the DX11 version and all your friends stick with the original DX9 release, you'll be playing without themJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												Dark souls, oh my dear Dark Souls. How little i initially cared about you. As a hardcore PC gamer im disgusted by the very idea of even holding onto a controller, let alone actually play a game with one. Even after that the horrible PC port actually turned me off Dark Souls 1 completely. But the idea of the Souls games always intrigued me. I was one of the few people who actually enjoyed some of those ""I wanna be the guy"" Games. In my mind they were challenging, but they were a lot about recollection and planning ahead.But alas, i didn't play the original Dark Souls. And after the huge disappointment that was Lords of the ♥♥♥♥ers i was kind of turned away from everything Souls-like for a decent amount of time.But then i noticed Dark Souls 2 was on sale.Now if you're like me you're always worried whenever you buy a game off of a sale. Cause you never really know what the hell you're getting into. But my fear was increased tenfold when i was booting up Dark Souls 2 for the first time, because i had of course experienced the nightmare that had been Dark Souls on PC. So imagine my very happy self when once i had watched the opening cutscene and got to walk around it happened without a hitch. I was able to walk briskly around like the happiest little puppy in the daycare. That was when i was greeted by the intro.Look From Software, i know you haven't got to stretch your cutscene muscles in Demon's souls and Dark souls, but could you maybe not have a cutscene last about 5-10 minutes only for us to make a character and have the cutscene go on for 2 more minutes?after that i set out into the world, and quickly met my first enemy. An undead warrior wearing what looked to be leather armor. I had of course prior to playing Dark Souls 2, seen a lets play of Dark souls 1. So i knew dodging was an essential part of its combat.Now, after i had slain my assailant i briskly moved onwards through the tunnels of Things Betwixt, fighting off more undead soldiers as i went along until i came to a hole in the road. I went into my controls to find out what the jump button was, and saw it was bound to F. So i ran forward and immediately fell down because i didn't know how to jump properly.I then respawned and found to my dismay that my previously handsome knight had somehow caught the Plague, and had therefore turned a very disgusting shade of green. I then also saw that my max health had gone down. Now, this is a mechanic i don't really like. Cause a lot of the bosses and the areas leading up to them are very much dependent on trying a lot of times to get the hang of their movement and attack patterns. This becomes harder when you're actively punished for your death in a manner that can stick with you for a while.But that doesn't deter from the awesome combat system though! Every single little bit of Dark Souls seems to be built around the combat. Every single boss is combat focused, when you explore the inevitable thing thats going to be in the way of your progress is enemies that you almost always have to fight, And all of your stat building and upgrades are inevitably going to be focused on fighting enemies. It is very good then, that the combat system is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. It has this real weight to it that encourages timing and precision. It rewards patience and punished rash decisions. A lot of times the mentality of ""Just one more hit,"" can either land you a close victory or a humiliating defeat.The exploration is also nice. With plenty of hidden areas to find if you're willing to stray off the beat and path.All in all this game is great, and while i dont condone the practice of making an HD remaster of it this soon (This being the upcoming redux version From Software are planning) This game is still amazing. Buy it if you can't wait, get the hd remaster once it comes out in the other case.			"

With his own Story and Location all of this is completely new. The Matchmaking is in my eyes better as in the first Dark Soul. The graphics are very good and are....smoother as in the first one...what i like more because it's nicer to look with the eyes.fact Dark Souls will be ever the best Game for Soul's fans but for newcomers too it's a good game but what i missed is....it was not really difficult what makes me a bit sad 'cause the first one was Hard as hell maybe it is because i played the first one i don't know but nevermind it is a very good and nice game and for me a s a Soul's fan it is a Great game10/10      ""Only the death can rule your acting.""

												I'm no professional reviewer, but this game deserves all the recommendations I can give.  This game is one of the best RPG's I've ever played, it has a very dark storyline that you actually have to discover and deduce instead of having it explained through cutscenes.  Each item connects to Drangleic or possibly to what existed before Drangleic.  The combat system is phenomenal, with a variety of attack patterns.  Besides the occasional hit box flaw, the combat is solid, and when you die (which happens many, many times) usually its just because of a dodge instead of a block or another fixable solution for the next time you face the enemy or trap. Another great mechanic is the game's innovative multiplayer, although being killed by a PVP oriented player is a little annoying, the invasion into your game works flawlessly to just create another obstacle to overcome.  The arena mode lets all the PVP players test their builds or gloat about them, and the Co-op is wonderful for anyone needing a little help from friends on an area or two.Even though the PC controls aren't the best, From did a good job on the port and as long as a controller is used there's definitely no difficulty playing this game.While this is a very challenging game, it's also very rewarding and were I not so busy my time on this game would easily be quadrupled, definitely recommended for anyone who wants a challenging, rewarding RPG with some deep, dark lore.

												A week before Dark Souls II's release date, I picked up Dark Souls I to prepare myself for the sequel. Dark Souls is now one of my favorite games of all time, and is one of the best RPGs out there right now. I poured hour after hour into that game. What makes Dark Souls so good? The world is beautiful, the atmosphere is incredible, the combat is smooth and challenging, the bosses are intimidating, the lore is amazing, but overall, it's rewarding. When you finally defeat a boss, you get an incredible sense of accomplishment. Every boss is incredible. The story-telling is amazing, in that there IS not story-telling. You don't get 10 minute cutscenes stuffing the story in your face. You get the story from your surroundings, from item descriptions, from lines that the NPC's say. The community pieces it all together and you get a beautiful story with lots of detail. The world felt connected; there were more than just one way to get to a location, and the game forced you to travel on your feet. Later in the game you get the ability to fast travel between bonfires which is awesome because by the time you learn the ability to do so, the world is huge and it would take forever to walk the whole way from A to B, but before you learn the ability there is no need for it. Also bonfires were few, so getting to one gave you this incredible sense of accomplishment. The world mattered.Now enough about Dark Souls, let's talk about Dark Souls II, and why it was a disappointment. I'll just list all of my complaints I had with the game. I'll start with who made Dark Souls II. The director for Demon Souls and Dark Souls is NOT the same director for Dark Souls II. It's a different person, which explains a lot of things. Let's talk about the bosses. They were a HUGE disappointment. They were easier than typical mobs in the first Dark Souls... For almost all the bosses, the typical strategy for killing the boss was: strafe, hit legs a couple times, dodge, repeat. A lot of the bosses were just copy and paste of bosses from the first Dark Souls. One was a literal copy and paste of Ornstein, and the rat boss you fight is just Sif in rat form. The final boss was a joke; it was one of the easiest bosses in the entire game. The final boss of the first Dark Souls was incredible! The beautiful music gave me such a chill during the fight. Dark Souls gave me an incredible feeling of accomplishment when YOU DEFEATED a boss (dark souls joke lol), and I got a different incredible feeling with Dark Souls II bosses; boredom.Bonfires are EVERYWHERE, and I... mean... everywhere... They are scattered all over the damn game it's rediculous, and you can teleport between bonfires right from the start! There's a section of the game where you walk out of a dungeon and appear in what looks like a fallen city, filled with giant warriors. You walk accross the bridge, and you see a bonfire to your right. Awesome! Checkpoint! moving on. You kill about 5 of the giants, and you walk down some stairs and see a fog gate. You pass through, and a bossfight happens. Defeat the boss, and there's a bonfire up above. Another bonfire? That was quick. backtrack a bit, go up a drawbridge, defeat another boss, and there's a third bonfire down some stairs... This is all within 2 minutes of eachother. You can literally see one of the bonfires from another bonfire...The NPCs are next. This will contain spoilers for the NPC's in Dark Souls I and II, so if you don't wanna know what happens to them, don't read...... ok moving on. The NPCs in DS had personality. Each one of them was different, and each one of them did something. The lore in DS was incredible, and each NPC was tied to it in some way, and each one had an interesting back story to them. There is a location in DS where most of the NPCs go when you find/save them, but as you progress through the game, they leave, and eventually, you find them... hollowed. and they turn on you. and try to kill you. Your friend who has been with you from the beginning, or your trainer who has taught you spells, or just a clumsy friend you found on your journey, they all die, and you are forced to kill them or you may die as well. 1 or 2 live, but only with your help. This adds to the feel of the game that nothing and nowhere is safe, and you will miss each NPC that dies, because you liked those guys, they were your friends. In DSII, NPCs have no personality, and I didn't care about any of them. If you find one on your journey, and you exhaust their dialogue, they will end up in the central hub area, where they NEVER LEAVE. They sit in that ONE area, never moving, and using the same 2 or 3 lines of dialogue whenever you talk to them... OH I HAD GIVEN YOU UP FOR DEAD gets old after the 2nd time I hear it, let alone after the 300th... they have 0 personality... One or two give you a sob story about how their life is hard, but it was hard to care about them at all. Also, the mob placement... the mob placement is just randomized nonsense. Dark Souls at least put thought into where they placed enemies. The placement of enemines in II makes no sense, they're just kind of thrown into the game with zero thought.The combat suuuuucks. At least for PVP, the combat is disgusting, and is in no way fun at all. The dodge roll is broken in this game. Rolling will save you from literally anything in this game, but only if you've thrown a ton of points into ADP. Don't have ADP? Have fun dying every two seconds. If you DO have lots of it, you're essentially a god. A lighting bolt coming at your face? roll! a sword about to cut you in half? roll! Being enveloped in a poisonous cloud? ROLL! I was challening a lighting spear and was prepairing to throw it at an enemy, and the enemy ran at me. At the last second, he rolled, but he rolled towards me. But by the time he rolled, he was already right in front of me, so he basically just rolled in place. The lighting bolt passed RIGHT THROUGH HIM! It pierced his torso and went right through him. Rolling should NOT make you invulnerable to everything, but IT DOOOOES, which is rediculously stupid. I'm not kidding when I say, if you are about to take damage from any source, press the roll button and you'll be k. Even if you don't include rolling among the problems with the combat, there are still lots more. Back stabbing is so weak in this game and just doen't work half the time, parrying feels horrible and unresponsive, and sometimes weapons will forget how long they are, and you will get stabbed from 20 feet away or you WONT get stabbed from 2 inches. The combat is clunky at best. Magic is broken. Not overpowered broken, but literally broken. You can be killed in one shot by magic, and there are so many stupid spells that have odd or nonexistant hitboxes (Lighting spears sometimes hit when they were fired in the opposite direction, or just no where near you) that you would THINK that it is overpowered. but it is also underpowered as well, because you just have to press the roll button as a soul spear pierces your heart and you'll be juuuust fine.The atmosphere is nonexistant. you have the ability to warp from the beginning of the game, which takes away from the feel of the game. Also, there are places in the game that, once you pass through it, you may never come back to it again. Even in the late game of Dark Souls I would find myself going back to the beginning places, but in this game there is no need.The problem I have with Dark Souls II is that... basically it's just not a real Souls game. If you don't compare it to any of the other Souls games, than Dark Souls II would be an mediocre game with a few problems. But if you DO compare it to any of the other Souls games, then Dark Souls II would be a horrible game with a lot of problems.Every time I open this game up, thinking I was a bit too harsh, thinking that maybe there is a good game somewhere in this ♥♥♥♥, I become disappointed. Every single time.			"

												Did you like Dark Souls 1? You thought it was a rad game despite its pretty numerous flaws? Well you'll be glad to hear that Dark Souls 2 adds even more flaws onto the pile while simultaneously taking all the cool enjoyable stuff that made the first game worth playing and throwing them in a fire!What a pile of tripe. At best, buy it when it drops down to bargain bin price; a game worth 50 bucks, this is not.			"

												Dark Souls 2 has an undeniable charm to it. The game is squarely aimed at a younger demographic with cuddly Undead that inhabit the land and cartoonish character-style and voices. Yet, the game design hits at something that can't be outgrown: the joy of discovery. That is, perhaps, the best way to describe From Softwares new gem.Dark Souls 2 also culls from so many different ideas that it is hard to succfinctly explain what the point of the game is. The Chink developer's elaborately woven and complex endeavor brings great depth to the normally pallid kid genre, and that's part of what makes Dark Souls 2 such a great game. Despite ample room for improvement, this is easily one of the best titles, if not the best, From Software game since The Adventures of Cookie & Cream.Part The Sims, part Animal Crossing and part Skyrim Difficulty AND part Rocko's Quest, Dark Souls 2 stands alone as a deep and engaging title on PC, fully accessible to people of all ages. To describe the game, we'll start from the beginning. The game kicks off by providing you with a ♥♥♥♥-riddled Corpse and tasks you with shaping the land using a sword. The point? To attract undead ♥♥♥♥ heads, each with chuckle-inducing names that are all candy and sweet-themed. Like real-life dead people, these undead have preferences for what retard they want to ♥♥♥♥ on.All and all Dark Souls 2 gets my bad ♥♥♥ seal of APPROVAL!!!! making this one of the worst games ive played to date 6/10 Sub-par.

												Buy Dark Souls (one) instead of this.While it runs better (no lags*) in a technical way, ist kinda ugly in its arrangement.While there are some beautyful disigned place, most spots are ugly as N64 Games.There is a forrest where they used the same texture over 10 km² (feels like).You realy start feeling the tunnels leading you throu the game.But Charactermodels are just fine.Now lets get to the gameplay, which realy lets me get angry and sad.Angry because the best (swearword of your choice) way to kill 95% of your enemies is to use a ranged weapon (bows, crossbows magic stuff) or circling around them for 10 minutes until they fail to hit your shield!Angry because Hitboxes (in wich they hit YOU!) and attacks of Bosses doesent make sense, you cant dodge most of them and some of them kills you allmost instandly, pointles how much armor you are using, most enemies kill you with 2-3 hits (doesent matter how small or big the enemies are). Also the windows between hughe enemies combos is that small, that you will be luky to get as least one hit. (if not unsing ranged weapons) Angry because poise doesent work the same way as in DSI. You can have the highest poise possible an one hit with a (swearword of your choice) Sword ist enough to interupt the swing of your 200 kg Hammer swing or any other activity.Angry because i need a stat for drinking my estus flask an doge an enemies attack properly (what doesent work in most cases)Angry  because 90 % of your enemies will be huge (you 2-5 times) humanoids like:tall knights, taller golden knights, giant knights, other giant knights, taller giant knights, lions with axes and shileds, giants  who shot magic with goblins(?) on their back, elephat giants with halberds, fatty guys with giant scythes, blue skinned guy with spears. huge pyromats with machetes on a long stick, giant hippos who will chew you to death immediatly, as well as skinny long armours with very long hammers and shields, tall witches and allmost every boss in the game.Angry because they all play the same way, circiling around and bla....Im angry because i cant do a fast roll!And im getting sad when i realize that all this was way better in DS I !Better do as i said first...(Forgive me if i spelled something wrong or so, english is not my first language) "

												I give it 6/10. If you're like me, and you adored Dark Souls 1, you are probably going to be disappointed by this game. It's a mostly regurgitated mess with bland level design, bland enemies, bland bosses, bland combat variety, and absolutely zero of the magnificent atmosphere that got my ♥♥♥♥ hard with DS1. Maybe it's all a matter of taste, but I played around 20 hours and defeated several bosses and not ♥♥♥♥ing once did I feel any sort of sense of accomplishment or excitement. I felt absolutely nothing but a tiny seed of disappointment planted after I swept through the forest of undeads level and defeated the last giant that only grew with time. I quit playing this after 10 hours or so and went back to DS1 to see if maybe it is very similar and I've just become a cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but nay, I still enjoy the everloving ♥♥♥♥ out of DS1 and put a good 20 hours into it before unehthusiastically dragging myself back to the bowl of plain grits that is DS2. I tried to like this game, I wanted nothing more than to enjoy it like I did its predecessor, I wanted to love it. But no matter how much I let slide, how much I just marked up as 'different' instead of downgraded, I just couldn't enjoy this game. It is a downgrade. It is nothing but a 'Call of Duty' style sequel that has none of the magic you fell in love with, it is, and I apologize for the pun, soulless. And if you want to kid yourself into liking it because you just want another ♥♥♥♥ing dark souls game, I beseech of you, cease such blind actoins. If we praise this game out of blind nostalgia boners, they are going to vomit up another bland mess of uninspired bile for DS3. TL;DR: I don't like it. It isn't a true sequel, it isn't even a good effort. To each his own, but mine is heartbreaking disappointment.  "

												Dark Souls is definitely a game of great difficulty for a player who is not well prepared or familiar with the game. The game offers a very interesting storyline as well as an addictive urge to come back for more. Well in all honesty, most of your first playthrough of the game will be spent screaming and raging at the countless amount of deaths you'll be facing, as death is inevitable with this game. Dark Souls isn't all that difficult once you become familiar with the games concepts and item locations, but either way it can still provide you with a decent challenge! The game overall was a beautiful creation and it deserves all the praise and reputation it has. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who awaits a challenge and has the time to sink a decent amount of hours into it! 10/10 Praise the Sun!			"

												This game is the epitome of Filth! I must say i liked it a lot first. After i needed to pay more for the dlcs as for the game itself (which was the first alert that Fromsoft got moneyhungry) I got a little suspicous. But after hundrets of ours of PVP, my view changed drasticaly. Unbalanced Weapons and Spells, Soul Memory distroyed every fair Competition, the worst netcode i had the pleasure to witnes. But all of that would have been bearable, but then, ""it"" came. The announcment, that this game will be ""re-released"" in a ""HD"" version on for PS4, Xbone and PC, with all the dlcs included. What does that mean? That means if you want to have the full experience of the ""new game"", you need to buy it again. Yes, you have to pay the same ♥♥♥♥ing game again, to enjoy the ""updates""(yes, these are not enhancments but just updates and a version, that has been promised to us in the first place.) For PS3 and Xbox360 owners, they are screwd. No update, no HD version on their console so they are stick to the 60$ ""beta"". I`m soo disgusted, that is unbelieveble. I uninstalled the game, took it, broke the CD in millions of pieces, burned the manual, and threw it away. I will never buy  something from Fromsoft again. This Company has fallen so low, rob their fans and buyers of their money, just disguting marketing strats to fill their filthy pockets. Dont support this behavior, dont buy anything from them. They need to understand that these kind of actions are not tolerated.			"

												I can't even begin to explain how disappointing this game was.From Software, all you had to do was fix connecting to other players, and add proper 60FPS to the game. Not only are those things STILL broken, and not to mention we learn more and more every day about how terrible the implementation of 60fps is in the game, but you also had to ruin almost everything else that made the original game fun.The near perfect hitboxes of the first game? Completely gone, and now you can guarantee dying every so often for the dumbest things.The fair balance of rolling? Also gone. It baffles me how any developer could think that tying i-frames to a stat was a good idea. The point of having a fixed amount of i-frames was so players could actually GET GOOD at dodging and KNOWING when they would be invincible during a roll instead of having near-zero invincibility at low levels and then having a hard time to adjust once they did have a good amount of i-frames in their rolls.The realistic movement? Once again, gone. Welcome the new floaty movement that feels like you're always ice skating instead of walking on solid ground. Oh and also the way equipment weight affects movement is ridiculous as well, making you look like a bouncing balloon instead of an actual person.Now on to weapons. Not only have the movesets been worsened, but now it feels like you're swinging a foam sword instead of having any actual weight behind it. They clearly did not use mo-cap for this game, or in the case that they did use it, made  terrible use of its advantages.The world map makes no sense whatsoever, and the interconnectivity from the first game is non-existant. It's all straight pathways from now on. Not only this, but none of the areas are as good as the original game's environments. They are incredibly inconsistent and far from grounded and realistic.Alright, now the enemies. You thought it would get better from here in the review right? WRONG. Humanoids humanoids humanoids EVERYWHERE. No originality whatsoever. But that isn't a huge deal, you know what is though? The fact that the game throws wave after wave of AWFUL enemies in groups of 4 to 5 enemies at you because ""LEL DERK SULZ IS HERRRD"" instead of putting you against 1 or 2 difficult enemies that have interesting fighting styles. It also sucks that almost every single enemy in the game has a 'one-shot' move in which you get stuck in a dumb animation where all you'll find to say is ""How in the f*** did he grab me? I WAS 3 METERS AWAY!"". All in all your deaths from these enemies with the smarts of a zombie will always leave you flabbergasted as to how you actually died.Finally, the bosses. Ohhh how great it was when you first encountered O&S, and later when you fought Artorias. The bosses were hard at first, but all you needed to do was adjust to their attacks and switch up strategies. They had unique fight styles which engaged the players and every death felt like it was YOUR fault instead of leaving you screaming at the monitor about how unfair the Ancient Dragon's attacks are. But that's not it, the game applies the same logic to bosses that they apply to enemies. It's no longer a fair fight where you can focus on the boss. No. Now the game puts you against MORE than one boss at a time, all with their own ridiculous hitboxes just for your enjoyment. Oh, and they are almost all humanoids too, and none of them are remarkable from the rest.I could probably go into how terrible the lore and story is in Dark Souls 2, but I think just remembering how poor this game was has left enough disappointment in me for today.PS : Get gud casuls			"

												I was extremely excited to play this game due to it getting a LOT of love on the internet among hardcore gamers.Unfortunately, this is easily the laziest port that I have ever touched in twenty years of gaming. The control displays (when you find actions to interact with the environment) are built for an Xbox 360 controller. The PC controls are designed poorly, so poorly in fact that I found myself looking online for better options for re-binding them that were designed by a human being rather than whatever twenty fingered alien completed this port in a bar on Tatooine.Incredibly, the PC controls are so badly designed and overly complex that re-binding it becomes a kind of sudoku/puzzle game, because any change to one key inevitably overrides another action key that was already used for. Even the options menu to change key bindings uses the same dastardly Xbox 360 button displays - this goes beyond ridiculous, and would not have been excusable ten years ago, let alone in 2014.While I appreciate that buying an Xbox 360 controller fixes many of these issues, the one way you can guarantee you will anger your consumers is by selling a product that requires a peripheral and not advertising how important this peripheral is to being able to genuinely play the game. There are more than enough third person action games that you can play perfectly well on a keyboard and mouse, and this port was more than lazy, it was an insult to its consumers. Fans who defend the game on the basis that ""you should have a 360 controller anyway for other games"", actually: no. A good consumer would never support a bad port no matter how much you like the game at its core, if you do, you are nothing but a slave doing a company's PR work for it.The atmosphere and story of this game seem good and the graphics, though looking a bit dated, can be fixed with modding, but there is absolutely no gain in value for these traits if the control aspect is so badly designed. Dark Souls II remains nothing more than a pretty picture until I go pay MicroSoft for their (in my opinion) crappy controller. I have also seen from recent remarks on the reviews page that a new, Direct X 11 version of this game is coming out which will not be a free update for those who own this version of the game plus DLC. This, alongside an already terrible port which has been given zero care or love by its developers, is an abhorrent practice and I will be avoiding buying games made by this company in future if I see this ever again and strongly recommend doing the same.

												I wanted to love this game, but I can't.The game becomes more and more tedious the more I play. Not in a difficult way, but a boring way: -Rooms filled to the brink with ""hard"" ennemies.-Horrible level design on game scale and small scale : An elevator going up from a windmill goes in a volcano. Another one from a tower at sea level goes to an underground port at sea level too.  When you remember that all areas in Dark Souls blended perfectly into each other, it hurts a little.-I don't remember some areas. or how to access them.-Bonfires every steps.-Only low level areas are acessible at the beginning, when the one of the features of Demon/Dark Souls was access to a large choice of areas, letting the player choose his path and get better loot at low level.-Only low quality loot available at the beginning. Forcing players to use and upgrade equipments he doesn't want to use.-Limited upgrading until late-game. Upgrade materials are really rare and expensive and a certain item necessary to upgrade one of the blacksmith is only available near the late-game.-Quantity over quality : too many ennemies in a single area, too many bosses (some being copy or having the same moveset) in the game, adding minions in bosses fight (I'm looking at you Royal rat authority), too many bosses in the same fight (An early boss fight have 3 bosses, each one being difficult to deal with -Long range hard to dodge halberd sweeps-)-Story. What story ? You are undead, you jump in vortex and go search for BIGGER souls and a king. end of the story. Seriously.-NPCs : well uh, there is that girl who is an emerald Herald. What is an Emerald herald ? I don't know.  there's a scottish guy, a guy who sell ladders and the crestfallen warrior 2. I don't remember their names or their story. Except Gavlan. Gavlan is memorable.  With Gavlan, you wheel, you deal !-Invasions are non-existant. I have 40+h of playing at the time i'm writting this and I was invaded only one time.-Covenants : Boring. One is Gank in two small areas. Another is protecting some peoples against invaders. Invaders are farming duels so they can get limited-use items to invade. Sunbro are sunbro I guess.-Gameplay mechanics are really a downgrade from the other games. hitboxes are Xbox huges, poise... how do poise even works in that game ?-AI is horrible, pathfinding ♥♥♥♥ed up, some ennemies don't even move when attacked. -Ranged attacks and magics overshadow melee. -Game has no atmosphere. No memorable musics either.Too many other things I could tell, but don't want.  Like i don't want to finish the game because it bores me. I am disappointed.Really disappointed. "

												Look I know poeople rate this game very highly, but consider my review first. I have reached over level 100 on multiple characters but no matter how much you play you always run into the same issue: ""what do I do now?!"" I guarantee you will not be able to complete the game without looking up forums that tell you to only visit certain areas when you have some arbitrary number of souls or revisiting areas that previously seemed pointlessly dead-ended with not so much as a hint that anything should or can happen to obstacles. Sure the gameplay is on the ""hardcore"" side, but the story progression goes far beyond ""challenging"" into ""obnoxious"" territory. If you want to spend hours wandering aimlessly wondering what to do or if you want to spend just as much time on a forum as you do playing the game, I recommend playing Darksouls II. To be clear, the difficulty of darksouls likely won't keep you from beating the game, it's the complete lack of direction and progression.			"

												HUGE EDIT: Killed the Ancient Dragon before talking to him. Didn't drop ashen heart. Character is now locked and 140 hours of play wasted. THE FACT THIS IS A THING REALLY TICKS ME OFF.I just can't recommend this game. I am a fan of Souls, I even played DeS until I got three characters to 712, a third to 650, and a fourth to 475, without using an exploit. I didn't get a whole out of DaS1, but it was still a very fun game and even felt innovative with what it was doing with DeS's foundation.DaS2 is pretty broken. it feels a lot like it's ♥♥♥♥-riding Demon's while not quite understanding what made Demon's good. If I had to guess, I would say that From is just obligated to make hard games. DaS2 is very easy to cheese every enemy, while if you are brave enough to play normally; you'd quickly find that (at least on the PC version), enemies can do some real bullcrap[giant.gfycat.com] things.On top of enemies being rather broken, this game uses frames as a timer for how things work. For example, more frames your weapon is in an enemy, the more durability damage it takes. Since DaS2 isn't moving faster in real time while at 60fps, your weapon takes twice as much durability damage potentially, when compared to 30fps. Also your rolls will have a tendancy to not work properly (Jumping can work pretty reliably though), and just simple button inputs can be buggy when at 60fps. Like.. I have a huge delay before I start sprinting, but locking to 30fps fixes that and it is really annoying.Bad port issues aside; Is the game good on its own merits? Well... I had some fun, but spells don't feel particularly well balanced post mid-game, the +10 mundane dagger is rather overpowered for backstabs, and a lot of the gear people use seems to constantly be hit and miss.Enviroments feel uninspired and very classic high-fantasy. They are not much different in idea in comparison to Demon and DaS1, but the issue is that the other two games were consistant with the paths. In Demon, you go to a storm temple, you finish at a storm temple (with a rather awesome air based boss). In DaS2, you start at a mountain side at night, end up at a mountain full of poison at day, then a windmill tower filled with poison, then you finish in a volcano. I suppose you can make the arguement that volcanos are toxic, but the lead-up to going into a volcano was non-existant and was really confusing.Have I mentioned that the AI is dumb as rocks? I think I have but I will reitterate:

												NOT RECOMMENDED, why? Take a look, oh god.Pvp: 2 / 10 - Unfair, unbalanced and the community just makes it worse.Community 1 / 10 - I've never met anyone who's actually into pvp for the fun. I feel like I am the only one testing out fun stuff, such as cosplaying, using ♥♥♥♥♥♥ or undervalued gear, etc. PvE: 5/10 - This really depends on what you're expecting from the game (I who prepurchased and all expected a good experience because the trailers/teasers were HYPE).Storyline: 6/10 - Although it's very very dull in comparison to the first two Souls games, it was still a good storyline, even though it has alot of flaws (which we are expecting to be fixed in the scholar update)Difficulty: 7/10 - I admit it, it's freaking easy in comparison to the other Souls games. However Dark souls 2 is not a easy game. There are still moments where I wanted to punch someone in the face, because of the frustration you get from dying over and over on the same map. Progress: 9/10 - This is very good, actually. I have nothing negative to say about the progress in dark souls 2, maybe except for it being very very similar (maybe too similar?) to the dark souls 1 method. I bought this for the anticipation of the story (which was rather dull in comparison to dark souls 1 and Demon's Souls), and of coursely the pvp. The pvp is total garbage, and the community even worse. For some strange reason Fromsoft does not know how to balance things. I personally think it's because they're not playing the game in the pvp aspect itself. First of all, we've got poise. What is poise? It prevents you fm staggering (getting stunned) by enemy attacks. The poise in this game is by far one of the worst things ever created by fromsoft. I have full havels (which is recognized as THE ARMOUR OF POISE) plus the ring of giants, which makes me even more unstoppable with more poise. Anyhow, some random dude comes by and stabs me with a cute knife, right? So I start swinging to hit him and disrupt his timing etc. But what do you know? One small stab from a knife stunned me into a combo of 4-5 hits before I could move... Then we have armour, which basically does nothing in this game. I've hit a full havels with my smelter sword (doing a cosplay, ehh) for straight 600, while I can manage up to 800-934 on dudes with nothing but a skirt. Point being that havels HELMET weight more than the entire dude with a skirt, whom I hit for 934. This is not balanced. Armour or not should actually make a difference, especially when the poise system is total garbage.If you compare this game to it's prequel, you'd puke. If you compare this game to other SINGLEPLAYER Action RPGs (solely for the offline pve experience) it is actually a good game to pick up. The problem is, that it is a sequel and it will be compared to its prequel, that is just how the gaming world goes around. This game costs too much (with the DLCs being overpriced), and it does not deliver enough for it's potential. The souls franchise' future depends on two things, which is the Scholar update (which is already looking pretty bad, after reading patch notes) and Bloodborne (which is personally my only reason for still believing that From might fix their games) .K I'll stop.

												Dark Souls II is a really good game, but it does not live up to the lofty standards of the Souls series. My main gripe with it is that the enemy placement feels very lazy. Instead of crafting a level with enemies placed to create memorable fights and interesting challenges, the devs often throw far too many enemies (all of the same or similar type) into a long hallway just before a boss in attempt to seemingly make that section of the game ""harder"". It's tedious, frustrating, and just not very much fun. I also think the world itself feels like it's lacking a lot of the polish and depth that previous games had. The way areas are connected together often doesn't make any sense at all. There are some very beautiful looking areas, however, so I guess it's forgivable to some extent.One other problem I have with the game is that the boss fights are just... brutally unfair at times, just for the sake, again, of feeling ""hard"". Demon Souls had two boss fights that incorporated multiple enemies (three if you want to count the Storm King I guess). Dark Souls had five (if I remember correctly). Dark Souls II has like... twelve multiple enemy boss fights. It's freaking ridiculous. All it does is drive players to do more co-op rather than grind it out and learn how to take the bosses out themselves. If there is any word I could use to describe Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 it would be ""Fair"". Despite being challenging those games were, for the most part, very balanced and fair. If you died it was on you. Dark Souls II feels very unfair a lot of the time.I'm not much of a PVP player, but to those who play the Souls games for the PVP I would warn you about Soul Memory. It is a system meant to stop experienced players from grabbing late game weapons with a low level build, spending all the souls on leveling up the weapons, and invading new players to kill them over and over again. I guess it works for that purpose, but once you reach Soul Memory 1,000,000 you're basically free game to be invaded by anyone of any level. This means if you want to stick to a SL150 build and play with others who adhere to that SL limit, you can still be invaded by a SL450 player. This can make match making really unfair and frustrating.Aside from those problems though, which are admittedly big flaws, the game is a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it for the most part. Also, the first DLC showcases some of the best level design in the whole series. Definitely grab the DLC if you can, it's awesome... even if the boss fights are still brutally unfair.3.5/5			"

												Much has been said about the difficulty of the Dark Souls series. For many it's the main draw of the franchise, and those people might be disappointed that Dark Souls 2 is the easiest of the three. That is not to say that the game is in any way easy, though. It is, however, much more accessible for newcomers, and that makes it the best Souls game yet.For those who can look past the game's clunky user interface and the less-than-ideal control scheme for mouse and keyboard, a brilliant action RPG of unparalleled depth and complexity awaits. From Software once again manages to deliver a beautiful and mysterious world to explore, filled with interesting and complex characters to meet and befriend.. or behead.To me, Dark Souls 2 is the finest entry in a franchise that has already rewritten video game history, and this latest entry in the franchise is worthy of its legacy. It will break you, and you will love it. It will teach you, and you will learn. This is the Dark Souls way.Bearer of the curse.. the kingdom of Drangleic beckons for its next monarch.			"

												Like its predecessor, Dark Souls II adds meaning to its experience by having strict consequences. You cannot take enemies lightly. Even the easiest monster in the game remains a threat throughout. A dark corridor may bring swift death if you run in screaming “YOLO”. And yet in spite of seeming so rigid and punishing, Dark Souls II is fun. At the start, you create a character from a selection of archetypes. You can be a spellcaster, or a swashbuckler, or someone that likes to hold giant swords in each hand. You could even go weaponless, there is much power in pugilism. You start off weak, with low values that represent the many aspects of your character, like how much health you have, how fast you are, how much equipment you can carry, and so on. As you explore and kill monsters, you’ll gain Souls: a precious commodity that is used to improve the stats of your choosing. But until you spend these Souls at a specific place, they’re at risk. If you get killed, you’ll respawn at the last bonfire you touched, but the Souls you’ve collected have dropped where you died. You’ll need to go fetch them without dying, or risk losing them. It sounds harsh, but it adds excitement. Do you press on, or play it safe and go back?You’re not alone in Dark Souls II. If connected to the internet, you can occasionally see the ghosts of other players around you. Players can leave each other messages in the ground, helpful tips, inspiration, or deception. By placing special Summon Signs, you can be asked to assist another player in their copy of the world, or bring players to yours. You might even get invaded by another player who’s only goal is to kill you. There are a lot of complex systems at work governing this “ambient multiplayer”. Players can even join special Covenants that are worked into this system tightly. If you join the Blue Sentinels, you’ll be automatically summoned to aid a player who’s been invaded. Players looking to help others fight bosses can join Heirs of the Sun. More eclectic Covenants include the Bell Keepers, who exist only to hinder other players from ringing a bell in a specific area. Or the Rat King Covenant whose members guard a crypt full of traps.If you’ve heard about the series’ alleged difficulty, it might sound strange to refer to it as “fun”. Often, those who tried the games and found them too hard, accuse those who do like them of being masochists. But that’s a shallow viewpoint. The Souls series became popular not only by being good, well-designed games. It’s just that, with much of the modern hand-holding in games, many have forgotten (or have yet to realize) that failing, challenge, and figuring things out is fun. Dark Souls II isn’t even that hard by classic game standards. There are some big franchises from the  PlayStation 2 era that can make a grown man cry. Dark Souls II, and its brethren, were made in spite of today’s push in gaming to make sure the player is having fun, long before giving them any challenge. While this tactic does work, especially with the easily amused, it devalues the experience somewhat. By contrast, Dark Souls II does not talk down to the player. It expects them to be intelligent, patient creatures that are interested yet cautious. There is an incredible thrill in exploring the unknown, of being afraid of what might lurk around the corner. But you need to experience that for yourself to feel it. You can be told what skydiving is like, but that will never be the same as actually jumping out of a plane. The only real barrier to having fun in Dark Souls II is impatience.Even though it is conceptually more refined than the first game, Dark Souls II was released too soon it seems. It needed more time to cook in the oven. There are technical inconsistencies, like framerate issues, though nothing as bad as Blighttown from Dark Souls. There were cutbacks to the new game engine, specifically, the much-touted lighting system. The lore is also more fragmented in its presentation. The first game had a carefully constructed silent narrative that led the player through it, where the environment worked in concert with precious descriptions found in talking to NPCs and on items. Dark Souls II has all of this, but it just isn’t as cohesive. You can make a story of it all, eventually, but it will forever remain open to interpretation.In spite of all this, it does improve on many of Dark Souls’ biggest flaws. The biggest single improvement being the “end game” of Dark Souls, which was rushed. The sequel has a better build up to its climax, with far more content after the first time the credits roll. This might be a bit of a spoiler, but it’s worth knowing. In the original, “New Game Plus” just upped the difficulty but in Dark Souls II, each successive New Game Plus remixes the game. It adds in new enemy placement, enemy types, and unlocks new weapons, gear and items to find. Combined with the Covenants being more in-depth and designed for long-term play, Dark Souls II has everything that matters where it counts. Even if the execution isn’t as good as it could have been.			"

												Gameplay - The gameplay takes all the great things from the original and makes them more refined and balanced, for the most part anyway. Rolling now actually requires skill rather than just rolling past everything, and it is assumed that you learn it to get far in the game at all, as the some of the most powerful attacks in the game can only be countered by doing so (Dark Magic, Great Hammers/Swords just to name a few). Where this game fails in some respects is the boss and enemy design. In the original there would be a few tough enemies in one area with heavy swings and low mobility, and the object of play was controlling their attacks and anticipating their next move, Dark Souls 2 seems to forget that this is where the combat system shines the brightest a lot of the time though, placing many enemies in one room just so they can stunlock you to death. And Bosses like the Royal Rat Vanguard and Belfry Gargoyles are just great bosses from the last game with a tonne more enemies shoved in for more artificial difficulty. This is my main gripe with the game, most of it isn't skill, it is just waiting until a set of enemies have completed their attack animations and taking a few safe hits in the downtime between the next (An example of this would be the set of three knight enemies in Heides Tower of Flame). This doesn't play to the strengths of the combat system and makes the game less fun overall. Speaking of boss designs, most bosses are predictable, humanoid Strafe/Roll fests with little to no substance, the ones that aren't are usually filled to the brim with enemies. Usually. There is one boss encounter that is true genius, and he is optional and out of the way for no particular reason, Darklurker. This boss is brilliant, seemingly easy at first, he has slow, easily dodgable attacks with long windups, but then, he suddenly splits into two. And usually this would be a problem like a said before, having you wait out his attacks and such but not this time around, it turns into a beautiful almost dance-like pattern that takes much more skill than most bosses to complete. This is how the whole game should have been structured, but it seems to have fallen off mark. That said, it was still thoroughly enjoyable and i would recommend an all-bosses run to anyone with the time, you get this game for the gameplay. Thank god it is good. Score: A-Story - The story is an abstract piece to many people. Instead of the game just outright telling you the legends of people and places, you are meant to piece together it's tale using a plethora of techniques, in-game descriptions for items, talking to people and the environment being just a few of the ways you can go about it. The game begins with a short cutscene of your player being told that you are cursed, that your timelines and sense of self will have no meaning, that you will become a wretched hollow come time past, and that you will ""stand before it's decrepit gate without really knowing why"". These things are left as speculation for the player for the most part. And are never answered directly, adding to the nature of the game. While it isn't the best story for your main character it is passable, but the legends and stories of people scattered across the land are really where the brilliance is at. Score: BControls - Ahh controls. The first game was a horrible port to PC, suffering disgusting mouse issues, keyboard mapping not working most of the time, and just being a disgusting experience without a gamepad. Dark Souls 2 addresses the most major problems, but still leaves a few glaring issues. The mouse is actually amazing this time around, working like you would expect. The movement can be done fully with WASD and sprinting by pressing X. The only problem with playing with the mouse is that there is major lag when attacking, being as the two attacks for each hand are mapped to the same mouse button. Thankfully, all of these problems can be fixed with a script you can find on the PC Gaming Wiki, you can even edit the prompts to show PC buttons in place of Xbox buttons. While it isn't as easy to setup a M+KB with this game, it is definitely not a disadvantage once you set up the scripts. Gamepad controls are the same for the most part, with a few minor changes to make movement easier. You can now sprint up ladders by holding B, slide down ladders with the same button, and if you really want to, completely let go of the ladder and fall by double tapping B. Jumping has been changed to L3, and this is for the better, as in the last game triple tapping B was extremely unwieldy, and lead to many a death. All in all, great controls, but could have done a little better with Keyboard and Mouse bindings. Score: B+Sound - The game was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, the man behind games like Braverly Default, Golden Sun and Kid Icarus: Uprising, and it shows. The game is filled to the brim with memorable themes and soft tunes while on your journey, making for a truly brilliant game to listen to. Themes to look out for are Majula main theme, Flexile Sentry boss theme and Tower Knight theme. Nothing much else to say really, brilliant sound design all around. Score: B+Multiplayer - I felt this needed it's own segment because it is extremely important, for PVE, you summon phantoms to help you on your journey, this can make many bosses trivial by splitting the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s up, I recommend playing through the game once without summoning anyone, as it ruins the difficulty. But it is overall fine and has no massive issues. PVP on the other hand.. It honestly depends on the time of day or the weather or how the game feels most of the time. Getting lagstabbed is extremely common and is not fun to fight against. There is a region setting, but it is literally 'Japan' and 'Not Japan', making many of your fights a battle of who can lag the hardest and backstab the other first. If you want this game for the PVP, get it on consoles. Because the matchmaking for PC is atrocious, FROM should be ashamed that they shipped the game like this for PC. Not to mention a cancer that plagues everyone, Soul Memory. Soul Memory means that builds become complete meaningless, where in the original many people would limit themself to Soul Level 125 to keep challenge in the PVP, that doesn't matter anymore. If you have a high enough soul memory you will get people wearing the best armor, best weapons and people that have to ability to use every spell in the game. This needs to be fixed with the new DLC or something, because right now going into areas such as the Bell Tower are bound to get you killed by lag. Score: DOverall, it is a great game with amazing gameplay, but if you have to choose between this or the first one, get the first one. Dark Souls 2 just doesn't live up to it's name. If you play DaS1 and want some more action do get this though, as it is still a brilliant game. Final Score: B-			"

												If you are looking for an easy experience, a game you can run through with ease, then this game is not for you. You will die. A lot. And it feels like a fresh break from the more casual games that are coming out these days, and a throwback to the challenging old school games, like Ninja Gaiden, where you learned from death and victory wasn't assured.Many people were worried that Dark Souls II would be a lot more casual than its predecessor, and I can assure you, it's not. It manages to be just as challenging, while still being more accessible for beginners. There are changes that make the game more convenient, such as bonfire teleportation from the beginning of game. Combat in the game is improved, and is as fun as ever. One thing I wasn't a fan of was the large enemy mob encounters. Encountering groups of large enemies is more irritating than challenging, causing the player to go out of their way to use tactics they normally wouldn't. The boss fights are unique, and are some of the coolest parts of the game. Unlike the first, I played through the entire game with keyboard + mouse, definitely and accomplishment for a Souls game, the graphics are also massively improved.The story is great, although it doesn't pop out at you, but that doesn't matter in a game that is based so strongly on gameplay. The story lies in the lore of the world. While it definitely isn't as good as in the original, the world connects in interesting and cool ways.Covenants are expanded in such great ways and make the multiplayer a strong point of the game. PvP is very, very fun, although the hitboxes and connection keep it from being perfect. With the improvement of online play also comes the improvement of co-op (Sunbros rejoice!)While better than and worse than the first game in certain aspects, it is a highly rewarding blast of a game that will challenge you, and give you hours of fun. 10/10 from me.

												I had heard horror stories about the difficulty of the souls games so I d never picked one of these dark fantasy hack and slash before; I am glad I finally did, t is an excellent game. It is unforgiving but it has a great atmosphere and is clearly designed to reward exploration and persistence. The ramping up of difficulty of enemies means it is easier to play by venturing into the first part of areas, stopping when enemies level make it nightmarish, going into another area and coming back to progress in other areas after that. I am only 10 hours in but I am enjoying it a lot so far, and I am far from being good at it.The unforgiving nature of the game means that minor occasional flaws like hits not registering can be a bit infuriating, especially when it leads to losing a bunch of souls. But overall it works very well. Beating a boss after having died to it several times to figure its full range of moves and how to approach the combat (and also, to manage to execute the proper series of actions and reactions during the whole combat) gives a great feeling of achievement. Do not let the stories about the difficulty turn you away from this game. It is well worth a try if you like medieval action RPGs. It is tough but not impossible.			"

It took a little bit at first for me to get it running, if it crashes on start-up, don't worry too much. Check the forums, there are solutions.

												Loving this game. It is the pure, harsh fun we have come to love about the Souls series.I am mostly writing this to tell people not to worry too much about the ""HD remake"" that is coming out. Sure, if slightly better visuals are important to you, and playing with 1 or 2 more people online is a must, then there is nothing I can say really. Go ahead and wait for the remake to come out. However, I do believe that this business model is vile, and shouldn't be promoted. As such, I bought this version knowing there would be the remake in april, and I don't regret it for a second (also, there was a sale, weee!)Now, the game looks great already, there are a lot of people playing online, and we WILL get a patch that includes much of the new content and improvements. I can't recomend this game enough, and I can't advise to stay away from the remake enough either. Please, boycott the disgusting choice From has made here with releasing the same game again, and making it basicly separate from the original game. But again, if the features in the remake that we won't get in the original version are too appealing for you, then go ahead. If not, buy this great game now so you won't have to wait months to play a slightly better version.			"

Brutal and Rewarding. A true masterpiece.The Dark Souls series has become a well renowned game for a survival dark fantasy world. It has, in essence, become its very own genre that is hard to re-create. For single player experiences, it is hard to run around this unforgiving world without a little bit of help. In fact, your first achievement will likely be ""This Is Dark Souls"". A rude welcome as the only way to achieve it is to die. Not only can the environment be unforgiving, but monsters can, and will, be hidden. They will lure you into a false sense of security. This is best played online thanks to From Software's innovative online interaction system. Players have the ability to ""summon"" other players into their game by use of a sign. The cost of doing this though, is you have to be human. And if you are human, other players will invade you, and want to kill you for your souls. That is what this game is all about. The acquisition of souls. The lust for power. The greed. As a hollow, you become attracted to souls like a moth to a flame. Welcome to Dark Souls. Welcome to hell in its finest glory.			"

												One of the most enjoyable Dark Theme Action RPG on the year 2014, certainly recommended for mid-range PC which can handle perfectly games for DX9, i had personally enjoying exploring caves, deepened into dungeons, beat down to pulp of Enemies (as per orange messages on the floor though), intense Boss Fights. And Lore behind this game was Amazing, I'd say it less epic than Dark Souls: Prepare to die edition but it still great, and lore being narrated amazingly done by Youtuber 'VaatiVidya', if you love Souls series, try watches one or two of his videos. PC optimization was greater than Optimization DS: PTDE. Steady 60fps 1080p on mobile GTX 860M, Fluid control systems but the controller less effective for online PvP, it had slightly delay action button appeared on PvP. There are more Dungeons, caves, secrets lying on this game, just like on DS: PTDE, and farming system was replaced by 'bonfire ascetic' and more punishing curse to undead (if keep dying on game), then you have 2 options for remain on Human form (required DLC's season pass) and figure out yourself the other one.+ Game is Hard? Try Jolly Co-op (summoning)+ Intense Boss Fights and Rewarding Journey+ Enjoyable online session, PvP, PvE, Fight Club on Iron Keep.+ Gorgeous view on Landscape in game.+ Gavlan Wheel, Gavlan Deal    XD- Annoying Invader(online) on certain areas, Hit and Run like Casul.- PvP soul Memories player prove it imbalance.- require DLC's in order to acquire 'Special items'.- Bandai Namco Announced DS II: Scholar of The First Sin on DX11 pc (re-release) git gud.

												**This is a review in progress, and will be edited over time. I'm also a noob to the series and skipped the first game, so this is my first go at the series. I'm also basing my review on specific things that peaked my interest throughout my time with the game. More sections will be added and edited as I further my progression through the game. **Overall Score: 9 out of 10Story: The game opens with an interesting set of cutscenes which draws the player in right away. The story as a whole seems simple, but interesting enough to hold the attention of the player. It's good enough to peak my further interest into what becomes of my newly created hollow.**UPDATE** 3/9/15 - I recently completed the story, and I was a bit disappointed by the way the game ended, but I felt as though there was still plenty of incentive to go into NG+ or even make another character.Gameplay: You MUST use a controller to play the PC version of this game. I spent the first hour or so using my mouse and keyboard and man was it frustratingly hard. The game is very difficult, so prepare for ""rinse and repeat repitition."" You will die ALOT. The gameplay as a whole is very satisfying, and it feels good to kill an enemy. The game especially rewards you for beating bosses.*Update* for Gameplay: Now that I have a better idea of how to play the game, the gameplay is highly addicting and very fun. It takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it is really fun!Soundtrack: It is very good, and creates a very eerie atmosphere in the game. Because of the eeriness it adds to the amazing experience.Graphics: The graphics aren't anything mind-blowing, but they help add on to the environment and the overall experience. I run the game on my 4 year old laptop, and it runs at a steady 40-60 fps. The game appears to be intended for consoles, but the PC version is a good port. This game is a gameplay over graphics game, yet it still retains a nice pretty atmosphere.Noob Awareness: The developers of this game not once took in the idea of helping out players who are new to the game. No tutorial, no game tips (Although player tips are found everywhere), there's no babying involved in this game.*UPDATE* for noob awareness: It turns out that in the starting area of the game, there is boards with the controls on them and other tips.

												9/10. My only complaints go to the lore which feels slightly lacking, in comparasion to the original installment, as well as the fact that some covenants require ridiculous amounts of play to achieve the highest rank in (looking at you, BoB and BS). Also, the PvP is slightly unbalanced in some departments, but that will be patched very shortly.All in all, a really fantastic action-RPG. The difficulty is what makes the Souls games what they are, and DS2 delivers. While the difficulty at times might be a bit unfair, such as an enemy jumping down from a space you can't see originally, but most of the times it holds up to its predecessor. The difficulty is easily dispatched if you tread lightly and mind your surroundings. If a boss or an enemy has an attack which can kill you in one or two hits, it is a slow attack that can be avoided if you think quickly. If you mindlessly charge in you will rest-assuredly die a very painful death.The music and atmosphere is great. Most of the times, only bosses actually have music, and that is great. You know ♥♥♥♥'s about to go down. Besides, since the areas themselves do not have music, it becomes so much more atmospheric. You are constantly on your toes and any noise is more easily registered due to the lack of music.The character progression system (leveling up) is fantastic. You start as a stereotypical class - warrior, sorcerer, bandit etc, but after that, you can go whatever path you feel like. Spell-slinging, fragile caster with a massive two-handed sword? No problem! Backstabbing, stealthy dual-wielding assassin with full noisy plate mail? Sure, why not?Another strong point this game has which the original Dark Souls lacked is that this one has a much more open world. You can travel to two different areas right off the bat, and after a few minutes of saving souls, you can go to a third area. About 1/5 into the game, you can go to a fourth place. The end-game is rather linear, however, but that's only about 20% of the game. Besides, it would not really make sense to have the final areas be too open-ended, in my opinion.Player interaction is much more polished here. Compared to DS1, I very rarely encounter heavy laggers. There are covenants for all sort of player interaction - helping other players repel invaders, co-oping, invading other players, getting summoned to duel with a player 1v1, fight in arenas, etc etc. Some weapons are slightly on the strong side in PvP, but as I earlier stated, that is getting fixed in just a few days from when I am writing this.All in all, great game, great community.9/10, ♥♥♥♥ing buy it lol			"

I have loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of dark souls but this is seriously fuc*ing absurd and I will not be giving From any more of my money;  I encourage you to follow.

												Dark Souls 2 is a great game for people who like to face a real challenge.It does a lot things right which most sequels don't.Nowadays many game series turn into casual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because companies aim for the highest profit. The development of a game gets less and less time, games get published even in their alpha state. Thanksfully, Dark Souls 2 is not like that.The game keeps the strengths of its prequel. -Surviving in a cruel world in which almost everything can kill you. -Lots of different weapons, to find your own playstyle.-A interesting story with lots of secrets.-Bosses, who require tactics in order to kill them.

												So far my entire experience has been either a breeze or pure hell, no in between.The main game and lore is pretty good, the gameplay feels alot smoother than ds1 (also a whole lot less depressing, which i enjoy alot more) though i finished the game under 6 deaths on my first run.But what is a must buy for me, is the Old iron king dlc, 2-3 of the most diffcult and ♥♥♥♥ kicking bosses are in that 1 dlc, the whole dlc itself is pretty good aswell, really challenging on my first run.The dlc's will give u that real challenge you'd expect for the Ds games , fume knight will kill u so many times you'll remember that guy for the next couple of months.I give it a 8.5/10 cause of lag issue's, bad hitboxes on critical bosses and some bonfire points which spawn u near mob ganksquads all the time. All do-able but quite annoying.+ The people complaining that From screwed them over, yes they did, till a certain point. U still get the new update and all it's new things, the fixed Ds2. Unless u really care much about the 6 man pvp (just a havel, hexer and pyromancy ganksquad cluster ♥♥♥♥, so i srsly couldn't care less) and the improved graphics aren't much of a big deal either.

												By the gods this game is as difficult as I've heard. This doesn't mean it's cruel, it shows and teaches from your gameplay lessons you just don't get from some other hard games when you die. Your multiple deaths are either caused because you're stubborn and can't adapt or you just don't manage your resources (Stamina, Estus flask uses, gear, etc.) well enough to survive, you just can't hardhead your way through this game. It does sometimes frustrate you but that only means that you're not seeing the obvious, or that you're approaching the problem the wrong way. I'm definitely recommending this game to anyone who seeks something that doesn't hold your hand throughout the experience.PS. Use a controller, mouse and keyboard don't make the cut in this one...

												Like its predecessor, Dark Souls II adds meaning to its experience by having strict consequences. You cannot take enemies lightly. Even the easiest monster in the game remains a threat throughout. A dark corridor may bring swift death if you run in screaming “YOLO”. And yet in spite of seeming so rigid and punishing, Dark Souls II is fun. At the start, you create a character from a selection of archetypes. You can be a spellcaster, or a swashbuckler, or someone that likes to hold giant swords in each hand. You could even go weaponless, there is much power in pugilism. You start off weak, with low values that represent the many aspects of your character, like how much health you have, how fast you are, how much equipment you can carry, and so on. As you explore and kill monsters, you’ll gain Souls: a precious commodity that is used to improve the stats of your choosing. But until you spend these Souls at a specific place, they’re at risk. If you get killed, you’ll respawn at the last bonfire you touched, but the Souls you’ve collected have dropped where you died. You’ll need to go fetch them without dying, or risk losing them. It sounds harsh, but it adds excitement. Do you press on, or play it safe and go back?You’re not alone in Dark Souls II. If connected to the internet, you can occasionally see the ghosts of other players around you. Players can leave each other messages in the ground, helpful tips, inspiration, or deception. By placing special Summon Signs, you can be asked to assist another player in their copy of the world, or bring players to yours. You might even get invaded by another player who’s only goal is to kill you. There are a lot of complex systems at work governing this “ambient multiplayer”. Players can even join special Covenants that are worked into this system tightly. If you join the Blue Sentinels, you’ll be automatically summoned to aid a player who’s been invaded. Players looking to help others fight bosses can join Heirs of the Sun. More eclectic Covenants include the Bell Keepers, who exist only to hinder other players from ringing a bell in a specific area. Or the Rat King Covenant whose members guard a crypt full of traps.If you’ve heard about the series’ alleged difficulty, it might sound strange to refer to it as “fun”. Often, those who tried the games and found them too hard, accuse those who do like them of being masochists. But that’s a shallow viewpoint. The Souls series became popular not only by being good, well-designed games. It’s just that, with much of the modern hand-holding in games, many have forgotten (or have yet to realize) that failing, challenge, and figuring things out is fun. Dark Souls II isn’t even that hard by classic game standards. There are some big franchises from the  PlayStation 2 era that can make a grown man cry. Dark Souls II, and its brethren, were made in spite of today’s push in gaming to make sure the player is having fun, long before giving them any challenge. While this tactic does work, especially with the easily amused, it devalues the experience somewhat. By contrast, Dark Souls II does not talk down to the player. It expects them to be intelligent, patient creatures that are interested yet cautious. There is an incredible thrill in exploring the unknown, of being afraid of what might lurk around the corner. But you need to experience that for yourself to feel it. You can be told what skydiving is like, but that will never be the same as actually jumping out of a plane. The only real barrier to having fun in Dark Souls II is impatience.Even though it is conceptually more refined than the first game, Dark Souls II was released too soon it seems. It needed more time to cook in the oven. There are technical inconsistencies, like framerate issues, though nothing as bad as Blighttown from Dark Souls. There were cutbacks to the new game engine, specifically, the much-touted lighting system. The lore is also more fragmented in its presentation. The first game had a carefully constructed silent narrative that led the player through it, where the environment worked in concert with precious descriptions found in talking to NPCs and on items. Dark Souls II has all of this, but it just isn’t as cohesive. You can make a story of it all, eventually, but it will forever remain open to interpretation.In spite of all this, it does improve on many of Dark Souls’ biggest flaws. The biggest single improvement being the “end game” of Dark Souls, which was rushed. The sequel has a better build up to its climax, with far more content after the first time the credits roll. This might be a bit of a spoiler, but it’s worth knowing. In the original, “New Game Plus” just upped the difficulty but in Dark Souls II, each successive New Game Plus remixes the game. It adds in new enemy placement, enemy types, and unlocks new weapons, gear and items to find. Combined with the Covenants being more in-depth and designed for long-term play, Dark Souls II has everything that matters where it counts. Even if the execution isn’t as good as it could have been.			"

												After 160+ hours of logged gameplay, I can easily say this game is a well made sequel. Let that be a review in and of itself. Any game that gets you well into the triple digits is well beyond your money's worth and is testament to the game. I am going to say it's good, and on par maybe even slightly better than DS1. As a matter of fact, I am going to recommend this game obviously. If you read nothing else, know that I can tell you that you will get your money's worth. At the very least. And really, at the end of the day, I feel  that's what is most important when it comes to games. Value and replayability. As much as I loved the first one, I just fell in love with the new stuff that DS2 brings to the table. Also they made Caestus and fist based weapons viable. That alone pushes it a little bit ahead of DS1 in my opinion.I won't get into lore and other DS1 fans complaints. They aren't something I share and you can't really debate a subjective thing.TL;DR: It's a good damn game.  "

												I had heard horror stories about the difficulty of the souls games so I d never picked one of these dark fantasy hack and slash before; I am glad I finally did, t is an excellent game. It is unforgiving but it has a great atmosphere and is clearly designed to reward exploration and persistence. The ramping up of difficulty of enemies means it is easier to play by venturing into the first part of areas, stopping when enemies level make it nightmarish, going into another area and coming back to progress in other areas after that. I am only 10 hours in but I am enjoying it a lot so far, and I am far from being good at it.The unforgiving nature of the game means that minor occasional flaws like hits not registering can be a bit infuriating, especially when it leads to losing a bunch of souls. But overall it works very well. Beating a boss after having died to it several times to figure its full range of moves and how to approach the combat (and also, to manage to execute the proper series of actions and reactions during the whole combat) gives a great feeling of achievement. Do not let the stories about the difficulty turn you away from this game. It is well worth a try if you like medieval action RPGs. It is tough but not impossible.			"

												This is the ideal iteration for anyone who was waiting to jump aboard the “Souls” franchise funbus. Little do they know that funbus will soon crash into some statue of a bat-winged God and without a fragrant branch...well, it’s complicated. Honestly, this is one of the greatest, and truest, RPG experiences of all time. Combat is fun and engaging, the story hits peaks that are absurd, and the world is as diverse as it is massive. Dark Souls may have a different sense of “fun” than you’re used to, but once you start to love it and hate it and then love it right before hating it again, you’ll be too addicted to quit. There’s also a mini-game where you try to avoid smashing your keyboard, or controller, into plastic dust out of pure frustration. Then, of course, a part where your lungs have to evade inhaling any of that plastic dust or else they’ll turn inside out. It’s complicated – just keep rolling. Praise the sun.			"

												This game can be put in the Action-RPG genre.But a category has its limits. So let's describe it a bit more precisely.Dark Souls 2 puts you in the role of a lone adventurer thrown in a dark-fantasy world where dealing with pitfalls and enemies demand skill and reasoning. Combat is both stats-based and skill-based. Stats are leveled up with the same curency that weapons are bought and repaired with : souls dropped from monsters. The skill needed in combat and in navigating the terrain is one reason the game is regarded as a difficult one. The other is the punishing loss of all souls after an unsuccessful retrieval attempt. While enemies are usually tough and the world is at times tricky to navigate, the game does a good job of connecting you with hints and warnings of dangerous zones left by players who experience the same challenges in their parallel world. One can also stumble upon signs offering help for tough fights when certain conditions are met. The player who offered his help is then loaded into the host's world and can assist in the difficult boss fight.The game world is beautifully designed. Enemies and friendly characters are numerous and varied. They are believeable. The challenges are great. This is clearly an atmospheric game. There is also different player-vs-player features in the game. Fun challenges as they may be, these challenges can be alleviated with in-game choices. "

From Software has announced an upgraded, sort of game of the year edition that we will still have to pay for (and our saves will not tranfer to). This doesn't even make sense to me. Haven't they made enough money off of the pc community already? How many other games do you see with 26,000+ reviews? I have loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of dark souls but this is seriously fuc*ing absurd and I will not be giving From any more of my money;  I encourage you to follow.

												Dark souls 2 is a king among games 9/10 (which is very good from me). As the successor to dark souls 1 (which i like better overall than Dks2. so if you love this game and finish and get bored, pick up Dks1) , dark souls 2 it is bigger, the already amazing combat is more refined, and the online pvp is better than ever. dark souls thrives on exicting precise combat unlike most other games out there. This game has a rep for being difficult. which isnt true, this game is hard to learn, not difficult. For ex: some enemies seemingly have no weakness, but if you are aware of your surroundings and use your knowledge of the game you WILL figure out how to defeat every enemy you come across. While this game is ""difficult"" it is extremely rewarding, you notice your improvement and after every playthrough you will notice you can deafeat enemies which origionally took you hours to kill now take you minutes. Like i said before this game is based on the combat, not necisarily the story. the story, while interesting and overall ok, isnt easy to find as it hides in npc dialouge and item descriptions, if you play games soley for the story do not buy this game. If you dont like RPGs do not buy this game (unless you really want to challenge yourself). and if you are a casual gamer who plays games every once and a while for fun, and dont really want to try that hard, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Recap: Dark souls 2 is a unique RPG with combat unlike most others and if you are willing to perservere over the mountain that is the learning curve in this game you will be heavily rewarded. I love this game and it is truly a king among games, but it isn't for everyone. Are you willing to join the Souls community and praise the sun? then COME ON AND BUY THIS GAME!			"

Wait if you can.Once in a while one can come across a game that is so immersive, deep, and vast that it raises the bar for great games. In this regard, Dark Souls 2 (and indeed the original Dark Souls) is in a league of its own. With its incredibly challenging and unforgiving gameplay, subtle storytelling, and fascinating environments, Dark Souls 2 is one of the best (if not THE best) games I've ever played, despite its flaws. If you haven't already, I could recommend starting with Dark Souls 1, but that is not at all necessary to enjoy DS2 to its fullest. What's good about it:- The gameplay. There's no hand-holding to be had here. You're thrown into a brutal world where even the lowliest of enemies can send you back to pre-school if you don't pay attention. The game is always challening, but hardly ever unfair. You lose, cry, swear, and probably rip your hair out because you're just not good enough yet. When you fail, you get back up and try again and again until you win, and when you do, you'll feel like the Best Player of Video Games Ever ™. - The combat. The combat mechanics make for some of the most incredibly exhilarating battles I've ever fought in a game. The wide variety of weapons and their respective play styles has something to offer for everyone. Remember that Fashion Souls is the best Souls.- The narrative. Or rather, the lack thereof. Nobody tells you where to go or what to do, and the actual story isn't delivered like we're used to. Instead, the world around you and the items you find will tell you the story. With a keen eye for details you'll be able to figure out the purpose of certain locations, characters, and items.- The abstract approach to multiplayer. The concept of Phantoms being summoned to your world seamlessly as you explore the world is incredibly clever. You can at any time (outside of some safe zones) be invaded by another player in the form of a Dark Spirit, or summon another player to help you as a Phantom or Shade. There are other ways to be summoned/summon as well, which will at times leave you wondering if you just fought a player or an NPC. - Copious amounts of sun-praising.What's questionable:- The PVP matchmaking. You can only be matched with people in your own tier, decided by the total amount of souls your character has acquired, whereas in Dark Souls 1 character were matched by their level. The system in DS2 seems like a step backwards. However, this will reportedly be fixed in the upcoming SotFS update. - The addition of Agility. DS2 introduced a new stat, Agility, that determines the amount of invicibility frames your character gets when rolling and dodging, and the speed at which you can raise your shield. To get to the same amount of invicibility frames as in DS1, you have to dump a few levels into Adaptability, or the doding will feel very off if you're used to DS1. I can imagine that this was introduced to give agile characters an advantage, but it feels like a strange stat dump.- The mouse + keyboard controls are simply inferior to playing with a controller. That said, they're a lot better than they were in DS1.Dark Souls 2 in my opinion even better than Dark Souls 1, which is saying quite a lot, considering that Dark Souls is (was) my favourite game ever. Truly a worthy sequel. Do yourself a favour, play this game, and git gud.			"

												Dark Souls II is a really good game. It contains alot of great boss fights and has a, well... Unique online system. Unlike dark souls one they have remembered to actually get servers and they improved on the hit boxes to a very high standard. This game is alot like the first Dark Souls game but the difficulty is much easier. I like Dark Souls one more than this game and I actually recommend you buy the first one instead even if the servers kind of suck, the gameplay is better, more rage moments, level design is 99999x better than this game's level design, more engaging boss fights and it is just purely better that Dark Souls II. If you have already played and completted Dark Souls 1 I recommend you play this. I rate this game...79 / 100			"

												The game is fun, until you get invaded by two people at once and when they both kill you they make a gesture implying you're bad. The game is fun, until you invade someone and they heal all their health back 2-3 times and when they finally kill you, act as if it was too easy. The game is fun, until someone one-shots you with over used dark magic. It's fun, untill you kill a difficult boss but manage to die just after and the game makes you have to kill it again. It's fun, until enemies who should by no means do the amount of damage they do just about two-shot you. It's fun, until when you go to attack an enemy but his shield is apparently up even when it's no where near his body and you get damaged for no reason. Despite these annoying problems, I still cannot seem to do anything but love Dark Souls.tl;dr: Dark Souls is fun except when it's not.        10/10 would complain again			"

												While it doesn't have the same umph and impact that Dark Souls had on me it certainly didn't fail to entertain (after the first boss that is...), aspects were refined, but mostly the game just gave a slightly lesser experience; not as well designed areas, even if they would be pleasing to the eye, some were just lazy and the sense of everything being connected, like in Dark Souls, was kind of lost. Overall though, a truly great and enjoyable game in its own right and arguably the GOTY.			"

												Having never played this game's predecessors:  Dark souls prepare to die edition & Demon's Souls, i found this game odd and even buggy at first. But i hadn't really understood the concept of being hollow and very weak and the enormity of the leveling up in this game and of how difficult levels can be at times.I was immediatly hooked on this game. The variety of items such as armors and weapons is excellent. I really like that it seems really simple to finish the entire game without realising that you haven't even gotten close to getting everything in the game and that to do so, you'll need persistent dedication. This game really doesn't explain anything, not much of story  either. It defintatly makes up for it with amazing gameplay. Lots of Giant Bosses. The summoning system is a bit quirky. Sometimes, certain bosses are so difficult until you reach a certain level that the only way to beat them is by sommoning other players, but then no summoning signs will be visible and no other players available to summon. This is fixed later in the game with adding other NPC characters that you can summon to assist you.Overall very good game. So many easter eggs are cramed into this game that really hadn't been apparent the first playthrough. Really don't like getting invaded by dark spirits ..kind of annoying if you're just trying to play single player. Recommend to any Action-RGP fans			"

The last is the amount of hackers in this game. I have been invaded (sexually at times its wierd) multiple times by reetarded feetus ♥♥♥♥♥ers who have no armor, and take no damage, immediatley restore respite, and shoot spells out like a tween on his nocturnal emission.  Other than that its a pretty fun game, easy to get rid of invaders that are hacking pieces of fish food if u turn off ur internet.

												Warning: Death will be your only salvation.This game has tons of both fun and frustration. The keyboard+mouse control is a mess but ""doable"" if that's even a word. Controller recommended but not a requirement. I played this on keyboard+mouse just because I play as an archer and manual-aiming with a mouse is far better than a controller.If you are a hardcore Action-RPG player who has alot of patience and has good wit then buy this game for it will serve you well. If you are one of those rage quitters then buy at your own risk.Note: get the Season Pass if you want extended gameplay and if possible buy it when it goes on sale.			"

												So.... I've spent a little time playing this game. Ya, and I spent prolly 3 or 4 times that playing the original. So I can honestly say that DS2 is a great game, especially with the DLC(can't stress that enough). If you have never played a souls game then I suggest going back to DS and play it first... BUT this game definitely holds it's own. Whats more it will all around beat your ♥♥♥ like there is no tomorrow, so prepare yourself. Maybe wear a daiper and vasaline your hiney cause the souls series is pretty unforgiving. In the first game it is more, I don't know what the hell I'm doing/ trial and error. In this one however the game gets pretty cheap, mainly when dealing with bosses. Plus the lvl design ( the DLC's not withstanding)  is not as good as the original but I daigress, it holds it's own. Basically this is a sequel to my favorite game of all time Dark souls and it does alot of what that one did but is NOT the original. Having said that the mutiplayer aspect in this one is polished significantly and with the DLC's it is an EXTREMELY fun and addictive game. I am bias toward the original but I still really enjoy this one. I give it a solid 9/10			"

												Without being a Dark Souls 1 player I absolutely love this game. I bring up Dark Souls 1 because people like to argue the first is better, and that may very well be correct. Without comparing the two, Dark Souls 2 is a great game. It takes a while to get a grip on the hidden story and background but oh my word is it shocking when you figure it out. Combat is absolutely amazing, aside of the auto locked PvE creeps/bosses that always seem to hit you, and PvP is what most (said most) Dark Souls fans love about this game. Some of the scenes/views in Dark Souls 2 are to die for. Even though playing on the mouse and keyboard can be more of a hassle to pull off compared to the controller counter part, controls are still pretty easy to pick up (PvE controls are simple, PvP you might have to do some key bindings or invest in a controller.) I'd recommend this game for any of my friends to play. I love it and spent over 200hours in game, so you might want to give it a try to.			"

The real challenge doesn't begin until new game plus for many of us vetrans. There are tons of weapons and armors to obtain through first playthrough and even more to obtain through new game plus.

												**This is a review in progress, and will be edited over time. I'm also a noob to the series and skipped the first game, so this is my first go at the series. I'm also basing my review on specific things that peaked my interest throughout my time with the game. More sections will be added and edited as I further my progression through the game. **Overall Score: 9 out of 10Story: The game opens with an interesting set of cutscenes which draws the player in right away. The story as a whole seems simple, but interesting enough to hold the attention of the player. It's good enough to peak my further interest into what becomes of my newly created hollow.**UPDATE** 3/9/15 - I recently completed the story, and I was a bit disappointed by the way the game ended, but I felt as though there was still plenty of incentive to go into NG+ or even make another character.Gameplay: You MUST use a controller to play the PC version of this game. I spent the first hour or so using my mouse and keyboard and man was it frustratingly hard. The game is very difficult, so prepare for ""rinse and repeat repitition."" You will die ALOT. The gameplay as a whole is very satisfying, and it feels good to kill an enemy. The game especially rewards you for beating bosses.*Update* for Gameplay: Now that I have a better idea of how to play the game, the gameplay is highly addicting and very fun. It takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it is really fun!Soundtrack: It is very good, and creates a very eerie atmosphere in the game. Because of the eeriness it adds to the amazing experience.Graphics: The graphics aren't anything mind-blowing, but they help add on to the environment and the overall experience. I run the game on my 4 year old laptop, and it runs at a steady 40-60 fps. The game appears to be intended for consoles, but the PC version is a good port. This game is a gameplay over graphics game, yet it still retains a nice pretty atmosphere.Noob Awareness: The developers of this game not once took in the idea of helping out players who are new to the game. No tutorial, no game tips (Although player tips are found everywhere), there's no babying involved in this game.*UPDATE* for noob awareness: It turns out that in the starting area of the game, there is boards with the controls on them and other tips.

With a keen eye for details you'll be able to figure out the purpose of certain locations, characters, and items.- The abstract approach to multiplayer. The concept of Phantoms being summoned to your world seamlessly as you explore the world is incredibly clever. You can at any time (outside of some safe zones) be invaded by another player in the form of a Dark Spirit, or summon another player to help you as a Phantom or Shade. There are other ways to be summoned/summon as well, which will at times leave you wondering if you just fought a player or an NPC. - Copious amounts of sun-praising.What's questionable:- The PVP matchmaking. You can only be matched with people in your own tier, decided by the total amount of souls your character has acquired, whereas in Dark Souls 1 character were matched by their level. The system in DS2 seems like a step backwards. However, this will reportedly be fixed in the upcoming SotFS update. - The addition of Agility. DS2 introduced a new stat, Agility, that determines the amount of invicibility frames your character gets when rolling and dodging, and the speed at which you can raise your shield. To get to the same amount of invicibility frames as in DS1, you have to dump a few levels into Adaptability, or the doding will feel very off if you're used to DS1. I can imagine that this was introduced to give agile characters an advantage, but it feels like a strange stat dump.- The mouse + keyboard controls are simply inferior to playing with a controller. That said, they're a lot better than they were in DS1.Dark Souls 2 in my opinion even better than Dark Souls 1, which is saying quite a lot, considering that Dark Souls is (was) my favourite game ever. Truly a worthy sequel. Do yourself a favour, play this game, and git gud.			"

												9/10. My only complaints go to the lore which feels slightly lacking, in comparasion to the original installment, as well as the fact that some covenants require ridiculous amounts of play to achieve the highest rank in (looking at you, BoB and BS). Also, the PvP is slightly unbalanced in some departments, but that will be patched very shortly.All in all, a really fantastic action-RPG. The difficulty is what makes the Souls games what they are, and DS2 delivers. While the difficulty at times might be a bit unfair, such as an enemy jumping down from a space you can't see originally, but most of the times it holds up to its predecessor. The difficulty is easily dispatched if you tread lightly and mind your surroundings. If a boss or an enemy has an attack which can kill you in one or two hits, it is a slow attack that can be avoided if you think quickly. If you mindlessly charge in you will rest-assuredly die a very painful death.The music and atmosphere is great. Most of the times, only bosses actually have music, and that is great. You know ♥♥♥♥'s about to go down. Besides, since the areas themselves do not have music, it becomes so much more atmospheric. You are constantly on your toes and any noise is more easily registered due to the lack of music.The character progression system (leveling up) is fantastic. You start as a stereotypical class - warrior, sorcerer, bandit etc, but after that, you can go whatever path you feel like. Spell-slinging, fragile caster with a massive two-handed sword? No problem! Backstabbing, stealthy dual-wielding assassin with full noisy plate mail? Sure, why not?Another strong point this game has which the original Dark Souls lacked is that this one has a much more open world. You can travel to two different areas right off the bat, and after a few minutes of saving souls, you can go to a third area. About 1/5 into the game, you can go to a fourth place. The end-game is rather linear, however, but that's only about 20% of the game. Besides, it would not really make sense to have the final areas be too open-ended, in my opinion.Player interaction is much more polished here. Compared to DS1, I very rarely encounter heavy laggers. There are covenants for all sort of player interaction - helping other players repel invaders, co-oping, invading other players, getting summoned to duel with a player 1v1, fight in arenas, etc etc. Some weapons are slightly on the strong side in PvP, but as I earlier stated, that is getting fixed in just a few days from when I am writing this.All in all, great game, great community.9/10, ♥♥♥♥ing buy it lol			"

												This is one of those games that you hate so much that you can't fathom the fact that you must keep on playing. Even though putting yourself through this torturous game you yourself seems to be compelled for greatness and have the will to push forward. Oddly enough you find yourself saying ""I'm going to play for 1 hour."" and find yourself playing for more than that.The game itself is beautifully made just to make you cry yourself to sleep and man up the next time you play. Areas are crafted amazingly, voice acting is beautiful and fits the mood and the boss fights make you want to throw your controller out the window to buy another one just to throw it out again.Another thing to add is since there is no gold or anything else. The game uses SOULS that has a multitude of uses such as purchasing things, upgrades, crafting, etc. and the best part about it is you also use it for leveling. BUT the catch is if you die you lose your souls until you retrieve them however if you die you lose all the souls you previously had and a new soul orb replaces it. Fun right?Overall its a 12/10 game because of the difficulty, how well the areas were crafted, the soul system, really annoying monsters that love to ambush you, the unique characters in the game and I didnt add it, but there is a way to 'invade' another persons world to just make their lives harder and vise versa. and to end is the very unique boss fights that make you very angry because you can't beat that one area.

												Praise the Sun!Dark Souls II, though it may be an easier game (by far) than its predecessors, is all I could have hoped it to be. It's a fun, (if a bit grind-y) challenging hack n' slash, with plenty of backstory and secrets to keep you playing and interested. The first run through may feel a bit too casual for veterans of the series, but NG+ is where the real Dark Souls experience begins.If you have the patience to run through the game the first time, hopefully the successive playthroughs will be what have you coming back for more.

												The combat feels better and the starting expirience is more streamlined for non-experts (though, not easier) than in the first Dark Souls game, and the PC port is MILES better (not a huge accomplishment, but a welcome one nontheless).However, the game lacks a bit of (dark) soul - the world seems less cohesive and more like seperated levels arbitrarily connected, the levels themselves seem more ""gamey"" then part of a dying decaying REAL world, linear corridors with way too many bonfires.Bosses are uncreative as well - too many of them are oversized humanoids with even bigger weapons.HOWEVER, the game is still amazingly fun and deep once you get into it (git gud ya scrubs) especially the DLC zones, which feel a lot more akin to the level design of  ""Dark Souls 1"" and have challenging new mobs and Bosses.In short, I'd say about 8/10 without the DLCs and 8.5/10 with them, if you like action RPGs and have the patience required to force through the first hours in which you will die, a lot , I'd really recommend getting it.

												If you are looking for an easy experience, a game you can run through with ease, then this game is not for you. You will die. A lot. And it feels like a fresh break from the more casual games that are coming out these days, and a throwback to the challenging old school games, like Ninja Gaiden, where you learned from death and victory wasn't assured.Many people were worried that Dark Souls II would be a lot more casual than its predecessor, and I can assure you, it's not. It manages to be just as challenging, while still being more accessible for beginners. There are changes that make the game more convenient, such as bonfire teleportation from the beginning of game. Combat in the game is improved, and is as fun as ever. One thing I wasn't a fan of was the large enemy mob encounters. Encountering groups of large enemies is more irritating than challenging, causing the player to go out of their way to use tactics they normally wouldn't. The boss fights are unique, and are some of the coolest parts of the game. Unlike the first, I played through the entire game with keyboard + mouse, definitely and accomplishment for a Souls game, the graphics are also massively improved.The story is great, although it doesn't pop out at you, but that doesn't matter in a game that is based so strongly on gameplay. The story lies in the lore of the world. While it definitely isn't as good as in the original, the world connects in interesting and cool ways.Covenants are expanded in such great ways and make the multiplayer a strong point of the game. PvP is very, very fun, although the hitboxes and connection keep it from being perfect. With the improvement of online play also comes the improvement of co-op (Sunbros rejoice!)While better than and worse than the first game in certain aspects, it is a highly rewarding blast of a game that will challenge you, and give you hours of fun. 10/10 from me.

												Yes, it's technically a superior PC port than the original; I don't remember a single instance of frame rate drop, lag or glitched graphics in my entire time playing it. Also the connection issues that the original game had are almost gone completely thanks to the transfer to Steam's servers. Unfortunately that's where the improvements seem to end.Graphics:Some of the later areas are really impressive, namely Drangleic Castle and the Shrine of Amana, however the majority of the game is aesthetically bland and uninspired and graphically poor, the use of repeating textures is prominent throughout a lot of the areas (Shaded Woods looks terrible no matter how close you are to the surface). I can only assume that the areas had to be redone when From Software realised that the hardware the game needed to run on would not be able to handle the graphics we saw in the E3 demo, and so the areas they had already completed had to have a shoddy re-texturing while the later areas were able to be given higher quality textures; I'm not sure if that is how it really went down in development but it's the only reason I can think of for the massive downgrade in comparison. Aesthetically most areas really lack that sense of mood and atmosphere that even the worst areas of Dark Souls 1 managed to pull off, with some areas being completely forgettable until you see it again in the bonfire warp menu.Enemies:Most of the enemies feel more frustrating to fight than a challenge to be overcome, as they can simply flail you with attacks with no downtime or even any kind of choreography of which attack they're about to do, as a result you just have to hit them in the hopes that you've chosen a moment when they don't decide to instantly perform a jab attack. Some fights become really frustrating as the game throws several enemies at you and unless you have some ranged attacks or a melee weapon with a sweeping attack you're likely to be overpowered as they ambush you from several directions. Again this is a downgrade from the Dark Souls 1 enemies which would be initially difficult but become easier as you got used to their attack patterns and became more skilled from playing. Also the enemy types are mostly uninspired save from a few interesting ideas that don't really work out, such as those turtle guys from the trailer, but mostly you'll be fighting generic solder guys.Bosses:At one point you're put against the Belfry Gargoyles from Dark Souls 1, only there's five of them instead of just two; while the boss was a complete copy-paste, right down to the music, I have to say that this was probably my favourite fight in the game which just goes to show how poor most of the bosses are, usually it's a case of hugging their leg while their attacks miss you. The only new boss I really enjoyed was the Ancient Dragon, which genuinely required skill and couldn't be spanked with two other sunbros like most of the bosses, though he still had to rely on a cheap fire breath attack that was difficult to flee from due to not quite knowing where the boss would attack from while airbourne. The only thing I would say I liked about the bosses was the designs for many of them were quite well done, namely Mytha, The Rotten, the giant bosses and the Demon of Song.Music:Not much to say on this point, the music was serviceable for the most part but mostly forgettable. Many of the tracks from Dark Souls 1 would get the blood pumping and had a memorable melody to them, whereas the music in Dark Souls 2 is more of a subtle background tune. To summarise, it's technically a good soundtrack, but I found it mostly forgettable.Story:Again the story takes a backseat and allows the player to discover it on their own terms if it interests them, which is what I liked about the first game. However while in Dark Souls 1 it felt like all the story elements were fleshed out yet subtle, I never really got that feeling with this game; in Dark Souls 1 everything had its place and allowed for speculation on how it all fit together and felt like it was an expertly crafted world, while Dark Souls 2, set in the same world, somehow feels more shallow and you can imagine that most of it was put together because ""it looks cool"" or ""the fans would like it"". The NPC stories are also mostly non-existent, with the exception of Lucatiel's storyline and Pate and Creighton's converging storylines. Mostly the NPCs will come to Majula and sell their wares, and that will be the end of their story.Recommend?Despite my mostly negative comments I'd still recommend this game on some level, I got 60 hours of gameplay out of it and I enjoyed a good number of those hours. If this was your first Souls game you might not feel as disappointed by the presentation, though I feel you'd still get frustrated by the cheap enemies and lack of real tactics in the boss fights. While I played the first game several times over, I can't see myself finishing this one a second time.			"

												Gameplay - The gameplay takes all the great things from the original and makes them more refined and balanced, for the most part anyway. Rolling now actually requires skill rather than just rolling past everything, and it is assumed that you learn it to get far in the game at all, as the some of the most powerful attacks in the game can only be countered by doing so (Dark Magic, Great Hammers/Swords just to name a few). Where this game fails in some respects is the boss and enemy design. In the original there would be a few tough enemies in one area with heavy swings and low mobility, and the object of play was controlling their attacks and anticipating their next move, Dark Souls 2 seems to forget that this is where the combat system shines the brightest a lot of the time though, placing many enemies in one room just so they can stunlock you to death. And Bosses like the Royal Rat Vanguard and Belfry Gargoyles are just great bosses from the last game with a tonne more enemies shoved in for more artificial difficulty. This is my main gripe with the game, most of it isn't skill, it is just waiting until a set of enemies have completed their attack animations and taking a few safe hits in the downtime between the next (An example of this would be the set of three knight enemies in Heides Tower of Flame). This doesn't play to the strengths of the combat system and makes the game less fun overall. Speaking of boss designs, most bosses are predictable, humanoid Strafe/Roll fests with little to no substance, the ones that aren't are usually filled to the brim with enemies. Usually. There is one boss encounter that is true genius, and he is optional and out of the way for no particular reason, Darklurker. This boss is brilliant, seemingly easy at first, he has slow, easily dodgable attacks with long windups, but then, he suddenly splits into two. And usually this would be a problem like a said before, having you wait out his attacks and such but not this time around, it turns into a beautiful almost dance-like pattern that takes much more skill than most bosses to complete. This is how the whole game should have been structured, but it seems to have fallen off mark. That said, it was still thoroughly enjoyable and i would recommend an all-bosses run to anyone with the time, you get this game for the gameplay. Thank god it is good. Score: A-Story - The story is an abstract piece to many people. Instead of the game just outright telling you the legends of people and places, you are meant to piece together it's tale using a plethora of techniques, in-game descriptions for items, talking to people and the environment being just a few of the ways you can go about it. The game begins with a short cutscene of your player being told that you are cursed, that your timelines and sense of self will have no meaning, that you will become a wretched hollow come time past, and that you will ""stand before it's decrepit gate without really knowing why"". These things are left as speculation for the player for the most part. And are never answered directly, adding to the nature of the game. While it isn't the best story for your main character it is passable, but the legends and stories of people scattered across the land are really where the brilliance is at. Score: BControls - Ahh controls. The first game was a horrible port to PC, suffering disgusting mouse issues, keyboard mapping not working most of the time, and just being a disgusting experience without a gamepad. Dark Souls 2 addresses the most major problems, but still leaves a few glaring issues. The mouse is actually amazing this time around, working like you would expect. The movement can be done fully with WASD and sprinting by pressing X. The only problem with playing with the mouse is that there is major lag when attacking, being as the two attacks for each hand are mapped to the same mouse button. Thankfully, all of these problems can be fixed with a script you can find on the PC Gaming Wiki, you can even edit the prompts to show PC buttons in place of Xbox buttons. While it isn't as easy to setup a M+KB with this game, it is definitely not a disadvantage once you set up the scripts. Gamepad controls are the same for the most part, with a few minor changes to make movement easier. You can now sprint up ladders by holding B, slide down ladders with the same button, and if you really want to, completely let go of the ladder and fall by double tapping B. Jumping has been changed to L3, and this is for the better, as in the last game triple tapping B was extremely unwieldy, and lead to many a death. All in all, great controls, but could have done a little better with Keyboard and Mouse bindings. Score: B+Sound - The game was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, the man behind games like Braverly Default, Golden Sun and Kid Icarus: Uprising, and it shows. The game is filled to the brim with memorable themes and soft tunes while on your journey, making for a truly brilliant game to listen to. Themes to look out for are Majula main theme, Flexile Sentry boss theme and Tower Knight theme. Nothing much else to say really, brilliant sound design all around. Score: B+Multiplayer - I felt this needed it's own segment because it is extremely important, for PVE, you summon phantoms to help you on your journey, this can make many bosses trivial by splitting the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s up, I recommend playing through the game once without summoning anyone, as it ruins the difficulty. But it is overall fine and has no massive issues. PVP on the other hand.. It honestly depends on the time of day or the weather or how the game feels most of the time. Getting lagstabbed is extremely common and is not fun to fight against. There is a region setting, but it is literally 'Japan' and 'Not Japan', making many of your fights a battle of who can lag the hardest and backstab the other first. If you want this game for the PVP, get it on consoles. Because the matchmaking for PC is atrocious, FROM should be ashamed that they shipped the game like this for PC. Not to mention a cancer that plagues everyone, Soul Memory. Soul Memory means that builds become complete meaningless, where in the original many people would limit themself to Soul Level 125 to keep challenge in the PVP, that doesn't matter anymore. If you have a high enough soul memory you will get people wearing the best armor, best weapons and people that have to ability to use every spell in the game. This needs to be fixed with the new DLC or something, because right now going into areas such as the Bell Tower are bound to get you killed by lag. Score: DOverall, it is a great game with amazing gameplay, but if you have to choose between this or the first one, get the first one. Dark Souls 2 just doesn't live up to it's name. If you play DaS1 and want some more action do get this though, as it is still a brilliant game. Final Score: B-			"

												One of the most enjoyable Dark Theme Action RPG on the year 2014, certainly recommended for mid-range PC which can handle perfectly games for DX9, i had personally enjoying exploring caves, deepened into dungeons, beat down to pulp of Enemies (as per orange messages on the floor though), intense Boss Fights. And Lore behind this game was Amazing, I'd say it less epic than Dark Souls: Prepare to die edition but it still great, and lore being narrated amazingly done by Youtuber 'VaatiVidya', if you love Souls series, try watches one or two of his videos. PC optimization was greater than Optimization DS: PTDE. Steady 60fps 1080p on mobile GTX 860M, Fluid control systems but the controller less effective for online PvP, it had slightly delay action button appeared on PvP. There are more Dungeons, caves, secrets lying on this game, just like on DS: PTDE, and farming system was replaced by 'bonfire ascetic' and more punishing curse to undead (if keep dying on game), then you have 2 options for remain on Human form (required DLC's season pass) and figure out yourself the other one.+ Game is Hard? Try Jolly Co-op (summoning)+ Intense Boss Fights and Rewarding Journey+ Enjoyable online session, PvP, PvE, Fight Club on Iron Keep.+ Gorgeous view on Landscape in game.+ Gavlan Wheel, Gavlan Deal    XD- Annoying Invader(online) on certain areas, Hit and Run like Casul.- PvP soul Memories player prove it imbalance.- require DLC's in order to acquire 'Special items'.- Bandai Namco Announced DS II: Scholar of The First Sin on DX11 pc (re-release) git gud.

												If you are looking for an easy experience, a game you can run through with ease, then this game is not for you. You will die. A lot. And it feels like a fresh break from the more casual games that are coming out these days, and a throwback to the challenging old school games, like Ninja Gaiden, where you learned from death and victory wasn't assured.Many people were worried that Dark Souls II would be a lot more casual than its predecessor, and I can assure you, it's not. It manages to be just as challenging, while still being more accessible for beginners. There are changes that make the game more convenient, such as bonfire teleportation from the beginning of game. Combat in the game is improved, and is as fun as ever. One thing I wasn't a fan of was the large enemy mob encounters. Encountering groups of large enemies is more irritating than challenging, causing the player to go out of their way to use tactics they normally wouldn't. The boss fights are unique, and are some of the coolest parts of the game. Unlike the first, I played through the entire game with keyboard + mouse, definitely and accomplishment for a Souls game, the graphics are also massively improved.The story is great, although it doesn't pop out at you, but that doesn't matter in a game that is based so strongly on gameplay. The story lies in the lore of the world. While it definitely isn't as good as in the original, the world connects in interesting and cool ways.Covenants are expanded in such great ways and make the multiplayer a strong point of the game. PvP is very, very fun, although the hitboxes and connection keep it from being perfect. With the improvement of online play also comes the improvement of co-op (Sunbros rejoice!)While better than and worse than the first game in certain aspects, it is a highly rewarding blast of a game that will challenge you, and give you hours of fun. 10/10 from me.

												Returning for the third iteration of the series, and the successor to my personal favorite game of all time, Dark Souls, is the epic  new adventure, Dark Souls II. I've played for about 20 hours so far and I must say, fromSoft has delivered yet another masterpiece in their notoriously difficult Action RPG saga. I've been a souls player from the very beginning of the series, which started with Demon's Souls on the PS3. I was instantly addicted to the polished, action oriented gameplay and the plethora of great fantasy lore. The story of the souls series has improved substantially with each new title, and Dark Souls II is by far the most comprehensive in the series to date.The environments, as usual, provide plenty of spectacular things to see and inspect. Even the still backgrounds include a ridiculous amount of detail, which adds to the overall sensation that you are indeed a part of this twisted, dark world. I will say that  the environments don't mesh quite as seemlessly as the original Dark Souls did, but this is a very minor complaint considering the fidelity and detail that each section of the new game provides. No two places look the same for the most part, which certainly adds a new layer of excitement every time you move on to a new area. The difficulty, which the souls series is probably most notorious for, returns with a vengeance in Dark Souls II. In some ways the game is much harder than either of the two previous games, but there is certainly some give and take in that regard(i've always stood by my statement that the game is hard, but NEVER unfair. Learn from your mistakes, and Souls will reward you in kind). You are punished more than ever for dying which is something that will inevitably happen a 100 times + per playthrough, but there has been some balancing features added as well to somewhat counteract this new gameplay element. The world is less crytpic and vague than previous iterations of the series, meaning players are more informed on what needs to be accomplished for them to achieve their ultimate goal of defeating all the bosses and moving on. This was a potentially vaunting addition for many souls players, but in my opinion, it made the world come alive more than it ever has in previous titles. Descriptions of items(for the most part) are more detailed, NPC characters are more helpful, and the beloved messaging system for online play has been improved dramatically. This is just one of the many new changes Dark Souls II implements, and segues nicely into my next topic; Dark Souls II and the new multiplayer format.In previous games, the multiplayer system was far less fleshed out than it is in Dark Souls II. You couldn't directly play with your friends in the original Dark Souls due to the splitting of servers(ironically this wasn't the case in the original game, Demon's Souls), and some covenants you could join had very little to offer the player in terms of reward and dedication. This has(for the most part) changed in Dark Souls II. The summoning system in Dark Souls II has changed dramatically, but the most important feature in my humble opinion is the ability to play with your friends online. The Souls games at heart have always been a single player game first and foremost, with the online system and it's benefits being ""secondary"" to the player's individual experience. While this is still the case, the benefits of playing online have increased a tremendous amount. You can once again summon your friends, rating messages has become infinitely easier and the connection issues and long load times when summoning a player to ""your"" world have decreased dramatically. Many people who played the Souls game's in the past can attest to the multitude of connection issues that occured when trying to summon another player to help you fight a boss or clear an area. Many times, one would sit and wait for almost 2 full minutes before the annoying ""summoning failed"" banner flashed across the screen. In Dark Souls II, no longer do you have to wait to find out if someone is being summoned to your world. You are notified immediately if someone cannot be summoned, allowing you to move on and attempt to summon somebody else instead of waiting for several minutes, only to find out that the player you tried to summon isn't coming to your aid. Rating messages has also become infinitely easier, no longer requiring the player to use their orange soapstone sign to rate a message left by another player. You can simply select ""rate message"" from the message read screen, and this is a marked improvement over the previous titles. Messages are an important feature in Souls games, allowing you to leave a note on the ground for other players to read. Messages pertain to things such as traps, tough enemies, or hidden treasures throughout the world. Messages can also be used as a ""griefing"" tool for the more sinister players, leaving fake advice in the form of a message to confuse or kill other players playing in that area. However you decide to use messages though, the system has been improved by an incredible margin. Covenants also make a return in Dark Souls II, which are esentially game altering ""clubs"" that you can join throughout your adventure to alter how the world responds to you. PVP has always been a popular feature in the Souls series, and the covenants in Dark Souls II add to the format first introduced in Dark Souls by a great deal. Covenants aren't exclusive to PVP alone however; many convenants are available to assist in CO-OP as well as PVE. Unlike the previous game, however, the rewards for ""ranking up"" in Dark Souls II are far more beneficial than before. Aside from the obvious gameplay changes a convenant provides, they also give the player rewards for their dedication to the current covenant they belong to. The only complaint I have with the game so far is how you spend your souls to ""level"". In the previous game, you could collect your souls from killing monsters and level up at any bonfire in the game. This idea has been scratched in Dark Souls II for a more conventional ""home base"", meaning the player must travel back to the home area if they wish to spend their souls. Also, many features of the game that involve bonfire's require the user to go back to the hub world and use that specific bonfire. This was the one ""step back"" so to speak that fromSoft did, but since I play on PC, load times are hardly an issue(there was far more complaining about this for console players since the load times were significantly longer). While a minor inconvenience to say the least, it certainly doesn't ruin the game by any stretch of the imagination.In short, Dark Souls II delivers another epic experience, from monsterous boss battles to intense PVP fights with players around the globe. fromSoft didn't try to reinvent the wheel here, but instead added and improved on an already fantastic gaming platform. If you haven't played a Souls game yet, this would be a fantastic place to start. While Dark Souls and Dark Souls II take place in the same relative ""universe"", they are indeed stand-alone titles that require no previous knowledge of either Dark Souls or Demon's Souls to understand. If you haven't played either of those games, though, you are missing out on two of the best games ever made. Dark Souls II improves on everything that Dark Souls couldn't(or didn't) achieve, and does it with the same flash and excitement of the previous games. Despite the one flaw I mentioned, this game will more than likely go down as one of my favorites ever, and will demand my attention for years to come(Or until the next Souls game!!). Be prepared to die, but also know that every time you do perish, it won't be for naught. This is a game about memory as much as it is about skill, and for those who wish to put forth the effort, they will be greatly rewareded with one of the most polished and exciting games ever made.

												I know there have been many reviews about this so far, but as a dark souls lover I feel I have to contribute. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, I CANNOT SAY THAT STRONGLY ENOUGH. From Software has announced an upgraded, sort of game of the year edition that we will still have to pay for (and our saves will not tranfer to). This doesn't even make sense to me. Haven't they made enough money off of the pc community already? How many other games do you see with 26,000+ reviews? I have loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of dark souls but this is seriously fuc*ing absurd and I will not be giving From any more of my money;  I encourage you to follow. I know this mainly happened due to Sony incentivising From, but this Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin BS seems just like salt in the wound after they made BloodBourne a PS4 exculusive :(			"

												Dark souls 2 is a king among games 9/10 (which is very good from me). As the successor to dark souls 1 (which i like better overall than Dks2. so if you love this game and finish and get bored, pick up Dks1) , dark souls 2 it is bigger, the already amazing combat is more refined, and the online pvp is better than ever. dark souls thrives on exicting precise combat unlike most other games out there. This game has a rep for being difficult. which isnt true, this game is hard to learn, not difficult. For ex: some enemies seemingly have no weakness, but if you are aware of your surroundings and use your knowledge of the game you WILL figure out how to defeat every enemy you come across. While this game is ""difficult"" it is extremely rewarding, you notice your improvement and after every playthrough you will notice you can deafeat enemies which origionally took you hours to kill now take you minutes. Like i said before this game is based on the combat, not necisarily the story. the story, while interesting and overall ok, isnt easy to find as it hides in npc dialouge and item descriptions, if you play games soley for the story do not buy this game. If you dont like RPGs do not buy this game (unless you really want to challenge yourself). and if you are a casual gamer who plays games every once and a while for fun, and dont really want to try that hard, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Recap: Dark souls 2 is a unique RPG with combat unlike most others and if you are willing to perservere over the mountain that is the learning curve in this game you will be heavily rewarded. I love this game and it is truly a king among games, but it isn't for everyone. Are you willing to join the Souls community and praise the sun? then COME ON AND BUY THIS GAME!			"

												I absolutely love this game, so much. The souls series is an amazing journey filled with a rich, mysterious world and brutal, visceral gameplay that kept me coming back over the years. I started with Demons' Souls on the PS3. I own DkS1 and 2 on both consoles as well as Steam. Let me be clear if I wasn't already. THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC.BUT.The fact that they are re-releasing the game with features that I believe, as well as many others, should have been included in the original release or given for FREE in the upcoming patch, are LOCKED BEHIND A PAYWALL?DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Buying this game now will just show Bamco and Fromsoft that they can get away with this type of crap. I love From Software, but we cannot allow this.

												If you didn't like the other games in the series, this won't change your mind, but if you're on the fence, this is the best one to start with and my personal favorite in the Souls series. I have beaten all games in the series and beat DS2 on PS3, so don't let my playtime fool you.This is more accessable than Dark Souls 1, without holding your hand. Navigation is easier with fast travel and a more logical map, and the difficulty is balanced even through New Game+.Two areas where the original Dark Souls game excel over this sequel is in monster design and music. Those aspects are by no means bad in Dark Souls 2, but the enemies and music have a more profound impact in its predesessor.Otherwise, as far as gameplay mechanics goes, I hold firm that Dark Souls 2 is an improvement compared to the former games in almost every aspect. This game is an easy recommendation for any fan of challenging dark fantasy games.			"

												Praise the Sun!Dark Souls II, though it may be an easier game (by far) than its predecessors, is all I could have hoped it to be. It's a fun, (if a bit grind-y) challenging hack n' slash, with plenty of backstory and secrets to keep you playing and interested. The first run through may feel a bit too casual for veterans of the series, but NG+ is where the real Dark Souls experience begins.If you have the patience to run through the game the first time, hopefully the successive playthroughs will be what have you coming back for more.

												Dark Souls II is a game about how the post apocalyptic world has to suffer from diseases and such in which you have to save the ones you love dearly by embracing this disease and wandering into the ruins of shrunken version of Brazil.You start out choosing your attire and your stand and meet some old Brazillian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who are known as the flame keepers. This hints towards the inevitable failure of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio De Janeiro where a large nuclear weapon would wipe out the entire South American continent. The flame remaining from the Olympic Games was treasured and spreaded around the corners of the fragmented country to help survivors seek their ways.Your character seeks to enter Dangalang Castle, an analogy to the old Palácio do Planalto building of Brasília but to enter you require the souls of former major atheletes of Brazil. You venture through out the broken nation to find allies like Luca Tael, Walter Payton, and the Chaos Emerald Herald to help you along the way as you fight through super mutants and blood stained American invaders.The game also features gang violence as you have the ability to enter a gang and spread their notoriety around the nation. These gangs worship ancient religions such as rodents and celestial bodies. You also venture to churches to ring bells of good fortune but get caught in an unbelievable amount of gang violence on the way there, a symbolism for drug cartels and how religion gets mixed up in such crimes.Do I recommend this game?Yes, it's a good foreshadowing of our near grim future and plays very well.

												Like the game. in its current state, buy SOTFS if on sale. however, I had to downrate because of this:The DLC, It's punishing people(ie me) for buying the game early, and its segregating the multiplayer community, basically leaving those without SOTFS with no one else-you need all the players in one place if you want a multiplayer system to work.While I'm complaining, walking. I don't have a problem about dying over and over again, but when you make me walk through half the bloody map just to die immediately and respawn again, I start to get irritated-and the game already punishes you for dying with health loss and soul loss. so there you have it.

												I'm loving this game so far, and would reccomend you to immediatly buy both this game, and the first one. DO NOT trust those who give this game a bad review if thier reason has ANYTHING to do with how they think they've been cheated because they only have a keyboard and mouse. Therefore, to anyone butthurt about it, just get yourself a ♥♥♥♥in xbox 360 controller, and stfu about how you wanted keyboard and mouse as the primary controls. There is no reason to comlpain, because this game is very nicew with a controller. It wouldn't make sense to have to change the gameplay mechanics to fit the needs of someone who wouldn't even consider taking the game seriously in the first place and simply read about how a controller is strongly reccomended. Its their fault for not actually thinking, and not making a smart purchase. As far as this game goes, if you liked the first one, play this one. If you like this one, play the first one. BOTH games are absolutely essential to anyone who values masterpieces, and they both are truly, the best 3rd person RPG games that I've ever seen.			"

												I'm about halfway through ( I think), after about 30 hrs.What can i say ? This is one of the most rewarding games i've ever played, and I've played a lot of games.First of all, there isn't much of a tutorial, you just gotta figure stuff out or go to a website and learn about weapons, stats, items and abilities. But, after getting your face aquainted with the floor for about two or three dozen times, you'll be getting the hang of it.IMHO, the moment that I started loving this game was when I could face up to an enemy who smashed me to pieces two hours earlier.Don't get me started on the bosses.PROS:+ Great open world, lots of secrets, beautiful views+ Great number of playstyles to choose from+ Lots of hours of gameplay, much replay-ability+ Great lore, if you're into that+ Combat, although on the clunky side, has a great feel to it+ You can summon strangers into your game to aid you, or to paint the walls with what's left of your faceCONS:- DirectX 9 graphics- No tutorial- Human effigies are hard to come by at certain points in the game- You might get stuck in the story, I didn't know what to do after I've killed all available bossesVERDICT9/10 would buy two more X-box controllers again!

												Do you remember the belltower gargoyles from Dark Souls 1? Well, they're here! Do you remember that thing about ringing two bells? Well, that's also here! Do you remember Ornstein? He is also here! And also the fire keepers! And the depressed warrior! And there is also an entire place sinking into the lava, does that sound familiar? Remember Seath? He's now a spider! And Nito has flesh over his bones! And Sif is now a rat! And the shields still are upside down just in case you were having nostalgia!But don't worry because there is much more fun than in Dark Soul 1! Here you can be invaded even going hollow, even by several spirits at the same time! Now bringing you the super-fun lagstab mode! Enjoy your PvP full of hexes, spells, lagstabs and mobs! Do you think this is unfair? Do you want to run from it? You can't! Force your disconnection and you will receive a shiny soft-ban from the developers and you will be never able to connect to any other player!A map is too difficult for you to pass through? No problem! Just kill the enemies a couple of times and they will dissapear! Kill everything on your journey and you can enjoy an empty Drangleic just for you! Easy as your best friend's mother!What a fun game! isn't it funny? In fact no. It's really sad. And what's the saddest part in this copy-paste game? The saddest part is there is no more Solaire in it.PS: If you're thinking of buying the game now just wait a bit. FromSoft wants to make the PC community to buy the entire game again just to have enhanced graphics (that ones it was going to have in the first release) and to be able to play online with the new purchasers. A lot has been said in the forums about this.PPS: Did I mention you can be invaded while being invaded?			"

												This game is basically dark souls with a few things taken and a few things added, so it's still dark souls and thus still good. Now here's what I don't like.They made it so that the monsters will eventually go away forever if you kill them enough times (which in some cases is a plus). But in trade you can't farm monsters effectively anymore (which is a big minus). They also made it so that you lose max health every time you die and humanity giving items are limited. Now I hope I'm not alone in this, but part of the reason I liked dark souls is because it was hard, but it was also effectively consequence-free when you consider things long-term. Sure you lost all your souls and humanity when you died but you could always go out and farm them back which gave the game a nice pace. I never felt like I shouldn't go explore there or try jumping off a cliff here, though in hindsight the second was probably pretty dangerous. However in Dark Souls 2 I feel like I'm being restricted. ""Better not explore there or jump off a cliff here, I have 24,000 souls and if I die I may lose them forever because I can only grind in a limited capacity"".I do recommend buying this but I recommend making two characters. Your first character should be an all-holds-bared adventurer who jumps off every cliff and explores every crevice ignoring the danger and consequences. When you're done with that go in with your serious combat character once you know what's where. Oh but don't be a swordsman cause one thing they didn't fix from dark souls in this sequel is that dual wielding still sucks.			"

												This right here is the pinnacle of RPG games. From the brilliant, beautiful and immersive  world, to the meaty, fun and intense combat, with a unique story that is not forced on the player, and an amazing integration of multiplayer into a sinlgeplayer experience while making it lore friendly, those are the things that make Dark Souls 2 one of the best JRPG's out there. its challenging in every aspect, it has an amazing soundtrack, EPIC and memorable boss fights, variety in enemies, and a great sense of achievement with every step you take that no other game offers.This is an absolute classic that wont be forgotten for a long time. RECOMMENDED to all RPG fans, but be warned... its as brutal as its predecessors and there wont be any hand holding.Also i found mouse and keyboard controls to be very awkward, therefor i recommend a joystick for a better experience.

												I definitily recommed playing this one before the first Dark souls, as the learning curb in this one is much easier than the first. That aside, this one is my favorite by far. The learning curve is much easier, and is much more newbie friendly, and by the end you feel like a pro. When you start getting into PvP, you also learn about different ways to play and fight, which help about a lot in the normal game itself.I can't get enough of this game; something about it keeps drawing me to it. Collecting items, PvP, coop bosses - as little as this sounds, in reality, it opens a much wider variety of doors to exploration and gameplay in both the levels and technique.With me currently at 150 hours played on the game, and my brother at almost 400, I can't recommend this game enough.

												It's very good, but not an improvement in every way over the original.It's still a game about patience, exploration,  and murdering a bunch of stuff.  There's souls to collect, equipment to improve, and blood stains of fallen players everywhere. If you liked the first one, you'll almost certainly like this one.  If the idea of a challenging-but-fair game that isn't a hand-holding power fantasy appeals, you might like this. That said, allow me to blab a little bit about the changes I didn't like.The biggest step backwards is the level design.  In Dark Souls 1, all the areas were connected and interwoven in interesting ways.  If you saw a bridge early in the game, you would probably get there later.  Dark Souls 2 doesn't do this very much.  The areas feel disconnected, and that makes it feel lazy.  It's like Demon Souls (or Super Mario!), where you've got the separate worlds that are all cool on their own but there's no real connection between them.   Dark Souls 1 made me expect more.The other step backwards is the story.  I don't think I like it as much as the first one.  It starts off on a bad foot, with two cut scenes and entirely too much dialog and exposition.  My guess is they wanted to be absolutely certain that every new player really got it that their character was undead, and cursed, and undead, and also undead.  Maybe players in the previous game didn't listen to Oscar and got confused? No one's fault but their own, but I guess they wanted to cater to that crowd. But even after that, there are more NPCs and they tend to talk more. They also don't seem to have their own agendas in the same way the ones in Dark Souls 1 did.  Maybe that's fine, but it made it feel more like a traditional RPG where vendors sit around and wait for you to need them.  The bosses also aren't quite as memorable.  In the first one, the big four bosses you were told about in the intro cut scene.  There was a nice build up when you had a showdown with the badass from the opening cut scene. Not so much here.But that negativity aside, it's still pretty solid.  You still get killed if you're sloppy or careless.  There are traps that will ruin your day if you're not paying attention.  If you like a challenging and rewarding game, it's worth playing.			"

												I have played the other Souls games (Demons Souls for PS3 and Dark Souls) and now I see that Dark Souls 2 took the best aspects of the previous 2 titles and molded them into a fresh new game to make in what my opinion is the best hardcore RPG ever. The difficulty level is only a problem if you make it one. No, you cannot pause the game and yes, you can be invaded by other trolls and lose your souls. If you are cunning and use your surroundings to your advantage, then you can always survive. I also was only invaded just a few times. I found out very early on that it is best if you explore and get the best weapons you can find. The player community is actually very caring and helpful. The bosses are fun and challenging, the levels and areas are vey ominous and imposing, but also majestic and beautiful. There are tons of weapons and armor just sitting around to collect. Most people complain about it being too hard to play if you have a life, but I have a full time job, wife and 1 year old baby and I had no problems just turning the game off anytime I needed to and resuming at the exact spot I left off at. You dont have to be a fanboy of any certain genre of games, this one can be a fun and rewarding experience for anyone.Dont miss out on this game. 10/10			"

												I love this game for it's challenging difficulty even though it's not as hard as Dark Souls 1 but now it runs better and there is not a blightown like area that drops your fps to extreme lows but I would still say play Dark Souls 1 first if your new to the series (I haven't been able to play Dark Souls 3 so I can't form a opinion on it) because of Dark Souls 2 feature of every time you die you lose some of your max hp/vitality every single time you die till you get to about the half way mark but then most of the time definetly bosses instantly kill you with one hit in the later parts of the game or if you use a bonfire astetic to farm boss souls like I have done with the pursuer and the last giant. There is a one problem though don't play this on offline mode for one reason you will not achieve the achievements because I defated the giant spider boss in offline mode for some reason I think it was because a friend was playing one of my games and I didn't want to disturb him playing it and even if you go to the bosses bonfire and use it to telaport it will not give you the achievement and I'm not trying it without a controller because mine died and bonfire astetic on that boss.

And I still think it's worth it to buy it, because the developers have tried their best,the bossareals are still awesome and especially the other areals have some tricky traps.Dark Souls 2 is still a challenging game.I think for everyone who likes challenges,it is a must.Have fun and good succeed			"

But not everything is perfect, the game world is build way flatter than in dark souls 1 and there are still some bugs that need to be fixed.If you are a fan of fantasy RPG's that offer a good challenge, i absolutely reccomend this game.See you in Drangleic.

												After 375+ hours of gameplay i though it was time to make a review of this game, probably my favourite one of all time. Let's start:First of all i'm going to talk about the gameplay:-Good port to PC, i don't use a ps3/xbox controller, i use the keyboard and mouse and you can play perfectly with that (not like DS1 where it was unplayable).-Really well optimized, i don't have an outstanding PC and i can play it at 60FPS with all graphic options at the maximum.-Difficulty of the game is pretty high, and you will die a lot if you are new to the series, but with effort and learing from your deaths you will get through it.About graphics:-Despite the downgrade of the graphics from the demo of dark souls to the final game, they are pretty good and really enjoyable-The scenarios change too much in my opinion, for example, from a poisonous dark zone you go to a iron keep full of lava and fire just by going up with a elevator, but anyways, its so gorgeous you don't even care at all.About story:-Brilliant masterpiece, shown in item descriptions and short talks to npc's, maybe its not too deep as it was in DS1 but if you enjoy this kind of story and the ""soul series"" it's still a masterpieceTalking about PVP:-Some people say katanas are overpowered, others just use cheap tactics to win, others play the role they like as a mage, warrior, or even cosplaying a boss. I like it, even though sometimes seems a little unbalanced.-There are some annoying ""lagstabs"".-Sometimes you may see a hacker, but it's not very usual, and the most of times is the lag that makes you seem you hit the invader/invaded when you didn't.-There are some people hosting funny fight clubs at the bridge of the Iron Keep and i like that, most ""club fighters"" are honorable players.Positive overall:-Gameplay-Story-PC port-Hexes HUEHUEHUENegative overall:-New realease of Scholar of the first sin, that will improve graphics and upgrade directX9 to X11 is NOT FREE-Not Solaire in the game :(Rate:10/10 a ♥♥♥♥ing must buy			"

												UPDATE! From has gone full jew and you should not buy this even at gunpoint!Other than that, this game that is undeniably fun, has no soul like the previous games, the developers have no souls either! Just check the other negative reviews and their new upcoming release thingy or whatever to know what Im talking about. Thanks FS. You can shove the casul souls where the sun doesnt shine, I hate to see good series die like this.Long live Demons Souls, long live dark souls. Short lived was the glory of dark souls 2.Casul souls 2: electric boogalooIts a great game all in all. It has its fair amount of issues so first I'll be talking about those so I can end on a high note.First of all, the game is easy as all hell compared to the earlier two souls games. It offers some items that make it all very easy and summoning phantoms on bosses is rarely required, but if you end up doing it, the fights will be over in less than a minute. So I strongly recommend first going into the bosses on your own, trying it out a few times and if you get frustrated, then just go for the phantom summons. No one forces you to use those OP items and such, so TRY to keep yourself from those if possible, incase you feel that it needs to be a bit more challenging.A mixture of ""easy-mode"" and extremely poor game design are the new grey phantoms. Basically there are few covenants that allow you to force another player into your world, where you can kill them without any risks whatsoever (unless you are incredibly bad at this game, then it might be somewhat risky). You spawn into a clusterf*ck of enemies that attack YOU and you also have that other player to worry about. They get rewarded for taking you down and even if they die, fetching souls is risk free for them. Just this idea alone drops the overall rating of the game by one point. It is THAT bad of a thing. Granted, the areas are optional, but first time playing through, you might not know that. You just explore around like an idiot and get pulled out every 2 seconds, eventually get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and flip the bird to the game.Few other more minor issues are the badly designed bossfights. I talked about them a bit earlier, but theres a lack of inspiration, they rarely make you afraid when you enter and are over too fast. They often have cheap skills to compensate for the lack of actually good, fun, challenging moves and tricks. Sure there has been cheap moves on every boss in every souls games, there have been really easy ones too, but they should be over this by now.The same goes for some enemies. While I LOVE killing humanoid type enemies in games, there were few too many of those in this one. The lack of inspiration and innovation is present with the enemies aswell and its kind of a bummer.The story and setting is.. so and so. I never felt truly invested in anything and sometimes the lore part too fell kind of flat on its butt. But that stuff too has its highs. Some places also feel really out of place, but I wont spoil any of that.Theres few other annoying things here and there, but mostly just me nitpicking. I wish that there were more armor sets and such, the character making thing should have been able to make other than potato people and shrek clones (you can create a decent looking character if you put in a lot of time, but not worth it). The removal of the kick attack also annoyed me a bit. it was fun to kick the poop out of the vases and other destroyable stuff. But like I said before, just me nitpicking.Luckily the game for the most part is great! amazing new places, great scenery, great atmosphere, sometimes suprisingly challenging parts and bosses, some of the bosses are GREAT and there are few enemies that really send the chills down my spine. It feels like a souls game through and through eventhough those issues I mentioned earlier are strongly present for the most part.I had a blast exploring the places, kicking baddies and had many moments where I yelled ""YES! I did it!"". part of the reason why most of it felt so easy was probably because I have played the two earlier games quite a lot so I knew to be extremely careful, when to back it up and expect some sneaky enemy. I also had a pretty good idea how most different types of bosses would eventually play out even if some bosses really kicked my ♥♥♥ a few times and beating them after that felt real nice.Atleast this didnt take me nearly a year (real gametime maybe 90-100hours) like Demons Souls, that game was balls hard and the last ""real"" boss made me so angry that I both screamed out of anger, but once I beat it, I screamed out of joy and got drunk as a bee. This took a fairly low amount of time to beat because I really blasted through some of the zones and the bosses often required just that one try. There was much less of that ""hmm, I wonder what I was doing wrong, I really gotta plan this out better."" That said, Dark Souls 2 was MUCH less frustrating too. Sure I said quite a few cursewords while playing this, but only once or twice it was REALLY because I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off like an ant that you pee'd on.Its a great new title for both vets and new players alike. It offers many ways to make it harder if you really wish that, but I'd save that for the new game+. Most of the annoyances from the older games have been ironed out and theres more room for different kinds of playstyles. Overall I'd say that this game was a great success and well worth the full price. The keyboard+mouse controls are still poop, so just use a ps3 controller or something similar.8/10, bretty gud, wuld recommend, no need to git gud.EDIT: Forgot to mention that yes, theres a craaazy amount of replay value, the pvp side if you like that and lots of optional bosses ect. I'll be continuing to play this for quite some time so dont be hesitating to buy this because of my game hours.			"

												I have been really excited for this game,I was jelly of the japaneses of getting the game first,I tried cheating to get it but patience is golden.Dark Souls II follows the same route Dark Souls took, a dark and difficult game, but it was not exactly like Dark Souls.The combat has changed, from better to good in some aspects, and to worse on others.On Dark Souls 1 we could progress the game without any cheating at all, and my cheating i mean using cheap techniques, and on this game you'll just need to ignore most of the enemies and if you can't ignore an enemy you'll just end up poisoning him up to death.The lore in this game is either so well hidden or there's really little lore, it's all resumed on what's happening right now and it isn't about you knowing what happened in the past, though, there is quite a memorable event on this game, but it's not very different from the old game.Although i really do love it, i don't mind a copypasta, if they're copying something that's good then we are all fine.The PC version delivers, i have not yet tried the console version because heck, i don't own an PS3 or a X360, but the game looks great. If you see a screenshot and say something different, the person that took the screenshot wants to take a really bad angle and show the game at the worst side, of course it has visual glitches, every game does, not to mention it's just the release of the game, patches are to come.The game may not be as dark as the first game, but hell it gets darker alot faster than the first one.In my opinion i found this game easier than Dark Souls, but it may just be the Dark Souls experience i already had that got me prepared for this game.This game tries hard to be difficultly challenging, while i prefer the inteligently challenging way Dark Souls 1 had.In this game there are various of bosses that are not only one boss, it's about three bosses or two, when there's one they have the companion of average enemies, i think the only boss that doesn't have this is the first boss, the second one and the first optional one.It brings back memories from the old dark souls, every character makes another appearance, reborn in another body, but the personality is the same. There are also some bosses from the old game you'll see again in this one and heck, if you played the older one you'll be really happy, it tells a bit more of their stories and what they really wanted to protect.Dark Souls II, while still making up for some of my 20 favourite games, did not meet quite the requirements, it still is, a great game, an amazing game, a wonderful game, there are some things to be fixed still, like PVP and online interactions since the ghost hitbox is terrible.Amazing game, worth your money, but do not get this one first since the real blast will really come if you've played the first one.

												I usually don't review games, but I felt compelled too review this one. Mindblowingly hard yet intensely satisfying when you finally beat that boss you've been stuck on for hours, this game makes you want to chuck your controller and scream with joy at the same time. For a game to both ♥♥♥♥ me off to this degree yet be so much fun is absolutely wonderful. I've only spent a couple hours on it so far because of schoolwork, but man as soon as ap tests are over I'm bum-rushing through this one with a couple friends. Definitely recommended. And one more thing for beginners: if you're about to die disregard everything else and run towards the last bonfire you were at. This sure does make recovery of souls a heck of a lot easier. 10/10 Would Play			"

												I'm changing my review of this game, because in hindsight it's a little bitter of me to not reccomend a fun game just because I think the pvp in the first game was loads better. The pve is great. It's Dark Souls. Everyone loves Dark Souls. Unless you hate Dark Souls, in which case you probably REALLY hate Dark Souls. Why are you even here?Anyway, like I said, I think they messed up the pvp, and actually even the co-op. Admittedly it's been a while since I played, and the might have changed stuff with the dlc, but I doubt the core mechanics have changed significantly.-Soul memory. This was a mistake in my eyes. There's no point in running min-max builds for pvp at a certain level range, which I thought was half the fun of pvp in places like anor londo in DS1. You can still do it in this game, but since you're constantly gaining more souls from pvp, the enemies you fight will constantly be getting stronger even if you choose to limit your own level.-In additon, this also messed up how I liked to play helper characters. In ds1, I liked to make a character and lock it in a specific level range to help carry people though harder bosses. You can do that in this game too, but since you'll be killing the boss over and over and getting souls, you will eventually be locked out of the usual level ranges that people need help at due to soul memory increasing.-Poise doesn't do anything; Barehanded punches can and do stagger you in full havels. Using shields will get you killed because of the ability to do laughably easy shield breaks that not only stagger you but set you up for a crit riposte. Together it makes fatroller heavy builds completely worthless which ruined how I liked to play pvp. I really didn't like how the game forced you into one of a few viable light builds for pvp.It's griping about one aspect of the game, I know. But the multiplayer is what gave ds1 longevity for me, and conversely what made me set this game down after I had gone through the story. Individual experiences may vary. Praise the sun.			"

												I've already played Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Demon's Souls on the PS3, still came back for DS2 on PC when it was on the Winter sale. I've run up to NG+++ already on the PS3 version, will most likely do so also here on PC. Gonna be also participating on the DLC content when I'm comfortable with my progress with the vanilla game. let's hope that pays off well too.I agree with the norm that the DS1 still takes the cake for the best souls game, but the mechanics of DS2 still makes me want to play it still.

												I did a complete 180 on how I feel about this game. At the beginning, I was so disappointed. The developpers wanted to make this game harder than its predecessor and they did it by making the game unfair. They added more traps, more ambushes, just a bunch of more unfair stuff. They added a lot of unecessary bosses, lowered the time of invincibilty your dodges have and made the hitboxes much bigger. They even slowed down the time it takes to drink estus which heal you. The first Dark Souls was challenging, but it was always fair. BUT even with all of this, once you get used to it, it still feels like a Dark Souls game. The feeling of accomplishement after beating your obstacle is still there more then ever before. The lore, the characters, the areas, the enemies, the bosses, they make me forget about the bad things of this game. Sure, this game has a lot, and I mean A LOT of flaws, but at its core, it's still a Dark Souls game and it deserves to be called a Dark Souls game.*I'm still pisssed that the warrior class has a broken straight sword as a starting weapon.*			"

												You ever wanted a game that had that right feeling of difficulty, not impossibly hard, but a god's honest challenge to it? Then you've come to the right game. With nearly 12 hours of game experience, i've seen the prelude of what this game has to offer, and can only tell you this: It's worth every single dollar you pay for it.If you're a veteran from the original Dark Souls, or perhaps even as far back as Demon Souls, then this game will feel familiar to you already, but for those of you who are new to the Dark Souls franchise, then we bid you a solemn welcome to the world of Dark Souls, and hope that your journey is filled with Jolly Cooperation!---------What is Dark Souls?----------Dark Souls is a third person action and role-playing survival game. If you're wondering why people call it the ""Hardest game in the world"" it's probably because they haven't played other games with as much difficulty as Dark Souls presented them with (If you want real hardcore, I implore you to play Ghost's N' Goblins. That'll give you a run for your money) in their lives. The challenge of the game comes not so much from combat, but rather, the challenge of this game is dealing with unknown patterns of combat that leave you stupified on what to do next. For example, encountering an enemy you've never fought before may lead you to try and strike at it with your weapon, only for it to utterly decimate you. This will be a pattern that you will have to repeat in this game time and time again. And even if you know how to deal with an enemy, what happens when the game throws many of the same enemy at you, will you be able to fend off more than one at a time? It's situations like these that will inevitably become the forefront of the Dark Souls II ""Difficulty"" that people have with this game.-------What's it like playing it?--------To dumb it down, it's been pretty much the same thing for these past twelve hours.1. Enter an area.2. Defeat enemies3. Read Messages on the ground that other players have left that lead to secrets4. Get to boss room5. Summon Two Phantoms6. Jolly Cooperation7. Defeat Boss8. ????9. Profit.10. Go back to step one.And even though it's those same steps, the game nontheless makes every area unique and memorable to go through, and each area has it's own unique challenges.---------Personal Opinions---------While i'm loving this game, the bosses so far have left me at a bit of a dissapointment stage, honestly. It seems like every boss i've fought so far is the same thing: A Giant Armored-Up Enemy with a large attack radius. Not really much in diversity. The game's first big boss fight is a giant joke too. Seriously? (Spoilers on how to defeat) You run under it's legs and hack it to pieces. It's hardly even difficult in the least. Sure, maybe the first time he stomps his foot you might not be ready, but after that there's no reason you shouldn't be able to utterly obliterate him.(Spoiler Ends)With the new invasion system, the only real incentive people have to Invade you is simply to be a ♥♥♥♥, to be honest. I find the blue covenant rather helpful to new players who find the invasion part of Dark Souls rather intimidating. For you new players who are reading, don't be scared of invasions, and if you are: Join the way of blue. It will pretty much guarantee that you'll nearly never be invaded.My Score for this game?9.5/10 I love it so far. Can't put it down.On a side note: If you see my summoning sign, give it a touch won't you?-IGN: Leeroy Jenkins			"

												Nowhere near as good as Dark Souls 1 or Demon's Souls which it tries to emulate a lot and does a ♥♥♥♥ poor job of it. I'd honestly consider this more of a sequel to DeS in some ways but I don't really mean to denigrate that game by saying that. When Dark Souls 2 isn't taking the bad stuff from DeS that was removed or improved in DaS1 it's trying and failing to emulate some of the good elements too.It's really difficult to say how many of the issues this game has just come down to it being the third in the series and not really doing enough to distinguish itself as its own thing. Maybe the formula is starting to wear thin and this game doesn't have enough of its own identity or vision to really capture peoples attention and imagination. Playing the game for a while you will certainly get the impression that for all the elements this game copies from the previous two the new team hasn't really played them much, or at all.Dark Souls 2 is the most flawed game in the series for a multitude of reasons but it is still worth playing and miles better than most other games released nowadays. I can only hope though that they don't make a Dark Souls 3			"

												I can’t quite articulate the feeling I had when I first awoke deep in the dark haunted depths of Drangleic. The haunting shadows, the sense of isolation, the fear mixed with wonder as I set out to explore.  If you allow yourself to get drawn into this world you will never forget it.Dark Souls 2 is quite simply one of the greatest games of all time. The game may have its faults, but I cannot see how any rational sane lover of games could give this masterpiece a bad review. You will notice that nearly all the negative are written by people that are either unfairly comparing this to Dark Souls 1 [arguably THE greatest game of all time], or by people that don’t enjoy a challenge in their video games.  Yes, these days most games are designed to be so effortlessly easy to appeal to as large an audience as possible, and to all ages. For those who are intimidated by the games difficult reputation… yes the game is difficult. [I found it to be far harder than DS3]. But it isn’t difficult for the sake of masochistic punishment. This is not a bullet hell or super meat boy type of difficultly. You can’t beat the game through boring memorisation. You will need skills to beat this game. And when you first start the game… you will suck. But over time you will hone and improve your skills. They will naturally develop, and you will have so much fun as that happens. Its like… Super Mario brothers 3. When you first picked up the controller, did you have any chance of beating Pipe Land on your first day? Hell no. But one day you  where uber pro and had the skills to walk through it. Ah… I really can’t do the game justice. Just buy it. Its wonderful.  Its exactly how games should be. [But you should probably by the scholar of the first sin edition ]			"

												Dark Souls 3 is a mideval turnbased game developed in 1985 by Tesco in collaboration with From Softwhere. The goal of the game is to find princess Nash, take place as their family pet, then watch their family fall apart. The graphics are really good, and are really great, so I give that a 10/10. Walkers Crisps really did a wonderful job with the engine this time around, and even went as far as to implement new additions to the game after beating it such as: Falconers, Tumor Punchers, Giant Cyclops, Rubix Robots, and Michael Bay. So far, I've beaten the game twice, and the bonfire ascetic is the best addition so far because.			"

												I remember someone saying that Demon Souls as well as Dark Souls, were both a pretty brutal experience,however Dark Souls 2 is a game, a brutal one, yet a game. And the difference between experience and a game is pretty significant. Developers tried to broaden the audience, while maintaining the difficulty level for the hardcore fans, and to be honest they did a freaking good job. It became slightly easier to get into, yet still its a DS game, where you have to pay for every mistake you make with you life. TL;DR If you are a DS fan - play the game, if you are new to the DS franchise - play the game, fall in love with it and dont forget to Praise the Sun. Verdict: A solid sequel -Must play 10/10			"

												You ever wanted a game that had that right feeling of difficulty, not impossibly hard, but a god's honest challenge to it? Then you've come to the right game. With nearly 12 hours of game experience, i've seen the prelude of what this game has to offer, and can only tell you this: It's worth every single dollar you pay for it.If you're a veteran from the original Dark Souls, or perhaps even as far back as Demon Souls, then this game will feel familiar to you already, but for those of you who are new to the Dark Souls franchise, then we bid you a solemn welcome to the world of Dark Souls, and hope that your journey is filled with Jolly Cooperation!---------What is Dark Souls?----------Dark Souls is a third person action and role-playing survival game. If you're wondering why people call it the ""Hardest game in the world"" it's probably because they haven't played other games with as much difficulty as Dark Souls presented them with (If you want real hardcore, I implore you to play Ghost's N' Goblins. That'll give you a run for your money) in their lives. The challenge of the game comes not so much from combat, but rather, the challenge of this game is dealing with unknown patterns of combat that leave you stupified on what to do next. For example, encountering an enemy you've never fought before may lead you to try and strike at it with your weapon, only for it to utterly decimate you. This will be a pattern that you will have to repeat in this game time and time again. And even if you know how to deal with an enemy, what happens when the game throws many of the same enemy at you, will you be able to fend off more than one at a time? It's situations like these that will inevitably become the forefront of the Dark Souls II ""Difficulty"" that people have with this game.-------What's it like playing it?--------To dumb it down, it's been pretty much the same thing for these past twelve hours.1. Enter an area.2. Defeat enemies3. Read Messages on the ground that other players have left that lead to secrets4. Get to boss room5. Summon Two Phantoms6. Jolly Cooperation7. Defeat Boss8. ????9. Profit.10. Go back to step one.And even though it's those same steps, the game nontheless makes every area unique and memorable to go through, and each area has it's own unique challenges.---------Personal Opinions---------While i'm loving this game, the bosses so far have left me at a bit of a dissapointment stage, honestly. It seems like every boss i've fought so far is the same thing: A Giant Armored-Up Enemy with a large attack radius. Not really much in diversity. The game's first big boss fight is a giant joke too. Seriously? (Spoilers on how to defeat) You run under it's legs and hack it to pieces. It's hardly even difficult in the least. Sure, maybe the first time he stomps his foot you might not be ready, but after that there's no reason you shouldn't be able to utterly obliterate him.(Spoiler Ends)With the new invasion system, the only real incentive people have to Invade you is simply to be a ♥♥♥♥, to be honest. I find the blue covenant rather helpful to new players who find the invasion part of Dark Souls rather intimidating. For you new players who are reading, don't be scared of invasions, and if you are: Join the way of blue. It will pretty much guarantee that you'll nearly never be invaded.My Score for this game?9.5/10 I love it so far. Can't put it down.On a side note: If you see my summoning sign, give it a touch won't you?-IGN: Leeroy Jenkins			"

												This game is a great experience, but not the best souls experience by far. The level design is severaly dumbed down in comparison to its predecessor, as is the enemy placements and design. The lore/story is easily the weakest of the souls games, with too many things left unanswered (i.e. why the hell is Ornstein now corrupted and now hiding inside of a seaside kingdom? Why does a poison castle have an elevator going through the roof heading to a castle atop lava?). As for the bosses, they are a real mixed bag, with some remaining fantastic while others are abhorrent. If this is your first souls game, I would reccomend it. However, if you are a long time soulsborne fan, maybe wait until this game is around 10 dollars, or purchase SOTFS, as it improves over this game in every way.			"

												I love this game, i've played almost all souls game out there,only need to play Bloodborne, but ok heres the review:Positive:-Its really fun and challenging-Some PvP sessions are really entertaining -You won't see a bunch of hackers, and if you do see its a 0,000001% chance, since the last update the number of hackers went to 0.-It works well on mid pcs-STORY IS DOPE......................................................Negative:-Most part of the community is filled with trolls and Scrubs that like to use the MOST op possible Character builds to rekt you(Like R1 spammers and Full havels, and the most hated, the Buttface build, look it up on youtube BUT DONT USE IT!)-From soft needs to fix the netcode, it lags and when i saw it lags it lags hard m8, sometimes it can work on your favor or against you, but eitherway when it happens its unbearable-There is no banning from world thing you know what im saying? Lets say you get invaded/summon a hacker, and you cant kick him out,its either you die or you die, so that gives a headache.So thats basically it, if you are clever enough to realize it you will see that all the negativity comes from the Multiplayer so From SOFT FIX PLZ!

												For those who count hours I have clocked around 300 hours on the ps3 version.DArk souls 2....Game is great and alot of fun, but lacks in many aspects altough this isn't exactly a game.Dark souls 2 actually has no lose state and no win state...at all and no, beating the last boss isn't a win state, not in this addictive exercise in futility.And pc version is a really huge upgrade from the console version. There is barely 3 seconds of load time between zones the invasions and matchmaking is incredibly fast, so far from what ive seen pc version has alot less lag problems and graphics/lighting are really good altough some locations in the game look so bad you would think your are in an mmo from the year 2000 and yet other sections of the game are totally breathtaking.However...The good:-Great gameplay-Way more accesible-Some gorgeous locations-levels can be Run trough in under a minute if you know how.-The game this time around feels like it has been optimized for gameplay, once you actually try different kind of runs like lvl 1 runs no death no bonfire runs, magic/pyromancy/etc runs that the game has been optimized so that everything you need would be layed out before you if you know the game well enough and even in some cases when you don't, same thing can be said with the level design it has been totally optimised to offer different kind of challenges.-Lots of sexual inuendo.-Still discovering new things even after all this time.-Cool new animations.-Feels like alot more weapons are viable now.-Again some of the level design is really amazing gameplay wise.-Shrine of amana, best level in the game by far both in gameplay and ambiance/lore.-New game + really adds ALOT.-You can praise the sun as much as you want.-White ring.-Jester Thomas-Jolly life drain patch cooperation.-They brought back being summoned in by a boss to fight other players trying to kill it.-Bat staff + dark fog...go on, try it out for yourself. -Lazers everywhere.-Attack/spell cancels.The BAD:-Mouse lag :(-HORRIBLE name cencorship...really....really?(Yes this would be cencored if this was a character name)-Steam not having messaging system, I really miss laughing at stupid rage mails sent to me on psn. :)-In some cases some really bad animation synch-A lack of creativity, its ok to reuse and remold old ideas like you did with demon souls to dark souls but doing it again like this just makes the game way too predictable.-A lack of innovation. Where is the heavy casting attacks? Where is the ground rolling? Where is the weapon locking? where is independant left right ""spell"" selection? Where is the dual hand mixing attacks? Armor abilities, move sets?-NO FREAKING basic climbing mechanics, it's incredibly infuriating not being able to hop over a knee high ledge, some thing a fat legless basilisc could do, In some parts, you could skip out on a whole level if you could just hop over a ledge. Really gimping players on something so simple so you can make the players go trough your level design is just bad game design either give players a way to climb small ledges or hide them better because there is nothing challenging, hard or rewarding for the player it's simply annoying.-BOSS BATTLES: biggest let down in the game :(  Not a single boss battle of epic scale and those that come close are just  boring or easy with a limited move set and/or repetitive patterns, Altough the fun of discovery is there for each new boss you encounter, There was not a single one that made me sit at the edge of my seat and fight for my life or even want to  refight in co op just for the fun of it like previous titles did.-Really lacking in atmosphere. (except in a few places)-Some levels are way too short and nonsensical. -Npcs are no fun.-Some really dodgy hit detection at times.-No flails.-No meaning in death, it just feel slightly annoying (I wish they would make a perma death scenario where if you go completely hollow you get perma death and an AI black phantom version of you character appears in another player's world where if it gets killed your chararacter is gone forever but if the hollowed out version of your phantom beats a player then you get the character back. Now something like that would spice it up and make you really dread hollowing.)-Lazers everywhere.-Gimped soul geyser.			"

TL;DR If you are a DS fan - play the game, if you are new to the DS franchise - play the game, fall in love with it and dont forget to Praise the Sun. Verdict: A solid sequel -Must play 10/10			"

												Single player: This game is so challenging but it's so fun! I can't stop playing!Multi player: Oh, that attack that was across the area hit me and took half my health oh well he's right in front of me i'll just stab him. *lag* oh he's behind me all of a sudden ok im dead. Let's check this guys profile, oh he's from russia. No wonder he was ganking, using havels armor, dual wielding power stance halberds, and hexes.Balance your online From.EDIT: after about 200 hours of using cheat engine to make pvp builds so that i would not have to farm for certain items for hours, or deal with going through the story multiple times to make my builds. I have been softbanned from the multiplayer, while i have no problem at all with this happening, I'm more worried about how people are still reporting hackers that are level 838 and have infinite casts of the acid surge spell that breaks your equipment, even though FROM software has started soft banning.

												This game is a great experience, but not the best souls experience by far. The level design is severaly dumbed down in comparison to its predecessor, as is the enemy placements and design. The lore/story is easily the weakest of the souls games, with too many things left unanswered (i.e. why the hell is Ornstein now corrupted and now hiding inside of a seaside kingdom? Why does a poison castle have an elevator going through the roof heading to a castle atop lava?). As for the bosses, they are a real mixed bag, with some remaining fantastic while others are abhorrent. If this is your first souls game, I would reccomend it. However, if you are a long time soulsborne fan, maybe wait until this game is around 10 dollars, or purchase SOTFS, as it improves over this game in every way.			"

												I would normally completely reccomend this game as it's pretty damn fun, but currently there's a new version of this game thats going to be coming out a couple months down the line and this version while recieving a good amount of the content updates will not be recieving the graphics upgrade or player cap upgrade. Currently there's no reason to buy this version of the game so anyone who wanted to play Dark Souls II between now and the update in april of next year are in a pretty crappy situation. I don't think I could really reccomend the new version they're coming out with soley on account of them screwing anyone who's already purchased the game.  I'll probably write some sort of proper review if this changes in the future.			"

												11/10 Needs to be Game of the Year, simply perfectThe PC port is seriously not as bad as everyone is saying it is, all of these complaints are from dead on launch, and every game has its launch problems yet no one can see that, I am writing this on the first day it was released and I have found no glitches within the game, there were some launch issues but there was a fix for everything and it literally took me around 5 minutes to fix it all. Also the controls are really easy to get used to, all you need to do is spend a good 5-10 minutes on understanding the controls and just continue playing and like I have, you just get used to it and actually master it. So don't just say no because some forums are saying it is terrible, give it a shot, it really isn't as bad as people say it is. "

												Slowly demon souls/Dark souls games are starting to become my favorite games of all time. As much as i love deep rpg's with huge open world areas, for these games i will gladly make an exception. From the graphics, to the deep rpg elements while tossing you in a dark gritty world without holding your hands, is one of the beginning reasons why its so unique.This one hands down aside from Demon souls is the best of the series. I like the fact they went back to demon souls roots and takes the best of dark souls 1, and of demon souls and blends it together with better/smoother combat and animations/cloth physx. It's also a steamworks title, so thats another HUGE plus. Def worth your time and money, buy it now. I personally rate it a 10 from my early gameplay experience, very hard to put it down.			"

												So, having been a veteran player of the souls series, both Demon Souls and the original Dark Souls I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised overall with Dark Souls II, and here is my brief summary for people interested in potentially buying:Pros:- Continued familiar and varied iconic Souls series locations, equipment, combat and lore- Many returning pieces of gear from the original Dark Souls game- Quite a large amount of consumable content, at least on par with the previous two if not a tad more- End game has been fleshed out a lot more for those seeking to extract as much long term play out of it as possible. Items like Bonfire Ascetic make the game so much more challenging (An item that you use on bonfires to increase the difficulty of the location).- Fluid combat much more reminiscent of Demon Souls (This is good or bad depending on your outlook!)Cons:- PvP is a pile of excrement: They've done away with SL, and replaced it with something called ""Soul Memory"", this in theory was a great idea as it stops low level griefing. Unfortunately at top end playing it is completely ruined. I shalln't go into the finer details of why, but if you want to read more there are plenty of discussions about it on various forums, suffice to say that people who want to cap their level and play with skill are no longer equally matched due to the fact that everytime they kill someone in pvp the souls they receive increase their soul memory, this in part forces them to level up if they want to remain competitive, this unquestionably ruins pvp since you get people, eventually, with maxed out skill points who just WTFpwn your face with little to no chance of you even being able to get a scratch on them. Anyway, stay away from PvP until they patch it (If they patch it). /rant- The game is still quite glitchy in places, not horrific, but a pain nonetheless.- No Solaire of Astoria (Booo!), at least they still have the ""Praise the Sun"" gesture though!Overall, this game is still amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good challenge and some amazing boss encounters and story lore.

												Note : This is more of a list of my impressions towards the game than a review !This game is a masterpiece for me as a  fan of rpg/dark fantasy genre. I can honestly say, that I have enjoyed offline gameplay much more, ever since I began my journey with about 300 hrs of exploring and learning about the lore... Souls game series is mostly about singleplayer experience for me therefore when it comes to online gameplay it significantly breaks immersion in my opinion - blood stains, annoying player messages and a rather boring pvp with  rage inducing invading system, not to mention scumbag/scrub players without honour.(SPOILERS AHEAD).... the very last boss fight from the crown of the ivory king dlc simply took my breath...the atmosphere, music and the sight of 4 loyal silver knights sacrificing themselves while fighting their corrupted brothers as Ivory king himself approaches exhausted hero is incredibly intense !!!

												imo there's nothing quite like DS both DS1 and 2 are amazing games can be very hard at times but thats half the fun of it.  The whole not knowing where to go you just need to explore, the invading ans summon system is like nothing else I've ever played.  Plus I love the wait co-op interacts it's just magical			"

												Note : This is more of a list of my impressions towards the game than a review !This game is a masterpiece for me as a  fan of rpg/dark fantasy genre. I can honestly say, that I have enjoyed offline gameplay much more, ever since I began my journey with about 300 hrs of exploring and learning about the lore... Souls game series is mostly about singleplayer experience for me therefore when it comes to online gameplay it significantly breaks immersion in my opinion - blood stains, annoying player messages and a rather boring pvp with  rage inducing invading system, not to mention scumbag/scrub players without honour.(SPOILERS AHEAD).... the very last boss fight from the crown of the ivory king dlc simply took my breath...the atmosphere, music and the sight of 4 loyal silver knights sacrificing themselves while fighting their corrupted brothers as Ivory king himself approaches exhausted hero is incredibly intense !!!

												if you love dark souls 1 then you need this, and as for the DLC if you ever plan on doing the post completion difficulties then yes the dlc is most definiatly worth it What I liked:changes made to pvp  attempting to prevent lowball tactics and most play styles are viableability to join a covenant that automaticaly brings in a pvp support summon when your invadedability to join a covenant to support those who are invadedchanges made to the poise system via poise breaking counter attack system (rewards skills/timing vs poise stackers)more bosses even without DLCWhat im unsure about:Bonfire warp system, once you light a bonfire you can warp to any number you have visited before, on one hand it means no long back tracking, on the other i feel the developer missed a opotunity to add to suprises for the player, if you had to go back, maybe a more limited warp system would of been better unimpressive bosses, while there are many more bosses i would of apreciated more ""chorographed"" fights that rewards learning and timing, some of these bosses you could dodge a few times and solo without any problems, but then again im slightly glad every boss fight was 30mins of stress and flawless dodgingWhat i didnt:Soul level system, so yeah instead of your ""level"" you have a soul level which is ALL the souls you have gained (and even lost) as a stat, pvp tried to put these souls level brackets together, which can unfairly punnish some one who has made alot of mistakes, and lost alot of souls, so you could have the stats of a lower soul level, and be invaded by a beast who has max stats for his soul levelprerelease vs ""finnished"" versionone issue i have is how different the game is to the prerelease preview  we were shownGraphics, and the light/torch system were all toned down.. hugely and without the developers telling people... ♥♥♥ well as a kinda poopy move, you can get a feel for how certain area's just dont have the ""finnished"" feelExtremely late game fixing patch: Yes it was a late patched that ""relaxed the souls level system"" and finaly polished off the end of the game with new lore and a new boss..but lets face it...too little too late			"

Dark Souls 2is an excellent game and continues to show why From Software stands out from the crowd, while falling short of their previous game.Firstly I want to say how well Dark Souls 2 runs on PC, buttery smooth framerate the whole way through and the game Alt + Tabs like a champion, which is always worth mentioning. It still looks like a PC game from past decade, but fancy graphics isn't why you play these games.As much as I hate to say it, the core gameplay is a slight downgrade from the previous game. Some don't like the floaty movement, I'm indifferent about it. What I do have a problem with, is the botched hitboxing and bad i-frames sometimes resulting in unfair damage, which is not cool in a game like this ...and frankly incomprehensible when they had it just right in the last game.The previous Souls games have been great at rewarding exploration and Dark Souls 2 is no different. There is a ton of content to discover and your first playthrough will probably clock a little under 60 hours. DaS 2 feels quite linear and the level design does not weave together as brilliantly as in the previous game.From Software has superb art direction in their games. Though after Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1, many of the places in DaS 2 feel samey and uninspiring, others like the hub area Majula are breathtaking vistas that demand you to stop and just look at them. Motoi Sakuraba has returned to compose a solid soundtrack for the game and his exquisite work make places like Majula truly memorable.The Souls games were never straight forward with their lore but unlike Lordran, I didn't much care what went down in Drangleic as I made my way from an uninspired boss fight to another predictable boss. In the end I was left with only one memorable fight, Mytha, the Baneful Queen ...I got my ♥♥♥ kicked over and over and it was great when I finally beat her. I wanted more of that, but after watching the credits roll, I was still waiting for that special boss fight.I have mixed feelings about the covenants. I liked how invading worked in Dark Souls, how someone could surprise me when I least expected it. In this game I never got invaded once, apart from getting gangbanged in dedicated griefing areas. The bulk of the PvP is dueling, which can be fun for a while but quickly gets infuriating when you get unjustly backstabbed due to lag. Co-oping and helping others through difficult times has its own rewards but soon you might not be able to do it anymore thanks to 'Soul Memory'.Following the pre-release statements saying the game would be made to 'appeal to a wider audience', many feared it would lose its Soul. Some changes were made as a lubricant to ease new players into the game, but luckily nothing too drastic. These changes include the likes of more item descriptions, the ability to fast travel back and forth as soon as you discover new bonfires and being able to deplete enemies from areas after killing them enough times. I think the 'improved' item descriptions are a welcome addition but the problematic 'Soul Memory' system, not so much.TLDRPROS:- Amount of content- Retains the Soul of the series- Framerate- Soundtrack- MajulaINDIFFERENT:- Lore/World- Linearity- Floaty movement- Covenants- Fast TravelCONS:- Boss fights- Level design- Soul Memory- Enemy depletion- Botched hitboxing and bad i-frames- Minor PvP lagI liked my time with Dark Souls 2 but I would recommend the previous game over this one in a heartbeat.I was left wanting more, looking at you ...Project Beast.

												This game is a great experience, but not the best souls experience by far. The level design is severaly dumbed down in comparison to its predecessor, as is the enemy placements and design. The lore/story is easily the weakest of the souls games, with too many things left unanswered (i.e. why the hell is Ornstein now corrupted and now hiding inside of a seaside kingdom? Why does a poison castle have an elevator going through the roof heading to a castle atop lava?). As for the bosses, they are a real mixed bag, with some remaining fantastic while others are abhorrent. If this is your first souls game, I would reccomend it. However, if you are a long time soulsborne fan, maybe wait until this game is around 10 dollars, or purchase SOTFS, as it improves over this game in every way.			"

												I can’t quite articulate the feeling I had when I first awoke deep in the dark haunted depths of Drangleic. The haunting shadows, the sense of isolation, the fear mixed with wonder as I set out to explore.  If you allow yourself to get drawn into this world you will never forget it.Dark Souls 2 is quite simply one of the greatest games of all time. The game may have its faults, but I cannot see how any rational sane lover of games could give this masterpiece a bad review. You will notice that nearly all the negative are written by people that are either unfairly comparing this to Dark Souls 1 [arguably THE greatest game of all time], or by people that don’t enjoy a challenge in their video games.  Yes, these days most games are designed to be so effortlessly easy to appeal to as large an audience as possible, and to all ages. For those who are intimidated by the games difficult reputation… yes the game is difficult. [I found it to be far harder than DS3]. But it isn’t difficult for the sake of masochistic punishment. This is not a bullet hell or super meat boy type of difficultly. You can’t beat the game through boring memorisation. You will need skills to beat this game. And when you first start the game… you will suck. But over time you will hone and improve your skills. They will naturally develop, and you will have so much fun as that happens. Its like… Super Mario brothers 3. When you first picked up the controller, did you have any chance of beating Pipe Land on your first day? Hell no. But one day you  where uber pro and had the skills to walk through it. Ah… I really can’t do the game justice. Just buy it. Its wonderful.  Its exactly how games should be. [But you should probably by the scholar of the first sin edition ]			"

												Dark Souls 2, well what DS does is it shoves you down to the ground beats you and holds you down but also some how lends you a hand for everytime you fall you learn a lesson, for instance how the boss fights or his pattern, but what it does best is teach you, there is alot of exploration for around everyturn lies an item, now it is very and i mean VERY satisfying to finally slay that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ boss that kept downing you all the time and you get a soul or a great soul, now boss souls there are a few options you could choose from, use it to get numerous souls or trade it in to acquire one of the bosses weapons (or shield if it used one).well at the beginning you will fall and get angry, but dont let your emotions best you, just try again and you will notice you came abit further even if you just downed the life bar 1% more you still improved and at the end of the day when that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ dies you will feel happy and satisfied you might cheer IRL and probably parade in the streets.now dark souls is HARD but easy when you know how, its like a science experement trying to learn and understand.i give dark souls a strong 9.7/10 since it deserves that, yes there are a few glitches one i encountered were enemies walked through walls but you will ignore that later, but it is very VERY satisfying(SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH, ENGLISH ISNT MY FIRST LANGUAGE)			"

												Slowly demon souls/Dark souls games are starting to become my favorite games of all time. As much as i love deep rpg's with huge open world areas, for these games i will gladly make an exception. From the graphics, to the deep rpg elements while tossing you in a dark gritty world without holding your hands, is one of the beginning reasons why its so unique.This one hands down aside from Demon souls is the best of the series. I like the fact they went back to demon souls roots and takes the best of dark souls 1, and of demon souls and blends it together with better/smoother combat and animations/cloth physx. It's also a steamworks title, so thats another HUGE plus. Def worth your time and money, buy it now. I personally rate it a 10 from my early gameplay experience, very hard to put it down.			"

												ill keep this Review short because a youtuber does a video review of this game which pretty much summerizes everything i have to say.first off i like the gameits not bad but i feel it pales in comparsion. i would reccomand Pros:Combat is much more refined I like the design of the new armor and weapons such as the Bone Sycthe or Bow of Want.Twinblades are really cool despite not using them :PThe abillity to rebuild your charcter from the ground up at the cost of a rare item ""Soul Vessel""Able to crush multiple souls at once instead of one at a timeIts Still Dark SoulsCons:Inconsities in the Lore such as with the DragonTooh having LESS durabililty then a GreatSword (explained below)Multiple stuff mentioned in the video such as geography and combat.a  heavy armor/ heavy weapons (no magic and rarely used bows)  build was really hard and i never felt as if i was this strong tough guy more so a liability and weak. as i was taking a lot of damage even in havels gear (all thou i don't think they were all upgraded fully but mixed upgrade strength) when switching to a Faith build mixed with Strength and Dex i found the game was laughablly eaiser as i could spam great lighting spear or Sun Spear at Bosses or enemies practicully melting them.I hated the Bosses i found nearly all the bosses to be either multiple 2 on 1 scenarios with a chance for one of them being a 3 on 1 and the bosses in general seemed to just be dudes in armor and varations of such. Nothing  really stood out to me enemy or boss design wise.but they also took out Cutscene intro's for most of the bosses which i feel lost a little bit of excitement towards the bosses like everyone knows the Orinstien and Smough Boss intro it was cool and awesome got you hyped up and ready.  i also found some of the level designs to be lazy as there were two seperate occassions i can think of in which there was just a line of enemies and the boss fog wall.  i also found out i didn't have much challange  getting back to boss fogs as it was kinda good the way you had to fight your way back to retrive your souls but in most cases i found the bonfire was super close to the bonfire or not much challange getting there.there were no locations in the game that really stood out besides Dragon Aerie and Dragon Shrine (off the top of my head) . Nothing so interesting like Anor Londo or Tomb Of Giants or Cystal Caves.------------anyway i will be linking a video which pretty much summerizes  the game and that if anyone ever asked me my opinion on the game i would saywatch this videoand play dark souls 1 Dark Souls 2 is not a bad game in any respect but it just isn't as good as Dark Souls 1

			After finding myself let down by Dark Souls 2 I wanted to talk about many of the problems I had with it. This is a critique, not a full review.		

all the props to Matthewmatosis and his Critique--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(From Dark Souls 1) Created from an everlasting dragon tooth. Legendary great hammer of Havel the Rock.The dragon tooth will never break as it is harder than stone, and it grants its wielder resistance to magic and flame.(from Dark Souls 2) A giant dragon tooth used as a great hammer.As solid as a boulder, this tooth is saidto be taken from a dragon, but the truthof this claim is unclear.What is certain is that it bears some mysticalpower, and its wielder gains resistance tomagic and fire.Even if the Dragon Tooth was from just a Normal Dragon i would have assumed it would still be a lot tougher then that. as its kinda weird when you have a situation where your Dragon Tooth broke.

												I remember someone saying that Demon Souls as well as Dark Souls, were both a pretty brutal experience,however Dark Souls 2 is a game, a brutal one, yet a game. And the difference between experience and a game is pretty significant. Developers tried to broaden the audience, while maintaining the difficulty level for the hardcore fans, and to be honest they did a freaking good job. It became slightly easier to get into, yet still its a DS game, where you have to pay for every mistake you make with you life. TL;DR If you are a DS fan - play the game, if you are new to the DS franchise - play the game, fall in love with it and dont forget to Praise the Sun. Verdict: A solid sequel -Must play 10/10			"
