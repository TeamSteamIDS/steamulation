												Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded+ (GRAPHICS) The environments are detailed and interactive even with the limited resolution options for the game, and the number of monsters on screen is still impressive.+ (SOUND) Adding in voice over work with improved music and the solid effects for shells and weapons makes this a better alien shooting experience.+ Longer missions, side missions and an RPG-lite character system are great. Unfortunately, you're still saddled without co-op and ambushes, along with some older issues.I enjoyed it, the core shooting feels absolutely great.			"

												Comparing with Alien shooter 1 - Alien shooter 2 is a step forward in all directions:+Better graphics: probably different engine, but the graphics looks better + the game itself, color palette and surroundings are more dark and grim, creating a great atmosphere.+New monster pack: reworked monsters, the bigger ones now truly BIG, old monsters reworked and a lot of totally new added.+Blood and gore: very nice work with body pieces and blood on the ground, especially when you are driving a vehicle and drifting in those blood pools mmmmm ^____^+Significantly improved RPG part - now you level up your character, spend skill points for spec, you have 8 different special abilities to start with, and each of them can be very useful for a various playthrough. A lot of different weapons for each weapon kind with various stats, inventory to pick up and exchange new guns. +Sound work - great sound work as usual and now this game is FULLY VOICED, all the NPCs talking with you, all the mission briefings voiced.Some other gameplay improvements like you go slower when you go backward and your spine doesn't twist 360* now. You have vehicles to drive and shoot. Secrets now are hidden way better, not only wall cracks, but secret doors etc. Really hard to find them, I think I have to try that secret search perk instead of vampirism. Good thing I also haven't faced any problems with modern PC compatibility, except fps drops sometimes.Overall this game is great action RPG, providing multiple hours of fun and it has great replayability.

												How come no one told me this game existed?Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded is a masterfully crafted horde-style action game with RPG elements (what a mouthful) that's all about running backwards and shooting. Shooting what, you totally didn't ask because it's in the title? Eeeeeveeeerythiiiiiiiing.Horde games usually struggle with enemy balance and keeping those enemies interesting. And RPG games usually struggle with balancing an effort-to-reward ratio that makes players feel accomplished and powerful without stressing them out too much or taking too much time.But Running Backwards and Shooting: The Game nails everything.The enemy design is stellar. Enemies are slow-moving, come in droves, can attack the player from multiple directions, and are NEVER bullet sponges! The more powerful enemies are even slower, and many of them have ranged attacks that are telegraphed nicely. The game follows (and never breaks) the golden rule of enemy design: The faster the enemy, the weaker it is; the stronger the enemy, the slower it is.The enemies are varied enough that the player must learn to prioritize and adapt on the fly. There are times when caution is the better part of valor, and other times when the player must be aggressive or they risk being overrun.The progression system is also just right. Money is limited, and that can make the game stressful at first. The player is never sure if they should buy that shotgun, or that implant, or upgrade their armor, or save it all for that one powerful rocket launcher. But that's what makes it satisfying. Players must plan ahead and be smart about their choices, not just with their money, but also with their stats.In a perfectly reasonable amount of time, the player is rewarded for their smart build choices and purchases, and a true sense of progression and accomplishment sets in. That's usually right around the time the player discovers that they have enough money to pay for that new assault rifle AND that RPG they've been eyeing, and then they enter the next mission and give the entire map a bloody makeover.But make no mistake: The game is always ready to throw new enemies -- and tougher combinations of old enemies -- at the player. This game is challenging! But it's never too challenging, and that sort of game balance should be applauded.Stylistically, the game is cheesy (in a charming sort of way) with a dark atmosphere. Surprisingly, these two things, combined with the overall challenge of the game, come together to create something that's easy to take seriously, but that doesn't take itself seriously, making for a truly fun game that never feels like it's being self-gratifying.THANK YOU, Sigma Team, for showing us all how it's done!

												It's a bit older so the graphics are nothing to write home about, but holy moly if you're looking for an isometric Smash-TV style slaughterfest this is hard to beat. Insane enemy count on screen, tons of secrets to find, destruction abounds. Only weak points really are the guns are completely linear, as in more $$ = better, but otherwise a complete blast for ~5 hours or so.			"

												An old school shooter that has a top-down / isometric perspective, similar to the one that characterises many hack 'n' slash RPGs. But Alien Shooter is not an RPG. It's all about the mindless action. Notice the adjective mindless! You press down your left mouse button and you do not stop until all aliens are dead. At the same time, of course, you try to get away from the smaller creatures and avoid the projectiles of the bigger ones.Although the game has some RPG elements (you can visit stores regularly and there's levelling up) main emphasis is on the action. It's a shame that SIGMA made this game very short and that they recycled most of the elements in the game that later became known as Zombie Shooter part 1 and part 2. I assume the game's next installment, Conscription, looks and plays exactly like this one so I did not bother purchasing it.Still, you can pick up this one or one of the Zombie Shooter versions and have a couple of hours of fun when SIGMA games are on sale.

												Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded is the follow up to Alien Shooter. Much like its predecessor, you spend the game shooting lots and lots of aliens. It improves on the original in many ways, and in the process becomes a game that can become worthy of some of your time.The graphics have seen a marked improvement in AS2. Everything looks crisper, there's more details to the characters and environments, and the aliens are varied and unique. The shooting is also much improved, with aiming being much tighter. The movement controls are as crisp as the original. You will be spending a lot of time dancing around with WASD and holding the left mouse button, so get used to that.AS2 has some RPG lite elements. You earn experience through your actions, and can level up in about 6 categories. I am not quite sure how a high intelligence would help you in this game, but it is one of the categories. You also spend your cash on weapon upgrades to help your hunting a little easier.Alien Shooter 2 has voice acting that is serviceable, and the music adds a nice touch much like the original.Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded can be recommended for the improvements that were made over its predecessor. All of the major flaws were addressed, with better controls, graphics and enemy variety. If you are looking for a mindless shooter than this game is worthy of a try.Grade: C+			"

												What can i say about alien shooter? Its amazing.Zombie shooter is an overhead action/shooter/rpg?? game that delivers nicely.An alien treath has arrived to earth and is decimating the population. Your mission is to find how did they arrived and to destroy them. Could say more, but thats about right for the story (and i wouldnt like to give spoilers).Anyways, a description of some aspects of the game.Variety of enemies. Unlike many ""Horde"" games, this one has quite a decent number of enemies. The combination of the different classes of the enemies in the screen makes the game actually decently hard. Not to mention, i have never seen a game with so many enemies at the same time.Good amount of weapons, most do well, some are specialized in certain situations only, but there are few that are all round up. Still, plenty to satisfy your gamestyle.At the beginning of the game, you have a ""special trait"" that you can choose,  which ranges from being able to recover some health x second to have some extra perception (for being able to find secrets), among others. Although you can clear the game with any, changing from one to another may affect how you progress in the game drastically according to your style of gameplay. Choose wisely.You can use some vehicles. Not many, but its fun to squash aliens with a tank, not to mention that they would kill you in matter of secons if you are not inside.Secret areas. To aditionally keep you busy, the game has many secret areas, most are just an extra room with some money/weapons, but you do feel rewarded, since its a decent extra loot for finding it. i found a lot, but way too far from finding every single one for every single level.Playing time: I finished this game a long time ago, i dont remember how many missions does it has (around 30), but the time to complete the game is around 7-8 hours since most missions are short, however, if you are looking every secret, killing most monsters, etc, ill be a lil bit longer. Also, the end missions are harder, and i mean it, sometimes takes longer to complete those ones (since you have only 3 lives) if going carefully.Replay value: This game is very fun, but the amount of enemies is overwhelming, that i can become tedious at times (so basically, at the end of the game you should have slayed a couple of MILLIONS of enemies) so yeah, virtually the grey floor is red at the end of the mission. Each time you play it, you can go for different characters/stats/passive trait, but at the end, you will do about the same build, the replay value relays on killing the alien horde over and over and over again. (This is my first run with this game @Steam, but i have finished it lile 10 times or so)Graphics. The game is not new, it has some 5~7 years under the belt, and still look nice. but seriously graphics is not really an issue,  my graphics card (ati radeon 3870 at the time.) was having some trouble at the final stage due to the amount of enemies at the same time. medium graphics are OK for this game.Sound. Not a masterpiece for sure, but it does the job, sets the mood in the game, you forget about it.Bad thingsIt has a co-op survival and probably a versus mode i think, Shame that no one is online ever, it might be fun to have a partner. Survival is fun but alone feels like meh. Its quite challenging though.Dumb AI. Although they will always try to get you, some will stuck in corners or any object that is in  between, some will stuck with other aliens. However, not a great deal, since there are many enemies, being stuck they will not overwhelm you from all sides every single time, you can create some bottlenecks. Not my intention to write a wall of text, but just to give you a general idea for your money. (probably worth 15~ bucks )			"

												Alien Shooter is badass, ALL Alien Shooter games. I've played some of the Alien Shooter games when i was a kid, i got so inspired by them, that i painted a lot of my own guns and gear. That's middle school for ya :). Sigma Team either brainwashes you or inspires you, and that's final. Sigma is working on Alien Shooter 3 behind the scenes, but it's on a freeze (game development pause). hope for the best, my brethren! :D. Regarding if i recommend this game? YES MOST CERTAINLY!, get it if you love lots of guns and gear and love shooting aliens. Play on IMPOSSIBLE, it's a challenge!, and do not get trapped in a corner by the aliens, they will shred you to pieces.			"

												The first time I hear about the original Alien Shooter, I was not even in Junior High. Back then, it could ran on Windows 2000 (just to show how far back the game goes!) and I tried the trial version, downloading it from the school's computer since a friend was playing it as well. 2 levels was all it took for me to scour the electronic center, looking for the bootleg version. (Hey, I barely have any cash back then! >_<)Somehow, a guy from school found one, and that game was installed in every computer in the IT class. Of course, as time goes on and my preference changes, I start to play other games, forgetting that after 4 years, SIGMA made a sequel out of it. I on the other hand was busy with highschool, so I didn't pay much attention to games at that time. A year back, I received the game from a friend, and while I have installed it, I never have the intention to play it. I didn't think that finally, after all these years, it gave me the nostalgia feeling all over again. :)So, the game itself, is pretty much similar to the original 2003 version with some additions to the characters and perks. Weapon wise, they have added new choices and classes, from the generic weapons like Colt .45; Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG); AK47 to prototype guns e.g. M̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶e̶x̶p̶e̶n̶s̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶n̶ ̶T̶r̶u̶m̶p̶'̶s̶ ̶W̶a̶l̶l̶ ̶b̶u̶t̶ ̶j̶u̶s̶t̶ ̶p̶o̶i̶n̶t̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶g̶e̶t̶ ̶w̶h̶i̶l̶e̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶t̶u̶r̶n̶s̶ ̶e̶v̶e̶r̶y̶t̶h̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶n̶t̶o̶ ̶g̶i̶b̶l̶e̶t̶s̶ G5000 Ion Cannon. The aliens are also have more variety, a step up from the original, from generic spidery aliens and some notable ones from the original to mecha-Transformer suit wearing aliens with ion cannons. There are also traps abound, from thorn-like plants to green-containers that spew green goo which acts like acid and cause damage if you step on it. However, the main thing that hooks people in (including me back then) is the action. Non-stop action, gun-blazing with almost endless aliens in the screen running towards you with 1 goal in sight. I can say that this was part of the positive traits that why I loved the original, and somewhat enjoyed this sequel. At one point in a level late in the game, there were so much alien teleporters, spawning aliens with rocket launchers, spitting acid, and firing ions shooting at me that I just blindly use my trusty M̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶e̶x̶p̶e̶n̶s̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶n̶ ̶T̶r̶u̶m̶p̶'̶s̶ ̶W̶a̶l̶l̶ ̶b̶u̶t̶ ̶j̶u̶s̶t̶ ̶p̶o̶i̶n̶t̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶g̶e̶t̶ ̶w̶h̶i̶l̶e̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶t̶u̶r̶n̶s̶ ̶e̶v̶e̶r̶y̶t̶h̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶n̶t̶o̶ ̶g̶i̶b̶l̶e̶t̶s̶ G5000 Ion Cannon. After ten minutes (which seems like an eternity), the battleground is quiet, and I faced the last boss. Of course, going down at 1/2 health is just a gimmick. Surprise! More aliens! D:After a few more minutes, teleporters destroyed, 80,000+ aliens harmed-most of them turned into giblets-and the final boss falls! Oh, oh, almost forgot, before the last level, there is a juncture where you have to make a decision, which will lead to different outcome, and a great addition. :D Nonetheless, one thing that they haven't fully fixed from the original is the alien pathing, as they will get stuck by trees and corners allowing players to reduce the numbers slightly using explosive weapons, for example. Still, while this game is 10 years old (gasp!) and can still run on Windows 2000 (!) it provides lots of action and entertainment for anyone who enjoys playing top-down shooting games. It also have other features like survival mode for those who liked more challenges.P.s. I wonder, how long would the Viscera Cleanup team take to clean the last level in this game? :P "

												Aliens Shooter 2: Reloaded is a game that throws hordes and hordes of enemies at the player until every inch of the level is covered in their blood and entrails. The developer clearly wanted to make a game that has constant action and they achieved that. This game barely has a moment without combat, which I like as sometimes it is nice to play a game that is just crazy gameplay. The player will constantly be backpedaling as they shoot the endless waves of aliens, somewhat like Smash TV. When the player kills a significant number of enemies, they level up and are given 5 skill points per level to improve the character's stats. For example, the player can upgrade their 'accuracy' stat which dictates how much damage the player will do. The player can also improve their health, strength, speed, intelligence and a 'special' skill such as health regeneration. The player can also manage an inventory and buy items from a shop located in every level. The aforementioned features are the RPG elements of this game - very light RPG elements I might add. If you're looking for a game with deep stat customization or indepth weapon info, you'll be disappointed with this game. I think the RPG elements in this game are perfect for an arcade shooter such as this one. The story is simple: evil corporation delves into the unknown and brings forth human killing aliens. Your job is to investigate what happened and eradicate all alien life, discreetly of course. Weyland Yu- excuse me, M.A.G.M.A. corp will be the majority of the locations you visit. Labs, armories and sewers. The voice acting is pretty bad and gives off a 'cheap' vibe but I believe it is forgivable considering the main point of the game is to blast aliens to smithereens and the developers are a very small team of Russians. The music is good! They advertise it as dynamic but this basically means that the game will begin playing 'action' music during battles and atmospheric music during non-combat sections. The action music is catchy and nice to blast aliens to, while the atmospheric music is even better and as it is actually creepy and gives off a horror vibe. The player will hear distant roars, buzzing and generally the noises of dread. Love it. Graphics are not bad but obviously not good either. What annoyed me is the fact that the game doesn't include a 1920 x 1080 resolution, which is strange considering it was developed in 2007. So expect aliased graphics. Besides that, the enviroments do look good. The labs are realistic but appear fictional at the same time, the alien design is reminiscent of aliens from other works of fiction but overall I liked it. The gore is fantastic and it will never get old blowing a hole in an alien's stomach. The game isn't very long, only about 5 hours on normal difficulty but the player can lengthen this by playing on a harder difficulty. There is two submodes called Stand Firm and Gun Stand but only Gun Stand is worth playing. Basically you defend a spot against alien waves and upgrade your turret. I recommend this game if you enjoy games like Smash TV or arcade shooters.6/10			"

												A Fantastic top down arcade shooter with some RPG mechanics thrown in. Great weapons and visuals if somewhat dated. If you feel like jumping into something where you can slaughter hundreds of enemies with blood 'n guts, explosions and nuclear powered miniguns :3 This will definitely be your bag.Final Score: 79/100			"

												Alien Shooter, one of my favorite games from my childhood. The game was released about 10 years ago. And yes, it has ugly graphics for today's standards, but it is actually so much fun playing this game. The game view takes place from an isometric angle and you control your character with the tasks of cleaning the laboratories. Just as its name implies, you shoot at aliens. There are a bunch of choices of weapons in the game. From small arms like handguns and shotguns, to ultimate weapons such as rocket launchers and framer. There are more than 1,000 monsters on each map, showing up to 100 monsters simultaneously on one playing screen. Blood is everywhere! Yay, Alien Shooter is a perfect game for you to satisfy your lust for blood.			"

												Even though a lot of time have passed since its release, this game is still a small diamond in my eyes. Back when i was 11 it was my game I've played with and after so many years, I still find this game entertaining (especially on harder difficulty levels). It has an ""ok"" replayability, because you can run through the game again and find every single secret place and kill every monster, though if you've done that already there's not many reasons to replay the game other than trying a harder difficulty.The second thing I miss from this release is the multiplayer/coop (It was avaliable in Alien Shooter : Vengeance). It would be a lot of fun going through the game with one of your friends, especially if the game would multiply the enemies depending on the number of players.Overall, in my opinion this game is worth a  7 out of 10  in it's category.

												In the later missions (levels) , it is literally Alien Shooter. Yes, Alien shoots you.Okay, that unfunny joke is out of the list--I played the first Alien Shooter (not the Revisited), and I could finish it a day or two days. There are three types of AS2 (I think) , which is Consription, Reloaded, and just basically Alien Shooter 2. There are no interesting facts or trivia or comparison that I'm going to tell you here, I just don't know what's the differences between those three (Sorry for wasting your time). Now with this Reloaded-sequel-thingy, damn, it really inject those suspense-tension moments when the Aliens try to overrun you. In this game, money is like your secondary HP. Money is very (very) important, so here's a tip, choose the Economist or the-money-symbol perk. It would help you out SO MUCH. Drones are worth the money. Go buy one. DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE (the number on the top right of your screen). I recommend you buy night-vision. One more thing, don't forget to shoot those cracked walls. ;)Pros:+It's a shooter and action game (so you could meet them aliens right after short introduction).+Triggers your 'save-mode' on funds (basically thrifty).+Enhance your senses of the surroundings (makes your human-sense tingling).+I like how my antique-spec can run this game at 45~60fps (my PC don't even have Nvidia or AMD, it uses Intel Family Express Chipset. My PC can't run or even launch GTA San Andreas >;/).+Varieties of characters, perks, armors, weapons, flashlights, and many items to choose from!+Secret areas (it usually unlocks after you completed the mission, so go explore after you shoots those aliens). Ahh, the DOOM nostalgia feels.+I'm weak-willed, and that moment where the aliens starts to overrun you, and you're alone (I mean no AIs accompany you), ohhhh, god damn. The pressure, intense, suspense. It is creepy.+Makes you carefully choose your decisions (buy shotgun or rifles, that sort of stuffs).+Did I already told you, that you can use vehicles?+ALL HAIL THE HOLY TURRET (One-hit K.O!)+GOD BLESS, CARMAGEDDON! (that's what I call, it rams alien, one hit-k.o with overpowered mounted-turret bullets)+Ammos are reasonable (easy to find, ammos at the shop is cheap).+No DLCs ;)+Graphics are upgraded (compared to AS1)Cons:-Stale or poor storyline.-The voice acting and the dialogue transition is a cringefest (for me).-Later missions, you will find an alien shaped like a dinosaur wears a rocket launcher machine, shoots rockets at you rapidly (kinda impossible to beat it because your bullet kinda hits the hordes and waves of aliens, you could say it's a mini-boss and I bought the $12,000+ rifle and I'm on Medium).-Basically, sometimes it's more to impossible than challenging.-How do you make AS2:R windowed?-Camera angle is weird (the angle blocks your view occasionally).-No achievements :O (more to personal opinion than cons)-No online co-op or PvP?-Ranged aliens is imbalanced in my opinion, because of the high HP and high damage output.I think that's it.Score:'9/10' - Why you still reading this? Go buy this game (well i get this for free in giveaways days ago ;p) !			"

												Larger and more in-depth than the first remake, Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded packs a nice amount of fun into an incredibly small package. For only five bucks, you're receiving a dozen hours of solid alien blasting play, as well as some decent survival mode features. I still wish that there was co-op, improved visuals or more modes to play through, but this is a definite improvement for the franchise and a step in the right direction from Sigma Team.			"

												Now this is an improvement over the first part in the series. Better in every regard. Pimped graphics, sounds and gameplay.This is one of the most atmospheric top down shooters on the market. Think of the new Alien Breed Trilogy but with isometric graphics.This game is solid as a rock.Totally recommended, though I think it's a little overpriced. Maybe because of lack of competition?On a discount you should totally get this if you enjoyed games like Alien Breed or Crack Down back in the days.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Topdown action game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is a difficulty Level settings available.There is an effect volume slidebar available.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is a voice volume slidebar available.You are able to toggle Subtitles.You are able to change and customize the controls on the keyboard.There are only 2 resolution sizes available. 800x600 and 1024x768.About the game.This is one of those classic oldschool games. I haven't tried the game before. You are able to choose a male or a female character. Including which perk. (Like Medic or a fighter etc). Male and females have different attributes and starting stats. So you might have to search around abit. You are able to place some points in the attributes from the beginning. The first thing what i have noticed that objects loves to block your way. You can ""walk"" it aside slowly.  You are trying to find out what has happend. (but judging by the title, you might know it already). You have to solve objectives and kill aliens. And ofcourse stay alive. You can find secret area's, destroy crates for items and you will see your statistics at the end of each level. I really like the lightning effect in this game.Text is pretty small and Flat. Because of the resolution size.There is a small manual of controls once you are in-game, This show only once howeverItems has green indications.Character is able to level up.There are secret locations.The game is not super optimized and could give lagg. (i have a powerful PC)I suppose the graphics is decent for this old game.Decent light atmosphere.There are some Guide lines. But they can be overlooked.Animations are pretty stiff and has No to a little movement.Other things.I shot a table... It exploded... (unless the hitbox was extremely off and a red barrel has exploded)It is one of those games, That you HAVE to like. This game might not be in everyone's flavor.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												Fun game.Its a isometric run and gun shooter with extreme gore.The game looks are pretty simple and all the monster are pixel based. The good part about that is that you dont need a good computer to render many enemies, you can have several predefined death animations and bodies stay on ground until the level ends. So if you if you go into a clean environment and kill a 100 aliens there, its going to look like a mess...Light RPG elements, lots of weapons to choose from, static guns, car guns and tanks. I had fun playing this game. Just remember to go into AlienShooter.cfg to turn vsync off (performance issues, not a ingame option) and change to a slightly better resolution, i used 1440x900 on a 24"".			"

												When we did a series of videos on this game, people thought we were playing a game from the old Amiga days, the top down excitement of this game and the endless hoardes of enemies result in a doom esq feeling that so far i havnt seen replicated anywhere else. A cheap game that gives you a huge amount of entertainment for your bucks and also provides some of the most frantic excalations around. loads of great guns (my personal fave being the shotgun as it has that solid clunk noise form Doom) and loads of levels means this is something you can play for some time and most importantly plays perfectly on tablets so sit back and enjoy a slaughterhouse of alien dead keeping humanity safe.

												8/10The first Alien Shooter was already quite a good game. This sequel was even better.It maintains the base gameplay of the original game - move around, aim with the mouse, shoot aliens. However, it also includes more things that make the game much more interesting. Attributes weigh quite heavily on gameplay, hence leveling up really does make a difference. The perks are quite interesting and varied.The best of all is actually the variety of weapons. Even among weapons of the same type (shotguns, automatic weapons, etc), there's often a large difference as they vary heavily on damage, reload times, fire rate and accuracy. The game actually makes the player want to purchase new weapons and test them out against enemies - and some weapons are just crazy fun to use (the miniguns are a personal favorite of mine).Bigger variety of enemies and the addition of vehicles are also considerable improvements.Camera is still an issue. Just like its predecessor, camera angle is fixed and there's no transparency effect, meaning there are items and enemies that may be behind walls and the player won't be able to see these.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E6 Alien and Zombie Shooter 2 

			Views: 1,119		

			Both of these games are awesome and worth the small price, if you really like one maybe consider getting both, otherwise just test out the demos for what looks most interesting for you and stick with...		

Alien Shooter 2 Reloaded: A fun run and gun that offers some really cool ideas like bigger and badder guns, power armor and giving your little guy a badass look. Taking some points for RPGs and letting you upgrade your own equipment and stats, turning you into one powerful mutha whose gonna kickass and chew bubble gum. Only $5.00 USD regular on steam and it is well under a gigabyte of space. Always wait on sale but not a bad purchase and you can easily spend the hours over what you paid for, in comparison to games at release that are full price. Check out the demo on steam and if you like what you see i'd say give it a shot. -Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												When we did a series of videos on this game, people thought we were playing a game from the old Amiga days, the top down excitement of this game and the endless hoardes of enemies result in a doom esq feeling that so far i havnt seen replicated anywhere else. A cheap game that gives you a huge amount of entertainment for your bucks and also provides some of the most frantic excalations around. loads of great guns (my personal fave being the shotgun as it has that solid clunk noise form Doom) and loads of levels means this is something you can play for some time and most importantly plays perfectly on tablets so sit back and enjoy a slaughterhouse of alien dead keeping humanity safe.

												This game is awesome,really...I don't care about graphics,because gameplay & story is awesome! What i also like about this game is shop (for buying a lot of guns and armour,flashlight and more..) and a lot of diffrent characters,and every character has a diffrent stats than other characters.Also upgrading your stats in game (health,strenght and other..) is really good..I finished campagin and i tried survival (for me the best mod)..It has a lot of fun misions,for example you can drive cars with miniguns on them and shoot in the same time! I really recomend this game to everyone,it's worth trying :)			"

												The game was made on a budget, had an awful story with some generic and predictable characters, awful voice acting and dialog, and is awfully short.Good thing the gameplay is all about one thing. Hold down the left mouse button, and watch some of the most satisfyingly bloody, brutal, and gory games I have ever seen from a top down shooter. On an average level, you will kill up to 500+ aliens on a screen, with lottle to no slowdown. Highly recommended if you just want to satisfy your action craving.			"

												I normally don't take the time to write a review, but it's one of those few games that keep you wanting to play one more mission. Story is decent, Graphics could be better, but it adds to the atmosphere rather well. Believe me when I say there will be soo many aliens coming at you will forget about that nonsense quickly. Whole areas will turn into grave yards of bones and flesh.The action gets bigger, and bigger, and crazier. My only major complaint is no co-op :( 2-4 player co-op would be extremely fun.			"

												There are reasons to like the game, but really the implementation is really poor. Be ready to lose a lot of progress because you cannot save and neither does the game tell you when it has saved. To go again through the 6th mission does not seem fun at all. Tedious job.			"

												The should've published ""Alien Shooter 2: Repaired"" edition.I don't care how much fun turning hundreds of non-descript abominations into hot, chunky paste with bullets is - if you plan to start the hunt for hidden secrets (to survive on higher difficulties), then prepare to get stuck a lot in the walls and restarting an entire level, sometimes, right near the end of it. Frustratingly, it happened, like, 3 times in a row in my game.Christ, I loved the Alien Shooter series as a teen. Seemingly, had a lot more patience for bцllshit like this back then.			"

												Alien Shooter 2 actually manages to be the best game I've ever played from Sigma Team. Not that that's saying much, they make some truly dreadful games. But it is still on the higher end of the mediocrity scale where they usually hang dangerously close to the truly abysmal end. They fixed the length of the game and gave it some proper RPG progression mechanics as well as a secrets system to encourage obsessive compulsive disorder. It is better than Zombie Shooter 2, more refined but it is still just another Sigma Team money grab.If you got it from the Indie Gala bundle then enjoy it for the few hours you can. If you bought it full price then you're an idiot and should not procreate.Also, it might be worth to try it, just for the voice acting which is truly in a league of it's own. It is actually so low on the scale it becomes a negative and in a weird way that actually makes it worth listening to just to be able to say you've done it.			"

												If there's one word that can describe this game: ""mindless"".  If I could use two, it would be ""mindless distraction"".I barely remember the plot at all, and the parts that I did gather did not make a whole lot of sense.Gameplay wise the most complicated ""tactic"" is to blow up barrels.  All upgrades are simply improvements over the previous firearm/armor.  There's no thinking required.But if you love holding down the mouse key and blowing up swarms of recolored enemies, then this game might be for you.  It's sort of theraputic actually.Worth it if you can get it on sale.  I figure it's worth about $3 of fun.  Really I'm only writing this review because of a personal mission to review every game I own on Steam.			"

												""90% of 170 reviews liked this game"" LOL this♥♥♥♥♥♥is awful. Anyone who likes this trash is really dumb.Exactly the same game as Zombie Shooter 2, which I have beaten because of my ocd despite it sucking bum nuts, but with aliens! Its max res is 1024x768 which blows, but I have a 39"" monitor so I can still see a big game area. The problem is that this game sucks so bad I didn't want to play for more than ten minutes. I learned with Zombie Shooter 2 that these games have to have vsync turned off or it will be an unplayable stutterfest. This game does not have the option to turn vsync off so I had to do so through my Nvidia control panel which isn't a big deal. Normally vsync has to be on or else the screen tears so badly in games that they are unplayable, but you can't notice it in this game unless the screen is shaking from explosions which happened a lot in the first level....2/10 mindless generic made-in-a-day bottom-rate alien killing. If this took more than one person and one day to make, those people should all be ashamed. These games from this company ♥♥♥♥ing suck. Low budget garbage. Maybe next time don't make games while hammered out of your minds on booze and heroin, queers.			"

												I got this quadrilogy on special for 5bux a while ago and this game is the best of them. There's loads of character customization with room for multiple playthroughs depending on how you build your BALD. Chock full of old-school gameplay, bad dialogue, the worse voice acting since sega CD, the fun of this game comes from chewing through waves of cannon fodder with bigger and more ridiculous weaponry. The other games in this pack are okay, however Alien Shooter: Revisited is just a remake of the original and Zombie Shooter is just Alien Shooter... but with zombies.			"

												The creators of this game mustve been so ♥♥♥♥ing high that they forgot how games work. 1st of all the most common enemy IS NOT SUPPOSE TO BE BOSSES and if for some dumb reason they ARE why not give the player a large amount of ammo? I cannot count how many times ive run out of ammo fighting ONE enemy just to finally kill it and then fight a LITERAL ARMY of the same ♥♥♥♥ing enemy. 2nd why are there enemies with super low health and then enemies with extremely hilarious HUGE amounts of health. Some of the strongest weapons in the game TICKLE most enemies. Finally why would the creators think to give the aliens RANGED WEAPONS!?! The player is already extremely outnumbered in numbers and strength, WHY DOES THE PLAYER NEED TO BE OUTNUMEBERED IN WEAPONS. It's almost like an ant trying to kill an army of elephents with a tiny feather. The people who created this game were probably new at it because this game isnt called Bossfight Simulator(Rage Editon), it's Alien Shooter 2. Anyone reading this dont waste your time and money with this game just to end up raging and trashing your room and probably even killing someone out of rage.			"

												I was never interested in this game, but when I saw it was for free, I noticed I couldn't buy it (even if I wanted to). Which tells me how little the developers care about their customers. They abandoned this game, obviously.Just because of that, I'm giving the game a negative review.And well, because the game has a really bad design (but I'm not complaining about it being old), just really bad graphic design. And also, the game is just too simple. If you like challenges, this is not a game for you, don't buy it. Too easy and gets boring really fast. "

												If mindless shooters are your thing this it. Otherwise it's♥♥♥♥♥♥... maybe the♥♥♥♥♥prints I left beg to differ, but this game does bog down into ridiculous amounts of enemies; seriously, humans didn't invent a number for the amount of enemies you kill.. Combat is highly repetitive, objectives are along the lines of ""shoot this, kill that, bring me my brown pants"". Plot ... lol. Then again, the weapon/armor item system is nice: shotguns, rifles, sniper rifle, grenade launcher, LASERS, LASER CANNONS, rocket launchers, grenades, mines. Plenty of stuff to shoot with. The character traits you choose make a difference  like better aiming, criticals or just plain building a tank to punch the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything that skitters. A great way to spend a few hours and the price is acceptable. Average game.			"

												Pretty good and a worthy sequel to the original game. Expect tons of aliens and some really sweet guns with flashy effects to take up some of your time. This time around we also get to use Cars and even a Tank to destroy hordes of aliens plus the graphics and atmosphere have been improved! get it if comes up on sale! 8/10			"

												Copy pasta from Alien Shooter 1 review...    This too is a game I played a lot back when it came out.   I only show 3.1 hours playing this, however prior to owning it on Steam I played it a LOT.   This and the 1st game really make me happy when I get the stray chance to play them.  The best description I can think of would be Serious Sam + Fallout (1 or 2) had a SECOND baby (lol) back in 2009 and named it Alien Shoot 2.   It's a brilliant and timeless game that I can go back to over and over and over.   This and the 1st game of course.  It's not for everyone as the graphics are somewhat dated and the story is a little hokey at times.  However it's a lot of fun.   Thanks again Sigma Team.			"

												I wasn't sure what I could expect from Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded. I mean, I spend really many hours playing the first Alien Shooter game - more than 10 years ago when it was added in certain gaming magazine in my country and not so long ago when I get my copy on Steam. So, here I am, after finishing this game. It looks same. It's same gameplay. You could say, the time stopped for this one, even if it was released around 6 years after first game... BUT, there is something that, even tho it's feels old and nostalgic, gives something refreshing. New aliens, new variety of weapons, new level up system, new vehicles, new shooting mode. Yes, a good old game that was improved on so many levels. You can complain about story, about voices or dunno what more BUT that doesn't change one fact - it's still solid and great fun game when it comes to gameplay.If you ever loved first Alien Shooter game, you must play it. Not sure if new players would be pleased with this kind of games in times when, sadly, games are focusing on everything but not on pure fun of playing. I know I will replay it at once when I will feel hunger for some intense action and simply fun of killing tons of aliens.			"

												Bigger and better Alien Shooter game. This is a huge improvement from part 1 of the series as we have lots of new stuff here, including:- different categories of weapons- levelling system where we actually allocate points in a simple system- we can choose perk at the beginning- plot is simple but okBe warned though - this is not as brainless shooter as part 1. This is a pretty long game when we consider the genre. Where part 1 was mass shooter, here we have more of a linear plot-driven shooter with lots of enemies.If you like Alien Shooter 1 then you can play this one too. If you would like a quick session of alien killing go fo Theseus Return of the Hero instead.Pros:- lots of secrets (like 17 for one level!)- lite sci-fi plot- lots of weapons- levelling system is ok- even pistols are useful- you can drive a car and control a robot later in the game- graphics are quite ok for such a game and may resemble some older rpgsCons:- it's really long for an isometric shooter- some levels are overly big- it can get repetitive pretty fast, as you could have guessed - there are parts where it is best to stand still and fry aliens for about 2 minutes- not really hard if you don't rush your way into alien horde If you feel that Sigma Team shooters are fine then play this one as well. It's really ok.---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												Guaranteed ""Shooter"" series ""twinstick"" fun, but feels like less than the sum of its parts as the new mechanics and features mostly make the game less enjoyable. If Zombie Shooter is 3 or 4/5, this definitely felt more like 2 or 3/5.+Still mostly the same entertaining monster grinding gorefest as in all the games of the series+Nice lighting effects+Hilariously bad voice acting and writing...-...which is also just cringeworthy at times-Despite being a 2010 game, there is no proper resolution support beyond 1024x768. Can be fiddled with to work in 1080p or beyond but the end result is not very good-The more detailed graphics make the game look like unclear brown or green mush at times-Absolutely abysmal vehicle controls-Player still gets stuck in places and can even exit the game area on some levels simply due to bad collision design-The new mechanics in inventory, attribute and weapon systems don't really add anything worthwhile to the game and just make it feel slightly less fluid-Sounds occasionally go missing as if there are not enough sound channels			"

												This is the best s**t game you will ever play. It is hilariously worth the money. It sounds harsh to say this game is s**t, but when you look at it objectively, practically everything is bad.The story literally seems to change script halfway through....and both scripts are terrible anyway. The voice acting is so bad I genuinely can't tell if they're the worst VA's doing a terrible job, or the best VA's doing an amazing job of sounding like they're some sort of hammy B-movie terrible. The graphics are low res, and not in a charming, deliberate Terraria way, but a 'this engine sucks and we're a team of carefree chancers' kind of way.But dear God the gameplay, it just works. There's lots of delicious little details that conspire together to make this game just a pleasure to play even though it's generally the kind of janky product Jim Sterling concerns himself with on Greenlight. The graphics may be generally humdrum at best, but then you start mowing down vast hordes of aliens and the visceral way they come apart is.....glorious. It's just so satisfying. And the sound, it's mostly pretty threadbare, but it proves that all you really need to feel good in life are decent, gutsy weapons sounds you'll never tire of as you march through every level with an increasingly overpowered arsenal of automatic shotguns, miniguns, and energy cannons.You're not going to sink your life into this game, you can complete a whole campaign for yourself in an afternoon once you know what you're doing, but this shoddy, thrown together mess of a game actually manages to have some serious lessons to teach about how you make it fun to massacre thousands of enemies again and again and again.Tough it through the surprisingly unforgiving at times initial stages of the campaign, and you too can discover the simple joy of sweeping your mouse lazily over a few hundred enemies and watching your minigun tear them to pieces in seconds.....you know, like better single player games never seem to give us, because they don't understand that sometimes balance should play second fiddle to fun.

												Based heavily on the GOG.com (DRM-free) release of Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded.Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded is a definite enhancement on what was good about the first Alien Shooter game. The graphics are noticeably easier on the eyes. Environments are larger, with plenty of 'sub areas' encouraging exploration. Missions now have secondary objectives and side missions which grant cool new items. There are now more playable characters with their own specialized attributes. There's now a Perks system for granting different advantages early in. That which wasn't broke wasn't fixed, and that which could be improved upon was improved upon very nicely.			"

 Solid game for a cheap price You will get around 10h of fun with it. That fun consists from killing hords of enemys with traditional weapons you can see in games (Pistols, Automatic weapons, Shotguns, Explosives and you will get energy weapons as it is set in future). Graphics are nice if you like retro style. Only downside is that maximum resolution is 1028p so it wont run on fullscrean. As far as replayabilty of a game goes it isnt huge but you may wish to keep it instaled for those times you just have to kill 100 aliens per sec			"
