												-Large, sandy desert-Bandits and psychos everywhere-Redneck car dealers-Alien creatures out to kill you at all times-87 bazillion gunsMan, Texas sure is greatEDIT: 15/01/2015So, it's come to my attention that this review, which initially began as a joke, has become tremendously popular on the store page (huge thanks to all who voted so positively!) so I decided I should actually include something in this review to keep it helpful to newcomers or fans coming off of Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel.What is it that keeps Borderlands so good to come back to, and compulsively play on a consistent basis? If you were to ask me this question, there would be no way I would know how to respond simply. But, I can at least try to break it down.Gameplay-wise, Borderlands has all the fundamentals of an FPS, shooting feels good and there's a wide range of guns with a unique feel to all of them (more on that later) without sacrificing movement. FPS makes up the core gameplay and how you interact with the world and NPCs in terms of combat, and it feels fantastic. However, the RPG elements are what give this game that extra depth that stops it from being 'just another' shooter. Every character has unique perks and skill trees that can be customised in different ways to alter general combat and your unique action skill. It keeps combat fresh and skills balance across characters really well. You might not see trees as unique as Zer0 or Krieg from Borderlands 2 but you can expect deep customisation nonetheless. No one character defines a playstyle, any of the four can be decked out with the according loot to keep you tanky, but the action skills and trees prevent the protagonists from feeling same-y.Storyline wise don't expect a deep tale, or even a sweeping adventurous romp like Borderlands 2. Instead, Borderlands goes for a strong atmosphere communicated through mission structure and world design, and yet I have no complaints about this lack of story. Gearbox balanced innumerable quests with a consistent world to combine for a truly unique experience. This is a game that, thanks to an RPG quest system, lets you get out there in the game world and get lost in it doing missions for insane amounts of time but lets you stay immersed in the storyline and world at the same time.Now, the meat of Borderlands. Let's be honest, RPGs have had shooter elements before, but, in my opinion, never has an inventory system in an RPG felt this good. Borderlands has my favourite inventory/loot system because it cuts the crap and gets right to the stuff you care about: guns, guns, guns! Don't expect to be picking up some arbitrary ""Lord Generic's Gold Coin #74 with Blue Palette"" to sell later. Borderlands gives you gear you use practically, and can sell for money. Expect to pick up grenade modifications, shields, class modifications which power up your skill trees even further and of course, guns. Perhaps what keeps the loot so good in Borderlands 1 as compared to 2 and Pre-Sequel is how they function relative to your character's level. I love Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel, but I found myself selling guns a lot more than in BL1, because Gearbox opted for a more balanced weapon system. Borderlands 1 has a different experience to opening loot chests. You could open something and still have the same giddy eagerness as when you first opened one in your early hours with the game because genuinely powerful and versatile weapons can be found. This is due to levelling and some manufacturers having incredibly unique traits that set them far above other manufacturers. Take, for example, the fact I own a Hyperion shotgun with a level 15 requirement that I still use on my level 44 Mordecai and you get an incredible idea of what this game can offer you. Not to mention the amount of guns outnumbers Borderlands 2 by around 3 million (5 mil vs 8 mil) and this game keeps a lot to see in it. Like the other Borderlands games there's a lot to see in the way of second playthroughs, offering more quests, even better loot and more challenging enemies.I feel as though my review barely scratches the surface even after typing all of this, but overall, I highly recommend you purchase this game if you want to get lost and spend countless hours in one of the deepest shooters I've played this past decade.10/10, would fight Texans again and again and again.

												This game is not like any other Shooter, it mixes with RPG-like elements to create an ultimate gaming experience. I love the cartoon-like environment and the story about this planet of Pandora. Even if you beat the game, you can do it all again with harder enemies and better loot and I certainly did it because it was so fun. This game is one of my all-time favourites and for the sale price it was totally worth it.I would recommend it to any gamer.			"

												Let me start out by saying that I do not like shooters.  1st person, 3rd person, or whatever.  I have never liked shooters.  My son came to visit and brought his Xbox 360 and he said he had a game that if I would give it a chance, he was sure I would like it at least enough to play with him when he came to visit.  When he loaded up Borderlands, my first reaction was ""Oh God!  A Shooter.""  I reminded him that I didn't like this kind of game at all.  He talked me into trying.  He suggested that I play Mordecai.  To make a long story short, within an hour I was so hooked I lost all track of time.  Between the pop culture knods and puns from my era (the story writers have GOT to be close to my age... which we won't mention what is) and the shere enjoyment of the game itself, it felt like we had only played an hour or so and I looked at the clock and it was 7 hours later!  I went on to play the 2nd AND the presequel!  I am still not very big on shooters, but I am at least a little more open to them because of this game and my son's persistance.  Borderlands have you laughing hard one second and then wondering ""what the heck!?"" the next.  The story is extremely engrossing, and the characters very relatable in their actions and motivations.  When you get to the end (is there actually and end??)  You will feel like you have acomplished the unachievable.  If you are even looking at this game and wondering, I have only two words:  ""BUY IT!""  Whatever genre is your preference, you will fall in love with it!			"

												I loved this game, the mix with FPS and RPG is just fantastic, and the fact that you can level your character and spend points in your talents tree is awesome! The art is great as well, and there are lots and lots of different weapons that you can try, until you find one that you really like! Playing by yourself is great, but it's a lot more fun when you play it with friends, the enemies get tougher and the loot gets better. 100% recommended!			"

												I don't know why I love this game. It is so totally asocial that it's a little bit sick. But I guess there come times in everyone's life when the only thing that suits your mood is to melt the faces off some midgets with a gun that shoots acid, or set bandits on fire and listen to your character laugh her head off as your victims run around screaming ""Mommy, mommy!"" It shouldn't be funny, but it's as funny as hell. It has some absolutely classic characters, not only in the main players like the siren Lilith, who has a ghastly giggle every time she hurts someone REALLY badly and who will abuse you if you leave her on hold too long, but also Dr. Patricia Tannis, the insane archeologist whose only reflection when a colleague is devoured alive by one of the local animals is ""He always had the more comfortable chair....I took his chair,"" Scooter, who could so easily have become a simple hick parody but turns out a great deal more, and funnier; and General ""Doesn't Like Mondays"" Knoxx, who is condemned to the hell of being commanded by a six year old child who outranks him because of nepotism gone insane. Just don't expect redeeming social value, unless there's some redeeming social value in getting rid of your less healthy desires in a relatively harmless way.			"

												Growing up on games like Quake and Diablo really helped me to appreciate the greatness of Borderlands. There’s been a lot of games that have tried to pull off genre hybrids, but they either fail to deliver or just fail to program a game correctly. Borderlands is one of the few games that manages to feel like an RPG and a FPS at the same time.Coming from a shooter side, the game is a very fun classic style shooter, meaning that the realism has been replaced with you getting to unload a clip into someone before dropping them. Sniper head-shots can generally take a foe down with one shot, but most all other guns are going to require you to get dirty. It feels an awful lot like a classic Quake shooter too. It’s just action based. Your ‘cover’ system is generally using you strafe and jump at the right time. By all means, this a welcome to some older gamers since most of today’s games are just striving to hit a certain realistic feel.From an RPG point, the game does take a few tumbling points in certain areas. The biggest problem is the skill tree. It’s pretty bare and some of the skills just feel useless. There’s also not enough skills to pin you into one type of character. Are you a Hunter looking to just be the stay-back sniper? Well, you can max those skills out but you can’t invest only points into one branch. It would have been nice to borrow a few more of the Diablo elements, allowing you to create an amazingly unique character from branches. Instead, you’re left feeling a bit underwhelmed by the skills. The only other problem with the RPG element is the characters all feel about the same. My Hunter manages to be a jack-of-all-trades character instead of just a hunter. While I might technically do more damage with a sniper rifle, my dark-orange rare machine gun that does 4x fire damage is going to take down the enemies faster. While these two things are a bit critical, the rest of the action role-playing feels genuine. Looting is fun; leveling up is fun; and having a huge inventory is very nice.From a graphic standpoint, this might not be a masterpiece, and some may feel a little turned off by the cartoony look, but by all means, you can at least distinguish this title from the other 90% of shooters that look like Modern Warfare clones. The one problem with the game’s graphics is some unstable frame rates, mainly when there’s a lot of blood on screen, a lot of elemental damage, or just towards the end of the game. It’s not unplayable, but the slowdowns shouldn’t be happening at all. Aside from that, it’s a nice refreshing look and feels more like a video game than a simulator.There’s a story to the game, but even after playing through the game two times, I don’t think I could tell you what it’s about other than treasure hunting. Personally, I think the lack of story kept me more interested. I wasn’t worried about progressing to the end as much as I was trying to kill as many things as I could to find the next best weapon. While the story lacks in a big way, it would be nice to have a bit more of it in the next title release.Where most people are probably going to go wrong with this title is trying to play this game as a single player game. Don’t bother. This was meant to be a co-op game. It’s like playing Left 4 Dead alone. It’s possible, but you’re going to actually enjoy playing the game when you have friends around. A benefit of having more friends play with you is that the game rewards you with more rare items. Plus, if you want to break away from the typical gameplay, they’ve installed arenas around the area to help you test out your gear against other foes, or to just play a little smack down with a friend.And for you achievement/trophy treasure finders out there, this title is pretty easy to get 100% in. What’s more interesting is the Medals (or challenges) you can try for with each character. Trying to get 2,000 head-shots or get the max number of cash in the game is wildly fun. It actually feels more like an extra quest in the game, since each challenge gives you a nice pot of experience points.My final thoughts on the game: it’s a fantastic game, and for a new IP, it’s refreshing to see that there’s companies that still want to bring new or greatly tweaked genres to the table. While there’s some work to be done in some areas, the game had me fork over $60 and supplied me with $100 worth of entertainment.			"

												Do you like GUNS?! Do you like Loot?!Well boy do I have a game for you! Gearbox and 2K's Borderland game is essentially just that - game based around guns and loot, and yet as you play you're invited into the very believable and 'live' world of Pandora. It's not long at all before you realise that this is more than your basic FPS, sure it has the First-Person viewpoint, and you, er, shoot, but there's an adventure in here too. It's rare that a FPS shooter has characters and humor injected into as rich as Borderlands, and looking back from when I originally played this on the 360, I'm not sure I've really played a game like it since.It blends FPS and RPG elements together, and embraces our natural greed for better loot, to provide what I can only describe as a really fun time. It might have aged terribly since I last played, it and Borderlands 2 (and it's endless DLC) has been released since then too, but the first Borderlands game will always have a place in my games collection. It was one of the first fun Co-Op experiences I had, which in part was due to the 4 unique characters you could play as. Each character had their own traits and specialist role within a team, but could be equally as well-rounded if you played Solo. So you never really felt like you had 'picked the wrong class' when playing. Sure the game would change slightly depending on who you picked due to that character's 'natural' play style shaped by their traits and abilities, but nothing that would make the game less enjoyable.In essence you had the Soldier, The Sniper, The Tank & The Magic classes to choose from. Each class comes with a speciality ability, and there are 3 seperate talent trees to spend skill points in to allow you to customise your characters abilities somewhat. The way the Co-op System worked was interesting, and one I wish was used more often. Every game you had saved was YOUR game, and it was up to you if you wanted your friends to join in and help YOU out in YOUR game. So you could play Solo and progress, or you could call in your friends and progress. The game wouldn't progress without you being there, so there was no real need to worry about slowing down other people's progress due to other commitments. Sadly, the PC version of Borderlands seems to come with a really terrible gamespy client that is hard to navigate compared to the Xbox360 Party System, which can at times make finding a party difficult and irritating. As mentioned previously, the ship might have sailed on Borderlands due to Borderlands 2 being released, but I still enjoyed it and for those with an older PC unable to run Borderlands 2 this might still be worth checking out if you're looking to scratch an itch when it comes to collecting guns...

												Commonly described as Diablo with guns, Borderlands can't really be explained by comparing it to other games. The closest you could probably get is Hellgate: London (as long as you were playing one of the gun/first-person shooter classes), but even then there are some pretty major differences.If you haven't been paying attention to this game at all, Borderlands is a first-person shooter with action role-playing elements. You choose from four classes -- The Soldier, the Berserker, the Hunter, and the Siren. Each has a unique ""action skill,"" which is basically that classes special ability, and three different trees to drop skill points into. While every class can use every weapon in the game (the only limit on what you can equip is determined by your level), most characters have skills in their skill tree that enhance one or two particular types of weapons.The Soldier is best with rifles and shotguns, the Berserker with explosive weapons and his melee attack, the Hunter with sniper rifles and revolvers, and the Siren with any weapon that deals elemental damage. Luckily, there is enough flexibility that these don't feel like absolute restrictions. If you wanted to make a Hunter that mainly used rocket launchers, that's completely viable. Sure, it won't be the best build for the character, but you won't feel like you have no options other than to use the ""recommended weapons"" for each class.You may remember some minor controversy a while back when Gearbox announced that they had scrapped the game's initial design in favor of cel-shaded graphics. I'm happy to report that I believe Gearbox made the right choice in changing the graphical direction of the game. Not only does it make Borderlands look unique, but it's gorgeous on top of that. Looking back at older screenshots of the game, the original art style seemed so generic and bland -- I'm really glad they decided to take a chance and mix it up. Other than some minor texture pop that resolves almost immediately upon loading and some slight screen tearing (VSync option please!), I didn't really run into any other graphical issues.The game begins with you being tossed off a bus. You meet your first Claptrap who explains the basics of the game, and gives you a short mini-tutorial. After making your way to the first town, you're assigned your first quest and the game really begins.There's a massive number of quests in the game, and Gearbox has done a reasonable job of mixing them up. While every now and then you'll be assigned a ""Kill X enemies"" quest, they are few and far between. For the most part, you'll be exploring various locations and recovering different items, usually with a bunch of bad guys standing in the way. Even after completing the game, I was still going back and finding quests that I had missed before.One of the reasons it's been compared to Diablo is because of the emphasis on loot. The initial stories were right -- there are TONS of weapons in this game. There are seven main weapon types: pistols (this includes repeater pistols and revolvers), submachine guns, shotguns, combat rifles, sniper rifles, launchers, and a seventh that could be considered a minor spoiler. Every weapon has a variety of stats: accuracy rating, recoil, how much the weapon can zoom, how many bullets the weapon can hold, how fast the gun can fire, how many bullets fire at once, how fast the weapon reloads, and more. In addition, weapons have a chance to have one of four elemental properties: Explosion, Fire, Shock, and Corrosive. You also have slots for grenade mods, your shield, and a class mod that will boost your skills and provide some benefits, each with their own special aspects and variations.Combat in Borderlands is a ton of fun. While the game is a first-person shooter at its core, some strategy is needed. Each enemy has a ""weak point"" that you can attack for critical damage. For humans, its their heads. For Skags (the world's dog-like beasts), it's their mouths (but only when they're open, which is not often). While initially combat will seem relatively simple, once you progress the game will get reasonably difficult, and you'll find yourself very carefully having to manage your cover, your shield/health level, and your surroundings.Borderlands blends the regeneration aspect of many popular FPSs with health-pack grabbing. You have shields and life, and your shields regenerate, while your life doesn't. While this will give you some leeway to run into dangerous situations with guns blazing, you can't just stand still and blow everyone up. If you're going to make a rush, you'll have to take out your opponents quickly.One criticism I do have of the combat is the lack of variety of enemies. Skags, bandits, and spiderants make up the majority of what you'll be fighting throughout most of the game. A few zones have unique enemy types, and the flying Rakk are occasionally around to harass you. But for the most part you're going to be fighting the same enemies over and over again. One of the ways Borderlands differs from games like Diablo and Hellgate: London is that nothing is randomly generated aside from items themselves. The maps and locations are exactly the same every single time you play, and immediately upon entering an area you're given the entire map of the zone. Quest items will always be in the same spots, vendors will never move, and even the chests, safes, and weapon caches will always be in the same locations in every playthrough.Luckily, the repetitive feeling goes away quite a bit when you're playing with friends. Borderlands was designed as a co-op game, and co-op is where it really shines. Gearbox has done a good job of adjusting the difficulty in co-op games, in that you'll need to work together carefully with your friends to avoid dying. I actually found myself dying more when I was playing through the game with a friend than I did in single player, because we had to think a lot more strategically and be more careful. Since the enemies have significantly boosted health and damage, if even one or two get through your defenses you'll get taken down pretty quickly.The final thing I want to touch on is the story. While Borderlands starts out with a reasonably interesting story, it kind of takes a backseat to the action. This is somewhat understandable, since this is an FPS game at its core, but be prepared. The ending of the game is massively disappointing. Think Fallout 3, but worse. It's a shame, because the initial story has a lot of promise, and it's sad to see that potential squandered. This doesn't really affect the gameplay, but I found it to be the biggest disappointment I felt from my entire time with Borderlands.Luckily, even with these complaints, the first playthrough of Borderlands is an absolute blast, and will provide you at least 25+ hours of gameplay as long as you don't avoid all the sidequests. With tons of weapons to find, a great co-op system, fantastic art, and a whole bunch of exploding bodies, Borderlands is worth your money. Even when I feel that the game is starting to get repetitive, there's something about it that keeps me playing. Even my plans to jump into the game for five minutes to grab screenshots would suddenly turn into hour long play sessions without me even realizing it, and even having done most of the quests twice, I still want to head back and try again with a new character class. Despite a few imperfections, the game is simply fun -- and at the end of the day, that's what really matters.			"

												I will go as far to say that Borderlands is a perfect game. It took me a few half play throughs to get through, but this is not because the game is not enjoyable, I just loose track of where I am in a game if I put it down for a few weeks, this past week however, I blastered through the whole game, the full game with all of the side quests took me twenty hours to complete.  I am now starting ""playthrough #2"" which is essentially, the same, just with scaled up enemies. I love the looting system, the gun mechanics, the quests, the story, I just love this whole game. Yes I am a little bit late to the party, and yes most people will already have Borderlands sitting in their library, but play it, finish it, enjoy it, it's an absolutely joy to play. You get a real feel of success when you reach the final stages of the game, there is no better feeling than finding a phat gun, that you can rip through tons of enemies with, dropping your defense turret to shield yourself while you finish off another fifteen skags.I seriously cannot wait to get stuck into my second playthrough and jumping into some online games. One again, this for me, is a perfect game.			"

 Long Review  (short review at the bottom)This game is amazing, it's an FPS RPG that has a stunning art style and a lot of replay value.The main purpose of this game is basically leveling up and getting loot.The story isn't all that, there is little to no voice acting, so if that's the only thing you care about in video games, you'll probably not gonna like this game.Although the graphics are a bit old, especially the low resolution texture and shadows, the art style they used (cel-shaded) really holds up the game even for modern gaming.Some graphic problems can be fixed, like adjusting FOV, enabling Vsync and Anti Aliasing, but personally I haven't tried them because I didn't feel it was neccessary. Negative Points There are a few problems with the game, so I'm gonna list what mostly bothered *me*, maybe you won't care about these problems, and maybe you won't experience them, so it's just my opinion. Some glitches happen sometimes, the worst I got was in the Underdome DLC where enemies would spawn/fly off outside the arena and there's no way you could kill them, and you'd have to do it all over again (can take up to 3 hours) Some of the achievements are ridiculous, like the Claptrap's New Robot Revolution DLC where you have to collect a bunch of *VERY* rare drops  (like pizzas and bobbleheads)  and I haven't gotten all of these achievements yet, even though I've already put hours into drawn-out farming and grinding. The Underdome DLC has these ""larger challenges"" where you basically have to play 3 hours back-to-back, 3 times (so 9 hours in total, #Maths) and if you quit or disconnect (or get the above glitch) you'll have to do it all over again, which is just painful. The DLCs don't have any ""Fast Travel"", so you'll spend a *LOT* of time just running around from place to place, especially in ""The Secret Armory of General Knoxx"", which to be fair, has a lot of ""Catch A Ride"" stations (for cars), but it still takes too long to get somewhere. Positive Points And now my most favourite things this game has to offer The variety of weapons: which is what -I believe- makes this game standout. Replay value: when you finish the game, which is a quite linear mission flow with a bunch of side missions, you get to play it again in a second ""Playthrough"". you get to keep your weapons, keep your level, skills, and basically everything from the first playthrough, but you'll face stronger opponents and better loot. and this system works perfectly (apart from overleveling and making it too easy). The Multiplayer: in this game is what I would call ""Perfect"", the entire party gets experience from every single kill, and they all get cash from loot and doing missions, the only thing not shared is the loot itself, which I still prefer, especially since different classes require different weapons/gear. The DLC: is really good, it's almost the ideal DLC a gamer would want: it adds a lot of content, increases level cap, adds more weapons, interesting backstory, more achievements etc.. the game by itself is really good, but with the DLC it's even better.The game is not very long, but it takes a decent amount of time to 100%.And it is a LOT better to play with friends (more experience, more fun, and more co op achievements). TL;DR Game good.RPG very.Story not very.Friends invite.DLC buy.Collectibles bad.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Borderlands Original Release: 2009 Genre Tags: FPS; RPG; Cooperative; Lighthearted; Action  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 20-65 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Multiplayer gamers  REVIEWBorderlands is a chef-d'oeuvre of gaming. It boasts a masterful blend of FPS and RPG elements with an elaborate loot system to make for truly delectable gameplay. Complementing the gameplay is the unique and self-identifying art style and graphics, the blithe and cartoonish atmosphere, and the lighthearted narrative and zany NPC characters. All of these factors working in concert generate one hell of a gaming experience that should be able to bring pleasure to nearly any gamer out there.The gameplay is designed to offer both the face-paced action of an FPS with the character progression elements and gameworld massiveness of an RPG. There is an XP system that awards level-ups and ability-boosts. There are scores of quests to complete; some ancillary and others pivotal to the core narrative. There is a crazy world to explore, filled with various interesting NPCs. Enemy spawns and combat occur in real-time, right in the midst of everything else that is going on in the gameworld. There is never a dull moment or a lack of something to be working towards.Borderlands also has an elaborate and semi-random loot drop system. In the style made popular by games like Diablo, loot spills out of chests, crates, and enemies to pile up on the floor for you to peruse. Much of it will be junk, but you must always keep an eye out for the rare high quality drops. Due to the nature of the stat-progression of the weapons and the sheer variety, you will find yourself experimenting with many more and various weapons than you would in a standard FPS.Another defining aspect of Borderlands is the self-identifying art style and graphics scheme. The graphics fit the theme of the game with perfection, as they expertly relay the feeling of zany, cartoonish raucousness that the game is striving to evoke. This atmosphere sets the tone for the burlesquing narrative which never wastes an opportunity to poke fun at the other, more serious games it relates to.  Finally, one of best aspects of the game is the multiplayer functionality. Also borrowing from the style made popular by games like Diablo, you are able to play with other people by either allowing them to join your session or by joining theirs. You bring your own characters and earn your own XP and loot, but the game will be progressed up to the point that the host has reached. Playing with friends, or even with random people, can make the experience exponentially more hilarious and fun.If you have yet to give this game a try, then I envy you. It is one of the hallmark games of its generation and will forever live on as a masterpiece of its time. So stop reading this and get on with it!Addendum: After the Gamespy shutdown, multiplayer functionality has been moved over to Steamworks in 2015, so it continues to work properly.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												The first question that comes to mind when most people see some screens from Borderlands or watch a trailer for the game is, ""Is Borderlands an RPG or a shooter?"" Well, that's not necessarily an easy question to answer. On the one hand, it's far more an RPG than a shooter with its classes, experience levels, skill trees, quests, and all of the usual trappings of an RPG. On the other hand, combat is not a slow-paced methodical affair, being neither turn-based nor a simple matter of selecting the attack button and letting the CPU roll the dice. You need to aim, move, strafe, and everything else that you need to do to survive in a first-person shooter. So what we have here may be one of the finest shooter-RPGs. A hardcore RPG gamer may not appreciate the twitch-based combat, and a hardcore shooter gamer may be a bit put off by the fact that there's some dice-rolling going on behind the scenes (what do you mean I'm too low level to hit that monster???), but everyone else should have a great time with the game.Borderlands takes place on the planet of Pandora, a backwater planet with a character that's a bit Mojave Desert and a lot Road Warrior. Pandora is the kind of planet that wouldn't garner a second thought from anyone anywhere else in the galaxy except that it's also home to The Vault. The Vault is an ancient structure left behind by some long-gone alien race, but it's rumored to contain treasure and artifacts of vast power. The presence of The Vault has attracted the attention of fortune seekers from all corners of the galaxy, in spite of all of the dangers on Pandora from the testy local fauna and aggressive bandit groups. You are one of those fortune seekers, and while it may seem that exploring The Vault would form the bulk of your adventure most of your efforts will be directed at just getting there - but that's alright because Pandora is a pretty interesting place in its own right.Borderlands gives you the choice of one of four different characters, and unlike a full RPG there's not really much available in the way of character customization. There are four classes available, a soldier who uses all variety of weapons, a berserker who's basically a tank and can cause some serious damage with his fists, a hunter who specializes in sniper rifles and has control of an attack bird, and a siren who's a stealth-based character with the ability to turn invisible for short stretches of time. Each character provides a different experience, and that experience can be further tweaked by specializing in one of the three skills trees available to each character. While you can certainly complete the game as any of these four classes, it's when you play the game in co-op mode - either split-screen or on Xbox Live - that you'll realize how well-balanced a team these four characters make. And when you do play online, the story progress will be set to that on the host's machine but the level of the enemies will be adjusted to reflect the mix of levels of the characters taking part in the game.One of the great things about Borderlands is that there is always plenty to do. In addition to the story missions there are always a number of other missions available, either from characters that you meet in the game or from job boards in the friendly settlements. Even after you finish with The Vault, you can return to the wastelands of Pandora and continue taking on side quests.The developers of Borderlands must have spent at least a little time playing World of Warcraft, because they understand how much fun (and how addicting) it is to find a huge variety of loot. There are an amazing number of weapons in the game to be scavenged from defeated enemies, discovered in foot lockers, or pulled from corpses discovered in the wastelands. There are several classes of weapons such as pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles, and they come in standard and rarer varieties. Each is rated on damage dealt, range, and ammo capacity, but some of the better ones will include the ability to use special ammunition like incendiary rounds, fire grenades, or even come with blade attachments to increase melee damage. You'll spend a fare amount of time in your inventory screen, deciding which combination of weapons to have equipped, which to save for later or to sell, and which to drop to make room for something else, but it's more a labor of love than a chore. The game is even kind enough to mark loot in the area with a small beam of light, and you'll more often than not decide it's worth the risk to fight through a group of enemies just to see what's sitting under that little beam of light in the distance.Borderlands has a great look to it - it's not quite a fully cel-shaded game, but it has a distinct comic book look to it. The violence also tends toward a comic book style, and although it would be pretty graphic in a game with realistic graphics it comes across as slightly humorous in Borderlands and fits the game's dark, subtle, and subversive sense of humor perfectly. Pandora certainly has its own unique look and feel to it, and it stands out from the myriad of alien worlds that you've visited in countless other games before. And it's not just the look of planet that makes Pandora, Pandora - everything from your chipper robot guide to the colorful locals to the mysterious woman who appears to you in brief visions, makes exploring Pandora a very interesting experience.Highly Recommended!

												Borderlands is simply one of the best games ever made.  They blended RPG and FPS elements and the result is wonderful.  Coupled with a great underlying game engine and terrific storyline/atmosphere, this game shines amongst the game choices out today.  Throughout the game, you're consitently challenged without the RPG elements becoming too repetitious.  Overall, Borderlands is a wonderful game that will have you coming back to it over and over again.			"

												Borderlands! what a great title for a game. I've never heard of it 'till I saw it on sale this summer and I bought it thinking ""look at this guy (-psycho-) on the game's art.. he's a proper lunatic this one definitely must have story"" sadly he hasn't much. All he wants is to throw his machete and blow things up including himself, kinda like mad max movie scene -witness me! anyway...The story is about an ancient Vault in a planet called Pandora, rumors say that inside that vault there is Chuck Norri's priceless loot -who knows! and guess what; you're the one badass Vault Hunter that will open it.  My heart started pounding crazy at that point of the story and then... my journey began.---info---here some pros/cons that I've experienced playin'+beautiful environment+faded cartoon color graphics+realistic enemy foes in foreign planet+four characters to choose +Smoothly 4 player co-op +Great story that made me feel like I want to visit this planet +Open world and quests flow at your own pace. +tons of loot $ (guns/armor upgrades/bomb upgrades/skill upgrades..TAKE IT ALL!+Character Level system and skills tree to choose one per level+Fast teleport system+Halo vehicles! (jeeps)+psycho fellas+funny dialogues and xp challedges-Lack of a codex/journal (lore background)-Unfulfilled ending -Overall easy AI if you play solo (AI gets harder in co-op)-Lack of a storage chest to put my badass gun collection (edit: added in Mad Moxxi's DLC)....It would be grand if I could play solo and the rest of the characters join in like an offline co-op9/10 ***TK Baha would need more braaaaaaaaaaaaaains! though.

												Borderlands was one of the first games I ever played, and coming back to it today, I still love the damn thing to bits.I got this game a couple of years ago via a USB that was circulating around the classroom at school, and instantly fell in love with those trademark, cartoony-realistic graphics the game is famous for. Having beaten the game on that presumably illegally downloaded copy, I jumped at the chance to buy it on sale (Humble Bundle is OP :D), hence my low playtime.This game has so much to offer the player, whether you be an experienced FPS player or an absolute n00b like I was on my first playthrough. This accessibility is primarily due to the RPG-like experience point system, that allowed me to level up and eventually defeat bosses despite my lack of skill.The story in this game is above and beyond what you would expect from your average FPS game. I guess you can't really consider Borderlands a shooter more than it is an RPG, and this is one of the things that is so attractive about it. I would say that the game excels in many areas where other RPG's do not, namely the openess of the world and the fairly sizeable ammount of free choice you have when completing quests (I'm looking at you, Far Cry 3). The humor in the game is also brilliantly executed, and had me cracking up at many points throughout the story.So is the game worth your hard earned money, even if it was realeased almost 6 years ago?HELL YES.

""If RPG and FPS made a baby it would be Borderlands"" The first part of the Borderlands series was a marvelous breakthrough. Some Diablo fan developers of Gearbox reinvented the way of co-op fighting and looting in a post apocalyptic world named ""Pandora"". Containing 4 different iconic characters which you can levelup by XP gained from kills or solving quests is still today (6 years after release) a highly addictive game concept. The other thing is the random weapon looting generator which produces practically an infinite variation of all kind of weapons (with elemental damage, multipliers, rarities, weapon classes, character class mods, grenade mods and shields). You can buy weapons from vendor machines but mostly they are hidden in weapon cases, lockers or stashes all over the landscape or they drop from killed enemies. So you cleanout an area in action loaded sequences (the AI is great) and after that you compare stats of dropped and looted weapons.You better play together with your friends. The game is up to 4 players co-op which is a great experience. Even if there are sometimes loot conflicts or quest solving / achievements asynchronities. Whatever is the reason it still makes fun.Very innovative was the unique cell-shade graphics at that time which gave the game the perfect comic look. Mixed-up with FoV and depth sharpness effects it felt quite modern and fresh. Today it feels a bit blurry but still nice to watch. Shooting at enemies let drop several damage numbers and criticals hits out of their bodies which is quite funny. The Bossfights are totally epic. Everything seems very story driven. Other things like quests of collecting things are rather repetive. If you finished the main story you will reach lvl36 but on a second playthrough you can farm enough XP to levelup to lvl50 and lateron with DLCs to lvl69 (max level).   The 4 DLCs content is quite extensive storytelling and new epic bossfights. You cannot miss all the DLCs in the GOTY version which is totally recommended and worth to buy.			"

												Borderlands is a first person shooter with strong role playing elements set on a distant and hostile planet.You play as one of four mercenaries who have come to the planet of Pandora seeking the legendary “Vault” and its many promised treasures.There are four different characters to choose from in Borderlands, each with their own set of skill and abilities. The four characters include Lilith ""The Siren"", Mordecai ""The Hunter"", Brick ""The Berserker"" and Roland ""The Soldier"". The missions and side quests can be quite rewarding in Borderlands and allows characters to score all sorts of loot and weapons to help them accomplish the game's main objective.In the multiplayer co-op mode up to four players can choose any one of the characters and play through the same single player campaign.Borderlands is an excellent mix of RPG elements without sacrificing FPS game play. It is a perfect choice to play with your friends, definitely worth to buy.Sounds 8/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Borderlands was a new project by Gearbox Software back in 2009. The game had a lot of unique features and settings. A first-person shooter set on a sci-fi planet - Pandora, with a lot of focus on RPG elements. The game was very well reviewed and recieved a various amount awards, including several Game of the Year's. Visually the game is beautiful and covered in cel shading, giving it a very comic book / hand-drawn look. The game took cel shading so far, that people often associate the game with that specific art-style. Thanks to the cel shading, the game could hide behind pretty simple textures without appearing low-res, as the game does not have to look realistic.Pandora is a very hostile planet, as you quickly get to experience with the regular human bad-guys and also a selection of aliens and mutations. You get to choose between 4 characters to play, each with it's unique ability and weapons. There is a leveling system where you gain experience and level up specific perks for your character and set-up. When you level up, so does your enemies, and occasionally you encounter a 'Badass' (stronger and more dangerous than the regular), as well as a bunch of unique variants and bosses. This game rewards you with more loot than your grannies wrinkles. You will drown in a sea of a billion different weapons, with different ammo types, reload speeds, firing speeds, scope zooms, damage etc. IT NEVER ENDS! There are 4 types of bonus damage; fire, explosion, shock and corrosion, all with an advantage and disadvantage to specific enemies. Luckily, you don't wear or find any armor in the game, only a shield and health augmentation, that has about as many billion combinations as the weapons.A lot of people compare Borderlands with Fallout 3. They are in reality very different from one another. Borderlands is very humoristic and bright, while still being twisted and deteriorated. This game is not set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been beautiful. Pandora itself never was a peaceful place, and the name should hint it's secrets within. Borderlands never really focus on a good story either, it's just about the loot, man, the LOOT!This game shows it qualities when played in Co-op, where 4 people can do all this nonsense together. It really starts feeling like an MMO RPG when fighting the harder bosses in co-op, grinding everywhere - and then then rewarded with loot. There even is PVP arenas for fighting over the loot too. If co-op is not an option you can still enjoy it in Single-Player.Pick this up if you are interested in a unique experience, with friends - or without - with a ton of loot and silly things to shoot.Note: Borderlands is the prequel to Borderlands 2, you might be looking into that game too.

												Updated review.Borderlands has to be one of the best RPG's that utilises guns out there. It's up my list with STALKER and Fallout, though the settings here are completely different!9/10 art style and personality; very original all around and it sticks with you; funny and relaxed; the only game that has a better personality is I think Portal 8/10 sound effects, music, voice; it all blends in to form this captivating world8/10 game mechanics; leveling like the classic RPG's have, meaning getting imba in just a few levels and also grinding IS part of the game, guns are fun to customize, combat is visceral with varied enemies and missions, quests are a little boring they look  more like MMO quests but there is a multiplayer option which is the best way to play with a few friendsNot that different from Borderlands 2. You're getting the same experience if you play BL1Not very immersive, but extremely fun to play. Great multiplayer. It can really drain hours from your life without you noticing at all.			"

Go with Brick.. Want to Snipe and have the best bird pal? Go Mordecai.. Want to be the best pal for your teammates and be good with every gun? Go with Roland.. Last but definetly not the least (imo the best) want to go with elemental SMG and destroy everything? Go Lilith, she's the boss!+NPCs are interesting and a hell of fun - for example Athena, TK, Tannis, Claptrap, General Knoxx, Scooter +Boss fights are fun and challenging+So many references and jokes+DLCs are top notch! Except ""The Underdome"" - IMO it goes like this: Zombie Island of Dr.Ned>The Secret Armory of General Knoxx>Claptra's Robot Revolution>Moxxi's underdome- Story may not be the best thing in the game, seems rushed some parts of the game- Respawning mechanism seem broken at times, when you've just killed the enemies, and then you leave the area, comeback, and baam here they are again- The Underdome DLC it's just awful, so much grinding for so little reward, and repetitive as hell- Way too much walking and no teleports in DLCs Overall - 9.1/10 "

												After having owned this game for about six years, I finally got around to playing it in its entirety.  It's a great take from the early stages of the RPG/FPS hybrids that are outrageously popular these days.  The gameplay is a blast and stands up to the test of time and the randomly generated loot is always exciting to pick up.  One gun could be entirely different from the next even if they're of the same category and you never know what kind of crazy weapon you'll be adding to your arsenal next.My only real complaints are that long range sniping could be improved and that by the time of the final DLC, if you're playing through all of them consecutively, the game starts to drag a bit.  Sniping seems to snap to a grid for particularly long ranged shots without a great scope which is unfortunate for those of us who have a sniper rifle preference.  The DLC is fun, though it's mostly more of the same.  There are new enemy types but the quest format is unchanged and they often feel like very well done skin swaps.All in all, I highly recommend the game if you have a friend or three to play with and consider it a worthy purchase even if you don't.Just make sure to have your volume control nearby for when Claptrap decides that he wants to start talking.

Borderlands Review - Rating: 8.6/10General ImpressionBorderlands is a great combination of the FPS and RPG genres, which mixed up would get a RPS (Role-Play Shooter). I had a lot of fun with this game. Off to the features: The graphics and the textures are pretty nice, they are 3D cartoonish, and well-designed. The atmosphere is huge, there are many maps to explore and to complete their quests. Many of them are side quests, which are not mandatory, but you need to complete some of them, in order to level up with the quests’ level requirements. You can kill enemies around the maps, doing the quests, or simply riding with your car. The audio, the voice acting and the music are fine. The gameplay is nice, there are a ton of missions, and they differ a lot, which is a good thing. You can kill a lot of diversified enemies, you can explore areas, you can ride your car and do stunts, you can buy from machine vendors whatever you want, and many others. The story is interesting, you can play with up to 4 different characters (Ronald, Mordecai, Lilith and Brick). I won’t spoil what’s happening in it, but 1 thing is sure: if you are going to play with all of them, you would basically spend a ton of hours (more than 200). Without the DLCs. I haven’t tried out the DLCs, but from what I saw on YouTube, they are pretty great. I recommend that you buy the GOTY edition of the game. This game also has a CO-OP option, where you can play with up to 3 friends (4 in the game). The user-interface is pretty nice, with additional designs and well-synthetized information. The controls are well-chosen. The engines are alright, I haven’t found any haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are pretty sophisticated, except with one thing: from time to time, you will get stuck in random objects, but it isn’t hard to get out of them. Overall, Borderlands is a nice combination of the FPS and RPG genres, which mixed up would get a RPS (Role-Play Shooter). A fun game! Made with love!Positive PointsPretty nice graphics and texturesHuge atmosphere, many mapsPretty nice audio and nice musicAwesome, fun and challenging gameplayMany main and side quests availableGood humorMany guns, types of enemies, types of environments, types of missions, etc.A well-designed user-interfaceWell-chosen controlsSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsMany Steam achievementsNeutral PointsTrading nice and Steam items would be some nice featuresNegative PointsSometimes you will get stuck in random objects Some missions are not very interestingIf you level up too fast, the game becomes pretty easy "

 “If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs.” Borderlands is a science fiction first-person shooter (fps) game with role-playing elements developed by the company Gearbox Software. It represents the first game in the Borderland series.  Atmosphere & gameplay: + It features a grim and unclean cel-shading-look in combination with strong contrasts, which results in a cartoonish graphical style.+ The unusual, humoristic events and cinematic moments contribute to the game’s atmosphere.  + Elaborate loot system creates a broad spectrum of weapons and items that support different play styles. + Four classes with various skill trees and weapon priorities offer sufficient customization options. + Well done online collaborative campaign gameplay allows for a flexible and fluent multiplayer experience. o Each of the four DLCs introduces a challenging mini-campaign.  o Solid sound design.- Repetitive side missions offer little variety. Ranging from go-get-it-boy-and-bring-it-back, over collect-all-the-stuff-I-dropped to kill-a-bazillion-of-those. They are tedious.      Characters & story: + Selected illustration of stereotypical side characters with a cynical attitude and wry sense of humour.o Solid voice acting.   - Simple storyline. As if a lobotomized zombie has been given a pen to smear down a one-liner.    Summary: Borderlands is a challenging and entertaining fps experience with (over-the-top) humoristic moments, and the right amount of loot collecting aspects. However, the paper-thin story remains uninteresting and most of the monotonous side quests lack long-term motivation.  Achievements: Estimated time for 100 % completion: +60 hoursSingleplayer achievements: 72Multiplayer achievements: 8			"

												Borderlands is the first game in the Borderlands Series, originally released in 2009. It is a mixture of RPG and FPS where you can play as one of four characters, a Soldier, Hunter, Berserker, and Siren, and complete missions for various NPC's. You start on the planet of Pandora, where you are sent by the Dahl Corporation to locate a vault containing alien technology, which is believed to exist on the planet. The planet had previously been abandoned by several large corporations due to their inability to find any alien tech, so it is a broken wasteland of desert and scattered settlements, with wild creatures and raiders a plenty. There is more to the plot, but I don't want to spoil the surprises for anyone.  The graphics look a bit cartoonish, almost a comic book feel to them; However, there are settings and even Mods available to make the game less cartoonish. Borderlands has a Single Player mode, Multiplayer, and Co-operative mode.Each character that you can choose from has a different play style. There are mulitple DLC's available for Borderlands such as; The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, Claptrap's New Robot Revolution, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx, and Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot. The game also spawned a Sequel, Borderlands 2, and a pre-sequel, Tales from the Borderlands: The Pre-sequel. Even though I don't personally like the cartoonish way the graphics look, there are workarounds for that and the game is still fun to play. It has a pretty good tutorial and very little learning curve, so anyone new to the series should be able to jump right in and learn from the playable tutorial. the NPC's are amusing, voice acting is pretty good and the game has decent music. Borderlands is worth purchasing, for those who like RPG-FPS games.			"

												Precursor to the legendary Borderlands 2, the original holds up very well alongside its more popular sibling. The best comparison I can offer if you've played the second but not the first is to expect a little more vanilla as far as gameplay and graphics as well as a number of small issues that were ironed out in the second game. These include some leveling issues with enemies, forgettable boss fights, vehicle problems, useless fall damage, falling through parts of the map to your death, too much money, random bugs, etc... However, all the strong points of the second game are present in the combat, humor, leveling system, and overall aesthetics making the original a great experience. All in all, it's a lot of fun and especially so if have the ability to co-op with someone. A definite recommendation.			"

												The game that started it all. Without a doubt the first game to start putting out ""shooters with RPG elements"", but at heart Borderlands is truly half shooter and half RPG. This can be either a downside or an upside to you. I find it amazingly enjoyable to run around interacting with the world, but if you're looking to just shoot things it can get slow. If you're considering buying this after playing BL2, you should definitely do it. But there are several differences between the games. BL1 is less arcade feeling than BL2 but in return you get more of a questing and exploring experience. The world is less colorful than BL2 but it's also more human. The guns are less flashy, but you'll find more of them to be more useful. The legendary guns are more plentiful, but less unique and gimmicky. The playable characters are more generic and dull, but less polarizing than BL2's (there's several skills in BL2 that do just.....nothing)Personally, I find the dry wit of BL1 to be a huge step above BL2's more...pie-in-the-face humor. You can see this in characters like Patricia Tannis and Claptrap. In BL1 they're fleshed out and have a degree of sad charm to their quirks, but in BL2 they sort of become walking charicatures. It's a matter of personal taste, and I'll always love BL1 for kicking off my favorite franchise of all time.			"

												If you've never played Borderlands 2 and want to play this for the story or just to expeirence the series origins, definitely play this first because the second game blows it out of the water and you won't be able to come back to this and have as much fun as you once did.It's a decent game and had a lot of promise which they fully flushed out in #2 and it's worth a playthrough or two.

												I've been running this through wine - specifically playonlinux using 1.7.53-steam_crossoverhack.  It works well although the FPS is not great but definitely playable.  Increasing/decreasing graphics options does not change the FPS so you can max everything out without worrying about performance.  The game itself is really fun.  I'm coming from BL2 and TPS so it is definitely a step backwards but remains a great game.  Like all the borderlands games it is built on loot and skills which are plentiful.  Really the most frustrating part is not have a mini-map which makes me keep opening up the map for directions.  I really like the Borderlands universe and it is fun exploring this planet again.  The opening is set in Fyrestone which is also playable in BL2, only in BL2 it ceased to be an abandoned Dahl village and was instead turned into a post apocalyptic environmental disaster by Hyperion.  The game also gives insight to many of the characters you run into in the later games.Overall, highly recommend it to Borderlands fans and if you are a Linux user it works fine with wine.  If you are new to Borderlands it is probably best to start with Borderlands 2.			"

												This is a great game, an old classic, this is probably my current favourite RPG, it's great fun and challenging with many fights and bosses, it gets harder to level up as you go on as do your enemies to balance the game very well. It is beautiful, once you get in to it it really is fun, the graphics are a shock at the start but you adjust to them quite quickly. It is long and it keeps you interested throughout, the storyline is amazing. I've really enjoyed playing so far and it is very fun. It is diverse and at the start the boss enemies are a couple of levels higher than you so it is very challenging. With cartoony graphics it is very unique and interesting to play.I'd rate this game 88/100			"

												SO. what can i say about this game.I've played this 100's of hours !i've had this game since it was a non-steam game (hence the little hours here)the field of view isn't all that great but there are workarounds for it . the graphics are fine (even though they're just a little outdated and wonky at times)and it's filled with puns.! the best part is that it's replayable in 4 different ways since you have 4 characters to play with with all different styles. and theres literally HOURS of gameplay which you will enjoy a lot. i'm pretty sure there might be one of em that suits you're likings.+MULTIPLAYER this is loads of fun when you play it with a few of you're friends!ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU BLOW STUFF UP WITH 4 FRIENDS BECAUSE .. REASONS !!!! i was surprised at how the mechanics were and how this game progresses throughout playing it. it's a solid buy, runs pretty well and looks good for it's time.i would recommend you buying the GOTY version if you do though to get the full understading out of it.EXPLOSIONS/10 !

Welcome to Pandora___Disclaimer___I put only 43 hours into this game and i finished the whole base game and the DLC but the only reason i have this many hours and not like 500 hours, is because i played this game back on the Xbox 360 and i played Borderlands sooooo many times back then, i might of have put like 600 something hours back on the Xbox so the only reason i have 43 hours on the Steam version is because i played this game so much that im burned out at this point. ___---------____Borderlands is my all time favorite game or may i say. Series. I played this game so much that even though im burned out with this game, i still love it to death. And to show how much i love this game we have to start from the beginning. Back in 2010 i was planning to get a new game, all of my friends from school were playing the brand new Call Of Duty games and i was not interested in it, i wanted something else, so i started watching this series on YouTube from this one YouTuber and it was Borderlands, i was bored and was interested in it so frankly i watched it. I loved the look of it from first sight and i knew i had to buy it.So the next day i brought it and fired it up on my Xbox 360. It was a very confusing game at first, it is an RPG game and i never played one before so frankly it took me a while to get used to it, do note that i was also a bit young back then so it was a bit more confusing for me. After some days of watching videos and reading a bit i got the hang of it and ho boy, did i love it. I played through the whole game, i explored every little bit of area, i finished all of the DLC's and after that i still wanted more. So i played through the game the next 4 times with each of the characters and through my time of playing i never got bored. I played as all four of the characters and finished the game 4 times before after moving up to the next game. But whenever i felt like playing something i played Borderlands, When i made a new self account, Borderlands was the first thing i played. I even played this game soo much that the disc one day broke, i won't lie, i was super heartbroken back then, so i had to buy a new copy because i loved this game to death at that point, 2 years later the disc broke again and then i was kind of burned out that i did not feel like buying it again, but later on after 2 years i had an urge to play it again, so i went to the Game Shop and i brought the game yet again and this time it did not break, i still have it on my game collection and even though i don't play it on the Xbox 360 anymore this game does remind me of how much i went through with this game and how much i love it. If you have friends to play this game with then buy it by all means, you will enjoy yourself and if this is your first time playing this game then you will put many hours into it. You have many enemies to fight and many guns to grab, the loot in this game is total madness, with other a bazillion guns for you to find and collect and use. You will never run out of fun playing this game unless you get burned out with it like i did. The performance on Borderlands is fantastic. Running it on a rarther medium to high end PC and i was playing it on high settings and did not drop a single frame, it runs like a wonder and i can tell that you shall have the same performance unless by any chance you have a 9 year old PC with a Intel Cerelon and a GT 240.I recommend this game or may i say game series to everyone out there who wishes to try out a good game to either play singleplayer or CO-OP. As a big fan of Borderlands i recommend this to everyone.You can buy it on sale when its cheap or buy it on other sites such as did when i brought this game on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Full game + GOTY for only £2.50.			"

												Insta bought this game back in the day for console and played an estimated time of 200+ hours.I think everything had already been said about this game and since i played it before Borderlands 2, I'd liketo address the one issue that Borderlands did so much better in than its follow-up.And that is definitely the lootpool.While i couldn't care less about Blue- or even Purplegear in Boderlands 2,i sometimes found myself drooling over Green- and Whiteequipment.The reason behind it is that when i find a gun in BL2 i can already tell or estimate the usual min. and max. numbers of every stat.But in this game i often times had to check every gun and every stat because there was a small percentage chance that a gun that was seemingly an ordanary weapon, had one of its stats way over the top and i would love to have this back in the upcoming series.So i suggest to play this game especially for people who came for the loot factor.

												Guilty pleasure. Don't get me wrong, the first 20 lvls or so are a great satisfying experience, but after that the stereotype comes rather quickly. Even though the ratings are quite high, I think it is overrated. The gameplay is fueled by MMO-style questing and a complex random stats weapons and loot system. What I liked was the cel shaded graphics, brilliant music by Jesper Kyd et al. and the addictivity of it all. The game is suitably challenging and entertaining. Being quite long it will take you about 45hrs to get through most of the content of the main game. The DLCs, especially the Zombie one, are well-done, however the car one has way too long transitions between quests and the arena one is a complete nonsense. There are many bad design decisions throughout the game that will make you wanna rip your hair out. But it isn't insurmountable. The game attempts at being humorous, using memorable characters like Claptrap, Dr. Ned, T.K. Baha or Scooter. Overall impression is good though, buy it, a must-have for achievement hunters.			"

Oldie but goodie.Borderlands realizes exactly what it promised - a great shooter and a pretty good ARPG. Farming of items is as in any decent game of this type, addictive. Hours run away quickly when we move smoothly from one task to another all the time killing hundreds of inhabitants of Pandora. Lacked a little bit to perfection. Failure to include a sharing mechanism of items between players, effectively deterred from playing with strangers, and friends are not always online. The script presented here is so vague that it is difficult to be drawn into the story of the search for treasure. What is important is not the goal, but the road itself, and that better overcome with buddies. However, if you have a group to which you can always count on a lot of free time and like to shoot with a gazillion of guns, that Borderlands is a game for you.			"

												Borderlands is an action-RPG / first person shooter. It features cooperative-play, phat loot(tm), and vehicles. This is a game designed to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. In this regard, it's a success.But what do I think of it? Well... eh. I mean, I like Borderlands well enough... I guess. When it comes to this game, the best statements I can muster come off as half-hearted and wishy-washy. I've always been a fan of loot-driven games, but there has to be some sort of hook beyond the basic qualities. It doesn't have to be something particularly clever, but it has to make the game stand out. I think Borderlands lacks this quality, but it's still an alright way to spend a weekend of four. Oh wait. You're probably expecting an explanation of what this ""quality"" is supposed to be aren't you? When it comes to videogames, originality can only go so far. Oft-times, we just have to accept the fact that not every game we play is going to be completely unique and excellent. Sometimes we end up buying games because they look interesting, are in a genre we enjoy, or our friends are playing them. Borderlands is a perfect example.To me, the words perfect and mediocre, are two sides of the same coin. Today's perfection is tomorrow's mediocrity. What was once the gold-standard, has now become the base-line. Borderlands has everything it needs to accomplish its goal of being a competent FPS Lootemup, and nothing more. The shooting mechanics aren't anything brilliant, the controls are acceptable, and the story/writing serve their purpose. The skill-tree system is neat, but only in a ""that makes sense"" sort of way. The build you create isn't really important, because the same two or three abilities tend to dominate every encounter.The guns, the aspect that should set this game apart from the pack, are merely okay. One commonality among loot-based games (especially more recent ones), is that very few character-builds actually use their weapon. By that I mean the sword, polearm, or otherwise is merely a stat-boosting piece of equipment. Usually, the player just uses their skills in order to kill enemies, instead of swinging a large piece of metal around. Practically the sole method of killing in Borderlands is through the usage of guns. Unfortunately, 98% of them are useless. This is especially true of the ""gimmick"" guns dropped by bosses. More often than not, you're going with the standard weapons, just because they're actually effective. In other words, instead of swinging the boring swords, you have to fire the boring guns. The inability to create an identity through play-style is the #1 reason why this game fails to stand out. A game like Borderlands could have really benefitted from more intricate level-designs, as well as a greater level of depth in terms of controls. I'm thinking that the developers could have come up with all sorts of crazy manuevers to pull off. Sliding, air-dashes, back-flips, shoulder-charges, some parkour stunts, you get the idea. Not all of these moves would have to be in the game, but even a couple of them would have lended more dynamism to the combat. This would also make the maps more fun to explore, well... if there was more to them besides wide-open spaces to catch a ride(tm) through, or the bog-standard ""rooms filled of cover"" that's in every other FPS. The RPG elements, while appreciated, sometimes make the game feel too much like an MMO. I know it's just a guideline, but when everything has a level suggestion next to it, the atmosphere is lost. While I always enjoy the immediate pleasures of leveling up and finding better gear, the world-building gets pushed away. Didn't TellTale make a Borderlands game that addresses this very concern? Hm... Perhaps I should look into it.When a game makes an attempt to stand out, it can instead become flawed. The developer tried something different, and either it was a bad idea to begin with, or they didn't quite get it right. Borderlands doesn't take these risks. It's a perfectly mediocre product that delivers enough incentivization to keep gamers playing, it doesn't strive to do any more than that. I don't think that makes this game worthy of praise, but I still enjoyed it well enough... I guess.			"

Despite not having great voice acting compared to BL2, it's still much better than the voicing in pre sequel.

												Borderlands retains its value through intricate skill trees for the time of release, mounds of loot, and its crude, dark humor. We're talking psychotic bandit lords with spiked nipples.In comparison, Borderlands 2 is more colorful, it has dedicated focus on a villain, and the skill trees have extra variety. However, the first game rewards useful weapons more often, bolstering the arcade experience. As for the setting, you might even find the desolateness of Borderlands to be more fitting for the vault hunters.Grab the GOTY on sale, for the DLCs introduce more guns and class modifications, as well as environments with new enemies. Don't look for a memorable story, but instead enjoy the spirited action present in all Borderlands games.			"

												I guess that since I now have over 340 hours on Borderlands, I ought to write a review for it.  As you can guess, yes, I recommend it.  It's a really good First Person Shooter and plays well even today (2016).  If you're wondering whether you should play this before Bordlerlands 2, I'd say yes.  It's not mandatory.  But, with what happens here, it will make the story in Borderlands 2 even better.  There are some quirks (i.e., small bugs) with the game though.  But, since it's long out of maintenance, we just have to live with them.  Probably the biggest I ran across was in the multiplayer area:  the microphone doesn't work well.  We worked around this by turning the microphone off in the game and using Steam's Friend voice chat instead.As to whether or not it's a good deal, well, I see that it currently lists for about $20 barebones and about $30 as a GOTY edition.  That's crazy talk.  Wait for a sale or buy a Steam code for it somewhere else.  I picked up a GOTY edition for a bit less than $9.  Of course, given that I've played over 340 hours so far, it really doesn't matter how much it cost:  it was worth it.BTW:  the last playthrough of just the base game took me about 55 hours.			"

												Lets put it this way. What do we want from an RPG game ?  A massive world with hundreds of quest, a detailed power / stats system with unique character classes. Nice bossfights ,fun leveling system, lots of loot and long-term replayability. This game offers all of these things PLUS ITS MULTIPLAYER. And while in voice chat with your friends you can play this game for 1000 hours with awesome DLC's and Playtrough system. It's one of my favourite RPG's even though its kinda old. Pros:- Massive world- Around 250 fun quests- Bazillion weapons / gear- Unique artstyle and designs (For characters and enviroment)- 4 Very fun and unique classes - Very impressive gameplay and fun shooting- Great leveling system with multiple playtroughs- Lots of content and endless playtime- Nice and satisfying sound effects and voice acting- Great presentation- MULTIPLAYER ! Cons: - Weak story- Lack of music- No mini-map (is a lot frustrating then you might think of)- Lots of bugs and stupid game mistakes- Some missions are repitive and boring- Unfair situations (f.e : flying bosses when you are playing melee berserker)- Second wind system should be a bit less forgiving.Overall Score:  8.5 / 10			"

Borderlands is one of the Greatest FPS/RPG game ever made, for me. The makers of this game have twisted both the elements together very finely that you won't be bored if you're an FPS and RPG fan. Its very AWESOME if you play it with friends or not (i mean single player). In this game the hunt for bigger and better loot for guns never gets old. Its always AWESOME when you fight your way into the wave of enemies and get loot of better weapons, Shields, Class, Health, etc. and many more. You aswell face many different Bosses aswell as new soldiers to fight and after the fight when you get the access to cases you feel like you're rewarded.Theres also Vehicles in this game,  it gave me feeling like Mad Max as bandits created a conflict in a desert area with me in a vehicle.there are 4 vehicles in this game and some you get by buying DLC.The main story is a blast evenn if you play it alone for Hours and hours without getting bored. and if you play it with your friends its an AWESOME experience.I havent tried all DLC yet but still will write for what i have,For DLC,The Secret Armory of General Knoxx starts players off in T-Bone Junction. This small town is a rest stop on a sprawling stretch of highway raised above the dry basin of an ancient sea. In other words, it looks a lot like the other stretches of beautiful wasteland in Borderlands. Players are required to drive a good distance along these roads to get to the surrounding areas, as there are no teleport locations. There are a few new vehicles, one of which is quite a bit faster than what appeared in the main game, but you'll eventually get tired of the extended driving segments that come with each quest. The four person Lancer allows crews to travel together, but it is slower and not much fun for two of the passengers. If you enjoyed Borderlands and still wanted more, then definitely buy and download The Secret Armory of General Knoxx.			"

												Borderlands leaves me with mixed feelings. I had a great time playing it – when I wasn't bored by endless fetch-quests, easy combat and (in the DLC) re-used bosses.I enjoyed the weapons the most. They feel and fire great, with a lot of variety. There's a finite amount of cash, so most of your weapons will be found via looting. And there is a TON of stuff to loot. Any fallen enemy drops loot, from bandits to wild animals. And if you find a stash, well, you just might land yourself a rare. Sniper rifles have a fixed zoom, though. The game world is huge and drab; a real wasteland. The visual style is still unique (even with Telltale using a similar hand-drawn, cell-shaded look for most of their games). It was a little jarring at first, but after a few hours I found the graphics very appealing. And light on system resources. I am able to run Borderlands at max settings @1440p on an R7 260X! Borderlands is just not that demanding.Getting around the huge world isn't a problem; Scooter's vehicle terminals are everywhere, making it very easy to “Git you one!” But why are we traversing the gameworld? Fetch-quests, mostly. “Bring me 20 fish!” “Destroy 3 fuel tanks!” “Find 20 parts!” They're not all fetch-quests, of course, but there's quite a bit of padding. The attraction was supposed to lie in the combat (and looting) while completing the quests. Which is fine, except the combat is easy. If you do a few side-quests and suddenly find yourself 2 or more levels higher than recommended, you'll breeze through the missions. Co-op play is supposed to mean harder enemies and better loot; I found co-op even easier.I'd heard so much about how good the characters of Borderlands are, and they're there, but barely; the characters are the start- and end-points of the missions, but that's it. You'll barely even see a cut-scene with them (except in some of the DLC). Claptraps are everywhere, and they're obviously designed to be cute. What about the story? Well, you're looking for a vault; think of it as a box. You're on a planet named “Pandora”. Put the two together, and hopefully you won't be too disappointed when you finally get to the vault after an endless level of “guardians”. So, I have mixed feelings about Borderlands. I found it tremendously fun in co-op, though, so if you have a few friends who want to run around together shooting and looting, grab it by all means. If you're planning to solo most of it, it will be a solitary, easy grind for loot. Not a bad thing if that's what you're looking for; if you were hoping for more, though, you'll be disappointed.""Wait, you forgot about your reference to 'recycled bosses'!""Read on.On DLC:There are four DLC, all of them substantial additions to the main game; campaigns are large (as are the rewards) and well worth the purchase – especially if you're buying the game for its co-op.Some problems with the DLC, though:- No fast travel. Wait, wtf? That's right. You fast travel to the start of the DLC campaign, but within the DLC, there is no fast-travel, meaning you'll spend a lot of time running (or driving). If you pass a save-point deep within a level, and quit your game, the next time you load your save, you'll be back at the beginning of the DLC, and have to run / drive all the way back to where you were when you saved. - RECYCLED BOSSES. You'll re-fight the boss from the main campaign, and in the Claptrap Robot Revolution DLC, you'll also re-fight the bosses from The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned and The Secret Armory of General Knoxx – sometimes even multiple times! Borderlands tries to be self-deprecating as it does this, but it doesn't change the fact that they're re-using assets. It reeks of being cheap. Did the devs seriously think we would swallow the EXACT same boss three times without complaining? Come on.Get the GOTY edition. When on sale, it's only a few dollars more, and it includes everything.			"

												Borderlands is a pretty great game; an even better co-op game. Amazingly good for the brain-dead gaming sessions whilst listening to music or podcasts. The story of borderlands isn't anything spectacular, it's not something I cared about whilst playing, however there are some charming characters to be found within. Aesthetically the game sports stylistic comic book-esque graphic that not only look great, but is a nice change from graphically realistic games. Soundtrack is stronger at some points than at others, overall it's generally decent. As far as being a first-person shooter goes, borderlands does most if not everything right, and let me say this now; reloading whilst sprinting is a godsend. Not only did I enjoy the combat but the loot system is great, always nice to find a better gun, and well guns are pretty much Borderlands' thing. I highly recommend buying if you have the friends to play it with.Those interested in buying the GOTY edition can see individual DLC reviews below;The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned - The Secret Armory of General KnoxxMad Moxxi's Underdome Riot - Claptrap’s New Robot Revolution "

												Probably the 2nd oldest game I still play on a regular basis. Borderlands is a game about 4 ""Vault Hunters"" who traveled to the planet ""Pandora"" to find an alien treasure known as ""The Vault"". Each character has a certain ""special"" skill and 3 different skill trees. Each skill tree supports a different playstyle depending on the character you're playing as (EG: Stealth, Medic, Tanking, Pistols). PROS:
 Each character is fun to play with several diverse ways to play Countless guns Funny side characters DLC adds a lot of content to the game Great soundtrack Lots of questsCONS: Once you've beaten the 2nd playthrough, you can't start a 3rd playthrough on that same character (you can complete side quests where all enemies, DLC quests, and weapon drops scale with your level, but the rewards from quests don't scale with your level.) A bit outdated by Borderlands standards, but still very fun to play If you're using a mic on Multiplayer it's either always on or always off, no ""press to speak""Overall, I'd give it a 8.5/10. "

												In nerdy terms, it's pretty hopeless. The bosses are a pushover, the guns are all over the place; some useless, others ridiculously powerful. It's a team coop game, but you have to stick with the same team all the way through, thanks to the rubbish levelling system and mission flags. Baddies are initially rather difficult but after a few missions way to easy to defeat for the rest of the game. There are no field of view settings so on widescreen it looks like you are viewing the world through binoculars....the list goes on.......so it's no wonder that Borderlands didn't get rave reviews.  But despite all the problems, it's a brilliant game! The music, atmosphere and sheer playability are second to none. The comic book style graphics are fantastic. And get the Game Of The Year too, because the DLC are great. The Underdome is so much fun it’s absolute must have.			"

												Borderlands is a FPS Action RPG game set in a planet called Pandora.You're a Vault Hunter, a mercenary that arrived on the planet seeking a place called The Vault. During your journey to riches beyond imagination, you'll have to stop and help the locals with their silly and insignificant problems, it's not like it takes much of your time and in exchange, they do help you get closer to your goal. Like in most RPG (and actually not many FPS) you have classes, skill trees, levels and more guns than you can carry... Or count.

												Guns, more guns, and yet more guns... if you have an insatiable need to shoot things and sift through hundreds upon hundreds of dropped items, in the hopes of finding that one rare gun that's marginally better than the one you already have, then this is most definitely the game for you. Oh, and it's pretty dang fun too. Borderlands is a sci-fi loot-fest shooter set on an alien planet. You play as one of 4 ""Vault Hunters"", on a quest to find and open a mythical vault that may or may not hold untold riches. Each of the characters has one unique special skill, plus a set of strengths and weaknesses (better in one weapon type versus another, etc). Unfortunately you can only pick one character at the start of the game, so if you want to try different characters out, you'll have to start multiple games. That kind of sucks, but it's not too big of a deal ultimately, and adds incentive for multiple playthroughs (if you are into making that kind of time investment). The shooting mechanics are pretty good and it's cool how many different types of weapons there are. It allows for tons of experimentation and variety. Gameplay basically consists of discovering a new area, collecting a bunch of quests that need to be fulfilled (though many are optional), completing said quests, getting more loot, leveling up, and proceeding to the next area. Rinse and repeat. Even though that might sound slightly boring on the surface, I assure you it is not. The game mostly stays fresh throughout and the writing is pretty good, bordering on laugh-out-loud funny at times (the game doesn't take itself too seriously). And oh yeah, there's a cute little robot named Claptrap... 'nuff said.There are a number of DLC campaign add-ons available as well. I believe all of them come with the GOTY edition, but if you don't have that version, I'd say it's worth picking them up after completing the main story (except maybe the Underdome DLC, which I haven't played), assuming you enjoyed the base game. In summary, if you like games with a cool sense of humor that involve first-person shooting things and/or lots of loot drops and weaponry, pick this up. It has a great style, good mechanics, and enough content to keep you occupied for many, many hours. A-			"

-Quick Review-Borderlands is a First Person Shooter, which has very witty humor, a great story, and at times a very challenging level system. Because this game is now rather “old” (seeing as it’s 2014) a lot of the mechanics and quest-style will reflect that age. But if you can overlook that, you will undoubtedly enjoy this game.-Long Winded Review-Hail Vault Hunters!  I will try to organize my review into sections, if you want a short review, look at my conclusion, if you’re interested about a certain part of the game look up the specific section, hopefully this will be useful instead of annoying. I hope my review will be useful to you.Introduction: (you can skip if you don’t care)I'm a firm believer in “gamer loyalty”, so I wanted to play borderlands so that I got the bonus stuff in borderlands 2. So I came into the borderlands backwards, started with the second, then played the first.So naturally there’s a risk doing something like that… you’re basically playing the higher quality game first, then moving on to an older one. It’s like if you played Mario Galaxy and then went back to the N64 Mario games. Analogy aside, you need to appreciate a game for how it plays to play a game in that way, and I do.Story-Review: (spoiler free)Something I have always liked about the borderland games is its story, and weather you’ve played the first or second borderlands, trust me, the story is excellent, the second expands on what has been done in the first, but you don’t need to play the first to understand it! (That is good game design if I’ve ever seen it.)The story has humor, drama, and twists and turns. Not only that but if you get the DLC you can to continue the fun with some side stories of your favorite (or new) characters in the borderlands!One final comment about the story, after playing through borderlands, I understood things a whole lot better in the second game, just because you have a foundation, and it give that whole “coming back” nostalgia feeling too it in the second game.Combat: (pew pew pew)I played at least a little bit of each class in this game, but I ended up leveling Mordecai, (Because I tend to prefer the sniper play style), although I played as Mordecai, I found myself testing out many different types of weapons. The initial thing that attracted me to borderlands was the concept of having guns that had different stats and abilities. (And believe me, they have many.)Choose between a high attack weapon, with terrible accuracy, or high accuracy + low damage + burst fire while zoomed. There really is unlimited potential to the types of weapons out there, the best is when you get weapons with unique abilities like bullet ricochet.Achievements: (I like achieesements, if you don’t – skip this)I know not everyone cares about this in a game, but for those that do, I have soloed most of the achievements in this game however there are plenty that you will need a friend to get. I intend to finish them out, but most of the ones left require some heavy grinding. It’s a very fun game that you get most achievements for just playing through.Anyone who’s spent much time going after achievements there’s just that point in the game where you’ve gotten all the easy achievements and everything else require grinding out the work or farming until you get those last few achievements. I still recommend this game even if getting several of the achievements is a headache.Final thoughts:Whether you get this game for the shooting, the story, the multiplayer feature, the classes, or the achievements, I recommend this game for anyone who is wanting to play a FPS in a more “quest” oriented story, even if you started out playing the first, it’s not that rough at you to go backwards into the borderlands, you’ll be glad you did. Fair warning, when you start out it does require a bit of work to get the hand of (or it did for me) but you can do it once you catch up in levels and gear.Best of luck, see you in the Borderlands Vault hunters!------Edits and updates------Borderlands 1Edit/Update September 18, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for  Borderlands 2Here's the URL to see my review for  The Zombie Island of Dr. NedHere's the URL to see my review for  Mad Moxxi's Underdome RiotHere's the URL to see my review for  The Secret Armory of General KnoxxHere's the URL to see my review for  Claptrap’s New Robot Revolution "

												This is one of the most addictive games I've played. The first couple of hours, I was thinking ""Wow, this game really doesn't have much plot."" After that, though, I was thinking ""Wow, this game really doesn't have much plot, and I don't care.""It's a great shooter. It's a great RPG. The ""87  Bazillion Guns"" promised in the trailer are fantastic. I love the variety. A big part of what makes you want to keep playing is the desire to see what kind of weapon you find next.The ending was... an ending. Not much more to say there.Bottom Line: If you're only into really story-rich games, maybe this isn't for you. Everyone else should play it.EDIT: I've now played the DLCs, and I don't love them.The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned features irritating undead enemies, including birds (so grab your shotgun), but I did like the ambience.Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot seems to be all about arena combat. I didn't play that one for long, because that's not really my thing, but it was well done for what it is. I HATED The Secret Armory of General Knoxx because it covers an enormous area, and no matter what progress you've made previously, you always start at the beginning location. Don't get this one unless you intend to play it in one sitting.Claptrap's New Robot Revolution is the best of the four. If you're just going to get one, get this one.			"

												Borderlands is an absolute blast of a game, no pun intended! Fans of first person shooters and roleplaying games will be in hog heaven with Borderlands excellent shooting mechanics, and the bazillions of guns, along with the lite RPG elements of it's character upgrade system. I spent many hours in this game and can't wait for the sequel. The only thing I did miss out on was the co-op play....I never got to play with anyone...just playin' with myself...hehehehe!			"

Loved it so much I bought it for PC and am playing it all over again.Pro:- Storyline- Character classes- FPS w/ RPG- Many weapons, abilities, side quests and DLC content- Graphic style unique and attractive; great music and sound- HIgh replay value; hundreds of game play hours- Many achievements- Single and Coop game play; able to use same character across different game playsCon:- Some boses seem unreasonably difficult no matter your character level (Crawmerax)- Some achievements are tedious to accomplish			"

												Borderlands is a really (really) good action game with rpg elements.In my opinion it would be best if you explored the game treating it as a rpg and not really an action game like other action fps(like counter-strike or even call of duty games).Can't wait to purchase the dlc's as well in order to completely explore the entire game.Pros : 1)Extremely fun storyline(jesus christ so much craziness),2)Easy to use customization,skill-trees,skills,3)Rpg elements that motivate you to build steadily your own character,4)Action elements so that even when you finish the game you can easily fight alongside with your friends,creat incredible strategies and have tons of fun,5)Incredible cel-shaded like toonish visuals,awesome musical effects,voice actors andCons: I didn't really find and serious con that would make me stop playing the game.Only thing that makes me a bit disappointed is the overpriced dlc's.P.S There ain't no rest for the wicked ;)			"

												Like any RPG, there are quests galore to complete for items, cash and experience, and the more of these you complete, more areas of the game will unlock. All quests can be completed in single player, although two players on the same system works just as well, as does three or four people playing together via the internet. All quests offer a set number of experience points, but experience gained through monster kills depends upon the level of the character and the level of the monster he is slaying - more experience for tougher monsters, and little or no experience for very weak monsters when your character is far more powerful.The art style is amazing, I know a few people who were put off by the cell shading look but once you're in game it all makes sense and the game wouldn't look right any other way, the characters are varied enough and some of the enemies are downright hilarious, shotgun toting midgets who fly back from the recoil when they fire at you are just one of the neat animations that this game is filled with.The storyline is a bit faint, your dropped into the game with the overall target been to find 'the vault' but there are hundreds of missions to do as you go through each area, most areas finish with a boss and some of the boss fights are pretty interesting (Boss's tend to drop their weapons after you fight them which is nice).

												Gosh I haven’t done a review in a while. Like others say and how obvious it is with the intro and trailers, Borderlands is a game about 4 ""Vault Hunters"" who traveled to the planet ""Pandora"" to find an alien treasure known as ""The Vault” With the hours played I have finished the whole game with a friend and I really don’t know what to say. It has an MMo feel to it (skills unlock and many quests to get with a massive world), personally I find the art style of the game very attractive and unique and very glad I have this game within my library. I feel it has become a “classic game” for its originality and style as well as creating a vast universe within their games. Borderlands as a series is a game that I feel is even more fun with friends and should be at least experienced by all. The enemies, the quirky characters, the weapons and the story give this…feel from a game that I can’t just explain in words. I hope this helps and good hunting Vault hunters!!A solid 9/10!!			"

However borderlands 2 and the presequel did everything that little bit better, so going back feels kind of stale.

Es gibt ein unglaubliches Sammelsurium an Waffen, weshalb man immer auf der Suche nach dem besten Equipment ist und Waffen vergleicht. Die Kampagne lohnt es sich sogar 2 mal durchzuspielen, da man mit dem erreichten Level, diese nochmals gegen angepasste Gegnerlevel bewältigen kann.Die Add-ons versprechen auch eine Menge Spaß, doch rate ich allen auf ein runtergesetztes Gesamtpaket zu warten, da mit diesen nur nochmal richtig Geld gescheffelt werden will (siehe Borderlands 2...)

												Borderland's biggest problem is that it's a loot game that actually OVERWHELMS you with loot, then gives you a pitifully disorganized mess of an inventory system to deal with it all.It's easy to fall into the familiar grind of stopping every few minutes to check the gun you just found against the guns you already possess to see if you've happened upon a small incremental upgrade. While this type of gameplay is inherent to many loot games, Borderlands' poor systems slow this whole experience to an insufferable crawl.It's a shame, because Borderlands is the type of world I could easily get immersed in, were it not for its constant need to scream LOOOOOOOT in your face all the time. There isn't a single corner of the vast open world that isn't stuffed with some variety of loot box, and each one has a bright shiny GREEN LIGHT that sticks out like a sore thumb in the brown and yellow tones of the world. This is intentional, because Borderlands really really wants you to care about loot. It wants you to loot everything, and you will spend more than half of your time in the game opening boxes for weapons, ammo, and cash, really for no other reason besides the fact that it's just so ♥♥♥♥ing GREEN and IN YOUR FACE ALL THE TIME. You could easily get through the game by looting 20% of what you find, and yet you will have your psyche exploited by the mechanic as you run around everywhere and loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot lootIf it were a well-designed mechanic, it might be a perversely enjoyable activity, the way it sort of is in better loot games like Diablo. But like I said, the game's biggest sin is its inability to let you manage the loot in an efficient way. It can't be overstated how cumbersome and unhelpful the whole loot system is. You can see a gun's specs hovering in front of you before you pick it up, but it will only represent whether its stats are better or worse than the gun you are currently holding, and only as vague up or down arrows signifying better or worse. The problem with this is that comparing a rocket launcher you've found to the pistol you're holding is strategically useless. Even if you ARE holding a launcher, HOW MUCH better or worse the stats are isn't visible, since your equipped gun's stats are hidden. What this works out to in practice is picking up every gun you see and going through your entire backpack every 5-10 minutes to slowly figure out what's worth keeping. Alternatively, you can ignore many loot drops, but since the game's common-uncommon-legendary-exotic-whatever classifications are pretty arbitrary, a relatively common green drop might outperform your rare yellow drop, so it's advantageous to always, always check. This becomes very, very dull.This might seem like a minor inconvenience, but it affects you constantly. Even the inventory menus themselves make no sense at all, and figuring out how to compare and even equip weapons is dumbfoundingly illogical to new players.It seems like it would have been so easy to design a system wherein the SMG you just found is instantly compared to the best SMGs in your backpack, all displayed visually next to one another in the game world. It's as if the devs knew that most of the loot you find is garbage and weren't really expecting you to think too hard about it, which undermines the entire point of the game.The bottom line is that Borderlands makes the whole process of finding better guns and becoming stronger a tedious pain in the ♥♥♥. It's just not fun. And it's a shame because the variety of Borderlands' weapons are what makes it so special compared to other shooters.Mechanically, as a shooter, Borderlands is just okay. I found precision weapons to be a chore to use, since your screen ""flinches"" too often to get steady beads when you get shot at, and the RPG nature of accuracy means your shots will often miss even when the reticle is lined up correctly. There are too many charging-type enemies (read: zero AI) that require you to jump backwards while shooting as the only effective strategy. Each class' special skill feels very underpowered and aren't that fun to use. And on a whole, animation is stiff and jerky which makes predicting enemy movement pretty hard. The guns do look, feel, and sound good though, which helps a lot.Challenge-wise, it's a purely mathematical level-based RPG, where missions over your level are hard as nails, and missions underneath you are cake walks. There is so much XP to earn though, especially with the DLC included, that it's very easy to only focus on missions that are at or below your level, which makes the entirety of the game very easy. I was vastly overlevelled for the last third of the game, which wound up being a good thing since I was so bored of it by that point.The story is barebones, interesting NPCs are sparse with practically no recorded dialogue, the enemy variety is lacking, the missions are mostly stale fetch quests, the vehicles are garbage, and there is a lot of backtracking required through areas you just cleared to go turn in said quests.It's actually a pretty miserable experience the more I think about it.Fortunately, a boring, lonely game like Borderlands is much less boring and lonely with friends. Kind of the way I imagine working an assembly line would also be less boring and lonely with friends.UNfortunately, I wound up completing the campaign solo since I couldn't find anybody to play with. (I can safely say that my Borderlands 2 co-op experience was superior.)Borderlands doesn't hide its multiplayer focus, with certain cutscenes referring to you as a group even when you're playing alone, and class-specific items dropping that you can't use, and better loot only accessible when you're with other people.I invested 48 hours into this product, giving up in the DLC playthroughs when I realized certain achievements required either heavy grinding for lucky drops or a second playthrough to finish. Also, I was bored senseless. It's hard to explain how someone can choose to not recommend a game they put that much of their life into....but just because I wasted my time doesn't mean I suggest that YOU waste YOUR time.Why didn't I stop? The answer is that while Borderlands is mostly a pretty below average game, it taps into gaming compulsions very successfully. It includes literally hundreds of quests to check off, one of which is ALWAYS displayed on your screen. No single quest takes particularly long, and there are always multiple quests to do in your area, so bouncing around from one to the next ""just to get them out of the way"" is an easy loop to get trapped in.Borderlands also features the operant RNG schedules inherent to the genre (read up on behavioral psychology in gaming), which means that every loot crate opened is a wild card chance at something good. I don't think it's designed maliciously, and one could argue that it's a generous game with its loot, but it's the type of system that will hook gamers no matter how bored they feel with the actual core gameplay.In conclusion, as this has been an intensely negative and long review, there are a few good things I want to mention.:D GOOD THINGS! :DSome of the voice acting feels really natural.The writing can be clever sometimes.It's relentlessly depraved.The arid atmosphere can be immersive.The art style is gorgeous and highly detailed, especially manmade constructions and signage.The whole game has lots of personality, from NPCs and bosses to cutscene direction and dialogue.You can shoot crazy midgets sometimes.

												This is the third time I've finished Borderlands, recently I've purchased the second game and so I wanted to go back, way back. Also not to long ago I've finished Tales from the Borderlands which became one of my favorite games and got me more interested in the series.Borderlands is a great first-person shooter with role-playing character progression, it can be played solo or up to 4 player co-op online. The original title used GameSpy servers for multiplayer modes. As a result of GameSpy's shutdown in 2013, 2K Games patched the game and moved the servers to Steam, as well as providing Steam-versions of the game for those that purchased the title through retail channels.The art style still looks good: #1, #2, #3. Also the soundtrack is great, just listen for a while.Next up for me is the DLC from the first game, somehow I never played any of them.			"

												Game Time as of this review: about 114 Hours Achievements: 80 / 80 — Some good humor in some spots in the game, especially in the Knoxx DLC. Wacky characters and some funny references. — It feels pretty satisfying to melt enemies and bosses with insane amounts of bullets. Ammo is abundant in the world, especially when you can cheat the RNG making it so you always get bullets for the weapon types you want. After a while, bullets become unnecessary if you use an Ammo Regeneration mod, making it less annoying since you don’t have to keep looting it. — Looting is this game’s major annoyance. Press a button to loot an item, and then repeat the process for each other item scattered on the ground. Certain enemies, like bosses, drop a ton of stuff, making it so you’ll spend most of your time in Pandora looking at the ground and looting. You can hold the loot button to execute an area loot, but the range is extremely short and you inventory is very small, meaning you’ll stop being able to loot items after half a dozen of these, at best. — The loot/weapon system is a mess. Weapons have a huge array of variable stats, including shooting speed, magazine ammo capacity, inventory ammo capacity, damage per bullet, bullet accuracy, bullet lag (I’ll come back to this one later) and elemental damage. The first time you play through the game, you obviously won’t have any idea of which elements are effective against each type of enemy. Making things worse, you can only equip four weapons at once (late game, 2 weapons early game), meaning you will also spend a lot of time swapping guns every time you enter a different area. No, you don’t get to use your favorite gun all of the time. It just doesn’t work. Also, seeing as your inventory is very small even after fully upgraded (by saving Claptraps) most of it will be filled with guns of various types and elements that you will need, making it so you have close to zero inventory space for loot and have to keep running back to vending machines to sell your crap. Loot rarity is also mostly non-functional, since, thanks to randomly assigned bonuses, it is possible for the crappiest low level weapon be stupidly good until 20 levels later, due to RNG. — Bullet lag. That’s right. Some genius at Gearbox thought it was a good idea to make each type of gun have a different bullet lag. If you shoot a medium distance object with a rifle, it will take way longer that it’s supposed to for the bullet to reach it. Even with a sniper, it’s near impossible to hit a non-stationary enemy at long distance. And forget about hitting moving targets with SMGs, unless you’re literally on their faces. What were they thinking, honestly. — Quick Travel is a blessing, but it’s not present in the Knoxx DLC, which by coincidence, has Kilometers of highways and makes you travel for a long time every time a mission asks you to go somewhere (very often). Also the missions tend to be repetitive and sometimes you have to kill every boss in an enemy base every time you get a mission to do anything in said base. Also, having to go through the base game twice and then going through all the DLCs to reach the level cap. Also, weird level sync where monsters are always 2-3 levels above you making them excessively hard to kill…… — Heavy Texture popping, especially after loadings, collision detection problems, where a small rock or piece of metal on the floor will bring you to a grinding halt, which means certain death against most bosses. — Most achievements involve hours of mindless grinding and some are virtually impossible unless you use exploits or design flaws. And even then the Coliseum achievements take several hours of uninterrupted play. — Multiplayer scaling is weird, making every enemy have several times more health, meaning that unless you and the other players are always focusing fire, each individual enemy becomes near-impossible to kill, unless you have infinite ammo or an ammo regen mod. So there you have it. There’s no doubt the game has a lot of problems. I haven’t found time to start on Borderlands 2 yet, but I trust many of these issues are no longer present in the sequel. That being said it was a fairly poor first attempt taking into account that we’re talking about Gearbox. Complete Review @ http://blurbarians.blogspot.pt/2015/05/borderlands.html#more "

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | *2* 3] = ~62% (50%-75%)A pure shoot-and-loot game. Even though this review is mostly for Borderlands 1, it applies to all three, so I copied it to all three. Since the games have been out for quite a while, there are convenient bundles with two or all three of them etc., make sure you check them out before purchasing.At first, I didn't get ""it"" and thought that the game sucks. I thought it was just a generic shooter (and once again with failed FOV - *sigh*) with gimmicky cartoon shader, very generic loot containers, guns with somewhat randomized values, and the super obvious fetch quest cliché.But then, a year later, I tried again - and I got ""it"". It's a well done generic shooter (whose FOV can be edited in a file) with an interesting fun-depressing otherworldly feel, cartoon shader, reliably balanced generic loot containers, a surprisingly powerful procedural weapons system, and simple quests that make you deal with all these things in various places and that give you some story background. What makes all this work is the whole that emerges from it. It's like acid music of the 1990s. The Roland TB-303 alone sounds boring, but if you use it right and let it play together with other stuff, it's a very powerful driver, and music history might remember you for it.I ended up buying and playing through BL1, BL2, BL The Pre-Sequel (which came out after 1&2 but whose story plays between 1&2), and almost all DLC. No regrets. It was not a perfect experience, but there's a reason I bought and played all three games, and the story didn't contribute much to this reason. It's just the mix of all the gameplay ingredients and - excuse me - the mindlessness of it. A simple but sufficiently deep shoot&loot trip that goes on for tens of hours. (According to howlongtobeat.com, roughly: BL1 20-60, BL2 30-80, BLps: 20-40)The quests become available over time, and you can choose freely which of the ones you soaked up into your quest management screen you tackle at which time. There's an indicator expressing how hard they will be for your current character level.I thought the procedural weapons approach would probably be stupid, that it would be e.g. just a bit more power or range. But no! There are many changing variables, even the weapon designs (and visual effects) change, fitting the weapon's character. Hunting / comparing for the best weapon and learning about where you'll probably find those and where rather not turns into a passion.WHAT'S WRONG?Too bad the inventory interface is not half as good as it should be. Well, at least you can mark weapons as garbage so that you can bulk-sell them once back at a vendor or machine, and you can even do a buyback for the identical price. But what complete idiot thought it would be a good idea to have the inventory interface move around incessantly? And you need to realize: You'll spend several hours with this interface, because comparing your guns is a core element of the game.Then there's the fact that the game will just forget where you have already killed people - they'll just be back on your next visit and loot containers will be refilled, you don't even have to die or reload/restart the game for this. This has upsides, of course, which would be why they decided for this, e.g. now you can keep grinding, and you can enjoy your new toys and your leveled-up character against old foes. It's rather important for balancing that you can't just wipe the world clean. But even though hypothetically, people would repopulate fortresses in reality, you will have to make yourself blind to the feeling that all you're doing is in vain, your actions leave almost no lasting consequence in the world. Just like in real life, right? Except in real life, you don't constantly whip the lands with powerful guns.What also sucks (but again makes sense, of course) is that you lose a lot of money whenever you die. There will be deaths, though, that are just unnecessary or unfair, or you might even get caught in a loop of dying, which maximizes frustration. This happened to me when I fought Wilhelm and didn't realize that I could just travel away via the obvious terminal. Why didn't I realize? I was mostly blinded by the fact that the arena is a place you can only reach by dropping in from a height that you can't jump, so you can't get out again. This clear message and the fact that I was still relatively new to Borderlands made me blind to the fact that there was an electronic exit right there.You can't save your game. At least it's not a classic campaign shooter quicksave that bakes every relevant world state detail into a nice file. Instead, you have your character profile which will change as you progress (e.g. incl. money loss from deaths; hint: If you Alt+F4 while you're still dying, nothing is lost.), and it's rather one of those ""general player state"" and ""checkpoint"" saves. On the one hand, this very character of savegame is a good thing: Checkpoints have the clear upside of getting you more involved and making the reality more real because you can't beat it into obedience by saving/loading at your leisure. The downside is: The game completely forgets everything but you. While fortresses have been repopulated when you revisit them even without loading, there are a few aspects of the world that stick - until you exit to main menu or out of the game and then continue playing, that is. It all couldn't revolve more obviously just around you. And there are the quite hard boss fights. Personally, I don't like boss fights, so ignore this paragraph as an actual negative, but I just find them stressful, and what others might misinterpret to be a sense of achievement in me is really just the relief that I managed to overcome this obstacle between me and more of the satisfying gameplay I want to enjoy. You know, like 1990s Eurobeat ""music"" (That I never liked.) where the painful hectic rap was the desert you had to endure before reaching the next fountain, making the refrain ever so slightly better than it actually was. The game does not have a whole lot of boss fights, but I had to throw everything into them and was often very frustrated when I didn't manage, because dying cost me a bunch of cash, and I had to start the fight completely from scratch.But Borderlands is fun. A well done shoot&loot world to forget yourself in.Not all Borderlands games have FOV settings, but with some config file editing, you'll always get what you want.			"

TL;DRAn interesting mix of an Action RPG and an FPS.+ Loads of side-quests+ Well-balanced for both SP and MP+ Setting and atmosphere ('MURICA!)+ Memorable characters+ Humour+ Art style+ Loot (some items are viable for a very long time)+ Skill trees+ Replay value+ Soundtrack- Picking up multiple items is a chore- DLC achievements- Relatively weak story- It requires an external program to change the FOV- No manual saveREVIEWBorderlands is a FPS game with some RPG elements. A wise man once said: ""if Diablo and Battlefield had a baby, it would be Borderlands""*. This game combines the FPP and gunplay with level progression, skill trees, and tons of randomly generated loot.The action takes place on a distant planet called Pandora in the future. There are rumours of some treasure being hidden in a Vault. The player can play as one of the four Vault Hunters: Lilith (specialises in deception and elemental weapons), Roland (soldier), Mordecai (sniper and gunslinger), and Brick (brute, specialises in melee and explosives). Each of them is memorable and adds to the game's replay value. Nevertheless, the story is quite weak, especially when compared to Borderlands 2. Pandora is modelled after a post-apocalyptic world, with a number of futuristic elements. Its ambience is enhanced by the unique cell-shaded graphics, marvellous soundtrack, hilarious (in a good sense) voice acting, and sense of humour. 'MURICA!The gameplay revolves around shooting the bad guys in the face, getting their loot, and completing quests. There is a myriad of side-quests and even more weapons. Albeit the gunplay has been heavily consolised, it is fun to use all the guns. Apart from shooting, every character has a unique active skill and a skill tree. For instance, Roland can deploy a turret, which can be further upgraded to provide ammo and health to everyone nearby. Moreover, there are weapon proficiencies (bonuses for using each weapon type) and challenges to complete (e.g. scoring a certain amount of critical hits, collecting dollars, etc.). Apart from getting the loot from chests and enemies, one can also visit a few types of vendor machines. There are numerous open areas which the players can explore on foot or by car. There also is a fast travel system to navigate through them.There are a few nuisances. Firstly, picking up mutliple items at once has a very short radius, making it somewhat tedious to gather all the loot. Secondly, in order to change the FOV, one has to use an external program. The default FOV may work fine on consoles but it is not suited for PCs. And lastly, the DLC achievements require a huge amount of grinding and some of them are purely luck-based.In summary, Borderlands is a great game that can be enjoyed while playing solo or with friends. Its ambience and mechanics make it an outstanding title even now. I strongly recommend it.*Or something along those lines.P.S.

												Borderlands was a new project by Gearbox Software back in 2009. An excellent FPS is more like sci-fi FPS, that occur on world called - Pandora - and counts with a few RPG elements, since loot, to level up system. Is great! Graphically speaking could be a bit weired for some of you, i still remember the first time i saw a trailer and i was meh.. but i started liking the details, textures. Thanks to the cell shading, the game could hide behind pretty simple textures without appearing low-res, as the game does not have to look realistic.Before we enter Pandora we have 4 characters to choose - The Hunter, Soldier, Siren e Berserker - that are all great and in case you play COOP, is better each of you use a different class. then you have the lvl up system, you will gain XP when you the main, secondary quest, also doing the challenges the game offer is great way to rank up.  After you get your character, you are now good to enter in Pandora, and i must say is not a pretty place to be - laughs - lot of bad guys to kill and some weird dudes too. about the game difficulty, well is not too hard perhaps if you play solo some parts could be a little tricky but you will do it for sure. After beating the main boss you can do a new playthrough, there enemies/boss will be a bit tough, is like doing transition from normal to hard. If you are someone like me, who love loot you will love this game, loot everywhere. There are a lot of ways to get the better loot, farming boss, chase the safe etc.. Like in normal games loot has many categories - green, blue, purple, orange e pearlescent - and of course everyone wants that orange one! Also Borderlands has a huge variety of guns to choose, so you won't get bored of it. That's it, i totally recommend you play this game, solo or in COOP and enjoy your journey in Pandora. ~ 8,5/10			"

												I've recently started playing Borderlands again after taking a short break, and in that short time it's made it's way in to my list of favorite games. It can be challenging, yet easy at the same time. But no matter what difficulty the mission is, it's rewarding and fun. With the exceptions of some of the DLC missions. A few of them are very annoying, such as Ned's Zombie Island's TK is alive! Brains series of missions, or the Clap Trap revolution DLC where you have to collect Clap Trap components. Other than that, Borderlands is amazing, and still holds up well with games today, and is easily one of my favorite games.			"

Great...For Its TimeConsidering the release date (2009), I imagine this game was top-tier for its time. Borderlands is unique, it's funny, it's got balanced classes, and a great new mix of FPS-RPG. It was fresh...in 2009-2011. However, I can't recommend this game to players who are used to the streamlined gameplay mechanics and witty dialogue that its successors possess. I tried picking this up three times. It's very hard to get into after playing Borderlands 2. Unless you're a masochist...or a really dedicated fan of the series and wanna finish it just to say you did.There are a lot of flaws in this installment that was addressed in the latter games. For instance, you're given quests to do only to run all the way back to turn in and fetch another quest—and tedious sidequests are mandatory if you don't wanna insta-die to mobs three levels higher than you. But if the mobs are one level higher, they're suddenly no match for you (doesn't make sense). For a game that's supposed to be open world, it plays very linear. Many quests are hard in the worst possible way: mobs are difficult—not because they have challenging mechanics—but because they come in swarms and they have massive health pools. That gets boring really fast. There is no ammo sharing, you have to manually pick up eeeeverything, no mini-map (you have an incomprehensibly broken compass), and there are rarely any voice-overs. The world feels as bland and lifeless as its sidequests—don't expect the vibrancy of Pandora that we see in Borderlands 2 to be here. It ain't there.For its time, it was brilliant and fresh. For now, where quests no longer feel like chores, it's deeply flawed. I see why some fans of this game don't like Borderlands 2—it's sillier and full of memes and pop culture references (which I enjoy). It's rough around the edges but I'm glad I played this because I appreciate the sequels that much more.If I played it first, 8/10. But I didn't so—4/10 (I'm sorry ;~;).			"

												I enter a big world, where i had a lot to explore and show the enimies who has the biggest gun. At the beginning, the game is really easy, maybe a little bit difficult, since I  recognize which enemies i can take on und which not. After i cleared of the first and second area, i thought the game would now be very boring but lucky for me i was wrong.  Why? Because on the next step of the story, i met a lot of interesting new buildings, new characters and i had a lot of fun to explore the region also to compare the new weapons i found.Normally, a very good game and i enjoyed playing it, really, but there are more than one areas, where the enemies are fully overpowered and its very difficult to beat them. Fortunately it is more in the middle of the game and at the end. But even at the end i did not recognize what i had to do to beat the last big enemy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For you germans guys :Ich hatte sehr viel Spass mit dem Spiel, startete in einer großen Umgebung, wurde sehr gut mit der Steuerung des  Spiel vertraut gemacht und konnte völlig entspannt starten. Etwas schwierig fand ich es herauszufinden mit welchen Gegnern ich mich anlegen kann und mit welchen nicht. Naja, nachdem ich dann die ersten Karten erkundet habe, hatte ich schon die Befürchtung das es nun sehr langweillig werden wird und sich alles wiederholt.Glücklicherweise lag ich hier vollkommen falsch, da ich in den neuen Bereichen, die ich nach und nach freischaltete absolut beeindruckende Charaktäre, und auch Landschaften kennenlernte, die mich offen und sprachlos erscheinen ließen.Nicht weil es so ungewöhnlich ist, sondern weil das Spiel nun schon fast 10 Jahre alt ist und ich es beeindruckend finde was damals schon möglich war.Da könnten sich viele Spielehersteller eine ordentliche Scheibe von abschneiden. Jedenfalls hat mir das Spiel auf lange Sicht gesehen sehr viel Spass gemacht, einzig an einigen Stellen droschen die Gegnermassen derart auf mich ein, das es mir sehr schwer gefallen ist zu erkennen, auf welche Art und Weise ich dieser Gegnerübermacht Herr werden kann.Ganz besonders hat mir auch die Hintergrundmusik gefallen. Da macht es mir wesentlich mehr Spass Gebiete erneut zu erkunden, da es oftmals vorkommt, das in eigentlich abgeschlossenen Gebieten neue Aufträge freigeschaltet werden.			"

												Slower than the second game, the first incarnation is still eminently fun. Indeed, if you're looking for a good time with friends, you really can't beat the levity and wit of the Borderlands franchise. This first game has only very minor issues (and I'm nitpicking): co-op can be unbalanced with different rewards and disparate leveling at times (depending on what your build is, you can level up much more quickly than your mates). Besides that, rare gun drops are few and far between. Make sure you get the DLC as nearly all add to the fun, with the exception of the tedious Moxxi's Underdome.  "

Classic shooter with the most guns EVEREven after all these years, the original Borderlands feels like a true classic, playing it like coming home - even for a short time - to a well-known spot. The story is more than decent, although a bit drawn-out: you're a vault-hunter, lookng for the ultimate prize on a most inhostible planet, Pandora. You make progress through the vast landscapes of the planet, fighting lots and lots of monsters, bad-guys, and some VERY badass bossess (they're even labelled as such!). The actual fighting and shooting is extremely well done: every gun, every type of weapon has a great ""feeling"" to it and firing it is very satisying.But there is more, much more to Borderlands. First of all, there are literally thousands, nay, hundreds of thousands of guns waiting to be looted. The game makes use of a random-generated drop-system, with ligher level enemies dropping more interesting and more unique loot. These are devided into several colours, with white being the most common ones, and going right up to purple and very rare green items. This system just works perfectly for me: it's so satisfying to keep on fighting, just hoping for that even better gun to drop.But Borderlands is not only a very well crafted first-person shooter, it's also a RPG up to a certain extent. There is some sort of levelling-system which gives you action points, to be invested in better skills. You can also choose from four quite different classes at the beginning of the game, and having played each of them, I can say that all four have a unique feel to them. This really augments the singleplayer experience! As for multiplayer, it's almost - but not quite! - dead by now, but you really want this game for the immersive, action-packed singleplayer. Highly recommended!Gameplay: 25/30Graphics: 16/20 (shell-shaded and very atmospheric, but sometimes a tad dull, brown and grey)Sound: 7/10 (I like the totally different gun-sounds, but ambietent sounds could have been better)Replayability/longelivety: 14/20 singleplayer has really tons of gameplay, potentially you could play four times as each class)Technical/stability: 18/20 (very smooth experience, tons of options to scale according to your rig)Overall: 80/100Played on a Intel Core2 Duo @2,66 GHz; Radeon HD 5850 & 4GB RAM			"

												Like Fallout 4 but feel like it's ""meh"" due to it using Skyrim's engine/ just being boring at times? Have you played Destiny but absolutely hated its looting system engrams and want a better version of its loot system? Do you like goofy over the top jokes with crazy characters? This game is for you! Well... maybe. Borderlands is a great game and it takes time to get through, it doesn't feel like a game I could take bite sizes of and play here and there, it feels like a sit down and play whole title. This game leans heavily on its writing and characters, and without them, it would have utterly failed imo. This was a single player play through, so this is a review written by a lone experience. Here's some pros 'n cons!Pros:- Interesting cast of characters that are rememberable and unique.- The game will break the 4th wall but tastely and not rip you from the immersion. Great writing, and plenty of jokes that will actually make you laugh out loud, no lie. LOL- Looting weapons is great and it's nice to find some badass epic or legendary weapons not given by bosses.- Unique skill tree building will allow you to build your unique vault hunter the way you want to play them.- Does a great job making sure you feel like you're in a trashed planet with a bunch of scum bag bandits who can't write nor barely speak proper English. - Fun unique DLC that came w/ the bundle I got was fun and fairly more entertaining than the original game.Cons:- Long treks back 'n forth from quest boards to waypoints on the map.- Game is not fully optimized for controller support. All interactions will specify pc UI/button usage, and unless you've figured out the buttons and usage through the menu, you'll have a bad time. - This same Wasteland is nice, but also bad? It would have been nice for a change of scenery to be honest. Most of the game makes you feel like you're stuck wading through trash piles and barren, lifeless and dry/dead plains just to hope that the quest you've been treking across the map to get to will be fun and exciting.- by the 3rd quarter of the game weapons are unique in nature and have some cool effects, but the weapons you may have looted hours upon hours back are better than legendary loot? Kind of makes it feel like you're stuck with the same  ♥♥♥♥ for the rest of the game's experience. (Even the DLC)- Claptrap never SHUTS THE  ♥♥♥♥ UP ABOUT HAVING NEW QUESTS AT QUEST BOARDS OR PERSONNEL! More than half of these extra tagged on quests are lame, agrivating, and annoying to do. Mainly the ones where you have to build weapons from scattered parts only to cash the quest and get a  ♥♥♥♥   ♥♥♥ gun you'll vendor 2 minutes after cashing.- Menu for quests sucks in its organization and is hard to use since it doesn't work hand in hand with your map to figure out where you have to go. - No mini map.- Vehicle gets stuck one every little  ♥♥♥♥ing rock you accidently run over (or guard rail) and you are forced to get out, blow that stupid  ♥♥♥♥ing piece of  ♥♥♥♥ up and run your  ♥♥♥ the rest of the GOD DAMN WAY TO THE QUEST MARKER. UGH.Anyways, yes, this review had many faults to pros, but I honestly enjoyed this game. I'm currently still playing some of the DLC before continuing my venture in BL2 which imo is far better than the first in almost every way. If you start w/ BL2 I don't blame you, the first can seem boring, but not uninspired. The game lacks much, but if you play the second, trust me, you'll love the characters so much you'll want to play homage to the first game. On a scale one 1- 10, I'd give this sucker a 7/10. Good game, even great at times, but not without its set of issues. Good luck out there Future Vault Hunter! :D			"

												I remember reading about Borderlands. It sounded cool. Procedurally generated guns? A neat-looking world? Awesome. Then they made it cell-shaded, which was... well, weird, but fun. The resulting game? Pretty fun too. It's seared into my memory as nothing less than pleasant awesomeness. I can't even begin to tell you how much fun I had pretending to be someone's hat by riding around on top of their car in my own.I was the best hat.Finding a loot chest felt good. Spending time jumping around the maps felt right. The enemies were neat, the guns inventive, the bosses kinda fun. It took me a long while to kill the final boss--where a friend killed it in less than half a second. Okay, so I didn't get the best loot on the planet, but I still had a blast. The game was funny, too. While the actual plot could have been better, the story told in logs and lore was amusing, and the character barks were great.Where Borderlands really excelled, however, was the DLC. Doctor Zed was a minor disappointment, not because it wasn't funny (it was hilarious), and not because it didn't have a lot of content (it had a lot of content), but because some of the content was an awful lot of ""hey, go there, kill a thousand of that, bring me back some brains."" This got a bit old after a while. Moxxi's arena DLC was, well, an arena DLC. Not all that fun. But then, like a spark of inspiration from the gods, we got The Secret Army of General Knoxx, which had like twelve to fifteen hours of content, cost $10, was fun, well-written, smart, and excellent. It is still the gold standard for DLC. After that we got Claptrap's Robot Revolution, which was not quite as excellent, but we're talking Jaws to Jurassic Park here--still greats, regardless of which one you value more.Borderlands is still, years after its release, a game worth playing. I still know most of the maps by heart, still have memories of some of my finest battles ingrained in my mind. Still feel a bit odd when playing the sequel and not having Bloodwing by my side. You definitely don't want to just skip it and head straight for Borderlands 2.Only complaints? It wasn't a great PC port, so it had no FOV slider and used Gamespy for its online multiplayer component, meaning it was really hard to play with certain people.			"

A game that sparked its own franchise - the craziness is addictive, exciting, funny... everything you need!Boasting solid co-op and single player action, it's not hard to see why Borderlands is (or was) a favourite for so many. While Borderlands 2 is often liked even more by the vast majority who have played it, this title still has a special place in my heart of heroism.The story is simple enough. You are a Vault Hunter - a title of some import in the game'ss lore - and you are hunting for a Vault on Pandora. Pandora is a world full of wild animals and bandits (and the occasional semi-sane person offering quests and the like) all intent on getting in your way and making life rough for you. As for the Vault... I think the hype for what's inside it has inflated the locals' expectations a bit. The promise of godly weapons, abilities, etc. You get the picture. Every bandit and his meat bicycle wants in, even though it only opens once every 200 years.Getting the Vault Key fragments is about what you'd expect - shoot lots of guns to kill lots of things. The descent into combat is made simple by convenient colour-coding, ranging from throw-away white-grade items to beautiful yellow and orange rare treasures (and even ultra-rare pearlescents if you have the General Knoxx DLC) that often have hidden abilities on top of their already impressive abilities, such as improved rate of fire, clip size or even the addition of elemental damage.The graphics style is cartoon-like, with black outlines around most every object. This is a good thing as it meshes well with the gameplay style and humour. It's even possible to change the field of view, if you are willing to invest a little time on the internet. Controls are not hard to get used to - as you progress you'll eventually be able to equip four weapons at once for quick switching, allowing you to focus more on combat and less on micro-management. Of course, with the game engine's random gun generator allowing for thousands of different weapons to spawn, choosing just four to equip poses its own problems! Even grenade mods can vary wildly - from rubber grenades that bounce around with no fuse, to cluster bombs, health stealing grenades and even teleporting grenades! Other equips include relics, shields and even class-specific mods that alter your specific character's skill set and abilities.The classes themselves number just four, but they each have their own special ability in combat that makes each of them unique and fun to play. Brick, Mordecai, Lilith and Roland each have Berserking fists, a pet bird Bloodwing, Phasing magic and turrets respectively, and with a grand total level cap of 69 the builds can get very powerful indeed. New Game + games will make it seem like you aren't powerful though, as everything scales to just a bit over what your current level is. It's still entirely doable.I've mentioned the humour briefly. There may not be much when compared to the sequel, but it's there. Some great dialogue includes:""Smokin' Jesus ♥♥♥♥♥ cinnamon! That is a monster!""""Never look at my fist, ♥♥♥♥♥!""""I uh, I hate to send you away, you're great company and all... but I, I gotta go take a dump. I gotta take a dump something awful! Something real awful! Oh.. never mind... it's gone now.""""That's the beauty of the undead - if you kill them they're just dead again, and I just fire up the mojo, and make them re-undead and they're back...""Brick's laughter and insane hooting noises during his special ability are a personal favourite.I probably haven't covered everything. If you love a good FPS (this game is more like a role-playing shooter) you'll give it a go and discover the rest of it for yourself anyway. Which I urge you to do. It's a game I'll definitely be coming back to.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. This is the game that starts one of the best series of video games. And though this game isn't the series' pinnacle, it is definitely one of the best in there.Pros:Amazing humorCreative gameplayTONS of randomly generated gunsUnique characters with skill treesFun multiplayerAwesome DLC'sChallenging bossesInteresting plotCons:2009 graphics (which is expected since it's a 2009 game)Quite a few fetch quests (though not always plot quests)Repetitive dialogue (I know, the rakks got Jess)But I definitely recommend this game. The negative reviews were mainly from people going from Borderlands 2 to Borderlands 1, so you can assume that going from a new game to an older game would make you feel that the older one stinks, right? And if you buy the game, you should try to wait until Game of the Year edition goes on sale, because the DLC missions are really fun and usually adjust to your character level. Happy Vault hunting!

												Besides stating I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The ability to co-op and loot. The story is fine. Maybe a bad ending. But the side stories from the DLC add-on (except Moxxi's) were very good.I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Worked hard after borderlands 2 came out to 100% this games achievements. I would highly recommend anyone to play this game. Its very playable solo, with a friend, or with a group.Roland, Lily, Brick, Mordecai and our best friend Claptrap - make the world of Pandora a great place to explore, shoot things, and of course LOOT!

												Borderlands is the cult classic loot shooter, where the main goal is to kill stuff and collect guns and guns and even more guns.Borderlands takes place on a planet of Pandora where danger lurks around every corner, we play as the vault hunters who came to Pandora seeking a vault, a place that contains fortunes. You can pick from four different characters Brick, Roland, Lilith and Mordecai The game is an RPG infused FPS. You run around killing stuff and looting chest for better equipment. The game is very fun and getting better equipment is also incredibly fun. The four characters you choose from have different abilities. Brick has berserk mode where he punches stuff and in rage mode regains health, Mordecai releases his pet Bloodwing which is a one hit kill on a random enemy in the battlefield or damages bosses, Roland puts down a turret which kills anything it sees and Lilith goes into phaselock mode where she goes invisible and after that releases a shockwave which kills or damages anyone around them. Each character is awesome but it's best to use the one to suit your play style the best.Graphics are awesome. The cell shaded look is awesome and even though some of the textures are mediocre this game is very appealing. The environments are very bland since all of them are deserts. I'm still very glad that the change from realistic to cell shaded happened.Audio is mediocre, I like some of the soundtrack but overall it's very bland. The gun sounds are awesome and everything but a lot of it is re used and some of the sound effects are quite bad.  Overall very mediocre sound design The game can get quite tough at certain points, some of the enemies are higher levels than you and will kill you in seconds. Your best option is to do every side quest to level so the later sections in the game aren't as tough.Level design is alright for the most part but some of the maps in the later sections of the game get really confusing. Overall it's okay for the most part.The main game itself took me 18 hours to complete everything with every side quest, with all the dlc it took me around 30 hours. The game also has tons of replay value, you can play Ultimate Vault Hunter and True Hunter which are more difficult versions of the game and you can also try the different characters and not to mention you can always play the game with friends which is a lot of fun.The game has one big problem. It's incredibly buggy. I've had many problems playing the game and DLC and constantly look for solutions to the problems I was having. Some of the issues were quests not showing up, I couldn't turn in quests. get stuck in the environments and fall through the levels. Overall there's nothing too game breaking and with enough time you could find a fix for the problems.Borderlands is a must play for everyone. To date this is one of my favorite games of all time. This game is incredibly fun and funny too. This is incredibly fun game and even despite the issues this is a must play for everyone. My suggestion is get the main game and skip the DLC's cause they're not very good but if you want more then sure go ahead and buy it but I suggest saving your money for Borderlands 2. This is a must play for everyone. I give Borderlands a 9/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Awsome storyline and easy-to-play format.  I really enjoyed the characters.  The variety of items wasn't lacking and the challenge, for me, was satisfying.  I've played it through with 3 characters and still playing.  The graphic style is unique.  It was easy to get used to on the PC, great control with mouse & keyboard.  Kudos to the writers, developers, and publishers.  I hope you guys keep pumping out more of this kind of FPS.  This game was thoroughly entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone who craves that ""can't stop playing until 2AM crap I'm late for work"" experience.			"

												Borderlands is truly a classic. It brings in an innovative plotline, with twists, turns, and everything around. It also adds 87 BAZILLIONONDIEREST GUNS, allowing players to really shoot 'n' loot, and kicks a** in general.Plot:Borderlands isn't linear. You can choose your way through Pandora, and do whatever the crap you want. It has approx. 30hrs. of Singleplayer gameplay for ONE PLAYTHROUGH, and countless more for the 2nd playthrough, four characters and DLC maps. In addition, there are progressive enemies, scaling up so you're never bored!Graphics/Performance:Borderlands is widely regarded as gray, grey, brown and grey. While I agree, it does have some beautiful art, and amazing guns. It can run on the modest of computers (mine is 2GB RAM, and it worked well on low settings), but is also a monster on those 16GB Alienware computers. Lag is non-existent, and the stuttering you get from COD: Whatevercrap doesn't exist.RPG/Skills:Borderlands adds a plethora of things to the shooting genre; customize your character with skill points, and morph them into whatever builds you want! In addition, players can swap out elemental relics to customize action skils, and that decisions in-game result into different out-guns, largely allowing customization. The guns in-game truly allow personality, with four elements, and 8 different manufacturers.Really, Borderlands is a great game. While it isn't Borderlands 2, it's great for those on a budget or Borderlands fans. GET THIS GAME NOW! "

												First off let me say, you do not want to play this alone. It's a much better time if you play it with at least one other person. Getting past that, this game is an odd gem. Released around 2009, this is a first person shooter/open world/rpg game with quite a bit of weapon variety across the 4 classes you can play as. You have (as I just mentioned) 4 choices, Lilith the support character, Roland the most black support gunner in gaming, Mordacai, the sniper with a cool bird that kills things, and my personal favorite, Brick, a bulky hamfisted guy with a bad temper. Each of these classes have ""action skills"" which are unlocked at level 5. Brick being able to go beserk and punch things, doing very heavy damage and recovering health. Mordacai being able to use bloodwing, a bird that homes in on enemies and does damage  no ♥♥♥♥ . Lilith, being able to phasewalk (don't ask me how that works, I don't play much of the siren). And Roland has his turret, which is very useful if you do decide to play alone. Moving on, the game itself is quite large, but the locations are level locked with the foes. So if you're level 20, going back to the start you will still fight the level 1 enemies there. Grinding is also a debatable issue, but it's not terrible in this case as there are plenty of side and main quests that will fetch you decent XP. The gunplay is what you would find in any other fps, exept this has more of a Halo feel to it due to the slight moon jumping and grenade physics. Another big part of this game is the driving, which feels amazing once you get used to the mouse sensitivity on the steering  unless your a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who uses a controller, then your sensitivty should be fine from the start.  Again, the driving goes to the Halo style of control, floaty yet tight turns where the camera controls the car. Now on to the gun variety. I think that the marketing strategy they pulled for this game (and the ones after it) of having billions of guns, is a lie. You may have quite a few guns, by quite a number of in-game gunsmiths, but they are mostly the same gun with slighty different stats and maybe a longer name or a model change. Guns also have elemental effects, as do your action skills, going from explosive to corrosion, they make fighting some enemies go from hard to easy, or the other way around. Moving away from that, the controls are tight and the keybinds are set just fine. Maybe it was just my game or my pc, but voice chat is a little iffy on my reciving end. All in all, is this a good game and worth the $20? Maybe. If you're looking to have a good time with a couple of your friends, then yes, by all means get this. In my opinion, this is the best game out of the current three. I also advise getting the DLC along with it, at least the one that increases your level cap.			"

												Dawm you borderlands! This game is so much fun, that it's easy to forget the time. Pros:- Fun and silly comments of the characters + well chosen voice actors (both playable and NPC's)- over 2 billion weapons to choose from- good looking cartoonish graphics- and so many more that it's hard to even think of things to sayCons:- sooo much walking (until you get a car)- not enough inventory space to cary all the stuff you find (in order to cell it all and make a ton of cash)- road-kills are too over powered (*Drives around like a mad man, killing everything in his path*)All and all it's a great game and I can't wait to start playing the second one.

												One of the best games I have ever played. Great story, tons of action and as the trailer says ,,87 bazillion guns"" I have yet to find more than two of the same gun! Very rewarding missions, epic feeling after killing an enemy that you really shouldnt be able to because you are underleveled. TONS of locations and enemies. Action packed, no joke the action never stops. A lot of achevements and weapon effects! The game is even fun after you finish it! You can choose to play it all again ( I recoment that ) with your whole inventory and level kept the same! 4 Player co-op is just the cheery on top! I don't think it would be as fun as it was playing it the first time with my friend! The one thing it does lack however is vehicles, it only has one (Or two if you count the rocket launcher and machine gun types different) and ofcourse you can customize the colour. But still the lack of vehicles in the game is not a setback. Also a good thing is that this game can run on a ,,potato"". I have a bad computer and I have no problem runing it on 60fps with medium settings. You might need to tinker with the resolution though. To sum up, if you like good story , grinding, epic missions and shooting everything you see, you will like this game!			"

												I think I've started and restarted Borderlands about a dozen times since I first played it. I keep coming back to it because it's a solid game, but after a certain point it's so tedious that I don't want to play any longer. I'd first played it back before the first DLC came out, and I still haven't finished it.Borderlands is a good FPS. The art style is unique, the shooting is great, the weapon types are varied, and the randomly generated enemies and weapons keep it (somewhat) fresh. There are many missions (ranging from ""kill this"", ""survive them"" to ""push this button and kill something else""). The HUD and UI are laid out well. The four characters and their upgrade paths play differently enough that you can get a lot of replayability. But...Pandora is interesting and exciting. You get a backstory as you go along, if you're listening close enough. And you wonder what's being left out. Was it always such a s***hole? Or was it because the Dahl corporation released its convict labour when they pulled out? Because it looks like it's been falling apart for a very long time, and we're just the latest bad thing to happen to it.But...The characters are interesting. Their random banter fills in the void, and the mission text adds to the character of the world. The human enemies are varied, and so are the creatures. There's no one strategy that will get you through the game, you have to work at it, and see what works. Getting killed has a penalty (just money, really), but it doesn't slow down the game, and it is possible (at times) to get through an area by sheer attrition (though not in arenas and not against boss creatures).But at some point, it gets tedious.I hesitate to call it ""backtracking"" because it's a pretty open world (with a definite direction as you move from area to area), but enemies respawn when you travel back through an area that you've visited before. And I'm sure it's okay for folks wanting to ground out a few more levels, but it leaves me without a sense of accomplishment, because as soon as I move on, the bad guys will be back. I'll rush through areas and then rush back because I don't want to fight the same fight so soon after. In spite of that, I still come back to Borderlands, because it is a good game, and I keep wanting to see if I can find that next gun or shield, and if they'll be better than what I have now.Would I recommend it? Yes, I would. Borderlands is a solid shooter, and I expect it's a lot more fun for those who enjoy co-op (unlike me). And it's good fun even when you're on your own.			"

												There's only one way I can describe this game so far.... and that is GUNS. Tons and tons of guns! This game is honestly just perfect. There's plenty of enemy variety and guns that your character specializes in that makes combat diverse and entertaining. The world of Pandora is yours to loot as you constantly keep searching for that better gun, and trust me, that itself is very addicting. I often find myself just running around looking for a new gun to blast some bandit's head off with. And the Eridian Weapons.... my god, the Eridian weapons. Ever wanted to snipe a Badass enemy with a bolt of lighting? Maybe you want to kill some Psychos with exploding energy balls? You can do all that and much more here. Many different elemental weapons provide an entertaining and brutal kill. If you like ANYTHING I just mentioned above, you need this game. It's mandatory. (And this is just the tip of the iceburg, there's much more to enjoy)EDIT: Now that I have more experience with the game I can safely say that eridian weapons are garbage. But they're fun to use in playthrough 1. I just got a bit overhyped about them when I first started out :P			"

												I played the... DRM-free version of this soon after it came out, around 2010. Now I've completed it again for the achievements. The graphics haven't aged well. While not utterly terrible by today's standards, they get tiresome quickly. The cel-shaded style has not stood the test of time here, perhaps due to how ""dirty"" and ""rusty"" everything is supposed to be. The core gameplay is fun though, definitely worth giving it a go. In terms of design, Borderlands is a piece of gaming history. Not a big piece mind you, not deserving a chapter of it's own but at least a big footnote. For maximum enjoyment I suggest just going through the main story and ignoring the DLCs. If you're a lore- or achievement-completionist you'll need the DLCs but then be ready for tedium and even worse writing than the main game.			"

												Without a doubt, one of the best ""Shopping Simulator"" games ever made.    Do you enjoy killing a bunch of things, picking up lots of ""loot"", then going to a shop to sell and buy approximately 4,678 times in the course of a 50+ hour gaming experience? Then this is the game for you.    If, like myself, you would prefer to only kill one type of enemy about, oh, 800 times over, rather than 8,000 times over, the preposterously lengthy and repetitive game-play might wear a little thin after a while. Personally, I enjoyed about the first 30 hours, and only kept going all the way to the end out of principle (having reached the point of no return).    And the best part of all? If killing the final boss isn't enough for you, the designers have kindly offered the opportunity for you to KEEP PLAYING, even though the plot is finished and the credits have rolled. But hey, you still have MILLIONS more enemies to kill and BILLIONS more things to pick up and sell. So why stop. EVER..?Think I'll give myself a slight rest before Borderlands 2. Don't get me wrong...this game has tonnes of personality, fantastic graphics, a great world, amusing characters, and enough good ideas for a good many games. But you really, really, REALLY can have too much of a good thing. And whatever you do, don't even HUMOUR the notion of tackling it single player. If ever a game needed friends with headsets, this'd be it. WAY too much brainless ""fun"" for one person to endure alone.Verdict: 7.5/10.			"

												For anyone coming from Borderlands 2 wanting to see where it all started here are a few pros and cons in comparison with BL2:Pros:- Much better loot system. Anyone who has clocked in enough time in Borderlands 2 will know that finding anything better than Green is fairly uncommon, but in this you will be find 10 times better and more varied loot and twice as often.- Fairer Scaling. The scaling in this game is Linear instead of Borderlands 2's Exponential, meaning that when you find a powerful weapon, it will be useful for much longer before having to replace it with a more powerful weapon.- Easier to run. Granted this is just due to it being older but even still, it's something I guess.- Cheaper. Again this is just due to it's age, but still, the GOTY is cheaper than the bsae game of Borderlands 2.- Backstory to Borderlands 2.- Able to play as Brick, Roland, Lilith and Mordecai. Awesome NPCs, Awesomer Playable characters.- Modding ability. This game can actually have modded content, although it's not officially supported by the devs.Personal Opinion:- Different feel. This game has a more dark and serious feel than the second Borderlands game. Some people may like it, some may not.- All the Areas have the same look to them. Every area is either a desert-like area, run-down buildings or Atlas buildings, with the Zombie DLC and the final area being the only exceptions. Again this can be a matter of opinion.Cons:- Skill Trees. The characters skill trees aren't as fleshed out as in Borderlands 2, with the major gamechanger 1 point skills not being there. While i'm not in any way saying the skill trees are bad, they're just lacking something that Borderlands 2 has.- Voice acting. The voice acting in this game can feel very hit or miss at times, with some characters sounding cool, while others feel very flat and last-minute.- Animations. Same as above, some animations are good, while others feel robotic and basic.OverallWorth getting if you want to see where it all started, although as a first purchase in the Borderlands franchise, it's better going with number 2. Get if on sale and definitely get the GOTY.8/10			"

Borderlands is honestly one of the best FPS games I have played in a while. Not only did it offer a great story line, but it enhanced the player experience through multiples quests, superb sound quality, and a unique graphic style that was very pleasing to the eye. Pros+  Large amount of quests (216 to be exact)+  UI was very user friendly and easy to follow+  Great game to play with friends, however... (listed in Con)+  An extremely large amount of weapons and gears available+  Sounds were very realistic and the music, while not the best, was sufficient+  Graphics were a huge plus (and based off of games that I've played, unique)+  Game play was challenging, but not too challenging where you couldn't progress+  Dialogue: usually I like to skip conversations, but these were too good to pass upCon-  Lack of a mini-map which threw me off (map available in inventory)-  A lot, a lot of DLC's required to make gameplay the best it can be-  Of course this is preference, but I found that this game was a lot more fun to play with friends; offers a fairly lackluster single-player option-  Be prepared for some glitches and bugs: While I did encounter a minimal amount, they were enough to make me rage. The one I came across, as I think many others have as well, was in General Knoxx's DLC. If you decide to loot the hundreds of crates instead of progressing through the quest, you will be barred from entering again (which means you will not be able to complete the quest). Quite silly how they don't allow more than 3 minutes (I think) to loot the cratesDespite it having been released awhile back, this game gets two thumbs up from me. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.Overall: 8.5/10 "

												When something is called Pandora, you can bet your marbles something bad is going down.For those of you who are not so well versed on the subject of Greek mythology, Pandora was the name of woman who was sent to earth by the gods as punishment for their disrespectful actions. Pandora was moulded by the smithgod and endowed with all the desireable traits anyone would want in a person. Lastly they gave her boundless curiosity. She was then given a box (or an urn depending on your textbook) and sent to earth with the simple message to never open the box. What was in the box you ask? Well...despair, terror, disgust, disease, death, pain, agony, greed, lust and lastly: hope. Pandora opened her box and the world was made miserable and the only respite was the tiny bit of hope at the bottom. Now that we have a context, can you image what is hidden on a planet called Pandora? Há! Wrong! It's guns! Guns and bullets and rockets and bullets and bullets. There are so many bullets on Pandora you'll be wondering why people are still paying with cash when you can get bullets and guns from everywhere. The whole point of the game is to open a mythological vault (Pandora's Vault. See where this is going?) On your way you'll be beset by all manner of horrors and fiends. So it is nice that you can pick up guns everywhere and share your bullets with everyone. Obviously I meant: shoot at everyone. Stuff gets a bit blurry after a while cause the game is so vast, so huge, you'll be dragging yourself from one end of the planet to the other over and over again, and everything looks the same. This is my chief complaint with this game: It is huge, but doesn't offer much in the way of streamlining. There is some fast travel possible, but only from certain places. You can also rent cars, but arbitrary barriers stop you from driving them all over the place. So if walking is not your thing, steer clear. However, if hearing the screams of bandits, as they dissolve into a sloppy pile of green goop after you shot them with a round filled with acid then you are in for a delicious treat. Borderlands drops a lot of weapons. You can compare and contrast to find what suits your class best and go to town on people's face with it. Zap 'em. Burn 'em. Melt'em or Blast them into tiny bits. All off course accentuated by delicious screams of pain and horror. What do you mean ""thats grim?"" That isn't grim at all. That's life on Pandora man. You better get used to it, cause you'll be doing it a lot. A funny thing about how the game presents itself is its classification system. A normal wolf-like enemy would be a normal wolf. A big one would be an Alpha Wolf, and a giant, burning and barking monstrosity would be a Badass Wolf. This trend developes, and it makes it easy to gauge what you can deal with, and what will certainly kill you. Dying then triggers a short moment where you can save youself by killing anything on the screen to prevent a hefty ressurection fine. Of course, you can mitigate all of that with the help of some friends. You can play the game with up to three friends at the same time. Everyone helps both eachother and themselves when completing quests. However, don't think it is weird to have all out brawls over who gets the good loot. It is a veritable melee of conficting interests that will inevtitably result in the death of many enemies who simply stood in you and your friends way of riches and glory. Unfortunately, the game is connected with an archaic netcode, to actually getting together might be a pain. However, there are workarounds, but it would have been nicer if it would have worked straight out of the box....Pandora's Box! I am ashamed for making this cheap pun.			"

												This game is fun. This game is fun with three friends.As Left 4 Dead made Co-Op in this from popular, this piece of software nearly perfected it. The only big issue is the lack of a good story. Like in all Action RPGs (one part of this game) the missions are either about killing someone or about finding something. But how the game presented this is amazing! But you have to love such type of optic.So for all who have at least three good friends on Steam, who like the ""Just-One-More-Mission""-gameplay should really buy this game. And also all DLCs (beside the Moxxi-DLC, as this DLC offers no real story, just shooting in an arena).			"

												Story: The story takes a back seat in this game to guns and more guns. But really gameplay and coop was the main focus, with the story there to provide entertaining situations. To be honest I don't have a great recollection of what the plot was... it never really stuck with me but it didn't bother me or seem out of place. That being said they could really get away with whatever they want because the game doesn't take itself seriously at all. I'd say some of the missions have memorable bosses like slege and krom, who I enjoyed facing off with. Other than that, you're a vault hunter hunting a vault. On your way you kill lots of things. Plot summed up.Gameplay: I like it! But don't love it. The gun-play is pretty satisfying with headshots looking sick. Your player moves nice and fast but seems sluggish when jumping or changing directions, not terribly though. The gun options and types are pretty vast and I liked most of the damage categories. I just wound up using the same op weapon for 10 levels until I found another. Not until the end game did I actually have multiple viable guns. The main way you interact with game world is talking to npcs and receiving missions. Now the missions are very mixed bag... lots of them are fetchy to death. Sometimes I'd look at my missions log and see fetch quest after fetch quest. They really feel insignificant to, with no plot or interesting reward. It just looks like these items were scatter-shot across the map, just so you would explore the whole map. On the other side of things, some missions have more plot significance and have you walking up to the front door of a bosses stronghold and blasting your way through. This straight forward action was good fun and could be challenging.DLC: I can't recommend any of the DLC's outside of the armory. The others look and feel under-developed, with boring mission after boring plot points in uninteresting areas. And the map design seems horrible here! I found myself running doing nothing for hours in these maps.The armory on the other-hand has vehicles! Thank goodness! Also you get a ♥♥♥♥-ton of great weapons. I feel like this DLC focused on the good aspects of the original game, while the others amplified the annoying aspects.Overall: I'm pretty neutral on this game. I'll recommend it for coop play and for those you can easily skip stupid missions and achievements without it bothering you. Expect fun gun-play and some goofy, outlandish settings and characters that you'll hopefully not get sick of too fast.			"

												Well, it's not as good as BL2. So I highly recommend to play this game before its sequel. It has almost everything that it's sequel has, just not as good. If you play those two games in chronological order, you won't notice how BL falls behind BL2 almost in every aspect, except for the loot system, perhaps. I finished BL and all of it's DLCs and then I finished the BL2 main story and then I switched back to BL again to play it with my friend, but it just didn't feel that great anymore. The character development and the story felt slow and only after we reached the middle of the game did things start to happen and it was the fun fast-paced action-filled post-apocalyptic experience everyone is looking for!Don't get me wrong! It's a great game. One of the best FPS CoOps out there. It's just that you need to get pass level 10 to see its true glory.PROS:- beautiful, immersing and vast deserted world (similar to that of Rage or Fallout)- tons of various weapons (even more than in BL2 and without the limitations of what the combinations might be)- cool upgradable characters (although, IMO, the Soldier's skill tree makes him by far the best, and that's a shame, if you want to replay the game with another character)- cool unplayable characters- interesting story; funny jokes- lot's of easter eggs and secrets to explore- DLCs worth of purchasing (I would even say that they're better than the main game)NEUTRAL: less enemies to shoot, which means less action, but also more time for calm explorationCONS:- Moxxi's Underdome DLC is too hard, IMO- It's not possible to complete one of the side mission's in the Secret Armory of General Knoxx, because you can't access the location, in which it's located, although you could before- 3rd party account/software is required for CoOp- Level caps and it's not possible to unlock all the skills- Picking up loot and ammo just by running over it was introduced in BL2; here you have to do it manuallyOverall rating: 8.5/10			"

												My Borderlands 1 ReviewSUMMARYBorderlands 1 is an awesome mix of FPS and RPG; Taking a procedural weapon system like Diablo then adding in a tactical FPS system like Stalker. After having played Borderlands 2 then going back to Borderlands 1 out of nostalgia, I can say this game feels much less polished. While still a pinnacle gem of its time, Borderlands 1 now feels more like a beta engine containing the prologue to Borderlands 2. This prologue still has much to offer, but read on for details on my opinions of some of the game's features.TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIESFirst issue I had coming back to Borderlands 1 is the FOV [Field of View] on my 1080p monitor. The FOV defaults to 70, which long ago I didn't notice was so bad on my 1440x900 16:10 monitor I used way back when. On my new HD 16:9 1080p monitor it looks like I have training goggles on that are creating tunnel vision. I had to search the web to find workarounds for this issue, but could only come up with a quick key binding as a solution. Unfortunately, my FOV continues to reset to 70 every time I mount a vehicle or gun placement. Borderlands 2 doesn't have this issue and allows FOV adjustments in the main menu settings.PROCEDURAL WEAPONSWhile innovative at the time with plenty of stat variation, weapon brand names were not as distinctive in Borderlands 1 as they are in Borderlands 2. Most of the weapon models felt reused constantly no matter what the brand was. The weapon mechanics and procedural system mostly made brand name a stat adjustment. So going back to Borderlands 1 with some brand loyalty didn't lead to any feeling of distinction or difference in tactics. The lack of brand distinction made Borderlands 1 weapons rather shallow with no lore behind them.Finding new weapons in Borderlands 1 was a rather odd ball inconsistent process of trial and farming. I didn't realize this at the time, but it appears that even a level 21 bandit can drop a level 4 standard weapon. At least in Borderlands 2, the loot drops were very close to the enemy's level rather than so far away. The feeling of reward vs. difficulty in Borderlands 1 is not as good as Borderlands 2. There is a slight bug that causes weapons to appear lower in level when equipped. Looking into it further it seems to be related to the proficiency of the weapon type. From what I hear, this is residual left over code from a feature that was canceled at launch that allowed players to equip higher level weapons as if they are lower level. The change has nothing to do with the weapon's function, which concerned me at first when I started noticing it.STORY AND QUESTSIn a lot of ways, the content of the story and the way quests are handled felt very much like Stalker-lite, but without the immersive element.  Voice acting was limited and the way quests were logged was a bit too simplistic. The compass tracking system was almost useless to me along with feeling clunky. Navigating the map in the menu was also clunky due to how it handled the current active quest. In Borderlands 2 this was considerably fixed up and even optimized. The plot was all over-the-top brutal humor with a ton of awkward fun. But was only skin deep, consisting of some villain monologue [which was always hilarious], but mostly instructional dialog by various characters you meet. The characters you meet didn't offer much beyond their initial introduction. There's really no emotional attachments to be had with any of the NPCs. The lack of NPC interaction beyond getting some transmission chatter kind of made Borderlands 1 feel lifeless, which was an issue that was addressed with Borderlands 2. COMBAT AND AIMy first impression before Borderlands 2 was actually quite good [and still is], but I've played a lot of games before coming back to Borderlands 1. I notice things now... things I didn't see before that are important to me. I've always been annoyed by horribly inaccurate weapons that give me that ""Naked Gun 2 1/2 - Gun Fight"" feeling.  I am especially annoyed when an enemy that is dead center on my scope takes a missed shot to the point of emptying my ""sniper"" rifle.  It doesn't help when you stagger from every single hit you take even if it's a distant glazing blow impacting upon a fully charged shield. Much like Stalker, weapons in Borderlands 1 can be weird and misleading when it comes to accuracy through aiming. This issue was fixed in Borderlands 2 since you can see the crosshair shrink for a moment as you focus in allowing for a more precise experience with an aimed weapon.Enemies in Borderlands 1 can also feel a bit awkward, but they still have that signature hilarious dialog that leaves you giggling hysterically while trying to shoot straight with an already inaccurate weapon.  AI navigation is a bit more problematic as midgets have a much harder time moving up ramps or even around corners to charge at you. If the navigation was any worse, you would think that you were playing with Doom 1 AI programming. Even AI vs. AI interaction was sketchy at best as the AI would prioritize the player at random intervals without ever checking line-of-sight. Some modest improvements were done to the AI in Borderlands 2.The enemy spawn rate is very aggressive in Borderlands 1, giving players no real opportunity to truly clear an area before another wave of enemies hit the field. This was a double edged sword as leveling and finding loot was easier to do in Borderlands 1 because of the aggressive spawn rate. On the other hand, if you were struggling in a large area while trying to escape back to the fast travel station, you would be in for a constant wave of ambushing on the return trip. Borderlands 2 toned that spawn rate down quite a bit.There is one big problem that has not been address in Borderlands 2. There are a ton of bad navigation issues that involve getting stuck on terrain and being blocked by invisible walls on ramps. On several occasions, I'll get stuck on a hill of loose debris or the corner of a small ramp while attempting to kite an enemy.  I really wish Gearbox took the time to smooth out their levels before launch.CUSTOMIZATIONYou get to pick a different color for your character and vehicle. That's it. You don't even get to view your real model when you do the customization - just a 2d portrait is used.  Thus another thing that was totally fixed in Borderlands 2.OVERALLStill addictive and still playing despite its flaws, but will likely be logging more hours into Borderlands 2 here soon.			"

												My first impression, a shooter with RPG - nah, this will not work, after launching the game, and this cartoony graphic, meh, how people can like something like this.... after many, many months of playing... WOW ..what a game :) The game feels perfect, the difficulty is going up with you, the looting is fun and surprisingly is working with the guns and additional gear like shields. I'm playing as Hunter, although I tried Lilith for a bit, but I just don't feel complete without my upgraded ""bloodwing"". There is also quite a lot of dark humour in here, the car fights are nice as well. My only small nudge would be the world itself. I know it's unique but in some way the one big garbage dump is a bit depressing...			"

Really, this game series is one of the finest I've ever laid hands on. The hours, days, weeks, months, years of entertainment these games have brought me have bore me no regret.The story in this game sets up the second story, which leads into the pre-sequel's story. This game's also great to run back to although nowhere near as much as Borderlands 2.			"

												In Borderlands, Gearbox and 2K Games has crafted a gem of a game, combining elements from first-person shooters and role-playing game genres to forge a memorable experience.Set on the remote, back water planet of Pandora where lawlessness and danger abound, the game invites you into an adventure wrought with intense gunfights and satisfying treasure hunting. With more variation in weaponry than you could ever hope to shake a stick at (or anything else for that matter...), Borderlands does a good job of keeping things interesting while you progress.While proving to be lots of fun in single-player, the fantastic multiplayer capability contributes a whole new level of enjoyment.Throw Diablo 2, Fallout 3, Mad Max, and a slice of science fiction and cell shading animation into a blender, and the successful result is Borderlands. In the words of Linkin Park, ""The journey is more important than the end or the start."" So go and embark on the exciting journey that this game offers!			"

												I've never been one for nostalgia. Plain and simple really. In fact, there are literally only a handful of games I'd willingly replay in their original entirety.

I played this game for at least 200+ hours on Xbox 360 like 2 years ago and decided to buy it on Steam and have currently put in another 100+ hours and I'm still playing it. Borderlands is a truly amazing game, however, this is based on my opinion and style of gameplay. This game is not meant to be realistic in any way!!! It is a humurous RPG, FPS game not meant to be taken too seriously. With thousands of different guns and and a ton of things to shoot, this is still one of my favorite games to this day.

												This is definitely a classic and I still enjoy playing it. I have been a fan of the game since day one. Borderlands is about – finding weapons and shooting things with them! It’s all about the guns: combat rifles, machine guns, sub-machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, revolvers, pistols, rocket launchers, and many that can’t be categorized! Seriously, there are a lot of guns! The gory Mad-Max feel of the desolate planet and the people you meet on your way is the bulk of the story! It goes like A) Go somewhere B) Kill some ♥♥♥♥ C) Flip a switch or something D) Kill some more ♥♥♥♥ E) Success! The game is fun! Its like Diablo loot with guns! The NPC characters are hilarious - yammering some schizophrenic one liners every now and then. Choosing what weapons to keep and what to toss is the most difficult decision in the game. Discovering a quality weapon stash is a very satisfying feeling! The four-player coop is the games shining moment! Going on a rampage in the hostile wasteland with 3 friends can be a lot of fun. It just feels good to level up, get new skills, new more powerful weapons! Bottom line is that everyone should have played this game by now!			"

												In Borderlands, Gearbox and 2K Games has crafted a gem of a game, combining elements from first-person shooters and role-playing game genres to forge a memorable experience.Set on the remote, back water planet of Pandora where lawlessness and danger abound, the game invites you into an adventure wrought with intense gunfights and satisfying treasure hunting. With more variation in weaponry than you could ever hope to shake a stick at (or anything else for that matter...), Borderlands does a good job of keeping things interesting while you progress.While proving to be lots of fun in single-player, the fantastic multiplayer capability contributes a whole new level of enjoyment.Throw Diablo 2, Fallout 3, Mad Max, and a slice of science fiction and cell shading animation into a blender, and the successful result is Borderlands. In the words of Linkin Park, ""The journey is more important than the end or the start."" So go and embark on the exciting journey that this game offers!			"

												This game brought in a lot of old ideas, added some new ones, and threw in coop. If there is one thing that I love, its coop. The story line is original but does not play a big part in the actual game. The biggest aspect of this game is the coop and the mass amount of guns. Oh there are so many guns. Add the DLC on top of that with even more guns included, and by the end you have closer friends and an arsena.			"

												OG Borderlands is still a huge hit for me and many others. Originally this game was a test run on Gearbox's end on its Gun Generator, and it does it very effectively. There are SO MANY weapons to use in the battlefield, some better than others, but all able to do the job nicely. What I like about this game than Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel is that your weapons do not become obsolete as fast, and an example would be in Borderlands 2 when I was level 55, the level 50 legendaries that I was using were weaker than the COMMON rarity level 55 guns that were dropping, whereas in Borderlands 1, I used a level 15 legendary to kill the level 30 final boss. The weapons all have slightly different stats (recoil, reload speed, damage) but otherwise look and function the same, something Borderlands 2 and TPS fixed. The story in the game is admittedly low compared to its sequels, but is still a high driving function in the game, with tons of sidequests avaliable before, during, and after the main quest is completed, giving this game a high replayability without the DLC alone.Speaking of DLC, this games DLC is INCREDIBLE. All 4 DLC maps are incredibly fun, lengthy, and add SO MUCH replayability to this game and the extra price for the 4 DLC is great to the point buying the game without it is a waste. While Mad Moxxi's Underdome is different than the other 3, all of them are great.tl;dr This game has a lot of guns, decently driven story with high replayability, and great DLC.I'd recommend getting this game even if you didn't play for it during a sale, it truly is worth the experience.

												At first I thought this game was pretty bad, I started it with a few friends but in honesty we were useless at it, we didn’t get very far and were playing it in completely the wrong order. I wrote the game off as bad and I was convinced I would never finish it.  I restarted with someone else and I was actually very surprised what an impact the people you play with can make. This time it was played properly (no offence, guys) and the game grew on me very quickly.Admittedly it’s slow when it comes to storyline, it took a little while for me to feel like there was actually a purpose to the game and I wasn’t just doing the same stuff over and over. When I look at it that way, you pretty much are doing the same thing over and over, but as the storyline unfolds I didn’t even really notice that anymore. There is a lot in this game to keep you distracted, one key part of that being the weapon system. It’s the first game I had played where “loot” was a big thing and it being a first person shooter only made that even better. There’s a massive range of weapons with different stats and abilities for you to find, in all kinds of shapes, sizes and rarities.That being said, I would never play this game solo. The co-op in this game is what makes it for me. That is very likely to be different for a lot of other people, so most people should just ignore that part, for me it just wasn’t something I would do on my own. I know for a fact I would get bored long before the end if I was on my own. So if you are like me, make sure you bring someone along you enjoy spending your time with.It’s a fairly lengthy game, and there’s a number of classes you can complete it with. The characters all have certain charms about them, they are all completely different from each other and with the whole RPG like elements in this game it’s a good reason to come back and play again. Which is always good, replay-ability in a game is never a problem.As well as this being the first first-person shooter RPG-like looting game I had ever played, this was also the first game I had ever played that used cell-shading in the graphics, and I have to say that I loved it. I think it’s a great style. I would say that I hoped more games used it, but I’m pretty sure that after this franchise released it rubbed off on a number of other game makers as well.All in all, I ended up really enjoying this game.(Not as much as I did Borderlands 2, but that’s another review all together)I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a great game to play with friends.

												This is a cult game and one of the biggest hits of the previous generation. For its time, innovative with a cell-shaded world, in addition to a wonderful blend between FPS and RPG.Essentially, the player controls a character with a skill tree. Each level gained grants a skill point, which can be assigned to a given skill. Additionally, each character has a special ability (e.g. Brick is a Berserker). Combine this with guns, and abundant humour, and it is a must-play game.Strongly recommend getting the Game of the Year edition for the full Borderlands experience.Play this, you will not regret your choice.Played on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any problems.

												Being a fan of the borderlands franchise, I can only recommend this game. The artstyle is very unique as well as the sense of humor (especially Claptrap). It has a very interesting plot, which will be continued in the second part of the franchise and a nice presequel.After finishing the main story and all DLCs, I can only recommend this great game with its DLCs (Moxxi's arenas were not that great, but the other three had some nice story and quests). It's a great game to play together or grind on your own.8.5/10			"

												The original loot n' shooter from Gearbox Software, Borderlands is a game guilty only of spawning vastly superior sequels. While far from a bad game, Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel simply eclipse the original in every single aspect. The environments are mostly just the same desert terrain throughout the entire adventure; the scenarios are nowhere near as memorable; the characters, although still entertaining, are represented much better in the later games, and the gameplay feels more monotonous and slow. I don't really hold this against Borderlands, as it clearly feels like Gearbox was trying to find its niche with this first entry. Again, this game is not incompetently made. It still can be some good fun, especially with some friends. It just happens to be the first game in its series, with the sequels improving every single aspect of the groundwork. I would recommend playing this game, particularly if you've never played a Borderlands game before. But only to be able to understand and appreciate what the original did and all of the improvements that were later brought to the table.			"

												So… Borderlands… Or how the vault cult began…Short review: If you love loot, then your loot senses should be tingling!I started playing, because I fell in love with BL2 and at some point I felt like I want more of it, but already had it all (if that even makes sense!).I already knew what to expect from the game, but I was curious how it all began, I wanted to know how BL2 was better than its predecessor, so I got into it. The typical storyline, character story, dialogues and missions I knew from BL2 were already present in Borderlands and as expected I loved them all.While playing the whole game and its DLCs, I felt like Borderlands is way slower to play than the second game.I think that if you’re used to playing co-op and you play Borderlands on your own, this will most likely result in boredom. I mean… How can you laugh at a duel when if you’re not playing co-op?

Contras:Depending on your graphic card, you may not have Steam Overlay.I’d say that Borderlands could become quite boring if you play by yourself. Didn’t happen for me, but I generally prefer coop games, so I seldom play any game solo. I’d recommend playing Borderlands with friends though – sharing the experience is always more fun.Pros:I had a lot of laughs and Borderlands is generally funny, but humour is highly individual, so this varies with the player. As already said – I love the dialogues and the playable character’s lines (Brick’s simple desire for ‘MORE!!!!’ made me laugh more than once).Ragdolls can be sooo funny! (and yes! That’s definitely a pro point :D)

DLCs:The available DLCs are a good addition to the main game in general and of course if you’re an achievement hunter, then the DLCs are a must have.If you don’t care about the achievements, then you shouldn’t buy and play Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot. This DLC is basically waves of enemies and killing them not only doesn’t give you any XP, but also doesn’t count for any of the challenges.The other DLCs (The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned; The Secret Armory of General Knoxx and Claptrap's Robot Revolution) are quite fun until the point you decide to go for achievements. Trust me when I say getting all Claptrap's Robot Revolution will take some serious farming.What I felt like really unnecessary was the looooong driving in The Secret Armory of General Knoxx. I know the DLC introduced new vehicles, which is great, but the decision about the amount of driving should have been left with the player. What I try to say is – more fast travel stations would have been better.Conclusion:If you look for logic, then look somewhere else. Why? Because BORDERLANDS!!!!!			"

												I had never even heard of Borderlands before receiving this for my birthday one year but quickly fell in love with it. With it's memorable characters, great storyline and HUGE ammounts of weapons, it's a must have. The price is also pretty cheap now.Doesn't matter in the slightest that Borderlands: 2 is out, it's still a wonderful game.10/10 would feed brains to Zombie Baha again			"

												Borderlands is an RPG FPS hybrid that is primarily based on gaining loot, which is most commonly in the form of more guns. The single player is decent enough to get through on your own, but its much more enjoyable with a full co-op cast. The story isn't bad either, and there are tons of collectables that attribute to both the story and gameplay. This game would be a good choice for anyone looking for a primarily co-op centered RPG/FPS.			"

												Borderlands. Great intro vid rare in games today the vid intro is what I would say one of the best parts for my experience with the 2009 hit from Cage The Elephant ""Ain't No Rest For The Wicked"" first time I watch it a year ago I am like ""Oh yeah I used to hate this song but now I am digging it and it's fits so perfectly with the game's settings and all"" etc. Anyways the intro vid is what grappled my attention so well but asides a video the game itself is just......MARVELOUS. This is not like Bioshock for those who have played that form 2KGames. This is Borderlands it's own game. Very originnal and you can get endlesss hours of fun and gameplay either by yourself or with others. THis game is one of those few games that asides great comic effects and visuals the MP is actually worth every cent the game is. The MP is where it's at the SP is good too but the MP is what makes this game epic. This game is like a much more graphic version of Serious Sam and less serious than Mad Max series. I would reccomend this game to anyone literally especially those looking for challenge, in depth gameplay, lots to do and MP based gaming. The Game should run decently on almost any pc for my HP G56 laptop it works like a charm on lowest settings but the game is best on a real gaming pc etc. Game itself is a 9.5/10 in my book only lacking a few settings and optimization options. But this is amongst my favorites and is not overhyped like many other games. THis game is a lot like the films: Mad Max, Titan A.E., Heavy Metal 2000, Heavy Metal (1980), I am Legend, Escape From NY, Treasure Planet and other post-apocalyptic films. This game is centered on one of four characters/classes, a Siren, Soldier, Hunter, and Brick. Each one has it's perks and downfalls, but the game is mostly the same experience just certain things easier and others not. Anyways amongst the four whichever you choose gets a random vision/message from a mysteirous girl/woman, to instructions to getting to the mythical but real vault treasure of the planet Pandora which is filled with wonders, and Loot. The point of the game is to be alive, kill bandits, and to get as much loot as possible and of course get the mythic treasure for yourself. The game is a lot like Fallout 3/New Vegas, Serious Sam kind of themed but it's truly a full on original fun experience with a lot of comical relief compared to the any of the examples mentioned beforehand I mean this game is filled with humour and it's good in general. One of the few FPS's I have respect for since it's not a COD or anything of the sort all in all the game is a hit, Fresh, and just a truly amazing game in general the sequel is even better on almost every aspect must have game for everyone!

												I own all 3 of the Borderlands games so that should tell you right there I just love them. This is the first game I have ever enjoyed playing a female character. Normally being a female I play all male characters as I like their skill sets better, but borderlands made their females badass! The Siren in Borderlands is an awesome character to play. She has great skills and I chose to have her use smg's and pistols making her a powerful gal to mess with. I love all the quests in the game and the weapon variety is awesome. If a game lacks weapon variety I have a hard time sticking with it if it is a long play through. Again this is a game you will play through more than once. You have to try all the characters and their skill sets not to mention you miss things the first time through. I played this game the first time through in co-op and as with any game co-op is much more fun. However I did go back and play through on my own because I had so much fun the first time. And lets face it if you play through with friends you just have to prove to yourself you can do it on your own! I would highly recommend this game to anyone as well as all DLC and all the other two Borderlands games that came after it as well!			"

												I really loved playing this game co-op with my boyfriend, we spent a lot of time playing this game together. I don't think I would have played this in single player, I think my review would have been worse if I had played it alone.There are a lot of things that I disliked more than I liked about this game. FIrst off, I did not like the story, a lot of people say that the missions don't seem to tell you WHY you need to do them, and it's true, for the mayority. I think it's just mainly for leveling up and adding extra content to the game which had really nothing to do with the story. Honestly I got lost with all the side missions, I kept forgetting what was happening. Lots of the side missions were also very repetitive, a lot of times I found myself wanting to stop playing. Honestly I would have liked that there were more story related missions to the point that you absolutely have to reach level 60 to finish the game in its entirety. And that's probably too much to ask. I don't like that I would find that one awesome gun and use it for almost 10 levels, to the point that other types of weapons became more useful than that one I absolutely loved. It would take another 5 levels to find one of the same type that might be just as awesome, but that may be my personal opinion I guess.I HIGHLY disliked that the bosses were REALLY easy.. most of them didn't even touch my shield, and I know, it was co-op, but even so I think it was way too easy to the point that random enemies that spawn as you explore the map seemed to be harder than a boss fight? I don't think that's right. I also noticed that the game become very easy after maybe level 20, maybe even before that.. a bit disappointing to be honest.Honestly, I liked the fact that I could play this with someone else, otherwise I wouldn't have even touched it, even if I had bought it. I like the game mostly for its FPS more than anything, and the RPG style of the game when it comes to the skills. It's really fun to play co-op I can't deny that, I had fun playing it. I also liked the graphics. I don't know if I would recommend it to someone, maybe if they played with other people but for single player, I can't see myself recommending it to anyone. I'll give it a thumps up for the co-op.I can't wait to play BL2, since so many people say it's so much better.			"

												I played through Borderlands 2 before I played Borderlands 1 GOTY edition. If you've already played BL2 but not BL1, then all you need to know is that the gameplay mechanics are the same. The story in BL2 picks up from BL1 and the environments are similar since you are on Pandora. BL2 feels more refined than BL1 but if you really enjoyed BL2 and haven't played BL1, then I'd recommend picking up the first game for at least one playthrough. If you've not played any of the Borderlands games and want to get into them, then I'd suggest starting with the first game. I currently have 52 hours on BL1 and that's going through the game and most of the DLC.			"

												From the small bit of this game that I have played, it is marvellous. The art style works a lot better than I thought it would. The combat and controls are very fluid.

I'd describe this game as a good mix of Fallout and Bioshock.Pros:Good gameplayPretty worldSatisfying combatCons:Textures take a second or two to load when going from area to area.I would rate this game 9/10 from what I have played of it.

												Borderlands...the marriage of FPS and RPG. But does it work? Let's find out!The Good:------------1.  Excellent art style - Borderlands looks great and plays silky smooth. Using cel-shaded graphics, Borderlands has a unique and alien vibe about it, displaying the world of Pandora in lush and vivid detail. Although many may feel that this look is somewhat cartoony and basic, I love the art style for the game and felt totally engrossed by it.2.  High Replayability - The player can choose from 4 different pre-made characters, with each one having a unique skill tree to develop. The soldier, for example, gets a machine gun turret, that can be upgraded and made more powerful. Add in the fact that the game has a massively randomized loot engine (more on that soon) and the ability to keep levelling your character once the game has ended makes Borderlands almost seem like an offline MMO at times.3.  Fun and addictive gameplay - Borderlands is simply fun to play, albeit mindless fun. Getting in a vehicle and driving around Pandora, plowing over bandits as your drive, is immensely satisfying. I often found myself wanting to see what was in the next ""zone"", and trying to face it's challenges.The Bad :-----------1. Very weak story - If you value a deep and immersive story, look elsewhere. The gist of the game is that you are dropped off on the planet of Pandora and using the telepathic image of a woman, you seek out the fabled ""Vault"", a legendary place of untold riches. There is a main quest, but the game basically is a bunch of ""fetch this, kill that"" mini-quests to grow more powerful to fight the final battle. There are bosses, but they are devoid of character and seem to serve no purpose other that saying ""hey! We got bosses in our game!"" The game feels very weak in the story department.2. Online is a mess - If you value your games having a strong multi-player feature, Borderlands falls flat. Servers are rarely up, and when they are you will find chat options a pain. There isn't a very good view of messages recieved by other players, and the game offers no microphone support.3.  Not optimized for PC  - This isn't a major point for me, but I know a LOT of people get salty when there aren't a lot of graphical options and PC-centric options. Borderlands feels a lot like a console game at times which is okay, but I really would have liked the menus and UI to be more PC friendly.Overall Rating:-----------------   Borderlands is definitely worth at least one play through, especially if you are a fan of shooters and RPGS. While Borderlands doesn't do either one perfectly, it does enough to give the player a pretty enjoyable experience.  6/10  - GOOD			"

												The start of one of the greatest franchises to ever exist. Borderlands throws you into a fps/rpg combo with four playable characers with thier own abilities and strengths and throws you onto Pandora filled with millions of guns ad thousands of enemies. An immense ammount of content can be found around the game and fill endless hours of enjoyment. 11/10			"

												Pack your bags guys, it's time to go to... PANDORA! No, not that expensive alien pocahontas rip-off, I'm talking about the RPG-like FPS that is Borderlands!The game is about 4 vault hunters. Mordecai the Sniper, Brick the Tank, Roland the Soldier and then there's Lilith the Elemental Cougar (and the only female). With their powers combined, they scour Pandora in search of the fabled Vault, hidden deep within Pandora.Now that sounded awesome, right? NOPE! That is just the sugar-coated, honey-glazed, dipped-in-caramel with a double serving of sweets way of describing the story of Borderlands, the story is actually crap.For a game meant to be played by 4 players, single-player is boring. It can get pretty lonely in Pandora with only one guy (or girl) out and about. The main point of this game is co-op. Now THAT's where the party starts. The game's multiplayer mechanics are simple but effective.More players = Tougher enemiesTougher enemies = Better Loot!!Overall, I give a 9/10			"

												Borderlands was a very fun game that I have now completed three times. I really like looters, and this game did a great job with tons of interesting guns to use. The story is interesting but is missing something to make you care more. The side quests are mostly just tons of fetch quests that get boring quick. Occasionally there will be one fun side quest that is quite memorable, but most are just rehashed version of go there, kill this, come back.     My biggest complaint is with enemy variety. After the first 15 minutes of playing, you will see the things you will be fighting for the rest of the game. The bandits and rakks just level scale and become more challenging. If you can get past this problem and the dull ""fetch"" quests, this game is really fun. For an FPS, this game moves fluent and leveling is great. Multi-player is where this game shines. Those dull fetch quests and same mobs don't bother you near as much when you are playing with a friend. The boss fights are also fun, but nothing too special. You will also find the characters you meet are not very memorable. Finally money is near useless. You will get money everywhere but never really need it.     My first run through, I had no complaints. The game is often fun, but never really so compelling that you can't turn away. You will even get a few laughs out of it. I myself really liked The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned. Generally by the end of Borderlands, I had fun, but I had no urge to keep going. Here is my take away in a pro con chart.ProsLots of guns with lots of effectsTons of looting, making it worth checking around for hidden chestsMulti-player is really funStory line is fairly interestingFluid game playLots of little goals to accomplish (such as 1,000 SMG kills, ect.)Good for some laughsConsVery boring side questsAlmost no mob variety Very little voiced lines, meaning you will be reading a ♥♥♥♥ ton.Money is almost completly useless All in all, this game is worth your time to play it. So if you are wondering where in the series to start, I would recommend here if you got a friend or two to run it through with. I'd give the game an 8/10.			"

Thats somewhat it. No deep storyline but don't worry, the RPG aspects help you love your character were the story doesnt.Graphics: Less said the better. Well lets say this. ♥♥♥♥ Cel Shader graphics, 1/10 for graphicsGameplay: Classic, mean, fun and overkill. Four words i love to say about games. Finding that epic gun that beats your other guns by miles is just a nice warm feeling.Pro's:- Great large levels- Epic guns- Plenty of ♥♥♥♥ to shootCon's:- Diabolical graphics- Maybe the maps are a tad too big at times8.5/10 - Get it			"

												Borderlands The best fps/rpg game out there with such in-depth story, humor that i`ve ever seen. The story from beggining makes you get into it with such amazing graphical and humoristic way that noother game has. The song`s are implemented soo well into the game story and funny dialouges. It`s one of a kind game that after completing it few times you won`t get bored playing it again,and again.  The skill tree making it that you can have few builds makes the experimenting and studying the fight more interesting. Fight`s it self are totally different story,from kicking your enemyes too blowin them up,running over with vehicles one word-AMAZING. Loot system and such big variety of weapons makes happy even the most demanding hoarders and collectionist. Also good and maybe the best thing is the multiplayer guys, playing with ur friends and blowing up enemy`s accross the pandora wasteland. Overall: for a game from 2009 the graphic is just mind-blowing,the music is oustanding,humor and fighting never seen in other fps games like in this one. That`s why I strongly recommend you MUST play this game if you like anykind of rpg/fps games.			"

												 It's a solid game. The story isn't anything special: you're looking for the Vault, like some other people. On your way you kill a lot of enemies, like bandits. That's basically it. The mechanics are satisfying and easy. The shooting is good. The loot is pretty nice and has actually a lot of variaty. The skill system isn't that interesting. It just gives you more health, you do more damage. Some upgrades are pretty neat, for example the special move upgrades, but these are unlocked after a long time. The enemies do miss some variaty. There are some pretty great ones and pretty creative too, but it feels like they use the same enemies to much. The multiple caracters you can choose and the different ways they play and the ways you can play the game, makes for a pretty replayable game. The game still looks good. Didn't have any performance issues either.The DLC really tries to pander out the gameplay: it takes way too long to get to some parts and it's repetetive. It just tries to make the game longer, but the gameplay and the enjoyment suffer under it.			"

												Funnny...l missed this when it first came out. Don't know how but l guess l was busy with family and other games that took my interest. Many years on and l freakin love this game and the 'hook' it has. l am an old school Diablo player and the grinding to level up is awesome and it has humour. If it was not funny l would not play this. Games are meant to not take themselves to seriously. Anyway l have all the Borderslands, 2 and the prequel but l want to beat this one first. Tales of the Borderlands by Telltale is also an awesome game and 'Scooter' is in it. Love the lore and the style. Graphics on my nividia970 are maxed out and runs so smooth with an xbox controller even though it has no support for it. Great game. l recommend play this one first if you are new to the series. Even though this is a great game it might not suit to everyones FPS style. If you like the Diablo mechanic you will love this but if you love the COD corridor movie production you might not enjoy this. I enjoy both but Borderland has the hook and charcters that l will remember years from now.			"

												You emerge in the stylised landscape of Pandora, a barren wasteland filled with excitement and hostile alien creatures. Whilst all this would amount to a pretty good game already, Borderlands ups the ante with it's Diablo-like gameplay. All pickups and drops are randomised, including the guns you get. Because of the almost limitless amount of weapons, class builds and strategies that follow. Borderlands still remains replayable just throughout singleplayer.Multiplayer however is pretty lackluster, especially if your playing with random players. It comes highly recommended to play multiplayer with a few friends rather then just game surfing.			"

												[TLDR: If you enjoy FPS games and dungeon crawlers you should definetally give this a try. Also would recommend you to get the DLCs as well as a few friends on board.]The start of the series!So, what can you expect here?Borderlands is - as it calls itself - a ""loot shooter"". Which actually pretty much describes the game in its entirety - you kill stuff, you loot stuff, you sell stuff, you level up (stuff?)... Best as a more ""defined"" description you could call it a combination of ""Serious Sam"" and ""Diablo"" - shooting, over the top design meets skilltrees and loot of varying rarity.Rarely the grind is hard or frustrating and often - especially if you play with your friends - it is fun, even.And while Borderlands is quite old by now, its - what is best described as ""comic-esque"" - look certainly aged a bit it still looks great, due to the fact that it doesn't really go for ""realistic"".One of the weaker points of - especially the first Borderlands - is the character balance, but since you usually fight together not against eachother this isn't really a problem, though playing as Brick - who is by far on the bottom of the power ranking - can be frustrating if you see the Mordecai instagibbing erdiens left and right.For single player, this game is good.In multiplayer it is awesome.While you often have it that coop games - like this one - are more fun in groups, in BL1 and the whole series it rang so exceptionally true and only a few other games manage to be this enjoyable if you play it with friends.Overall if you like FPS-games like Serious Sam and dungeon crawler like Diablo this is the game for you. Consider waiting until it is on sale, but even if it isn't you will get your value back.			"

												Amazing ""vanilla"" game, not much to add that has not already been said.  The DLC, however, is a different story.  The ONLY one worth getting is the Secret Armory of General Knoxx, which actually adds a lot of content.  The same cannot be said of the others, which are short, repetitive, and add very little.  An example: you fight General Knoxx in the Claptrap Revolution DLC.  You battle a boss whom you already faced previously TWO MORE TIMES in the Claptrap DLC...			"

												This is probably one of the most fun games you will ever playEDIT: Almost 4 years later.......http://imgur.com/tYFNQrKThe first Borderlands I think is still the best out of the Borderlands series/ Why?I first played this with my brother when I was only 12 years old, and him and I shared his account just so we can play this together. -One online and one offline, thus allowing a LAN server. This was possible in 2010 because Borderlands ran on Gamespy servers, and not steam servers. Got into the original Borderlands again because the Pre-Sequal is just a cash grabber. The second installment of Borderlands is fun, but it's just missing some side missions, I.e. In Borderlajds 2 there isn't a side mission where you have to help a charater, such as Cl4p-, give the character something they need. When you give that item or objective to that character you get loot.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I would reconmend this game for anyone who loves RPGs or First Person Shooters. *If you like Destiny then please play Borderlands, becauuse Borderlands is the ""superior"" game compared to Destiny. Eventhough the pre-Sequal was the worst borderlands game, it's still more fun than Destiny. Destiny requires you to have people play with you, and those people have to be on your friends list.			"

												Upon first seeing this game, I wrote it off.

You will likely never get the same gun as your friends, as there are thousands of stat and effect combinations.The story is kind of dry and flat. The enemies get redundant. The characters are pretty funny, making the quests and story tollerable.If you're looking for a shooter with good gameplay, this series is for you. If you're looking for a deep, insightful story, stay away.			"

												A crazy action-adventure RPG where you play a vault hunter - a mercenary who desperately tries to find the vault to claim its hidden treasures. There are 4 different characters (classes) you can choose from that offer 4 different play-styles. There is an enormous amount of items found in this game - really, the amount of weapons you can find is just amazing. Colours indicate their extra features - this is similar to Diablo. The rarer weapons you find the stronger it is. There are tons of missions to complete and many conversations to listen to. It is a sin to skip even one single side mission as the dialogue is very, very entertaining and funny. In addition to this, the game has 4 DLCs that take you to different areas and continue the already silly story by telling you further adventures.I guess the only difference between this and its sequel is that the first episode lacks a proper antagonist. There's no main villain here which is a bit of a let down once you complete the game and encounter the final boss. Still, this one small flaw cannot ruin the experience for you as your walkthrough will be entertaining all the way.Also, the sequel has a bit more vivid colours that was a nice change compared to this episode where everything is grey or brown. Anyway, Borderlands is a great game and best played with friends (you need them for some of the boss battles). Playing the first one to understand the sequel's story is not mandatory. If it is discounted, though, picking up the game of the year edition can be one of the best gifts on Steam. "

												I played this game AFTER Borderlands 2, so, obviously, if you compare it to that, it's NOT as good. That said, it's still pretty amazing, and you can see why they MADE another game (and made that game better, oh, so much better). On the other hand, I also played it after the Pre-sequel (yes, in terms of story I played the games BACKWARDS), and it was certainly better than that overall (being longer - with the dlc - and less glitchy, and certainly cheaper).      The levelling and story are not as good as Borderlands 2, but it's still fun, still funny and still pretty damn violent. It's shorter than Borderlands 2, and without the dlc (this is the only one of the three that I got the full edition of, with all four dlc), it's probably shorter, or equal to, the pre-sequel. This makes it clear to me that these games were made to have the dlc - and, amazingly, that I got NINETY hours out of Borderlands 2 WITHOUT the dlc, which is impressive, and just goes to show that games just aren't long enough anymore. The idea that you don't get the complete game without paying EXTRA for dlc now is one of the things that annoys a lot of people in the gaming world today, but this game is fairly old now and very cheap on sale, so the full edition is worth getting (especially as without Moxxi's Underdome there isn't even a bank to store your stuff).

												Borderlands is a very unique game with a very funny and well thought out storyline. The characters are memorable and the landscape across Pandora has its own special feeling.Driving the runners feels great how smooth it glides across the terrain and the infinite guns gives it a diablo feeling of loot progression. One of my favorite aspects of this game is the New Game + system where you can play the game a second time with renamed enemies who are much tougher than before, which turns what used to be easy missions into a nightmare.The DLC is fun and rewarding even though Mad Moxxi TD can be very tedious. As a game I own three copies for and have beat over a dozen times I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fps/rpg elements with a funny and progressive storyline.I give it an 8.5 out of ten for replability, story, and great gameplay that will keep you playing for hours.

												Borderlands, is a good game.Ya know, the game can't take the blame.Be a man, play this game.I'm stoppin doug, gonna play this game.(game, game...)This game isn't expensive and it will be alot better than you see in the screenshots. The screenshots are a joke, the game itself really shines. But if you want humour, buy Borderlands 2. Let's move on with the pro's and con's.Let's get the con's out of the way, shall we?- Travelling to another place/location takes some of your time.- Inventory space is ok, but not the best. Although I like the fact that it makes these games more challenging.- Some missions are impossible, even if your level is recommended.And now... *drum music* the pro's!+ Made in Unreal Engine 3, one of the best engine's in my opinion.+ You don't need a gaming pc to run this stuff, my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc handles this game with Medium-High settings on 40+ FPS. If you can run Team Fortress 2/XCOM: Enemy Unknown, your pc will probably handle this game.+ Loot, loot and... Omg! More loot! :'D And alot of weapons!+ Great characters like Claptrap.+ Good story.+ Scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me when I saw my first Psycho in the game.+ Many missions, open world. It's an official RPS (Role-Playing-Shooter) game.TL;DR: This game isn't the average Shilectronic Farts game, it's a great open world shooter. Try the experience for yourself.I rate this game 10/10, it kept me playin' ;)			"

												I played this game a long time ago.  I was I think 10 when I got this on sale at my local Half-Price Books.  The game was fun, I loved playing the multiplayer and the people were so nice.  Then I got an OP weapon and shield where I could kill things in one hit as well as survive everything.  I finished the game at level 7...  Other than that, the game was fun and hilarious.  I didn't buy the DLC, so I was missing out on a lot.  Now that I have it on Steam, Im pretty happy I can play through the entire game as well as the DLC.  I would recommend BL 1 for the people who want more of the story behind the original Vault Hunters since this shows what they were like before they become leaders of the crimson raiders.  BL 1 doesn't exactly have the greatest maps like in BL 2, but its really fun especially co-op.  I would rate BL 1 am 8/10.			"

												Actually, the game is quite good!Nice graphics.Simple story: Go out, kill, collect new weapons.But the following just annoyed me and made it unplayable / not enjoable at all for me:Enter a new map. Make your way through it or just partially.(Achieve your mission goal, get close to death and make your way back to get some medkits or get killed)In most of the times all the enemies you just killed a few minutes ago are back again!It might work if the map is big, then it would not feel empty - but still, all are back after some minutes (?).The breaking point for me was in Sledge´s bunker or whatever complex it was. I made my way through it, was close to death so i ran back - maybe 300m ingame - to get myself some medkits. And all the enemies i killed just 5 minutes ago were back???Same like in the S.t.a.l.k.e.r game - ruined it for me the same way.If you are into stuff like that, get the game, its good!But its definitely nothing for me, unfortunately..

												Choose your hero and prepare to plunge into Pandora's world. A loads of guns will come in very handy when you'll face bandits and the fauna itself. And yeah, Borderlands will tell you the story which won't be flogged to death if you'll start game over and over again. But also the game won't spoon-feed you and I strongly reccomend you, loser, to get friends to play it.			"

												The game is good but it does have its issues. When thinking about the gameplay the weapon handling feels clunky, but it feel that its actually a good thing, its feels like you really have to control them rather than just point and shoot.The story and world is really interesting, whether it be the main game or the expansions. However the gameplay never really changes, and is very hard to keep you interested.Its worth giving a go, but if you have yet to play a Borderlands game I would say that 2 is a better place to start.

												I was a bit late to the Borderlands game. To be honest, I didn't enjoy this as much as BL2. Advice to anyone getting into Borderlands, don't think that you need to play BL1 to appreciate BL2. The second game is much more fun, and stands well on it's own legs. If you're aching for more after finishing BL2 and have checked off ""be disappointed by BL:TPS"" on your To-Do list, come back and play this game.			"

												Borderlands is one of my all time favourite games for many reasons. First off, its RPG elements are great. You get to choose the 'class' of character you want at the beginning of the game, and choose exactly which abilities and skills you want as you level up.  You get to choose which sidemissions you want to do, when you want (If you like it hard, do it straight away, or wait a bit so its easier. AND the GUNS, so many guns. the randomness in them are great and theres always the feeling like you have the best gun ever, only to play for another 30 minutes and find your new best friend. This game also has replayability, start as each class member and thats 4 playthroughs, and each one will be very different not only because of the different skill trees, but also due to the different weapons you'll encounter.

Borderlands.Published in 2009, this game belongs in the ""lifetime"" category, being always replayable no matter the advance on technology. People will come back for this game. Not necessarily for its geeky, retro, cartoony graphics (which can be a downside for some gamers), but rather for its never-ceasing ability to incite laughter and challenge at the same time.It runs on a modified Unreal Engine 3. While they indeed implemented cartoony graphics instead of polished ""realistic"" graphics, this approach allowed the developers to highly detail the surroundings in a way no other devs managed to pull off before using cartoony graphics.The general atmosphere of the game could be defined as a mixture between Fallout, Diablo and dozen of other FPS / RPG's.Critics and reviewers rarely give this game a lower score than 80/100 and with good reasons.If I had to critize something concerning Borderlands, I'd probably point at the considerable weak AI and the rather weak storyline. A gamer interested in a deep, attractive and emotional storyline shouldn't invest his money in Borderlands. The boss fights are intense and satisfying when won, something some developers fail at achieving.Summary:Pro's:Favoured amongst seasoned reviewers and critics;Intense and satisfying boss fights;Amazing weapon variety;Enjoyable co-op multiplayer;Astereotypical characters in an original setting with an abundance of dark humor;Very entertaining DLC-packs;Contra's:Rather weak AI;Weak storyline;Not many players online anymore for co-op;PvP, while available, almost nonexistent;Neutral:Cartoony graphics;Overal, I'd agree with most curators by stating that this game is an absolute masterpiece. It might not be for you due to the rather rare approach concerning graphics and setting, but I'd definitely recommend this to anyone. "

												Borderlands is an RPG sci-fi shooter that features four player online co-op.Borderlands is the shooter for those who may have dabbled in Diablo or World of Warcraft but find them boring and monotonous and prefer a more hands-on approach. Sure, the amount of depth to the RPG elements isn’t really the same, but what is there is substantial enough to addict the get-up-and-go kind of player.			"

												8/10If you haven't played this game by now you're like me; There are prior elements of many games here as well as elements that many future games have been built upon. The gameplay partially reminded me of a similar ""low-gravity, shielded action FPS on another world"" shooter called Halo. Did I say Halo?, I meant Halo 4 (10/10). As a Vault Hunter on open world Pandora, you need to favour your way through the right people and fight your way to your destiny. Collect more powerful weapons and sell your loot for cash. Spend your cash on upgrades and better weapons, or save it for when you die and need reconstruction.			"

												Borderlands is still my personal favorite of the three to come out. Maybe it's a nostalgia thing, but it's honestly a pretty damn good game. The one con that I can find on the PC is that a ""Are you sure"" prompt pops up every time you buy/sell an item at a vendor. But the problem with that is you have to press ""enter"" every time, there is no way to custom bind that accept button to the left click which would save a ton of time spamming enter when you go to buy ammo. Other than that it's a great game by it's self, but with DLC it's fantastic.			"

												I actually enjoyed playing this game a lot. I loved jokes, graphics, story, characters, etc. But the only thing that ruined the whole picture is ending. I was very dissapointed in it. The feeling of rush and hurry in the last story mission was such a good thing. When you know that the vault could be in hands of bad dudes and you are trying to be the one who stops them and takes the treasure of the vault. The boss which is looking like he is worth killing for the treasure. And in the end he dies and gives you NOTHING. The vault just closes and you are without treasure. Neither a good weapon is dropped, neither a player is happy.I played the T-Bone Junction DLC after completing the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned which where both very good, but as usual the T-Bone Junction had such a dissapointing ending as I couldn't even imagine.But even though the ending is not that good, the game still became one of my favourite.9/10 Psychoes Totally worth buying.

Its fun and can be funny at points.My only complaints is late game on your first playthorugh, there will be near zero good guns, but that's because you already have pretty much the best stuff for your first time through.

(Exploder,Elemental hellstorm,Sniper, and a guy with a turret).Ive beaten this game like 7 times at the time of this review and im still yet to see all this game has to offer.Its the most satisfying thing to see that shiny new smg you found in a chest one shred through a crowd of shirtless psychopaths with buzzaxes, or a rocket launcher to take revenge on that boss your died to too many times to admit.This game can be frustrating but more often then not it is quite enjoyable.

Originally posted by The TL,DR Genie:Join the Vault Hunters, visit exotic Pandora, meet strange psychos, then shoot them. Borderlands is one of those rare treats that managed to be wonderfully fun for me, no matter with how many people I was playing with or what we were doing. It's not perfect but it's damn close.Spiderants, Rakks and Skags, oh my!The story of Borderlands is in no way new. There's treasure! Treasure so large and so old that there are stories about it. These stories attract treasure hunters. And then there's the uncountable number of enemies and inhabitants between the treasure hunters and the treasure. Do the treasure hunters give up? Naaah, they use guns. Lots and lots of guns. And one little annoying robot that somehow manages to survive and make it to the sequel. The characters of Borderlands manage to stay fun and interesting and very much unique which is actually surprising considering that at the end of the day they could all be using the exact same type of gun.The main HUD is minimal and even blended in to the start of the story. The other menus aren't that fortunate though and until the user gets used them they will feel very clunky and unintuitive. This is to be expected with console ports but a menu overhaul or revamp would've been hugely appreciated. The feel of the controls is however very reliable and satisfying. Itemization focuses mainly around offense as there are no actual pieces of clothing or armor that can be found and worn. The amount of randomized weapons and the absolutely ridiculous number of enemies are what makes Borderlands feel like a hack-and-slash. The experience gain, skill trees, quest progression, open world and legendary items are what makes it feel like an action-role-playing-game. The fact that all those weapons are guns, that a lot of bosses have guns and that even the vehicles have guns are what make it a first-person-shooter. And all of these elements make it very fun.The graphic style is one my favorites and as such, I can find no fault in it, although others might. The protagonists, the other characters, the world, the weapons are all very well made and blend in. There is no element that actually stands out. The music always fits the setting flawlessly, the sound effects are crystal clear and nothing users wouldn't expect and the voice acting is spot on as well. The protagonists do not really seem to interact that much with each other and that's a shame.For a first-person-shooter all the controls are spot on as well and the integration with the protagonists' unique skills has no drawbacks.

												My thoughs about Borderlands 1:- If you like FPS and Diablo, this is perfect game for you- If you need good story, buy Borderlands 2, cuz the story in Borderlands 1 is not very well builded- After playing Borderlands 2, you propably can have feelings that B1 is Alpha version of Borderlands 2- Graphics: Fine- Music/Sound: Very Good- Gameplay: Good- Great for Co-op (max.4)- PvP only 1vs1 and 2vs2(?)- Ending is really bad in my opinion- Don't buy Moxxi Arena DLC is just boobie trap!!!It's still worth to buy and play.

												I cannot say enough good things about this game. After I played it I purchased every other game in the franchise. It is just one of those must play games. One that keeps you coming back for more. Lovable characters, including the villians. Setting is great, quests are awesome. I can't decided if I like the guns, the pyschos or the alien lifeforms the best! If I could only play one game for the rest of my life - it would definitely be a Borderlands game.			"

Originally posted by The TL,DR Genie:Join the Vault Hunters, visit exotic Pandora, meet strange psychos, then shoot them. Borderlands is one of those rare treats that managed to be wonderfully fun for me, no matter with how many people I was playing with or what we were doing. It's not perfect but it's damn close.Spiderants, Rakks and Skags, oh my!The story of Borderlands is in no way new. There's treasure! Treasure so large and so old that there are stories about it. These stories attract treasure hunters. And then there's the uncountable number of enemies and inhabitants between the treasure hunters and the treasure. Do the treasure hunters give up? Naaah, they use guns. Lots and lots of guns. And one little annoying robot that somehow manages to survive and make it to the sequel. The characters of Borderlands manage to stay fun and interesting and very much unique which is actually surprising considering that at the end of the day they could all be using the exact same type of gun.The main HUD is minimal and even blended in to the start of the story. The other menus aren't that fortunate though and until the user gets used them they will feel very clunky and unintuitive. This is to be expected with console ports but a menu overhaul or revamp would've been hugely appreciated. The feel of the controls is however very reliable and satisfying. Itemization focuses mainly around offense as there are no actual pieces of clothing or armor that can be found and worn. The amount of randomized weapons and the absolutely ridiculous number of enemies are what makes Borderlands feel like a hack-and-slash. The experience gain, skill trees, quest progression, open world and legendary items are what makes it feel like an action-role-playing-game. The fact that all those weapons are guns, that a lot of bosses have guns and that even the vehicles have guns are what make it a first-person-shooter. And all of these elements make it very fun.The graphic style is one my favorites and as such, I can find no fault in it, although others might. The protagonists, the other characters, the world, the weapons are all very well made and blend in. There is no element that actually stands out. The music always fits the setting flawlessly, the sound effects are crystal clear and nothing users wouldn't expect and the voice acting is spot on as well. The protagonists do not really seem to interact that much with each other and that's a shame.For a first-person-shooter all the controls are spot on as well and the integration with the protagonists' unique skills has no drawbacks. The options menus are not at all surprising considering that Borderlands is coming from a console port and the only main issue I found is the lack of an integrated Field of Vision option. There are a lot of Achievements but many of them will be reached by completionists without any issues. The others however, may take a little bit of work, depending on skill and luck.Finally, all I can say is: join the Vault Hunters, visit exotic Pandora, meet strange psychos, then shoot them.

My only complaint is lack of voice acting but this was a new ip and they fixed that in the second one. The gameplay never gets old and it can be difficult but, that just makes killing ♥♥♥♥ so satisfying OOHHHH MY GOOOOOD! The RPG elements are quite nice and they all feel like they have a great impact in the game.

												Borderlands is FPS/RPG with a unique art style set in a world filled with chaos and danger. You have a choice of 4 classes each with their own ability and weapon specialty. You’re on a mission to find the Vault. What’s inside? Well some believe fame, money, power, or maybe even women. There’s plenty of missions along the way to finding the vault with some funny ester eggs sprinkled though out.I've played and beaten Borderlands on the Xbox 360, but decided to pick it up for PC because the game is that good. Playing the game solo it’s very enjoyable; however, get a few friends to join you and this game become incredibly fun. Ultimately the game comes down to collecting guns to go kill small and large creatures and/or people.  "

												There is a review somewhere on here were a fellow talks about how terrible the game is because of the aiming system. He says that he aims right at the bad guy and the shot misses and when he aims of to the side of the bad guy the bullet hits him. Do to this he says, the game is crap. This guy forgot a very important aspect of the game; it's a First Person Shooter-RPG not just a fps. In a regular fps, your guns are powerful the only thing standing between you and killing your enemy is how good you aim. In a FPS-RPG your guns have stats. You could have the best aim in the world but if your gun sucks, you're gonna get mauled down faster than a turkey on thanksgiving. On the other hand if your aim sucks but you have a powerful gun just run up to the guy and blast him and if you get swarmed by a bunch enemies no problem because in this game, it's all about the guns. And second winds, the best aspect of this game.Normally if your get shot down in a game you die and have to restart the level or whatever, but in this game if your shield and health bar deplete to zero you have a chance to kill and enemy before you bleed to death and catch a Second Wind in which your shield regenerates and you can go on killing baddies. This single element gives you the freedom to play the game anyway you like. You can run and gun, or stealth kill or both whatever. Just make sure you have a good gun and a good shield ALWAYS or your second wind rampages will be short lived.Death is the difference between losing money and not losing money. When you die you respawn at a checkpoint and get charged a fee which is a percentage of the amount of money you have so, if you low on cash it's possible to respawn for like 3 bucks. Don't worry about having to kill the same baddies over again because in this game, when you kill an enemy in an area but another one kills you, when you respawn the enemies you killed WON'T Be there anymore. Let me say that again, enemies you killed already will not respawn when you die. They will only comeback when you exit the game and reload or in some cases, when you return to the area at a later time. This is great because even if a second wind can't save you then just walk back and take out what bad guys are left.One important thing though, the health bars of guys you didn't kill will regenerate when you respawn, so if you're fighting a boss and die, he will be at full health when you return. You need to have at least some strategy in this game though because a run and gun will NOT always work. Especially with bosses. Using Second Winds is a strategy in its self that can be very effective and an extremely fun way to play, but if you do not use it properly you will lose money FAST and/or get repeatedly killed by gang lords.That begin said don't worry too much about boss fights, they are a fun aspect of the game because you can approach the battle anyway you like. The boss battles are as challenging as you make then. Exploit the bosses attack range and spam yours or fight him legitimately in a head to head arena using the proper dodge, cover and aim techniques; either way boss killing is satisfying.You have a lot of control on how you play the game with the skills, guns, approaches, ect you discover. I won't ruin it all for you and leave you to figure them out for yourself. All in all, this is probably the best game I have played do to the fact that you can play the game however you want to. In short, Get. This. Game.			"

Also The Different Characters Can Cover Everyone's Playstyles, And Also The Humour In This Game Is Great With It's Good Quest Names. Now The Art Style...

												This game holds a special place in my heart. It was one of the very first games I ever 100% enjoyed, and still do to this day after 5 or 6 so years have gone by since first playing it. It gives me and I'm sure countless others that adrenaline rush that many games these days do not give. If you enjoy killing things nonstop, this is the game for you.If you have always wanted to see what its like to play a game where developers have left bugs and glitches in a game on purpose, this is the game for you.If you want a perfect combination of comedy, gore and action, this is the game for you.Borderlands and Borderlands 2 go hand in hand, and are in my opinion two of if not the best games created. Also if you're looking for a farming companion hit me up on Steam :"")			"

												If you have never played Borderlands before and you want to know if you should before playing the sequal the answer is yes and no. No because story wise it dosent tell you anything the 2nd game wont clarify. Yes because it will get you invested in the characters and give you a better feel of why Jack is badguy. All of that aside there really aint no rest for the wicked and i can back that claim up. Iv spent so many hours with this amazing FPSRPG that iv lost count. What it lacks in a deep intresting story it makes up for in fun 4-way co-op. The random gun generation means that no play through will be quit the same. The art style blends well with the gameplay and the game itself doesn't try so hard to be funny (like with the sequal). The gameplay can get a little repetative (it is an FPS after all) so its best not to play for very long at a time. The only real glaring issue with Borderlands are its legendary guns; the weapons that are ment to be top tier. Many of them have been codded incorrectly and dont behave as intended. This is a very minor oversight and really does nothing to take away from the game. It just messes with my OCD. Also hellfire is OP.			"

												Borderlands is still my personal favorite of the three to come out. Maybe it's a nostalgia thing, but it's honestly a pretty damn good game. The one con that I can find on the PC is that a ""Are you sure"" prompt pops up every time you buy/sell an item at a vendor. But the problem with that is you have to press ""enter"" every time, there is no way to custom bind that accept button to the left click which would save a ton of time spamming enter when you go to buy ammo. Other than that it's a great game by it's self, but with DLC it's fantastic.			"

												The cartoonish style of Borderlands might be a minus for some, but Gearbox uses that to implement a particular gore style and a buttload of humour. Best Features:  - Loot, loot again and some more loot there. - Leveling. Even though it is a FPS, the leveling system let you play four different characters with each three different talent trees.  - Humour. The humour in this game is genius. Shooting to death a bandit at point blank with a sniper and stumbling across his arm a few feet farther is always nice in that kind of game. Plus the CL4P-TP robot makes me think of the hyperactive child GLADOS would have had if she could have one. - It plays well in solo and great in co-op. The game stays the same and you have many hours of gameplay. Took me around 40 hours my first time with a little try of every character and some fooling around. Minus : - It is kind of an open world but you can't really venture off to the high level zone if you're not yourself high level. The trash mobs will kill you pretty fast.  - Community is greedy. If you play in a quick match online, you might have to fight for the loot.  - PvP is not really insane in Borderlands. Though I had my fun on PS3 killing those hacked-shield wielder in the small arena in the first zone.			"

												Borderlands combines the best in first-person action with player customization and vehicular combat for incredible layers of gameplay depth. The game features a groundbreaking content generation system allowing for near-endless variety in weapons and item drops. Borderlands allows for multiple players involved in online co-op games simultaneously. The player can at any time to join a game or leave it or continue playing in single player mode. In addition a complex and thrilling story.All these features combine to form a breakthrough experience that challenges the conventions of modern shooters. Players choose from one of four distinct characters and then win in battle experience and Unmegen added special skills. Many of these skills can be developed through upgrades, so that the player can create his character exactly as it corresponds to his playing style.83/100			"

In addition, there are massive DLCs that improve the experience even more. I love this game, and so far from what I've played, I love Borderlands 2 even more. definitely recommended.			"

												I beat Borderlands on PS3 back when it first launched, and more recently beat it again on Steam. Sure, Gearbox helped push giants gobs of DLC into mainstream, and one could argue that the series has gone a bit stale recently, but for the time, Borderlands was an awesome experience. I have mixed feelings about the DLC, and especially about their weird little ""key"" giveaways, but that doesn't change the original Borderlands being a fun experience.It's not the most varied game, and by the end of the 20-30 hours of your first playthrough, some parts have gotten a tough tedious. But grab a friend or three, and blast through the hunt for bigger and better weapons. The original is still very much worth a try, but be warned that it's a fraction as enjoyable solo.			"

 Does it have a premise? As the Vault Hunters, you (and your friends) are looking for The Vault, a place that opens every 200 years, which, according to rumours, houses treasures not of this world. While it is a Pandoran legend, that's not going to stop you. How does it play? Borderlands is an open-world looter shooter with RPG elements. The enemies are usually bullet sponges, and while I'm of the philosophy that bullets shouldn't respect how far in the game you are, it's unavoidable. Weapons and other items are color-coded by rarity, and generally, by their overall quality. It goes as follows: White >> Green >> Blue >> Purple >> Orange, white being the most common, orange being the rarest. On another note entirely, vehicles drive like total ♥♥♥. Fin.You can choose one of four characters, each boasting a unique set of skills and a specific role in a well-balanced team. Roland - the Soldier has a sentry turret which he can deploy, which, with some upgrades allows it to heal and replenish ammunition of teammates, filling a defensive and supportive role. The character is suited to shotguns and combat rifles.Lilith - the Siren can phase out of reality as we perceive it, turning invisible to enemies and moving far faster than normal. With this, Lilith's elemental proficiency and her damage and crit skills in mind, the class is well-suited for a hit and run DPS role. The character is suited to SMGs and repeater pistols, preferably with the capability for elemental damage.Mordecai - the Hunter can use his pet, Bloodwing to swoop in and attack enemies, dealing massive damage and negating cover. With his skills geared towards sniping and long-range combat, he fills in the much needed long-range role. The character is suited to revolvers and sniper rifles.Brick - the Beserker can do just that, berserk his enemies, beating them into piles of bloody goop with his fists. His skills are geared towards tanking damage, kicking ♥♥♥ and taking names. The character is suited to explosives and melee combat. Does it have music? The music is there, however, it's woefully average. There are a handful of memorable pieces, but it's mostly ambience and generic combat music. How is the port? This is a new addition to my typical reviews, but I've ought to mention this, the game is locked at a 55 degree field of view, which can understandably be troublesome for a lot of players. This can be remedied with some .ini tweaking which I won't go into detail with in this review, but that doesn't smoothly fix the issue. The game's determined to have the FOV at 55. However, the performance is solid, which is a given since the game is approaching eight years of age. Who should buy this? If you enjoy RPGs, open worlds, shooting or looting, then this game is for you. While its sequel, Borderlands 2, overshadows it in every regard, I can't help but carry a certain degree of nostalgia towards the original. I have to say, that in my opinion, this is one of the finest looter shooters around, which isn't surprising when you consider that the market isn't crowded.			"

It has a lot of comedy and action, sometimes fast paced sometimes slow. I especially loved the robot Cl4ptrap, he made it so very fun to play. You meet interesting characters and you get to shoot creatures that for no better reason than you being in the area will hunt you.			"

												Not a bad game at all. Exploits allot of hidden potential in the Unreal Engine on a graphical level previously unseen in games utilizing the Unreal Gaming technology.Pretty loose fit for the genre as it is interactive more than RPG although it sports the mission style game play mechanics of the lot with intermediary free roam slaughter-house fun.It's a good game for a first installment and does its part to raise the bar where others have  met status quo on a good day. The installment gets better as the eccentric details surface through the incorporation of DLC.Ultimately, 29 USD for the GoTY Edition with all available DLC was a good buy even though the P.C. version seems a bit much for the NT Kernel at times as does Fallout 3.

												Borderlands, Borderlands, Borderlands. You're such an odd game. On the one hand, it's fun exploring your vast world and collecting weapons along the way, the combat and guns are fun too. However your quests get grindy and repetitive, your story is non existant which would have made the quests more bearable if there was a more fleshed out story and your ending is seriously one of the worst i've played. But I feel that the pros outway the cons so I recommend it if you're a fan of action RPG's, just don't expect anything really great though.			"

												The start of an amazing series of games. The first version of borderlands is a fun game to play. There are a lot of great missions that make the story line quite good. The side missions tend to get a little repetitive, but nothing too seriously.  The graphics are good for this (older) game.  It does look acceptable and is no downfall.The game is filled with weapons , each more crazy than the other. As the story line features great boss battles and funny jokes , it was a pleasure so far playing this game. I Can definitly see why border lands 2 was an even bigger succes. Its like borderlands 1 except bigger and more detailled. But this game had set a very good example for the coming borderlands.I highly recommend this game. Its cheap, Its hours of fun and it has a nice co op system, allowing you to play with friends.  Borderlands 1 and 2 go hand in hand , as this game had set the right example and building fundaments for whats possibly the greatest fps of all time, borderlands 2...			"

												Borderlands is an amazing First Person Role Playing Shooter in a sense. It has a great leveling system, tons of loot to make your character stronger, and a very neat and organized skilltree. The story could have been better but its still acceptable due to the DLC and the amazing gameplay mechanics. There are some glitches that you can access and odd things happening, but its nothing game breaking. The soundtrack is also pretty good but it needed a lot more for how big the game truly is. So far even on a low end pc the graphics are decent and the gameplay is smooth. I didnt excpect it to be good on my pc. I am not saying every pc can play it but keep in mind I do not have a graphics card to run on its own. I currently have a processer with a built in graphics card.All in all this game is a solid 9 in my honest opinion (on a scale of 10). I love practically everything about it and Ive been playing it for many many years. Pretty much since it came out. I definetally recommend this and all the DLC to everyone who has yet to buy and or play it.			"

												Borderlands Review.*Note: Review based on PS3 version.Borderlands is the game you may have dreamt of when you were younger (minus the gore!). A big open world to explore, a multitude of quests, and cartoon graphics in an age of gritty realism. What's not to like?The only downside to Borderlands is the fact it is basically a tech demo for things to come. But when you step onto Pandora, you forget about that, you just exist in this fascinating world that has been laid out for you. Sure, the lack of a solid story can and will disappoint you at times, but once you allow yourself to be immersed in this non conventional world, you will be hooked.I say non conventional, because really it is not your typical FPS game. Nor your typical ARPG. It's almost a new genre, where all you do is loot, shoot and loot some more. Never have I felt so restricted in my choices to carry loot I find, but this is a good thing. You are given a steady stream of improving weapons and upgrades that encourage you to change how you play on the fly. This really gives the game longetivity and prolonged enjoyability, it just doesn't get stale.The graphics, the world, the characters, the audio. All are wonderfully utilised in creating this game. You may find yourself shooting the same enemies over and over again, but that makes it even more exciting to find the ""badass"" version of them, and to beat the virtual stuffing out of them.Borderlands will continue to entertain you hours after you start playing. It is a funny, tough, exciting, non stop thrill ride (that's right, cliché time) from start to finish. In short, you need to buy this game. Come on, visit Pandora. Who know's what you'll find here....9/10Excellent			"

												In a nutshell, Borderlands is an FPS mixed with Diablo-esque ARPG elements of grinding and leveling. The visual style is cartoony, yet oddly compelling and four different characters as well as the randomized loot will keep the game somewhat fresh on subsequent playthroughs. The scenery is a bit dull, even though they try to freshen things up by the end at least a bit.The plot of the game is, unfortunately, nearly non-existant. The few lightly fleshed out characters you meet won't actually have that many voiced lines and the actual ""bad guy"" of the game remains so wallflowery that I didn't even realise she existed until the very end. Oh, and the ending... well, less said, the better. To me it was, unfortunately, rage inducing. I would also like to point out that when I originally bought the non-steam version of the game, it didn't even have the courtesy to work on my computer until I downloaded a cracked .exe for it. Shame on the developers.Still, if you're looking for a decent ARPG to sink a few hours into, Borderlands isn't such a bad choice to be honest. Although it's hard to get into the story or characters, you can at times get absorbed in the world and the non-stop silly yet gory action. At least it's something different in a sea of mediocre fantasy-themed hack-and-slashes.			"

But recently a few friends invited me to play and I finally got into it. The gameplay is quite fun and unique once you get used to it. The co-op part of the game is really well done.

												Borderlands is a great game. There is co-op up to 4 friends, 87 billizion guns in the game, and it has RPG elements in a first person shooter. If you love to level up, get new guns, and play with your friends all at the same time, this game is for you. The guns range from snipers, rockets, machine guns, handguns, and shotguns. The guns are creative and bring a feel of the world you are on. Each character that you can be has their own special abilities and each one has it's own mod. The mods can give your allies ammo, health, boost to your current health, or a boost to your current shield. The game has a comic book look to the game and it fits just right. With the 4 other exapnsions you get with the game, you have hundreds of hours of gameplay with your friends. You can play with other people in public games, and depending on the host, it could be fun or just a waste of time. Borderlands has a feel of action with a little funnies to it, and you will laugh at the jokes they make. BUY!			"

												This game was and will always be amazing.I have put almost a thousand hours into this game (most of which were off-steam) because it just keeps giving back. The Cooperative experience is where this game lives.  Playing alone will give only half the perspective. With a full party of four, this game goes places.  Much time will be spent clamoring over weapons and equipment. Sometimes the team will spend an hour just having a good time with the vehicle physics. Other times will be lulled waiting in towns and for shops to restock. When taken beyond the game's limit, Vehicles will be dropped through the map, superior parkour through entire levels and completely irrelevant adventures made by developer's mistake.  The game is just so engrossing, whether it is played as intended or off the record.Some people may ask how I manage to spend so much time on a single game. I ask myself the same question. Glancing back, it's hard to imagine. Looking back, I reminisce of good times.			"

												This game is a masterpiece. With a memorable characters, great humour, beautiful cel-shaded graphics and hours of content, you simple can't go wrong with this game. It's hard to put into words really. This game just has a lot of diverse gameplay with an innovative take on the FPS genre. This rethinking of the genre allows this game to be enjoyable for both casual and hardcore gamers. Its open-world setting allows for hours of exploring (both on foot and in a tank) side-questing, weapon-collecting and just screwing around. To top it off, it has 4-player story co-op (and it's done well). There are also 4 classes to choose from: Beserker, Siren, Hunter and Soldier - each with their own skills and abilities.This game is definitely recommended for lovers of the Bioshock and Fallout series but is also a great place to start for people who are new to the genre.

												If you're a fan of the ""Lootin' n Shootin'"" genre, this game is for you. While it might not be as pretty or fleshed out as the succeeding titles, it still holds up remarkably well even to this day and has plenty to offer in terms of gameplay. Not to mention the fact that if you buy the Calptrap's New Robot Revolution DLC, you finally get the chance to kill (literally hundreds) of Claptraps any way you like. If that's not a major selling point then I don't know what is.			"

												Lets Just get right to the TLDR cause this game doesn't need a long review. It's just fantastic and worth it's full price. The art style is timeless, the gunplay is polished and impactful. The loot mechanics are addicting in a good way. The story is tongue in cheek with some seriously hilarious writing. It has a significant amount of dlc content, which is all great. For me this game is truly a classic. I played it on PS3, bought it again here to play through it with my friends again. 10/10			"

												Pretty sure everyone has said all there is to say about Borderlands. I'll give you my 2 cents though... in a quick manner. My second playthrough about 2 years after I first played through it. Enjoyed the main campaign a lot more, the variation of loot is always good. The gameplay gets pretty stale later in the game, especially during the DLC.I didn't really like the fact that I couldnt have the graphical settings on full and get less than 30 fps, my rig is more than capable of being able to handle this game 6 years after release. I've read in places though, that the game is not very well ported for pc. For me, it was all about the exploration, the experience and story. Kinda wish they would have just left it at the main campaign and forgot about some of the DLC because the Knoxx add on just draaaaaggged on, Moxies was kinda pointless, Neds was ok and so was Claptraps. Otherwise a very uniqe and memorable experience.			"

												Very fun with friends, not the biggest fan of Gearbox but this is their gem.The randomized guns and the pure amount of things to do with friends while leveling up and killing everything in sight is really great.The story isn't anything amazing, and the ending can almost ruin the whole adventure for you...but you don't play randomized lootfest games for the story, right?....right?The DLC's are equally as fun, some of them get VERY difficult. I highly reccommend trying this game out, as long as you have 2 or 3 friends to play with.			"

I can admit that the weapons are unbalanced, the shields/grenades are unbalanced, and hell, even the classes are unbalanced, but the game, with friends, is hilariously fun.Very creative take with the blend of RPG and FPS genres, all while managing to make grinding not difficult.  Guns, of course, take the game's central focus, with a startling amount of combinations.  That feeling when you find 50 bucks on the sidewalk?

It does have a few quirks, like invisible walls, but the number of variations for combat and exploration make this extremely fun. Questing is a bit unique, and the controlls took a while to adjust to, but now feel fluid and natural.

												I beat Borderlands on PS3 back when it first launched, and more recently beat it again on Steam. Sure, Gearbox helped push giants gobs of DLC into mainstream, and one could argue that the series has gone a bit stale recently, but for the time, Borderlands was an awesome experience. I have mixed feelings about the DLC, and especially about their weird little ""key"" giveaways, but that doesn't change the original Borderlands being a fun experience.It's not the most varied game, and by the end of the 20-30 hours of your first playthrough, some parts have gotten a tough tedious. But grab a friend or three, and blast through the hunt for bigger and better weapons. The original is still very much worth a try, but be warned that it's a fraction as enjoyable solo.			"

The story line(s) are fantastic, the gun possibilites are endless and satisfying (if you want, you can have a machine pistol that spurs acid on your enemy along with regular bullet damage!), the graphics are pretty nice, and, altough it's a dark and depressing world, can be hilarious at times (like Claptrap!)  Even your charcter has certain skills and actions to do (spawn a turret, go in another direction, etc) and can be upgraded.

												This is one of the most fun co-op campaign FPS games I've played in ages.  I've gone through it countless times on console, and find it quite serviceble on PC.  While it is balanced favoring the Siren due to the commonality of better suited drops for her, it's entirely fun and playable as all of the classes and an excellent way to spend an afternoon with friends.

												Yeah nah. I had high hopes for this game. The 'shoot at the enemy until it dies' philosophy is more prevalent here than most any other game I've seen.It's the perfect storm of: No real need to seek cover, all enemies are bullet sponges, most abilities amount to ""+% extra damage or accuracy or health or willy size"", all the weapons are pretty generic and boring (despite being randomly generated), no real character customization (in terms of appearance or ability (builds usually amount to 'punching guy' or 'shooting guy')), boring and repititive locations, bland narrative, annoying attempts at humor.The graphics style is kind of cool, and the idea of putting in a diablo-esque loot system into a FPS is also kind of cool (even if it doesn't work too well). But not even co-op could make this game interesting.Bland bland bland. Just bland. Bland as ♥♥♥♥.			"

												There is a review somewhere on here were a fellow talks about how terrible the game is because of the aiming system. He says that he aims right at the bad guy and the shot misses and when he aims of to the side of the bad guy the bullet hits him. Do to this he says, the game is crap. This guy forgot a very important aspect of the game; it's a First Person Shooter-RPG not just a fps. In a regular fps, your guns are powerful the only thing standing between you and killing your enemy is how good you aim. In a FPS-RPG your guns have stats. You could have the best aim in the world but if your gun sucks, you're gonna get mauled down faster than a turkey on thanksgiving. On the other hand if your aim sucks but you have a powerful gun just run up to the guy and blast him and if you get swarmed by a bunch enemies no problem because in this game, it's all about the guns. And second winds, the best aspect of this game.Normally if your get shot down in a game you die and have to restart the level or whatever, but in this game if your shield and health bar deplete to zero you have a chance to kill and enemy before you bleed to death and catch a Second Wind in which your shield regenerates and you can go on killing baddies. This single element gives you the freedom to play the game anyway you like. You can run and gun, or stealth kill or both whatever. Just make sure you have a good gun and a good shield ALWAYS or your second wind rampages will be short lived.Death is the difference between losing money and not losing money. When you die you respawn at a checkpoint and get charged a fee which is a percentage of the amount of money you have so, if you low on cash it's possible to respawn for like 3 bucks. Don't worry about having to kill the same baddies over again because in this game, when you kill an enemy in an area but another one kills you, when you respawn the enemies you killed WON'T Be there anymore. Let me say that again, enemies you killed already will not respawn when you die. They will only comeback when you exit the game and reload or in some cases, when you return to the area at a later time. This is great because even if a second wind can't save you then just walk back and take out what bad guys are left.One important thing though, the health bars of guys you didn't kill will regenerate when you respawn, so if you're fighting a boss and die, he will be at full health when you return. You need to have at least some strategy in this game though because a run and gun will NOT always work. Especially with bosses. Using Second Winds is a strategy in its self that can be very effective and an extremely fun way to play, but if you do not use it properly you will lose money FAST and/or get repeatedly killed by gang lords.That begin said don't worry too much about boss fights, they are a fun aspect of the game because you can approach the battle anyway you like. The boss battles are as challenging as you make then. Exploit the bosses attack range and spam yours or fight him legitimately in a head to head arena using the proper dodge, cover and aim techniques; either way boss killing is satisfying.You have a lot of control on how you play the game with the skills, guns, approaches, ect you discover. I won't ruin it all for you and leave you to figure them out for yourself. All in all, this is probably the best game I have played do to the fact that you can play the game however you want to. In short, Get. This. Game.			"

Originally posted by The TL,DR Genie:Join the Vault Hunters, visit exotic Pandora, meet strange psychos, then shoot them. Borderlands is one of those rare treats that managed to be wonderfully fun for me, no matter with how many people I was playing with or what we were doing. It's not perfect but it's damn close.Spiderants, Rakks and Skags, oh my!The story of Borderlands is in no way new. There's treasure! Treasure so large and so old that there are stories about it. These stories attract treasure hunters. And then there's the uncountable number of enemies and inhabitants between the treasure hunters and the treasure. Do the treasure hunters give up? Naaah, they use guns. Lots and lots of guns. And one little annoying robot that somehow manages to survive and make it to the sequel. The characters of Borderlands manage to stay fun and interesting and very much unique which is actually surprising considering that at the end of the day they could all be using the exact same type of gun.The main HUD is minimal and even blended in to the start of the story. The other menus aren't that fortunate though and until the user gets used them they will feel very clunky and unintuitive. This is to be expected with console ports but a menu overhaul or revamp would've been hugely appreciated. The feel of the controls is however very reliable and satisfying. Itemization focuses mainly around offense as there are no actual pieces of clothing or armor that can be found and worn. The amount of randomized weapons and the absolutely ridiculous number of enemies are what makes Borderlands feel like a hack-and-slash. The experience gain, skill trees, quest progression, open world and legendary items are what makes it feel like an action-role-playing-game. The fact that all those weapons are guns, that a lot of bosses have guns and that even the vehicles have guns are what make it a first-person-shooter. And all of these elements make it very fun.The graphic style is one my favorites and as such, I can find no fault in it, although others might. The protagonists, the other characters, the world, the weapons are all very well made and blend in. There is no element that actually stands out. The music always fits the setting flawlessly, the sound effects are crystal clear and nothing users wouldn't expect and the voice acting is spot on as well. The protagonists do not really seem to interact that much with each other and that's a shame.For a first-person-shooter all the controls are spot on as well and the integration with the protagonists' unique skills has no drawbacks. The options menus are not at all surprising considering that Borderlands is coming from a console port and the only main issue I found is the lack of an integrated Field of Vision option. There are a lot of Achievements but many of them will be reached by completionists without any issues. The others however, may take a little bit of work, depending on skill and luck.Finally, all I can say is: join the Vault Hunters, visit exotic Pandora, meet strange psychos, then shoot them. Borderlands is one of those rare treats that managed to be wonderfully fun for me, no matter with how many people I was playing with or what we were doing. It's not perfect but it's damn close.			"

												Borderlands is FPS/RPG with a unique art style set in a world filled with chaos and danger. You have a choice of 4 classes each with their own ability and weapon specialty. You’re on a mission to find the Vault. What’s inside? Well some believe fame, money, power, or maybe even women. There’s plenty of missions along the way to finding the vault with some funny ester eggs sprinkled though out.I've played and beaten Borderlands on the Xbox 360, but decided to pick it up for PC because the game is that good. Playing the game solo it’s very enjoyable; however, get a few friends to join you and this game become incredibly fun. Ultimately the game comes down to collecting guns to go kill small and large creatures and/or people.  "

												The cartoonish style of Borderlands might be a minus for some, but Gearbox uses that to implement a particular gore style and a buttload of humour. Best Features:  - Loot, loot again and some more loot there. - Leveling. Even though it is a FPS, the leveling system let you play four different characters with each three different talent trees.  - Humour. The humour in this game is genius. Shooting to death a bandit at point blank with a sniper and stumbling across his arm a few feet farther is always nice in that kind of game. Plus the CL4P-TP robot makes me think of the hyperactive child GLADOS would have had if she could have one. - It plays well in solo and great in co-op. The game stays the same and you have many hours of gameplay. Took me around 40 hours my first time with a little try of every character and some fooling around. Minus : - It is kind of an open world but you can't really venture off to the high level zone if you're not yourself high level. The trash mobs will kill you pretty fast.  - Community is greedy. If you play in a quick match online, you might have to fight for the loot.  - PvP is not really insane in Borderlands. Though I had my fun on PS3 killing those hacked-shield wielder in the small arena in the first zone.			"

												If you have never played Borderlands before and you want to know if you should before playing the sequal the answer is yes and no. No because story wise it dosent tell you anything the 2nd game wont clarify. Yes because it will get you invested in the characters and give you a better feel of why Jack is badguy. All of that aside there really aint no rest for the wicked and i can back that claim up. Iv spent so many hours with this amazing FPSRPG that iv lost count. What it lacks in a deep intresting story it makes up for in fun 4-way co-op. The random gun generation means that no play through will be quit the same. The art style blends well with the gameplay and the game itself doesn't try so hard to be funny (like with the sequal). The gameplay can get a little repetative (it is an FPS after all) so its best not to play for very long at a time. The only real glaring issue with Borderlands are its legendary guns; the weapons that are ment to be top tier. Many of them have been codded incorrectly and dont behave as intended. This is a very minor oversight and really does nothing to take away from the game. It just messes with my OCD. Also hellfire is OP.			"

												FIrst it's about the level then it's about the loot. This game is really fun and is similar to a fallout co op. There are heaps of missions to do for hours and hours of gameplay but most of those are a little grindy. The main missions are great and it's something really worth playing with a friend or even a group. Solo it's not as fun as this game was designed for co op and is honestly one of the best modern co op games today. For a game made in 2009 there are some things that are annoying such as having to constantly pick up ammo and walk/drive back and forth between places without insta fast travel. The storyline is pretty good and dlc adds pretty much double the game play and is worth the extra cash you paid. It's not useless DLC just get the goty edition on sale and have a blast. Don't compare this to the second one because the second one is just amazing. FPS Diablo 8.5/10			"

												FPS, aRPG, Co-op, AWESOME.The latter is the best description to this game.A perfect combination of Perk-based aRPG and Shooter (sans the aim twitching that a lot of shooters require, which makes this game far more ""approachable"") put in a blender with less than relevant NPCs, shallow and non-intrusive story and freaky enemies trying to skin your face to wear as a mask, added with some gore and ten tons of blood. That's Borderlands for you.And it's multiplayer mode is the best thing since sliced bread, to the point that some people claim this is one of those games that can't be fully enjoyed by yourself, playing solo. Well I say these people should be hung in a rope of Skag guts and left to rot under the scorching sun of Pandora, then respawned at a New-U station and beat to death with a Midget Psycho's arm - only to be revived yet another time and thrown again into the pit-fight/rat-race madness that is the planet's looming backdrop. Alone or with friends, this game is awesome.			"

												This is an FPS RPG. Sounds awesome, right? Well, it is. It apparently has a multiplayer feature, but I haven't used it, at least not yet. But I've had plenty of fun on my own.While Borderlands 2 is crisper aesthetically, funnier overall and polished better than this one, I think I've had just a bit more fun playing Borderlands 1. Enemies aren't quite as bullet-sponge-y as they are in Borderlands 2 and the risk versus reward is better in general.I'd say a $30 price tag is pretty reasonable for the GOTY version of this game. If you are bothered by the $30 price tag, wait for it to go on sale. Just note that it doesn't go on sale very often, at least in my experience.			"

												Borderlands is the first game of the Borderlands trilogy and it's an ok start to the series. This FPS with RPG elements a is stupid and violent looter shooter, so if that's your thing, grab yourself a friend (or 3) and fight your way through the deserted, eponymous, cel shaded Borderlands of Pandora, quite honestly a ♥♥♥♥ hole of a planet, as one of four classes.Pros:-One playthrough (with all DLC except the arenas) can last up to 60 hours depending on how thorough you complete quests-Playable in coop with up to 3 friends-4 different classes with unique skills, each with 3 skill trees you can combine after your hearts content-Effectively an endless amount of weapons with some juicy abilities-Big and diverse world-Action packed fights-Graphics-HumourCons:-Some bugs and glitches-Some quests may be repetitive-Depending on your equipment there can be segments which are full of bullet sponges and tough to get through-Story is pretty much non-interactive-Quite some DLC-Graphics-HumourPersonal opinion:Borderlands is an ok game as far as I'm concerned. If you're a diehard fan of the Borderlands series, then why don't you have it already? If you are looking for a good entry into the series, I'd recommend to start with Borderlands 2. Sure, there are some characters in Borderlands 2 that you would know a little bit more about if you played the first one, and some areas would be cool to go back to, but the second part is just way better rounded out and honestly, the narrative is not what makes you want to play a Borderlands game. Borderlands hasn't aged all that well, and it's not even all that old. If you can get it cheap, grab yourself a friend and play it, otherwise, there's not much harm in skipping this one. It's not bad, but it's not too great either, especially when there are two newer Borderlands games to choose from.			"

												This game has multiple classes, special graphic style and many secondary quests with pretty good main story.1. StoryIt is not complicated one but it keeps you going. It will definitely take you some time to get to the end of it. The big finale was pretty insteresting eventhough the last fight was very easy, although the boss looked cool. The main story has some twists, but nothing that surprising. It also had some awesome voiceovers, especially the robots :)2. GraphicBorderlands has definitely its own graphic style and even I played this game many years late, I still had no problems with the graphic quality. I had to get used to the style, but never had some major issues.3. GameplayAlright. This one gets a little bit tricky. Some guns on some enemies acted weird and eventhough I hit 100% headshot, I didn't kill the enemy. The guns are pretty fun and it's nice that you have many options and can hold up to 4 guns at the same time. Also some other gears to put on later stage. Eventhough there is the car system and port system, there is going to be a lot of running. You can't go everywhere in your cart and shoot everything easy with it which I really liked because that would be just dumb. The gameplay itself could get sometimes repetetive and even intense because even with really good weapons and headshots it took a lot to kill the enemy and if there was more of them, well, then it was not pleasant. You get respawn though, but it cost you money. The money it cost is calculated on how much money you own at the moment which was nice. Also if you die you actually don't die right away and you get a chance to kill enemy which pops ""second wind"", basicly resurecting you on spot which was very handy. Although there was some weird things with some guns I enjoyed the gun play and the special class skill was also pretty cool.4. Final wordsFinishing this game took some time and I got sometimes a little bit bored, but it kept me going. Only thing what bothered me was that I had to clear some areas over and over again and a lot of running didn't help either. Nice touch is that you some enemies have different weak spots so you just dont go headshot everything. Story was decent and gameplay was enjoyable enough.7/10 - Good game			"

												Borderlands personally is a fascinating video game introducing a different world than any other game with unique elements. I will just write down the points what makes it so great.- A wonderful, competitive, funny and unique FPS. - Various weapons, shields, elements give diversity to the loadoat. - Every coin counts if you want to have all the great stuff (In Bordelands 2 I just use guns I get from bosses, I rarely purchase weapons or other stuff from vending machines).- The story impacted me more than the sequel.- Coop is always so much fun with friends.-Always an opportunity to find a challenge.Despite my subjectivity, I rate it 10/10 because of its uniqueness and success making a colorful and hilarious shooter.MUST TO GET			"

A story that's so light it's hardly there and some clunky console-focused mechanics are annoying, but the core gameplay is good enough to mostly overcome that.Running around and shooting stuff until it dies and loot pops out has never been so fun.Oh, the guns in BL1 are a million times better than in BL2.

												Great game, love every hour I spent playing it. Gameplay is great, feels very rewarding, and the story is entertaining but Borderlands is not mostly based on the storyline. For those of you that have not played Borderlands, its a ""comicbook-like"" shooter. the graphics are bold and in your face, but it makes the game creative and unique. It's very entertaining, and theres always something for you to do. ias you can see, I have over 30 hours in it, and I have not beat the game yet. Although I do have to say, I recommend Borderlands 2 a bit more, everything they lacked in Borderlands One, they made up for in the second game. If Borderlands two had not been created, would rate this game a 9/10 (no games are perfect) Definitely worth the buy!			"

												This game is a masterpiece. With a memorable characters, great humour, beautiful cel-shaded graphics and hours of content, you simple can't go wrong with this game. It's hard to put into words really. This game just has a lot of diverse gameplay with an innovative take on the FPS genre. This rethinking of the genre allows this game to be enjoyable for both casual and hardcore gamers. Its open-world setting allows for hours of exploring (both on foot and in a tank) side-questing, weapon-collecting and just screwing around. To top it off, it has 4-player story co-op (and it's done well). There are also 4 classes to choose from: Beserker, Siren, Hunter and Soldier - each with their own skills and abilities.This game is definitely recommended for lovers of the Bioshock and Fallout series but is also a great place to start for people who are new to the genre.

												FPS, aRPG, Co-op, AWESOME.The latter is the best description to this game.A perfect combination of Perk-based aRPG and Shooter (sans the aim twitching that a lot of shooters require, which makes this game far more ""approachable"") put in a blender with less than relevant NPCs, shallow and non-intrusive story and freaky enemies trying to skin your face to wear as a mask, added with some gore and ten tons of blood. That's Borderlands for you.And it's multiplayer mode is the best thing since sliced bread, to the point that some people claim this is one of those games that can't be fully enjoyed by yourself, playing solo. Well I say these people should be hung in a rope of Skag guts and left to rot under the scorching sun of Pandora, then respawned at a New-U station and beat to death with a Midget Psycho's arm - only to be revived yet another time and thrown again into the pit-fight/rat-race madness that is the planet's looming backdrop. Alone or with friends, this game is awesome.			"

												This is an FPS RPG. Sounds awesome, right? Well, it is. It apparently has a multiplayer feature, but I haven't used it, at least not yet. But I've had plenty of fun on my own.While Borderlands 2 is crisper aesthetically, funnier overall and polished better than this one, I think I've had just a bit more fun playing Borderlands 1. Enemies aren't quite as bullet-sponge-y as they are in Borderlands 2 and the risk versus reward is better in general.I'd say a $30 price tag is pretty reasonable for the GOTY version of this game. If you are bothered by the $30 price tag, wait for it to go on sale. Just note that it doesn't go on sale very often, at least in my experience.			"

												Best game I never realised... Until Now...Borderlands appear to be best played with friends. However, I don't really have any gaming friends and I think no one is playing it anymore since this is a 2008 game and I'm only playing it in 2014, so the lobby right now is empty. It's fun, regardless.Weapon loadout is *Dead Island* confusing... I think Dead Island loadouts were inspired by this... Lots of modifiers to keep each weapon pickup unique and confusing at the same time.**I should have written this review a long time ago but Steam got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at me for getting a refund from the unauthorized transactions that I have been trying to reverse; At least the hacker didn't win this time but my community profile got suspended for 3 months**			"

												Borderlands it's like World of Warcraft with guns, and midgets, and violent psychopaths, and violent psychopath midgets with guns that try to kill you like all the time.No, but really, Borderlands it's a pretty cool First Person RPG with an awesome and well writen story that gets even greater with the DLCs that add at least 20+ hours of gameplay.If you've played Borderlands 2 first you will find Borderlands ""slow"" or rather clumsy compared to it's sequel, but of course it's, Borderlands 2 fixed many things that Borderlands missed, but it's an amazing game on it's own glory and should not be dismissed,Geardbox updated it after all this years when GameSpy was shutdown and integrated it with Steamworks so you and your friendos can party up and wreck up mayhem on Pandora together. It's a fun and entertaining game, alone or with friends, and should be given an oportunity for it's great story, clever humor and countless hours of slaugther and loot party. Give it a go when in sale, the GOTY often goes 5 bucks and it's a cheap grab for many many hours of fun, laughs and murdering.			"

												This game is awesome. Although many people will say that this games sequel ""Borderlands 2"" is the better game, I feel as though both games are equally good, though for their own different reasons. In the original Borderlands, you are thrown into the world of Pandora without knowing anything about it as a player. As you explore the planet, you learn more about the people who live there, as well as grow accustomed to the kind of wildlife that lives there. And you blow it all the hell up. Good times.You play as one of four people: Mordecai: The hunter, Lilith: The siren, Roland: The soldier, and Brick: The Berserker.Mordecai is an expert of long range combat, specializing in sniper rifles. His pet bird Bloodwing assists him in combat by swooping down and attacking enemies with it's claws.Lilith is a Siren Warrior come to Pandora to learn more about her kind. As you progress with her she will enhance her Phase Walking ability in addition to making use of various elemental damage types.Roland is a former Crimson Lance soldier who is now going his own way. He has a special turret he can deploy that guns down enemies for him and restores ally health.Brick is a monsterous wall with legs. Although he is definitly not dumb, he is very simple minded with his approach: Punch everything in the face until it dies. As simple as he thinks however, he is very effective at what he does. If he is ever surrounded by enemies in a locked room, he is not trapped in the room with them, they are trapped in the room with him. He specializes in explosive weapons and anything that packs a punch.Each of these characters is a vault hunter, searching for the mythical Vault on Pandora. The Vault is said to contain countless ritches, enough money to grant it's owner fame, political power, and women (Or in a womans case, men). Guided by a mysterious being called ""The Guardian Angel"" or just Angel for short, they travel across Pandora collecting pieces of the Vault Key to find and open the vault before time runs out and it seals for another 200 years.With your character of choice, you will gradually grow in level as each enemy you kill grants you EXP. As you gain levels, you will gain SP to spend on character specific skills and perks. These skills could be anything from giving your melee attack an elemental effect to increasing how fast you shoot bullets. Each character has 3 trees to choose from, and each tree has different possibilities for different builds. Even two people playing as the same character will be different in capabilities.What's really important though, is the guns. Guns are all over the place on this planet, and they are all yours for the looting. As you travel across the planet, you will occasionally find chests containing guns in them. You can also upgrade your grenades with Grenade mods, allowing you to change them in different ways like leeching enemy health to give to you to setting them on fire. Guns can also drop from things you kill, and you will sometimes find gun loot rooms filled to the brim with chests. Don't expect to find these rooms without earning them though, whether it be by completing a long quest chain or beating a powerful boss. If you aren't having luck with finding a good gun, you could always try buying one from one of Marcus's vending machines. You can also buy Ammo if you aren't finding enough on your journey.The music in this game is fantastic. It's hard to describe, but I guess a try would be that it's a kind of orchastral environmental music. It's beautiful while you are exploring and dramatic while you are in combat. It fits perfectly with the theme of the game, and is definitly worth a listen.The visuals are fantastic too. Everything uses a cartoony cell-shaded look that makes the game look rather timeless. Originally, the game was going to be very realistic in appearence, but they decided on this look instead. Although the original concept video showing these realistic graphics was impressive looking and visually stunning, I am glad they went with this look, not only because it still looks great and will for a much longer time but also because the humorious theme that the borderlands franchise has taken on fits with this visual style much better.The story is simple but well written. The characters you meet are interesting and likable, while the enemies you kill are satisfying to overcome. It doesn't just feel like you are shooting things all the time, you are immersed in the experience, you are a vault hunter overcoming challenges and proving yourself to the world as you search for the vault. You go from being just some stranger to everyone that is going to get yourself killed to a great hero that most everyone respects or fears.Back to my earlier comparison to Borderlands 2, the sequal to the original game that started it all does bring many improvements to the gameplay, such as improved visuals, greater exploration over a larger area, an even better story, etc. But for what it is, Borderlands the original is still a fantastic experience that I can easily recommend to anyone who likes first person shooters. If I had to give any advice, I would say play Borderlands 2 first, If you like Borderlands 2, then give the original a try. This way you will not judge Borderlands 2 by what you experienced in Borderlands 1 in the event that it's not your thing.			"

												This game is one of a kind, bringing RPG and Shooter together with its great art style and crude humor. You can choose between 4 different characters, all with different stats and abilities, and then you go on an epic adventure of loot and battles which will blow your mind and keep you busy for hours.I would like to go over some problems the game has, though.No FOV slider- If you want to change your FOV, you have to go into the files and add your own hotkey for changing it. This problem was resolved in Borderlands 2 +No fast travelling to DLC areas- You can only fast travel to the starting area of a DLC, so if you are really far into the DLC you can't fast travel to your current quests are, you have to walk all the way there. This doesn't seem like a huge deal but when you are trying to farm bosses or something it gets super ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This problem was resolved in Borderlands 2 +No official mod support- This is a problem with all Borderlands games, they are almost un modable. Borderlands 1 is probably the most modable of the 3, but even thats pretty eh. Hopefully the next game has official mod support.Story- Most people complain that this game doesn't really have a story. I don't care since I don't spend the hundreds of hours I've spent in Borderlands for the story. But even then, it does have a story behind, the problem being that it tells most of it is told through text whenever you accept or hand in a quest. This problem is resolved in Borderlands 2 + though.The challenges- This is another problem fixed within the new Borderlands. Borderlands has a challenge system, which is much better in Borderlands 2 + with its badass ranks and stuff. In borderlands 1 its only really used to earn extra xp, but some of the challenges are ridiculous to complete. Like, for example, Winning 1000 duels. This means that you have to sit there for hours, winning duels with another player over and over and over again just to complete it. Luckily there is no achievement to complete every challenge in this game.Being someone who has played Borderlands since it first came out in 2009 (On Xbox), I think its fair to say that I am a pretty hardcore Borderlands fan. I would highly recommend every single Borderlands game to anyone interested in shooters or RPGs.			"

												This game was and will always be amazing.I have put almost a thousand hours into this game (most of which were off-steam) because it just keeps giving back. The Cooperative experience is where this game lives.  Playing alone will give only half the perspective. With a full party of four, this game goes places.  Much time will be spent clamoring over weapons and equipment. Sometimes the team will spend an hour just having a good time with the vehicle physics. Other times will be lulled waiting in towns and for shops to restock. When taken beyond the game's limit, Vehicles will be dropped through the map, superior parkour through entire levels and completely irrelevant adventures made by developer's mistake.  The game is just so engrossing, whether it is played as intended or off the record.Some people may ask how I manage to spend so much time on a single game. I ask myself the same question. Glancing back, it's hard to imagine. Looking back, I reminisce of good times.			"
