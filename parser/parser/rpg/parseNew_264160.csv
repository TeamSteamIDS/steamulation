												The most appealing part of this game for me is the smooth transition between action and strategy. You can be running down a hallway and mowing down goblins, then suddenly you're inches away from a giant, sifting through your inventory and trying to decide which item is the most likely to prevent his club from crushing your skull. Do you have a sleeping potion to throw at him? Maybe this unidentified scroll can teleport you to safety? Your wand of polymorphing might turn him into something that can't wield a club...Looting is another big part of the game that stands out for me. Almost every enemy drops something, often many somethings. My inner hoarder loves when I've finished slaughtering a battallion of gnomes and find myself standing knee-deep in daggers, various wands, and a pile of tiny outfits. You have a fair bit of inventory space, and it's surprising how fast this can fill up with scrolls, potions, books, gems, weapons, rings/amulets, armors, foods, etc. Then you have to decide what you want to identify, sell, drink, read, or keep for emergencies. Don't get me wrong though, having hundreds of items and unlimited time to think doesn't make the game get any easier as you go further down. Enemies become stronger and spawn more quickly, until you're fighting your way through waves of liches, giants, skeletons and demons. Your stockpile of healing items, wands and scrolls can be quickly depleted if you don't plan ahead or if you just have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ luck. Beating the bosses and making it back to the top is a major accomplishment, one that you'll only experience after you have a good grasp on how things work and what the best ways to approach situations are. Even then it's still a rather rare experience, especially with the most difficult characters.There are only a few games that I can say I've put hundreds of hours into, and I'm proud to say that this is one of them.TL;DR - Replayability, looting, inventory-management, strategy.

												WazHack is a new take on roguelikes, but don't let the graphics fool you, this game has a lot more depth to it than you can imagine.WazHack is a 2D roguelike heavily inspired by NetHack. If you're a fan of NetHack then you'll immediately find yourself at home as the game mechanics are pretty similar to the old classic. This game is basically a 2D turn based game. Time only passes when you move or take action, so you can take your time and plan ahead to your hearts content.This game is hard like any other roguelike out there, so if you're not into hard or challenging games, then don't pick it up. You'll have a pretty good time trying to get past that 300 feet mark or to survive the depths without dying of starvation.The game also features over 300 different items, and every time you die all the items/potions/weapons/armor will be randomly generated and have different stats. There are also several different classes to chose from and both the male and female version of the class start with different equipment. Playing as a wizard can be extremely hard, but it's also a lot more rewarding later on into the game.WazWaz has been the lone developer of this game for a very long time already and he has done a phenomenal job so far. Some people might be put off by the ""grotesque"" or ""lacking"" graphics, but hey, you're playing a roguelike here. It's not like graphics matter when you are looking at a genre based around depth in gameplay and game mechanics.Take your time, plan ahead, always carry with you some items which can help you escape (like teleport scrolls or wands) and learn from your mistakes,you'll soon come out victorious! And remember: dying is part of the ""fun"".			"

												The hack in the name is worthy of the original nethack... this game is amazing if you are into oldschool roguelikes and the 2D representation of the action is nice and endearing and makes it a charm to follow your adventure until you hit another untimely death. But the fun is in how far you can get and what you can amass this next time around....			"

												Let's see. I was gifted this game for Christmas by a friend and I've played 78 hours in less than a week. That should tell you something. This game is digital crack, it's that addictive. I'm low on sleep and my left eye has a nervous twitch now but who cares? It's back into the dungeon for me. I highly recommend this to those that like true roguelike games such a Nethack or Tales of Maj'Eyal and/or dungeon crawlers in general. In short this game is just pure fun.Pros: The game is like peeling the layers of an onion. It seems easy to get into, but then you die. And die again. And huh, how about that, I died again. Before long you find new things about the game. Then more new things. And more. And then you start doing better and hey, I may just beat this game after all. Thinking is required to win. You can hack away and have fun, but to stay alive and win you must use everything you have. Tons of items, content, creatures, equipment. Lot's of cool hidden little things to find out. Very good graphics and engine for a game like this. The semi-realtime works perfectly and is a great innovation.Cons: Caution: Requires willpower to force yourself to take a break to eat or sleep. If you're like me you may not be able to tear yourself away from the game. "

(Actually it is both: turn-based or action; as you like)You will find all of this.You will also find different characters and many items to loot from.I was even able to contact the creator of this game and we shared a few Emails. I can highly recommend this game. Not only will it take you a while to beat, it also has a very high replayvalue, as the dungeons, mobs and items are generated randomly for each playtrhough.			"

												I've played this game more than any other I own. More than Kerbal Space Program, even. I love it! It takes Rogue, turns it into a 2D side-scroller, and does an amazing job of it. It'll even make you laugh sometimes, even though it mercilessly kills you over and over again. I think I played for 100 hours before getting past 1000 ft. 300 before seeing claiming the Amulet of Zaw, and another 100 before I could actually bring it back to the surface. I don't think I've ever better spent money on a game.			"

												I originally bought this game when it was released on Desura close to 2 years ago, and have put many hours into it.It's a ""pseudo-turn-based"" game, where you can run around with the WASD keys like a platformer, but enemies/NPC's only move and attack while your moving and attacking. While you are not doing anything, neither is the enemy. In a way, it's kinda like FTL in that regard. Kinda.For those familiar with roguelikes, Wazhack, as the name suggests, takes a lot of inspiration from Nethack, to the point where it might be easier to describe it  ""2.5D Nethack"". You can see it in the items; the way they are identified, cursed, blessed, enchanted, etc..That's not to say that it's a clone though, Wazhack has MANY of it's own features that I don't want to spoil for everyone, and even has branch dungeons and many different enemy models and spells.There's even going to be a multiplayer like feature, though not in the traditional sense.If you like roguelikes, Wazhack is definitely one to pick up.EDIT: I hadn't played this game for about 5 months, and the game is even better than it was back then. Loads of new content, including items, events and even classes were added. There's also been even more balance changes. The game was far more fair than Nethack ever was, and now even more so. Just the right amount of fairness and challenge.For beginners, the Barbarian/Vandal is a great class to start with due to their high health, damage, and starting weapon. You'll have trouble finding armor due to their large size, but their high health makes up for it. By the way, you can tell if your Barbarian/Vandal can use armor if the armor in question has something along the lines of 'very large' in parenthesis underneath it's name.The only thing I really consider bad in this game is the pet AI(every class starts with a pet). While it's certainly leagues better than Nethacks, they're terrible when it comes to running across ladders, though they're better now than the last time I've played. I also wish you could set their aggressiveness like in Torchlight 2. Honestly, they're not all that useful, but they're nice company in that lonely dungeon. I also wish you could choose which pet to take, rather than each class having it's own pet, though I understand the reason behind that.For those who want to try before buying, go to it's Desura page here: http://www.desura.com/games/wazhackOn that page, click the blue ""Free"" button next to demo. If you don't want to use Desura, simple click the Free Button and look for the link that says ""Download Direct"", and you'll be able to download the standalone demo installer.			"

												I have played this game extensively outside of Steam and can confirm that it is the best 'nethacklike' I've played (and I have played a fair few). Don't let the graphics or sound put you off from this, it really is a game worth playing and has a large amount of content in a very playable format. It captures the very random elements that a roguelike should have very well and will have you laughing and wtfing quite a lot!			"

												I havent had this much fun since 1989. So after many hours I took down the end boss. I thought it will now be easy to get back to the top. Well, all of hell came down on me. My heart was pounding after all my heal potions were gone and I was left with little health to make it out. With an epic dash I got out for the win. Whats the big deal some might say. The big deal is that you can invest 6hrs in the game only to lose it all. There is no old save to fall back on. Its old school perma death. Aside from the main quest and the chance of dying a few hundred times the game has many cool extras. Such as the chance to find epic loot like the classic Excaliber or some good old +3boots of speed. There are also a few optional bosses as well, like the God of Wine or the Gnome King, each with their own side dungeon. Not to mention the fact that you can also have your brain sucked out by a mindflayer!!! Great Game!!!			"

												I love it!I've known it existed for ages, and presumably dismissed it, including when on sale. I picked it up in a recent weekly sale on a whim, and I'm glad I did.I find there is something charming about the graphics, it reminds me of 90's prerendered 3D sprites or something, and has some cute item physics and corpse ragdoll.Sound effects are adequate, although the small amount of music quickly led me to turning it off.The mobile version is also surprisingly good and controls well, and you can play the first few levels for free if you insist on trying it before you buy.But the most important thing is the gameplay, randomisation and discovery, and that's where it shines as a true rogue-like. At first you have no idea how to deal with all the different items, but with each run you learn a bit more, and discover a little more of the hidden attributes, details and interactions. Sometimes I find this kind of hidden information frustrating, but so far in WazHack the discovery and new possibilities you learn has been really fun.I'm informed that WazHack takes a lot of inspiration from NetHack, and while I've played various rogue-likes, and a lot of Angband (which I finally beat recently), I never really played NetHack. I like WazHack enough that I'm thinking I probably should have played NetHack more, but for now I expect to enjoy a lot more hours in WazHack.			"

												A cartoony tribute to the RNG gods. Same feel as classic 80's rogue, but with 90's Three Dee Grafix. It feels like most development energy went into the engine, custom graphics, and classes/skills. There's also some well aged cheese around, for those who make the appropriate temporal sacrifice.If you strongly identify with the @ character on your keyboard, stick with nethack. If you need to be graphicsed at for immersion, get a modern ""roguelike"" rather than a real rogue variant like this one.Pros: Classic feel. Skills / talents are interesting. Classes are pretty well-balanced. Blends in some modern mechanics, while keeping to the genre. Good cheese. No spoon-feeding. Cons: Could use more content. It isn't as rich in items and monsters as many rogue variants (nethack, angband, moria, and tome), or as other modern ""roguelikes"" that don't stick to the classic formula. Unique monsters would be nice.			"

												A truly underrated Gemfirst i will talk a little about the game and then write the pros and consWazhack is a roguelike nuff said, every playtrought the items are randomized, that means that leather glove that did nothing in your last game perphaps this time it is a power glove that looks just like a useless leather glove.or that milky potion that healed you, perphaps it now is an acid potion ouch.In Wazhack your objective is to get to the bottom of the Dungeon and grab the fabled amulet of zaw and then come back up and end your journey. Make no mistake though getting said amulets will require hours and hours of effort into learning strategies/game mechanics so you can increase your odds of survival.The RNG isn`t unfair in this game, that said in some runs you may get ultimate items on the first floor or in another room more than half of the stuff you pick up is cursed(cursed means the item will probably do something you hate like for instance if it is an equipment it will be glue to you, if it is a potion the effect will be diminished) BUT make no mistake a good player is capable of prevailing against odds if he knows what he is doing.There are tons of classes each with a diferent playstyle, you have wizards,rogues,archers,knights and the variants like barbarian(a big warrior that has issues to wear armor due to his big size).about equipments, it is possible to equip 2 rings,1 cape,boots,gloves,armor and a helmet(just like any rpg you ever played)now for some PROS and CONSPros-Huge replayability(look my playtime)-Interesting game mechanics(won`t spoil much find about it yourselves)-Randomized dungeon/items assures you no playtrought will be the same-Has Online coop-You can save during the gameCons-Huge difficulty(your first tries will always be failures, unless you know what you are doing the game can be pretty unfair at times)-There are no diferent difficulties to the game(in other words you can`t choose between easy,medium,hard, the game has only 1 difficulty setting)Neutral-It is a roguelike so every run you only get one life-The only thing you carry over trought playtroughs is your intelligence(in other words you should learn from your mistakes and always strive to go deeper)With all that said, i truly enjoyed wazhack, and i had a blast playing it with a friend it is only one of the few games in my library that i have invested soo much time, for an indie game developed by just one guy i truly i got way more than my moneys worth.If you are a fan of roguelikes buy this, if you are a fan of rpgs buy this, but if the idea of permadeath turns you off you should play stay away from this game			"

												Visually okay, controls are adequate but enough annoyances to remove the fun pretty quick.  Rogue-like perma-death I understand and expected.   But this is a game where the designers exercise arbitrary control over every choice you can make, and it isn't the better for their choices. The mechanics and the attack/spell visuals for all the different ""classes"" are the same.  Their starting stats are pretty much all the same.   And limited by the game -why?  If I want to play a wizard with Intelligence 13 and Strength 15, or a barbarian with constitution 9 and wisdom 16 - why stop me?  The character may die faster, but that's my choice.  And it might make starting a new character every 15 minutes a bit more interesting.  Or at least give the illusion of player control.But when my pet dies from MY attacks (because I have no control over it and it won't attack but also won't move away?)  I get tired of that pretty quickly.   When you pass a side door the game asks ""Investigate Yes/No?"" but your answer doesn't matter- either way the monsters come out. In large numbers.  Behind you.   Right on top of your pet, if they're still alive.  (Yeah, every time over at least 20 rounds of play...wth?) When one of my characters dies because a merchant insists I pay for damages from a dwarf attacking ME - and I sell them everything I'd collected, then try to run - and go through every healing I have, a speed potion, all of my attacks,  and even lead the merchant through a trap (which zaps me but doesn't affect the merchant).   And perhaps I wouldn't really mind that if at least it was my character who had broken the merchant's goods!Was it exciting for two minutes? Yes.   Did I make me want to try again?  No.   That's where this game falls on it's face.I don't expect a game to be fair, and games can be arbitrary - up to a point.  But if you want my time there has to be something about it that's rewarding to me.   If there is nothing under my control as the player that can change the presentation of the game, the mechanics, or the outcome then why give you my time?Torchlight on insta-death mode offers much greater variety of classes, skills, creatures, customizations, mods and settings.

The game covers every classic element (now including genies/gods/prayer!)It has a unique co-op mode which I have now played many times.

												This is hands down one of my favourite roguelikes that has come about from the commercial resurgence of the genre. A 2d homage to nethack, turn based but with fluid enough controls that you might forget it's turnbased. Which will obviously result in your death. As far as I know, this is not one of the roguelikes where you have persistant unlocks, the only thing you gain between one run to the next is knowledge (and some achievement type stuff).I find wazhack to be very addictive and extremely uncompromising. This is a proper roguelike with 2d graphics and a decently clean and simple UI. Like all faithful roguelikes, time invested is not necessarily related to success. You might never beat this game ever, or you might beat it on your first run. The controls and straightforward interface makes this very accessible, this is an excellent representation of the genre that can and will challenge long-time enthusiasts, but can also be easily picked up by somebody who is new to this type of game.

												An interesting little permadeath rogue-like game, it seemed promising at first.  There are over a dozen classes to choose from, each with a skill tree with unique (or at least varied) skills to level up to improve your chosen character.  Along the way I'd run into leprechauns and psychadelic fountains that caused the entirety of my game to look like I was tripping on acid while I did battle with floating shapes and swirling colors.Unfortunately, the game quickly gets old.  In reality, the characters don't -feel- much different from one another once you're in the dungeon.  Unlike other rogue-likes, where you will die and go, ""Oh man!  I should've done <enter alternative course of action here>"" and give the game another go, I felt frustrated more than anything with this particular game.  It seemed like all too often my death was unrelated to anything done on my part and more of a roll of the die that resulted in an overpowered monster showing up or a weapon that was cursed that I never had the opportunity to uncurse on that particular run.In the end, the game isn't -bad- persay.  I might even install it and give it another go in the future when I'm feeling bored.  I don't recommend this game, however, because there are far better rogue-likes out there to play that are more fun and have a much longer longevity to them.  If you do decide to pick this up, get it when it's on sale!			"

												Before buying this game I had already lost hundreds of brave heroes in unNetHack, an extended version of NetHack that added new areas, enemies, etc. When I saw WazHack my first thought was that it would be like a graphical version of the game I had experience with, and to an extent this game is a graphical version of NetHack. But to call this game NetHack with graphics doesn't do it justice. The game takes a lot of the basic features of NetHack such as cursed/uncursed/blessed items, spells that are forgotten over time, and the ability to make an army of pets to fight to the death for you and adds to them or changes them in ways that make it a fresh experience. Giving too many details would ruin the fun of discovering the game's secrets but  pets that have died don't have to stay dead! While I was initially disappointed that certain features from NetHack weren't in this game such as digging through walls or bones levels; I find that once I get started on a character I don't even think to compare the games: I am too busy enjoying this one.Overall: 10/10 would lose entourage to green dragon at depth ~1400 again.

												One of the biggest surprises of last year for me and easily one of my games of 2013. Wazhack is an unusual roguelike (like, a real roguelike, not a roguelike-like) because not only does it feature full 3D animated visuals, lighting and physics, it’s also a side-scroller instead of the traditional top-down fare.Wazhack wasn't one of my games of 2013 just for its unusual appearance for a roguelike though, I loved it so much because it was the source of many an unexpected and grim tale (as roguelikes often are) thanks to its careful, tactical play and many emergent systems and mechanics. Here are a few choice screenshots from my time with the Android version, complete with anecdotal captions:http://imgur.com/a/hpm80Wazhack is full of these moments and often ones that aren't so easy to relay in single screenshots.Granted, the game's graphics are very… particular, and certainly not for everyone (I personally find them really charming and they look tactile as if they've been handmade), but because everything is in 3D the game can afford certain luxuries that a frame-by-frame pixel art roguelike can't, so for example you can see what gear enemies are wearing and wielding at a glance, while your own character’s appearance changes depending on what you equip. When you sell stuff, you also see it populating the shopkeeper’s shelves, racks, pots and busts (which is a really neat touch). And of course the physics and lighting work with the 3D too: loot explodes and tumbles from enemies, their limp bodies slump and slide, amulets around your neck jostle about, lit lamps illuminate your way, arrows ricochet off surfaces (and can be retrieved), capes flap and fall (yes, there are capes in Wazhack). It's just nice to play a roguelike that can be easily read.Wazhack is absolutely worth your time if you’re wanting something that's meaty and rich that you can play in short (or long) bursts. It's ideal on handheld devices too. The original PC version here looks a lot better and is easier to use with mouse and keyboard, but the Android and iOS versions are portable gems in their own right.It's also worth mentioning that Waz (the developer) has been improving and adding to Wazhack since it was released back in 2012 and only recently he added another 8 classes and overhauled the talent system!TL:DR - Charming, solidly designed, accessible, deceptively deep, surprising, extremely challenging and replayable, funny, tactical and just bags of fun, Wazhack is a bit of a desert island game for me now and one of the genre’s best kept secrets. The game is available on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS and can even be played (and trialled) in your browser at: http://www.wazhack.com/play.			"

												Highly recommended with one caveat:Be prepared to die. A lot.That you'll (very, very) often die in unexpected and hilarious ways may or may not make the game more attractive to you. The game is, in essence, Nethack with a slightly fancier graphic interface. Don't be fooled by this into thinking you're playing anything but a turn-based game, however. If you stop, the action stops. As the tagline says you have ""all the time in the world"" and that's true as far as it goes. You're free to walk away from the PC for an hour while an angry Dwarf Lord is staring you in the face, axe poised to cleave your skull in two, and rest assured that he'll still be there when you return, just as short and belligerent as he was when you left.The classes you have to choose from run from the rather humdrum Knight to the ever-faithful Wizard to a singing Bardess, each of whom is endowed with the sort of standard STR, CHA, DEX etc. attributes common to most dungeon-themed games. The starting attributes can be tweaked, to an extent, but each character has certain minimums/maximums in each category that cannot be exceeded. Likewise your alignment can be changed, but again only to an extent. Not all characters can be played as ""Chaotic Evil"", for instance.The game itself is set up as a simple dungeon, into which depths you must descend in increments of 100 feet, with 3 floors per ""level"". Enemies will scale both according to level depth, and according to your character's current attributes and abilities. The strong you get, and the deeper you go, the tougher enemies you can expect to encounter. The entire dungeon consists of 3000 feet, i.e. 90 floors to explore, at the bottom of which you'll encounter one of several varieties of the game's main Boss.To help you get there you'll have an inventory in which you can store a limited amount of items and equipment such as spells, potions, armor, weapons, food and magical items. How much you can carry is determined by your CON attribute, and as this varies from character to character you'll find that different characters require different strategies in terms of what you'll decide to hold onto and what you'll have to discard. Your Barbarian or Vandal may be able to hold on to an astounding number of items, but your White Witch will find herself quickly over-encumbered and see her attack speed and movement speed reduced as a result. Choose wisely, in other words, both your character and their possessions.The inventory is/can be quite large, but since you're playing a turn-based game there's nothing stopping you from taking what time you need to sort through it. By default the game allows you to sort items by weight at the click of a button, or to sort by category such as ""tools"" etc., in the same way. There are also items to be found in-game that can give you the ability to sort by ""value"" or the like, but access to these isn't guaranteed.Combat is performed by either magical or physical means. You have the standard health and mana meters, which will scale both according to your character's level and are also dependent on a few other factors such as potions/drinks or various things and places you can interact with as you progress. Spellbooks abound, as do various wands, all flavored toward ""evil"" or ""good"" uses, as well as ""dark"" and ""light"" magic. Your ability to use these and the strength of the corresponding effect are seperate attributes that are improved with use, and they are mutually exclusive of one another, meaning if you increase your ability to perform ""light"" magic you will lessen the maximum possible ability that you could obtain in ""dark"" magic, or vice versa. Weapons range from the humble staff to the mighty Excalibur to your bare fists, if you're so inclined. Weapon proficiencies, like those of spellcasting, are increased as you use a given weapon category such as Bows or Two-Handed swords or staves and so on. Some enemies are more susceptible to magical attacks than physical, while some operate on the reverse principle. Knowing what to use against a given enemy comes through trial and error, and in this game ""error"" means a quick and not necessarily painless death.There are various NPCs spread throughout the dungeon, though their number, the cost of their services, and their attitude toward you and your quest are all  dependent, at least in part, on your particular character's CHA skill. A higher CHA means more NPCs, so again some characters can expect to be able to take advantage of more variety of services than others.The game also includes two ""side areas"" in every dungeon. Their location is somewhat randomized, but there is always a Gnomish Mine to the left and a Roman Fort to the right. When or if you decide to go in them is entirely optional, although the Mines provide some very useful resources for the late game. The Roman Fort is often avoided entirely, as most players consider it to be far more difficult to complete then the base game, and I tend to agree. I only enter the fort *after* I've completed the full 3000 foot base challenge, and only then if I'm feeling very powerful and am prepared to die in a hail of arrows if I make a single mistake.The game is difficult, to be sure. Many say exceedingly so, and the word ""impossible"" comes up rather often in conversations dealing with the game. If perma-death isn't your thing you should probably avoid this at all costs, but if you're prepared for a challenging environment, a large variety of enemies, and a moderately healthy dose of RNG, you could do a lot worse than Wazhack. Personally I enjoy the hell out of it, deaths at 100 feet from club-wielding Kobolds notwithstanding. My first success didn't come until I'd clocked 100 hours in the game, but by then I was well hooked and a taste of victory only prompted me to try again with a new class, and a new strategy.If you do try it, above all keep in mind that despite the graphical interface this is 100% a turn-based game. Don't get suckered into thinking you have to rush anything. When you encounter difficulty stop, look through your inventory and give some thought to what item or scroll or potion or wand, etc, will offer you the best chance at coming out of the fight alive. Sometimes you won't discover anything that will work for certain, and you'll be reduced to quaffing a random, unidentified potion in the hopes that it will heal you, or zapping the enemy with an unidentified wand in the hopes that he'll just die already, but other times you'll realize that the key to survival is right there in your pocket, and then you can congratulate yourself and move on, probably right  into the face of an even worse enemy.Enjoy!

												A challenging game that quite obviously resembles Nethack, but this is fine; the game is its own entity, using its 2.5d design to its advantage and adding genuinely unique and fun aspects that you won't find in any other roguelike. Certainly better than Vulture, even though it's seven dollars more (Vulture is supposed to be free, people, don't buy that piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥from Steam. Waz has said on the WazHack subreddit that he has update 1.3 slated for April with a bunch of sweet features, can't wait! Can't recommend this enough. Wait for a sale if you must, but I believe that $10 is a perfectly fine price to ask for for the amount of content and fun that you're getting. Perfect if you're getting bored of Dungeons of Dredmor (another game I highly recommend) and/or want a bigger challenge.			"

												Wazhack is an amazing game. From one guy who worked on Nethack, Wazhack is a side-scroll pseudo-version of Nethack. The gameplay is intuitive and simplified. The graphics aren't on par with games like crysis, but I've easily sunk 100 times the play time in this game than I have Crysis because it's FUN! You'll find that the gems of the game aren't right on the surface. Indeed, it is seemingly just a side-scroll roguelike (or roguelite or roguelike-like for people concerned with semantics). But Waz didn't just make a smash monster, grab loot game. There's unique ways of identifying items, unique combinations of item/spell usage, and unique tactics for various situations. Many of the concepts in Wazhack were carried over from Nethack, but it avoids being quite as complex. I found myself engrossed in this game when I had it on tablet (more so than many other roguelikes) and it still makes an excellent PC game (for casual or serious dungeon runs). If you like roguelikes, roguelike-likes, or roguelites, I can't recommend this game enough. Just try the free browser demo on Wazhack.com and see for yourself!			"

												I've been playing Wazhack for about 8 months and it has really become one of my favorite games of all time. I was fairly new to rogue-likes at the time- I had only really delved into the survival genre (UnReal World and Cataclysm: DDA) after becoming perma-death obsessed through playing Don't Starve and FTL, but I had stayed away from hardcore dungeon crawlers and *hack games. I've since played nethack and other dungeon rogue-likes, but I just keep coming back to Waz. It's so simple to play compared to other rogue-likes in this genre because of the more tangible graphics and absence of the constant need to input keyboard commands.Don't let the user-friendly design and graphics put you off if you are a true rogue-like fan, as this is not a ""rogue-lite"" at all, but a full-on hardcore adventure complete with emergent gameplay and those grand educational experiences (death, death, and more death) that you expect from these games. Your have the same overall controls over your character that you do in nethack, all items are unidentified, scroll names are obfuscated (again, just like nethack), and like half of the items are cursed. It might not have some of the features of nethack (religion is absent, at least in the form it has in nethack, and there aren't as many classes) but I wouldn't be surprised if the dev worked that stuff in eventually as it seems development is ongoing. It used to be a good bit easier than nethack (actually got the amulet once but died soon after...didn't ascend) but it appears the dev has ramped up the difficulty in more recent updates and I'm having trouble consistently getting characters to 600 ft.Some people criticize the graphic style but I don't mind it and actually find it amusing. Same goes for sound but it does its job. rogue-likes have never been known for graphics and sound anyway.  If you don't know anything about rogue-likes, this would be a great place to start as it's a ""real"" rogue-like in a user friendly package that gives you easy acces to the ""core experience"" of this genre.

												This is the best Rouge-like by far.  It is true to the old mainframe games in spirit (how many of you even remember a main frame?) while being updated for the 2000s in terms of graphics and playability.  Your character is no longer a ampersand!   Insanely fun and addicting.  Also frustrating when you make a silly mistake and die, but that is what a Rouge-like is supposed to be.   Many mysteries to solve.   The new release, V. 1.3 adds new ones.  Not that I ever stopped playing 1.2, but the update has me further addicted.  Overall, very well done.   This is easily my favorite game.			"

												Writing my first review, and for a game like wazhack, its hard to give anything but good feedback. I was looking up different rougue games that gave me the same feel of being thrown into a dungeon and left for dead that the original nethack game gives you, and this was the perfect compliment. I've been recently playing nethack on vulture before i found this and what a great surprise! Combining the easy feel of platform games with the rougue like gaming on seemingly endless map scenarios. My favorite thing is how they have kept to the title name with the naming system. I was hoping for some prayers because they help you out of some sticky situations in the original game and the lack of the pickaxe for crushing walls is to bad but other then that its true to the original with so many classes to choose from and random levels, it offers great replayabilty which is somthing I often look for in a game.So overall I would have to say that it a good 9 out of 10 for me.

												WazHack is a gamers game -buy at your own risk. Addictive, expansive, and difficult. There is a free demo you can play online, google search it and get hooked. Then, give the Waz his due and slay that dragon. I bet you can't, but after 40 hours and 100+ attempts, I did. So stop whining about the last time you drank or touched the wrong thing, pick a class and steel yourself for death... well, death and the dizziness that comes from killing hundreds of kobolds and rats without blinking. Controller Support is solid - my logitech gamepad worked fine without the aid of a third party key emulator. You will need to type and select things on occasion, so don't get too far away from the keyboard. The learning curve can be steep but rewarding. Tons of replay value with different classes. My only criticism would be it could have a stronger narrative and UI.Without giving away too much, let me leave you with this advice: don't be afraid to pour/throw/dip/rub/apply/etc. Just don't pour acid on your pet boxer puppy, trust me, you'll feel like a real prick. In my defense I didn't know it was acid...Ultimately, I give ""WazHack"" 8.5/10, would turn self into dwarf lord again.			"

												It was a good game a year ago and I've seen nothing but improvements.  The game is a bit easy as far as roguelikes go but people coming from Hack&Slash games like Diablo might find it difficult (you're expected to run from some enemies).  The game takes a lot of what was fun about Nethack and the graphics make everything easily readable but it also takes some of the arbitrary things that made a wiki a must have for nethack.			"

												Its a traditional roguelike. If youve played one, you know how they work. Unidentified potions, scrolls, random magic items, monsters, one keypress is a turn, ect. This is pretty standard, neither as expansive as ADoM or (Z)Angband, with all the races, caves, world, item permutations, monsters and so forth that those games have. Compared to many other 90s and later roguelikes, its pretty simple. 8 classes, each with a male and female type and a pet (the pet is not pickable - each class has their pet). Male and female types are slightly different and have slightly different skills and starting inventory. Stats are customizable by clicking on the stat box, and so is alignment( which I havent found a use for, yet)So really, 16 classes if you wanted to nit pick. They are Sorcerer/Sorceress - a monster summoner and ""dark magic"" type, Wizard/White Witch - a typical spell caster, Knight/Valkyrie- your standard ""warrior in shining armor"" although the Valkyrie starts with crap armor, Rogue/Thief - Stealthy and thiefly class, Hunter/Huntress - Ranged weapon fighter, Barbarian/Vandal - Huge and strong but no or very little armor, Bard/Bardess (Bardess!?) - plays magic musical instruments, and Druid/Druidess - nature magician.Theres a nice balance of classes, although I do wish the pet was choosable, or more exotic. I want my Huntress to have a cat! The Thief's monkey is cool and unique. Other than that, theres just the procedurally created dungeon, no towns, quests or NPCs besides a shopkeeper of Arabian Nights extraction that can be found randomly in the dungeon. The items are what youd expect from a traditional roguelike, althpough there are some pretty cool effects and things you can find. The sounds are just the grunts, thwacks and clangs youd expect from a swordfighting game and theres no music.So what makes this game cool?Two things. One, unlike most traditional style roguelikes, its not top down but sidescrolling. And 2. No tiles or ASCII - Its graphical with decently rendered graphics for an indie game. Pick up a plaid cape, and put it on, and your PC is wearing it. A ""smoking potion"" is rendered smoking, fire burns, traps explode, arrows shoot ect. Although there are other graphical roguelikes out there, I personally have never seen a traditional one done like this. Step on a potion, it topples over, throw a dagger and it clangs and slides on the ground before stopping. Also, it is still turn based. When youre not moving, the mosters dont move. It gives it this weird red light, green light (that old children's game) effect that I personally like.Al in all, its a cool game. I still think the asking price is a bit high at $9.99 for what you get (After all, there are much more complex roguelikes out there for FREE). But I dont mind paying for it, the rendering is nice. And way better than squinting at ""@""s and ""k""s. If youre a die hard traditional roguelike fan, pick it up, especially if you can find it for 10% or better off!EDIT: Really weird. I alt-tabbed back to the game, and theres music? There hasnt been any music before this time (and yes, I had the sound on). It just suddenly appeared. So as for the music, its decent. I turned it off though because I was so used to playing that I found it destracting.			"

												WazHack, as a rogue-like, has a great deal of luck involved. That is the nature of the genre--a careful balancing act between the influence of luck and of skill. Initially, after some ""unfair"" deaths, you will think the game is all about luck. This is an illusion. WazHack does involve quite a bit of skill, but in ways that are not apparent until you have braved the depths repeatedly. You will die, often. You will make mistakes. But unlike a lot of games, growing from those mistakes is not an automatic, subconscious affair. As the great yoshimitsu once said, ""overconfidence is the greatest enemy"".How then, do you reveal the skills involved in WazHack?Easy. You think. Every item carries a risk, and managing those risks is something learned by practice... By glorious, stupid deaths from a wager failed. Do you try on every piece of equipment you find? Bad move. You just equipped a cursed -3 helm, sucker. Good luck getting that off. Do you equip every amulet or ring you find? Sorry, that was enchanted with polymorph. You are now a rat. It seems random, and to an extent it is. But through play, patterns emerge. Starter pets growl at cursed items as they approach. Traps on the ground could burn, inflict sleep, teleport... Why not jump over? Hm, there's a door here... If I open it, enemies spawn. But if I defeat them all and check once more, I am rewarded.So yes, WazHack is a game of chance. Every rogue-like is, to varying degrees. But it is also a game of skill. Don't forget it.			"

												#1 advice from someone who actually played it for more than 1000 hours and multiple classes beat on mobile and a bit on pc:Learn your characters. Warrior class may seem awesome at first but it's melee dosesnt work later in game unless you get adequate range power. Alot of things gotta be in equilibrium, otherwise youre gonna have a bad time. For an example: My Wizard may be great ranged and magic but I always have a pretty powerful melee for backup later game. Its all about prepping for later game (lvl6+) you would rather die repeadtly around lvl4 bc you can pretty much feel at that point if youre gonna be prepped. Oh, you have a powerful ledgendary weapon? you wont get far without good spells or wands. This game is good and overwhelmingly well executed, although newbies and people with less than 100 hours may be able to pass 300ft easily without fustration, they may not find mid-lower levels easy and fun, but rather awful because of an almost garunteed death. Armor and weapons isn't everything, but they sure do help. Ok fine. It sucks to try get into. But it will be one of the best games in your eyes if you try and have that determination to try reach the dragon boss and smack the crap out of him. Yes, fine. The graphics are horrendous. but no one complained when anahack or net hack came out in the 80's. People still play the @ symbol and the game itself today. The shopkeeper looks invincible? gues what? hes not. Beast mastery at 100 percent and multiple create monsters will result in a wonderful turban and robe for you to wear that can last you till the boss.You should be able to spare the pain of dying later (if you want to) if you feel youre character isn't well equpped enough at 300 to 400 ft. Look at run throughs on youtube people. They know what they're doing.  "

												Wazhack is a traditional roguelike (very Nethack-ish) reimagined as a 2D platformer/side-scroller. The controls and the UI are streamlined, simplified and easy to use, even for people who may be new to the roguelike/dungeon crawling genre. No hotkeys to memorize or confusing menus. The graphics while simple, have their own unique charm. The music/sound is not particularly noteworthy but works well. The sound also serves to provide the player with audio cues.The gameplay is a rehash of the classic ""get to the Xth floor, get the thing"" formula but instead of the classic top-down plays more like a side-scrolling platformer. A warning...it's not a platformer. It's a turn-based game. If you play this game like Mario Bros./Sonic (which you can) you will die more often than you would otherwise. In fact, you have about a 50/50 chance of killing yourself. There are many times when it is wise to stop, evaluate your surroundings, inventory and enemies before making your next move.Verdict: This game is +1 fun!Check out this great game guide (for Knights) if you don't mind some ""spoilers.""If you would rather avoid spoilers, check out this beginner's guide instead.

												I have never written a review before. This is the most enjoyable game I have played in a long time. I am amazed at the depth and scope of this game. It's been a very long time a game has kept me awake in bed thinking about it. Anything that makes me call out from work to play is awesome! I am very happy I purchased this. Will recomend to friends.			"

												Incredible game!I have never very much liked rogue-likes - because it's frustrating to sink so much time in, and it's all basically hoping to see nice dice-rolls occuring.  It's possible in early scenarios to just find crappy items or WASPS and there's just no chance - that character was born to die.The Freezeclock:In spite of those dislikes, what makes this game hugely relaxing and enjoyable and immersive is the freeze-clock.  You have time to figure out what needs to be done and look at all the resources and available moves you have.  The freezeclock is 100% why I don't mind this being a rogue-like, because it's no longer a twitch-response game like other rogue-likes.  You don't die because of some finger-gymnastics-skill-thing.  It also gives (me at least) time to consider the board as a whole.So I just now had a great run with a wizard (well.. great for me anyways - I haven't played this very many times).  Anyways I felt like my wizard was LOADED.  He had magic missile and wizard lock and an invisibility cloak which everybody still seemed to see him anyways.  But the feeling was great.Then a big orc is chasing him and wizard has taken several hits, but it looks like now that the orc is paralyzed - yeah just zap him with the wand and he should die....  Except....  yeah I had all the time in the world to think about this and work it out..... but I forgot the beam bounces off the wall and kills both the orc and my wizard!  Ugh!  Wahahahahahahaaa!!  WAAA!!And so it goes.  :)If it was much easier, the **TENSION** in the game would be lost.  But when it's really close, when both your main character and the pet kitten are both suffocating and losing health and there's no way to know how long it's going to last, and after a while they can both breath again - that tension makes for good stories.  This is what makes the game shine.  And then that acid blob killed my kitty while I was fiddling with putting on some ring of levitation.  NO!!  NOT KITTY!!!The dying and losing is also really well done - the humor, the slo-mo... it just gets it right and it's not a mechanical play it over and over again thing like other rogue-likes I've seen and tried.Pros:- the game is impossible, which produces very good tension- high content (many different potions, scrolls, spells, weapons, armors, game mechanisms, secret knowledge, tribal knowledge, stuff you need to learn to get anywhere)- the game seems to generate stories even at the very earliest levels (which is as far as I've gotten).  There's some sort of landscape story in there too (i.e. there are some gnomish mines, and some other area with special gods or something).  But besides the landscape story, there is the game mechanism story which randomly ""happens"" while playing, which makes plays memorable.- there is an element of survival.Cons:- It's almost certainly unfair.  Oh no I already said that in ""Pros - the game is impossible""!- Wizards are possibly really unfair, and just a random dice throwing insanity machine among other difficult classes, while Barbarians and Knights seem to be ""oh you have to play these because the other ones are so hard"".  I'm not sure - maybe it's fair.  But probably not.- Way too much whiney fans?  I asked for an easy setting and got all this ""oh no we don't want the option to play it easy"" bullshh.

There is a sort of religious fervor that gets ignited in players, and it won't make any sense after playing for only 10 hours, or maybe even 20 hours.  But there are really deep tactics learned while playing - the game is brutal and there is real hesitation to offer an easy mode just because learning those tactics can be really rewarding (this really cannot be underestimated).

												Fantastic game! A thousand different scenarios to die in, and all of them will teach you something new, and most of them will leave you laughing and howling in frustration at the same time. Fantastic value for money, immense replayability ( you will have too! you will die A LOT) subtle humour, and then the real funl is just how your own ignorance and stuborness will kill you time and time again. Do you have what it takes to learn from your mistakes and beat this dungeon? Of course every dungeon is unique and loot drops are random so sometimes despite your best efforts you can't and won't succeed.TRY TRY TRY again. you will fail! I promise you, but you will love it!

Then I picked it up on Steam, and with the improved interface I was blown away by how fun it actually is!As a Crawl/Nethack player over the years, I can without hesitation say pick this one up. Neat graphical flair, turn based dispite what it looks like, and loads more depth then it seems at first glance. Recommended!			"

												Surprisingly deep game with an abundant amount of variety in character skills. Lots of fun enemies. Unapologetically and punishingly difficult, which makes even small victories seem like they mean something, unlike your standard non-rogue-like where you expect to win. You should expect to lose this game repeatedly and enjoy it.I actually tried it out because of the multiplayer component, which turns out to be too clunky to sync up two people who are trying to play competitively. Single player is great if you are looking for a dungeon crawler, however.			"

												Hail Sir Ralentine, the Just knight! Today is your birthday, but you are 21 years old. You are mighty, charismatic, and healthy. You have perfect blonde hair and use a lot of gel. You've never been one to read books, but you are somehow well trained in handling swords. The pointy end goes into the squishy flesh of evil doers.On this beautiful day, you close your eyes and say a prayer to the Big Guy in the cloud to lead you to adventure. The Big Guy has always been with you since you were born, and always tells you what you should do. For example, he might say go left or go right.When your eyes open, you realize you don't know where you are. Some other adventurous looking types are standing around a hole in the ground. The Big Guy calls out to you by name. Everyone stares at you. He says go right; then you should go down. You are uneasy with this path, but left is so very dark. You ask your trusty dog Fido to come along. You like Fido because he growls whenever there is danger nearby. Fido has been your trusty dog for about three seconds. Somehow, this is okay.As you head right, you notice broken egg shells around a hole not far from where you stand. Thinking this is quite odd, you approach and peer inside the hole. A ladder descends into the darkness. The Big Guy tells you this is the legendary dungeon of WazHack. He says it contains the amulet of Zaw, and he wants it, NOW. For some reason, you feel like somewhat like committing senseless acts of violence, and invading the homes of others, and robbing them. Next move?RUN AWAY: The Big Guy is furious at you. If you told your tale of cowardice to your dear mother, she would be deeply saddened. Thankfully, that will never happen. After you turn away, a kobold head pops out of the hole you were looking down. It waves a shiny pink stick at you. A magical missile flies at your head. *Sneak attack, critical damage.* You have died. Try again?CLIMB DOWN: You congratulate yourself on being a brave adventurer and following the advice of your beloved deity, the Big Guy. Your dog falls to the bottom of the ladder. It doesn't even yelp. Good dog! You reach the bottom and peer around a torch-lit hallway. The Big Guy says go left, no, no wait a second, go right.GO LEFT: The Big Guy said left first, and there might be something shiny to the left. The Big Guy can't always be right! What does he know? Fido follows behind you very carefully, sniffing for a place to use the bathroom. You don't sense any immediate danger as you walk. Happy that you picked a safe path, you listen to the rhythmic pattern of your boots on the floor. You walk some more, and suddenly an orange haze appears around you. The room starts to fade. You close your eyes reflexively. Your insides yank down. You feel like your stomach is going to come up through your mouth.  When you open your eyes, you are in another room. A feeling of panic builds inside you. Fido is not here. Oh Fido, where are thou hiding? Silently, from across the chamber, a glowing floating sword, stained with blood, flies at you rapidly.  You do not notice because you are staring at an odd sign. It reads 800 feet. That's strange! You only see two feet in the room. You smile and close your eyes to ask the Big Guy for advice about the 798 feet. He just curses and forsakes you. *The flying +3 enchanted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sword swings and executes a critical hit.* You have died. Try again?GO RIGHT: The Big Guy sees that you follow his advice. He casually mentions everyone deserves a copy of WazHack. The ramblings of your benevolent deity make no sense to you, but you continue on your quest for the amulet and eternal high score glory.EPILOGUE: To spare our readers from ruining the adventure, we suggest that you spin up ye old computer and tell Sir Ralentine what to do next. An adventure will indeed take place, and many more may follow. "

												I may not have many hours on record for how long I've owned the game, but that comes down more to me obsessing over competitive online games despite myself.This game is terrific. Absolutely awesome. It can be very unforgiving, and it's incredibly random, but that makes it so much more satisfying when you accomplish something. Some runs you'll essentially die of starvation - others, you'll end up in an otherwise unremarkable fight but that blessed potion was actually a blessed potion of *insert horrible death-causing status effect here*. Maybe you'll be a sliver of health away from losing but come out on top, only to have an egg hatch with an enemy snake to finish you off. Literally anything can and probably at some point WILL kill you.Now, that doesn't mean that you won't do awesome stuff too! There are 16 different characters (8 different classes, slightly different male / female versions - slight enough not to♥♥♥♥♥♥anyone off, significant enough to make them play differently) which all need to be approached differently in terms of strategy. Choosing the correct skills based on your run, the strategy for the character you're playing, and dealing with the craziness of the RNG with everything being possibly extremely awesome or horribly deadly... It's Very, Very fun :)I'd recommend to all!			"

												This game is awesome. If you can buy it while it's on sale I would definitely recommend it. The graphics are really smooth and aesthetically pleasing, and the gameplay is different every time, even once you find a class that you work well with.It feels like literally anything can happen. I saw the picture someone uploaded of the potion of hallucination. Accidentally drank that while I was fighting goblins and they all turned into weird 4D cubes with really weird names. Not something that is going to wreck your whole day, you can jump right in. And when you don't feel like playing anymore, you just let yourself die or just save and quit. I would describe it like a game of Baldur's Gate II where the goal isn't RPG so much as ""Just how far can you delve into this dungeon.""			"

												You will not be disappointed by this game.... PLEASE IGNORE THEIR HORRIBLE MOVIE. I know it looks bad... and the pictures do not do it justice. Trust me on this! They have so much incredible game mechanic genius in this little gem that I'm surprised it isn't on the top 10 yet. Gameplay: Basically, you move around the dungeon trying not to die, picking up as much loot as you'd like (you usually know what you want to pick up based on your style of play, and encumberance usually isn't an issue). The game lets you think about what you're going to do next, because bad things only take action as you take action. This has the effect of giving you that ""Oh S*%#"" moment when you get surrounded by spiders, a few short actions from death. You get to cast a crap ton of interesting and funny spells, via scrolls, tomes, wands, etc. Items are super interesting, because you never know what you're going to get. The very starting room could have a skeleton key, which allows you to lock away difficult monsters and open anything up at all. Truly, the various gameplay complexities are too numerous to go on about. You will most likely learn something new every play through.... just don't expect to win your fist play through or anything. You will die.... brutally.Limitations: Alright, so I've never been a fan of hunger mechanics in any form, but WH does alright with it. You learn quickly that just resting after every encounter isn't the best strategy unless you have a feast to rely on. Balancing hunger/gluttony is a big limitation to the gameplay, as you'll find far too many times that you're out of food, getting hungry, and those damn monsters are not dropping any food. Another limitation is the drop off in spell viability in the later parts of the dungeon. You know that amazing spell you've used the first 10 floors? Yeah... about that... you're going to die soon if that's all you have. As such, as a mage your late game strategy usually encompasses being tricky with teleports, or being super lucky and finding the right spells for late game. Another limitation is how risky it can be to equip stuff, because they can be cursed. I once equipped an amulet that seemed to have an interesting art model, and it turned out to be a strangling necklace. This killed me horribly. To counter this, you have to either identify items with somewhat rare methods, or have a pet around that hogs your precious food. While some may think of these limitations as classic additions to the rogue rpg genre, I call them slight annoyances and detractions to the main point of the game (killing stuff and getting stronger through skill). It can be pretty funny sometimes, though.Verdict: Absolutely will be playing this many many more hours than the price should allow. You really get your amusement value of the cheap price point. Don't let the apparent graphics deficit dissuade you from a smart purchase if you in any way like heavy emersion, high difficulty, luck base RPG's with plenty of insane loot, spells, monsters, and game mechanics.

												A great game well done. I spent many hours playing nethack and am very impressed with this 'version'. A rogue-type game, named after the frst game done in this style, that stands apart. Expect to die thousands of times, seriously. But fear not, that is part of the fun in this game. So many ways to play the game, to explore, to discover, and to die horribly. I've been playing Wazhack since 1.1 on the ipad and pc and have only beaten the game once (thanks to a wish or two), but I keep going back for more. Even after all this time I'm still discovering new things, and not just new ways to cry. This game is a good way to kill time or spend your life's ever so valuable moments on. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes rpg's, dungeon crawlers, and the like.			"

												This is a REALLY cool spin on classic roguelikes. This game borrows very heavily from the oldschool roguelike classic Nethack. Many of the mechanics are the same, but they've made some cool changes that seek to lessen the learning curve. If you want to experience a true classic but don't have the stomach for an ASCII game this game seems like a really nice fit. Then, when you grow some balls you can play nethack.			"

												Loved this game. Finally won it, though I wondered if I ever would -- do yourself a favor after banging your head against it and read some of the community guides! Lots of fun, truly challenging. One criticism though -- this game is NOT truly co-op, though it has the tag -- when you are in co-op with another player you both run the same dungeon SEPERATELY but can ressurect one another if you find the other's body. This game would be AWESOME to play with a friend, but that ain't what I call co-op... is it? That said, great game for fans of rogue-likes. LOTS of monsters and gear, good combination of random and stable elements, fun loot system, interesting classes that play VERY differently. I recommend starting play as a BARBARIAN (not a knight as they suggest) and going from there.			"

												This game is awesome. If you can buy it while it's on sale I would definitely recommend it. The graphics are really smooth and aesthetically pleasing, and the gameplay is different every time, even once you find a class that you work well with.It feels like literally anything can happen. I saw the picture someone uploaded of the potion of hallucination. Accidentally drank that while I was fighting goblins and they all turned into weird 4D cubes with really weird names. Not something that is going to wreck your whole day, you can jump right in. And when you don't feel like playing anymore, you just let yourself die or just save and quit. I would describe it like a game of Baldur's Gate II where the goal isn't RPG so much as ""Just how far can you delve into this dungeon.""			"

												You will not be disappointed by this game.... PLEASE IGNORE THEIR HORRIBLE MOVIE. I know it looks bad... and the pictures do not do it justice. Trust me on this! They have so much incredible game mechanic genius in this little gem that I'm surprised it isn't on the top 10 yet. Gameplay: Basically, you move around the dungeon trying not to die, picking up as much loot as you'd like (you usually know what you want to pick up based on your style of play, and encumberance usually isn't an issue). The game lets you think about what you're going to do next, because bad things only take action as you take action. This has the effect of giving you that ""Oh S*%#"" moment when you get surrounded by spiders, a few short actions from death. You get to cast a crap ton of interesting and funny spells, via scrolls, tomes, wands, etc. Items are super interesting, because you never know what you're going to get. The very starting room could have a skeleton key, which allows you to lock away difficult monsters and open anything up at all. Truly, the various gameplay complexities are too numerous to go on about. You will most likely learn something new every play through.... just don't expect to win your fist play through or anything. You will die.... brutally.Limitations: Alright, so I've never been a fan of hunger mechanics in any form, but WH does alright with it. You learn quickly that just resting after every encounter isn't the best strategy unless you have a feast to rely on. Balancing hunger/gluttony is a big limitation to the gameplay, as you'll find far too many times that you're out of food, getting hungry, and those damn monsters are not dropping any food. Another limitation is the drop off in spell viability in the later parts of the dungeon. You know that amazing spell you've used the first 10 floors? Yeah... about that... you're going to die soon if that's all you have. As such, as a mage your late game strategy usually encompasses being tricky with teleports, or being super lucky and finding the right spells for late game. Another limitation is how risky it can be to equip stuff, because they can be cursed. I once equipped an amulet that seemed to have an interesting art model, and it turned out to be a strangling necklace. This killed me horribly. To counter this, you have to either identify items with somewhat rare methods, or have a pet around that hogs your precious food. While some may think of these limitations as classic additions to the rogue rpg genre, I call them slight annoyances and detractions to the main point of the game (killing stuff and getting stronger through skill). It can be pretty funny sometimes, though.Verdict: Absolutely will be playing this many many more hours than the price should allow. You really get your amusement value of the cheap price point. Don't let the apparent graphics deficit dissuade you from a smart purchase if you in any way like heavy emersion, high difficulty, luck base RPG's with plenty of insane loot, spells, monsters, and game mechanics.

												WazHack takes a timeless classic formula and polishes it up with modern mechanics. For example, combat is ""time-based"" - denizens of the dungeon only attack and move when you do, meaning a dagger-wielding monster might get 2-3 swings in for your every one staff swing - a very nice evolution of the old-school tild-based movement and turn-based combat. It's a roguelike with lots of loot to find, monsters to kill, and deaths to experience. I've put a decent amount of hours into this game and still see something new almost every round. Each death teaches you something which helps you get further next time. With how addicting this game is, you can bet there WILL be a next time.With so much replayability and difficulty, this game is going to last me a loooooong time. I only wish I could get the game for free on my iPad after purchasing it for Steam, because I won't be able to resist having it on the go.			"

												I may not have many hours on record for how long I've owned the game, but that comes down more to me obsessing over competitive online games despite myself.This game is terrific. Absolutely awesome. It can be very unforgiving, and it's incredibly random, but that makes it so much more satisfying when you accomplish something. Some runs you'll essentially die of starvation - others, you'll end up in an otherwise unremarkable fight but that blessed potion was actually a blessed potion of *insert horrible death-causing status effect here*. Maybe you'll be a sliver of health away from losing but come out on top, only to have an egg hatch with an enemy snake to finish you off. Literally anything can and probably at some point WILL kill you.Now, that doesn't mean that you won't do awesome stuff too! There are 16 different characters (8 different classes, slightly different male / female versions - slight enough not to♥♥♥♥♥♥anyone off, significant enough to make them play differently) which all need to be approached differently in terms of strategy. Choosing the correct skills based on your run, the strategy for the character you're playing, and dealing with the craziness of the RNG with everything being possibly extremely awesome or horribly deadly... It's Very, Very fun :)I'd recommend to all!			"

												A game like no other.... Everything about it is amazing. Super hardcore like the games from 30 years ago, but it can be beat! I remember playing Binding of Isaac and enjoying how hard it is, and the feeling of success of beating the game.... And I get the same feeling when I play this game, except it is much harder and requires tons of skill rather than just luck... I've put many hours into the in-browser version, and I've enjoyed every bit of it. You can't stop until you win or die. After probably 50 hours of this game, I finally beat it. Best game ever. I just wish if more people played it so we could discuss the wonders of this game.			"

												First and foremost, Waz will personally talk to you on the reddit wazhack board.  One man made this great side-scrolling, nethack-esque blend of real-time action and turn based strategy dungeon crawling hack and slash.  With a great engine, (unity 5/1.3 beta 1) it's on android and steam. My buddy says he doesn't like the wonky animations, but compared to ASCII roguelikes and Pixel graphics, Wazhack is a VERY welcome breath of fresh air.  I recommend this steam version (though I have both,) because you don't have to buy the classes separately, and the controller support works like a dream.  Bind some stuff to the right stick, and you're set.  Where scrolls and potions are unidentified, weapons could be cursed, or the legendary Mjolnir for example, leads for some delightfully hilarious gameplay mechanics.  You can find a wand of create monster, bounce it off the walls and make literally dozens of creeps for you to either mezmerize to join your posse, or pierce with a single magic missile to get massive amounts of XP. If you like class-based item collecting dungeon crawlers with seemingly endless amounts of replayability via procedural generation, then Wazhack is for you.			"

												I can't believe I didn't find this gem earlier though I was looking for good rogue-likes on Steam.The thrill of identifying potions by quaffing them, scrolls by trying them out each game anew is brilliant, much like classic rogue-likes, but with really slick graphics. Great game, really like the time mechanism, too. It's sort of relaxing (which only means you will die relaxed, but still ...). I keep dying a lot quicker than in Dungeons of Dredmor, which saves a lot of time.First game, found a README scroll, laughed about the name of it, tried it out, turned out to be a summon monster scroll. Got surrounded by 14 monsters at level 1, died in one turn.Third game, found a +5 longbow and +3 arrows, felt like an unbeatable archery god, accidentally hit the shop keeper  while shooting some rats, ignored the whining of the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag merchant for one turn too long. What is it with militant shopkeepers in these games? Why don't they adventure out instead of me? Are they all the dungeon lord in disguise?Died a swift death to Brax' cousin's pinkish-purple magic missile.11/10, would accidentally shoot shopkeeper to the knee again.			"

												Wazhack is a great side-scroller that pays great attention to detail. What more is there to say? How many games are there that you can throw your potion at any emeny to find out what the potion does? What game can you play as over 10 very different classes with pros and cons? This game even takes it up a notch and allows you to be stronger at certain magics depending on if you are chotic-evil. The only main flaw I can name is that I cannot run it at the highest setting on my pc but that is mostly a personal problem.			"

												A Nice litle game i play in my spare time.I remember playing this game when it was free to play in your internet browser.. I can proudly say a lot has changed since those days.Being only about 100mb, id say (this in my opinion) this game is better than many AAA titles. The procedurally-generated dungeons never get tiresome and they constantly give you nice choices througout the game that will impact your chances of survival or not.The only thing i would do to change this game in anyway is add character customisation, just the hair and hair color would do. But besides from that this game is really good for its price.  8/10			"

												I've been playing Wazhack on the Web version for about a month. I'm very excited for the game to come to Steam! I'm a huge fan of roguelikes and this is one of the more challenging ones out there. The one developer has done a great job responding to bugs, making improvements, and keeping up a chatter with the community at large.Very challenging, very very fun, and never frustrating, except in the very roguelike permadeath way at times. Great for a free 15 minutes or an 8 hour series of sessions, with 16 different classes to try out you're never want for variety.This is a fantastic game. One of the best of this year so far.			"

												I really like this, but most people won't.I'm well suited to it because I have very extensive nethack experience and really like brutal difficulty levels in those games.A lot of the code is blatantly ripped from nethack/rogue, which is ok since I'm sure it was no easy task to transform it to the semi-3d perspective.The game gets better as you get better.It's not as good or durable  as Sword of the Stars: The Pit or tales of Eye'majal, but i think i'll still get quite a few more hours out of this.

												I really like waz hack. it has a ton of replay value and is a nice easy pace hack and slash rpg rouge like. its like a singleplayer side scrolling dungons and dragons game.i have beat the game twice already but have not done so on steam there are a lot of improvements from the desura version.EDIT: 7-11-16I finally beat Wazhack for the first time on the steam version! Woohoo!I feel that give me a good enough perspective to re-write my review of Wazhack.The first time i beat the game was with a knight decked out with dragon armor and Excalibur. The second time was with a wizard who could teleport and shoot lightning bolt and had crazy mana regeneration.this third time I had beat the game was with a rogue who wielded two legendary curved swords and a suit of crystal armor.Wazhack has filled a role in my game collection as an exceptional side-scrolling adventure game. it can be unforgiving at times but I have always been rewarded by thinking critically and trying to utilize all avenues.the main game play is great at the beginning there are usually a dozen or so options to dispatch enemies and some even offer some interesting interactions.the middle of the game sometimes is a bit of a slug fest you really need to make sure your armor class is high and your weapons hit bonus is decent.the end game is frustratingly simple you need to  ready yourself to face monsters that are directly countered by items found early in the game. some of the late game monsters can feel really unfair due to luck and their sheer power.I would like to seem some puzzle elements like codes or ciphers. a quest giver would be cool. With quests like bring back 3 rubies or the head of a named monster for a ring in return.More unique items something like the Midas would be really cool. like the Horadric cube or a portal gem that goes somewhere else.In conclusion Wazhack has always delivered and more. I have played a lot of Wazhack and died a lot too but the randomly generated levels always leave me coming back for more.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes single player dungeon adventure rouge-like games.

												This feels like a cheap, clumsy Nethack clone. It would have been far better with A) more content, B) unique monsters, C) different names for the scrolls (and maybe a second identifier on potions) since they're lifted right out of Nethack, and D) MORE CONTENT.I do like the side ""rooms"" you can ""investigate"" for monster waves. Maybe I am passing judgement way too soon since I've only made it about 300 feet in. What wikis I found didn't seem populated with content, making things seem sparse.Had this been a ""standard"" dungeon crawl game and not such an obvious overglorified nod to Nethack (right down to water nymphs and fountains), I'd probably enjoy it more. But it's a fun little diversion, so I'll keep playing. The amount of effort going into this to get the right feel shows, so that is worth something. And a 3D roguelike never hurts, it is a nice change from the pixel art of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and others.$10 is... a bit steep. I'd say $5 or $6.8/10 --- worthy of picking up, but it does Need More Content.			"

												WazHack was a game I saw on yogscast a couple years back, and it looked fun. I saw it was on steam greenlight a few months later, and thumbed it up. A year later it made its silent realease on steam. I was happy it was on steam, yet for some odd reason didn't buy it. A year later, I bought the game at last. I had almost known this game for 3 years, and I haden't even played it! It was time to sink my teeth into the huge world of WazHackThis is a roguelike dungeon crawler. It's like most dungeon crawler games, but one quirk makes it diffrent from the rest. ""All the time in the world"". This means that when you move, so does the world, and when you stop, so does the world. This means that you can take your time in combat, and situations, and I love that. The fact that I have time to contemplate my next move, is really cool. And let me tell you, you NEED to think about your 'next move', because this game has perma-death.This game has many diffrent characters to play as, each giving its own unique since of play style. You could be a knight, that uses melee weapons, and is a tank. Or, you could be a fragile wizard, that attacks from a range, and hits with staffs.This will give you a lot of reason to replay the game, even after you've beaten it.This game will make you question everything about the enviroment around you. You have to question every item you pick up, and every piece of food you pick up. Why? The walls could have hidden spike traps, that amulet could strangle you to death, and that apple could be poisoned. Everything has a fair chance of being dangerous, so you must be cautious.  One time, I decided to use a scroll, and guess what it did? It destoryed my armor, and I died shortly after. You have to make sure what you wear, or even look at, is safe, and I love it.This game has such a large variety of items to find, and discover. Maybe you'll find a lute that puts even the fiercest of beasts to sleep. Maybe you'll find a gem, that turns out to actually be a worthless piece of glass! Maybe you'll find a sword that allows you to levitate, and shoot magic missles! It's you're job to find the right items that will help you, and the items that will destroy you! You have to paly the game for quite a while to even get an idea of what each item does. Unless you google it. Then you've taken all the fun out it it. Good job.This game has an RPG-like system. Everytime you level up, you get to upgrade a skill (each skill is unique to every character). Perhaps you want to upgrade your duel wielding skills. Or maybe you would rather upgrade your first aid skill, so you don't die as fast. The choice is up to you.They are currently updating the game every so often with a bunch of new content, so there will always be something new waiting for you!CONCLUSION: This is an underated gem on steam, and I recomend it to everyone who has 10 $ to spare. And make sure you have some free time as well, because you are gonna get lost in this game. You will lose track of time. I started the game up at 1pm, and the next thing I know its 2 in the morning			"

Honestly WazHack is one of the most well made, well balanced, and well designed Rogue-Like's I've played since classic text based 'Band games.Some may complain about the art style, but if you're a true Rogue-Like fan you'll understand that's literally the least important aspect of games in the genre.Also worth noting that WazHack isn't watered down, simplified, or generally made too easy to cater to the masses.  This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you're not careful, just like the classics.			"

												This is most likely my favourite Rogue-Like or at least the one I spent the most time with by far. It has great replayability and if you are into the genre the game is definitely worth its money. If you are not sure you might wanna consider waiting for a Sale.			"

												If you're a fan of roguelikes, buy it, if not go away you're adopted nobody loves you. This game is incredible and possibly my favourite roguelike of all timeGraphics:GoodSounds:GoodVariety (items potions enemies and stuff): GreatPolish (stuff works as you would want):Quite goodDifficulty:Great, if you're a masochist.Multiplayer: I haven't played because i cant find anyone, to play with but it seems like it'd be ok.Fairness (Not dying for stupidly unlucky reasons):As all roguelikes do this game relies heavily on luck, not bad IMODevelopment: I'm not sure how quickly this game is being developed but it is definitely worth buying right now.Classes:16/8. there are 8 classes, with a fairly different male/female version, there isnt a single bad class, some people wont like bard and bardess, and some people wont like the 2 thief classes, but that leaves 12 classes that most people will really enjoy playing as, i never get bored of the classes because they are so varying.BUY IT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY.

												I am a total sucker for rogue-likes. I really want to like this game and will continue playing it when I get bored of other games. Buuut, like all low-key games this game suffers from a lack of knowledge. Specifically, what stats do and what different effects actually do. I know it is supposed to be trial and error but at some point these should be known quantities. Also, like every inexpensive rogue-like the game suffers from an atrocious random number generator. When your level 6 Valkyrie just easily dispatched an ogre and then a goblin riding a rat kills you.... *le sigh*. I've found that problem in just about every game like this on Steam and to be quite frank, its getting old. Things I do like though include not knowing what things are, the variety of uses behind companions, and the fact that different characters actually require different strategies.			"

												Cons: This game is ridiculously evil.Pros: This game is ridiculously evil.A+ roguelike, would play againIn all seriousness, this is bar none the best indie roguelike out there at the moment. It's simple yet engrossing, cruel but leaves you craving more. The mix of strategy and action is on point. Attacks are an almost entirely automated affair, but the game nails that way of making you feel like you're doing something even though you really aren't which makes hack 'n' slashes tick. Thanks to the brilliant 'time only moves when you do' system, the game moves as quickly or as slowly and carefully as you choose for it to. And while death is permanent, you can exit mid-run and come back to your game later, which is a welcome feature on the off chance you've actually managed to go more than twenty minutes without dying. Fiendishly unforgiving, Wazhack is a delightful little ball of hate.			"

												First let me start off by saying, I love Rogue-likes, Rogue-lites and permadeath.  These are the reasons I kept WazHack in my wishlist for weeks.  When I finally came around to purchasing it, my experience was less than stellar.  I later grew to like the game after the issues below soured my first impression.Here are the top reasons I was more frustrated with Waz rather then enjoying my experience.- Game says it has full controller support.  Lie.  In the game you have to aim to shoot your bow, spells and to throw things.  Your controller cannot aim AT ALL.  You basically have to use your mouse to aim, and if you're using a controller, we all know how annoying that is.  The whole point to using a controller is to lean back and relax.- Some classes are just downright pointless!  Bard and bardess for example.  They either charm monsters or put them to sleep.  For the bardess, mobs put to sleep immediatly wake up when attacked.  So since you can only have your harp out and no other weapons, you just stand there and have your pet attack the mob.  Problem is, you don't get xp for mobs killed by your pet.  So I take it the developer figured bardess was hard mode because you'll  never level up.  Other than that, she can identify items a little better.  The bard charms mobs.  It's the same thing with this guy where you can only have your guitar out and nothing else.  So again, relying on your pets to attack other monsters.  The problem with this mechanic is, every time you want your pets to attack anything, you have to go to another screen and select ""Entire Entourage"" then select attack.  It is VERY tedious and ruins the fun.  I had more frustration with the controller than the mechanics of the game.  Going through the game menu's was clearly thought of with a mouse and keyboard as there are several items to look at and scroll through.  I get it, you're playing on PC, why use a controller?  For alot of gamers, we don't like being hunched over a keyboard for longer than an hour.  It's just not comfortable.As for the RNG.  I like.  I have no problems with RNG in most games (other than Darkest Dungeon).  This is a dungeon crawler.  Which are meant to be difficult.  My issues above slightly ruined my initial first impression but I grew the love the game after I put in a few more hours.  Now, if you don't mind using kb&m, and enjoy dieing to RNG, then you will thouroughly enjoy WazHack.  You will probably get many hours out of the game for 10 bucks.			"

With perma-death, it is sometimes hard to stay alive, but the mystery, intrigue and comedy in the procedurally generated content will keep you coming back for more and MORE!			"

												I like hard games but, when it's super hard and there's a lot of bugs it's a waste of time. I may change my review if they fix serious issues. Forgetting perfected spells is garbage; you don't forget a sword, you shouldn't forget a spell if your stats are maxed. It makes playing a spell caster impossible when books are so rare. Many mechanics don't work properly either. Items from wishes don't always appear on a successful wish, lightning doesn't recharge wands but will destroy them, blank spell books can't be filled with anything, and rooms respawn faster than you can catch your breathe. It may be fun if they bother fixing some obvious problems. It may work fine on android but, it's absolute garbage on pc.			"

Posted: August 9, 2014
												Im going to be clear about the one major flaw - of this game is - ""the complete absolute and total randomness of everything - ruins the game"" - a game may last an hour or 1 minute, you as a player have little control over it > with any skill you attempt to apply, if you like restarting a game until the random mobs, drop layouts and npc's fall in your favour and you get a good session of play … then fine - but this game is complete chance, hardly any leverage is possible using the knowledge one gains over many play sessions - only by the luck of survival for a period of time can you leverage even the tiniest bit - which to be honets is probably below the thresh-hold of perception - but even then if it generates badly and you dont get say any offensive spells drop as caster by level 12 or any decent staffs or say there is no baker before the elevator area no second shop etc you can be knackered at level 10-12 even if your 4 hours in thinking your going somewhere,  its completley possible for this game to randomly put you up against odds you cant handle with no means of escape per example a dwarf lord and you have no offensive spells as a caster or wands left ? The randomness of the layout means you might have a dry hard time of it with few drops by chance. Theyre is little clear or obvious in how blessed or cursed items clearly work, the knowledge button is tucked away in inventory and is sort of pointless unless you have everything identified anyway and a pain to dig out and even then it tells you nothing numerical or clear most of the time, even the wazhack wiki is player done and has huge holes in it in terms of information, I dont buy a game to waste large amounts of my time browsing a user generated wiki? when ive identified something at least give a clear ""tooltip"" of what is does in practice. This game is effectively like being slapped in the face by randomness continuously - if you enjoy the idea that the application of skill should win out, do not buy this game, as skill has little impact, this game is an afrront to the idea of skill and if your the kind of person whose happy to press a lever and hopes the next time will be the time - you get a cookie in terms of drops and the layout of the map etc, then i guess you will be fine with this game, but you will waste 100 of hours until the stars align and you get the randomness going in your favour for onceAlso spell casters start off with no spells or wands ? meaning as a class they are gimped, you may not get spellbooks or wands in the first 10 floors that are useful offensively its completely random meaning you choose caster and end up playing melee ? as no offensive spells may drop and no matter what level you become half the useless spells you can get are often too advanced and rubbish or remain too chancey to cast, you get advice like play a melee class for an easier time - melee should not be the only option to progress to begin with, any knowledge or skill you learn in this game is of little relevance, on the basis each play session everything is so totally randomised. This game should have various randomness levels which moderate the ""extreme level of randomness"", provide some basic spells for casters to start with and maybe a beginner mode that gives you three ressurects per character until you learn the game.To make this entire game so restart heavy and so damn random, means although I can clearly see theyre 'could be' a fun game to had in here, the game stubbornly refuses to let you have access to anything but a randomised slot machine of aggravating frustration. I stear clear of any game when youve played 2 x 4 hour play sessions and your still not able to break free and clear from the heavy effects of the dice ruining your game, then its not a game its a random gambling dice simulator to be avoided at all costs, an abusive time sync that works on the random reward principal. cynical rubbish. And worst its a wasted mistaken investment - As I can see getting little pleasure from the money I spent on it, This game isnt old school unforgiving and hard like say dark souls becuse in Dark souls the application and development of skill means the game rewards you - wazhack on the other hand is just plain random ghastliness, the good reviews for this game must come from people who had games where the stars aligned in the randomness or are generally masochists, the game is certainly random enough that even if they imagine its their skill it may well not be.

												One day I will be good enough to fully Hack the Waz and maybe even rock the Casbah.If you like classic roguelikes even a little bit, this game is wonderful. And maybe even if, like me, you were first baffled then excited then annoyed then disgusted by the proliferation of the genre as a modern thing, it'll be a nice relief from everybody and their brother endlessly making the next 'roguelite'. Half of these fraud games don't even have turn-based combat.Can I comment on the graphics? They're also wonderful. As someone who played lots of PC games in the 90s, the cockles of my heart were instantaneously warmed by the obvious throwback to the era when those clean, low-res textured SGI renders were all the rage. Look up SGI, kids, I'm not here to educate you. It particularly reminds me of the game Constructor, although there are probably things that are closer. Tons of ads used those SGI renders as well.Play it. Learn it. Love it.			"

												Bought this game for Steam and android.The premise is great: classic-classic RPG style adventure through a dungeon with essentially a DnD character.  Lots of cool ideas, perma-death, and ridiculous situations to find yourself in.The execution however, I decided finally, is pretty bad.  The game has some bugs that can literally be game ending.  Considering every single action and item are generated by RNG, an entire game going haywire on what is FINALLY a good run can be about the most frustrating gaming experience you can have. Example:  we are in a Co-op game and my friend finds a blessed scroll of remove curse.  This will remove curses from every item in your inventory.  This is during easily the best run we've ever had; 20+ wands and books each, multiple bows and arrows(witch and hunter), I had 3 fireball wands to start, it was great.  I give everything to him in a trade to de-curse, and EVERY SINGLE ITEM DISAPPEARED.  I was left with a blank inventory.  As anyone who plays the game can tell you, catastrophic events happen in game all the time.Playing a game where one in-game mistake can be catastrophic with bad programming on top was way more frustrating then fun, and it made me angry I wasted hours and hours one the game and researching all it's silly quibbles online.Future Potential = 9/10, actual current enjoyment easily say -5/10.  =(  Don't buy unless dev gets serious about making this game bug free.

												You cannot restore previous saved games other than the one you are currently working on..  Permadeath is your only option.  The game is fun but ultimately it is a Waste of time.  You will spend countless hours re-rolling your main character everytime you die, which will be often, instead of actual dungeon crawling.  It is a very frustrating experience.Save your money until they fix it.  Play Nethack instead for free.  It is a much better game.			"

												this game in its current state has to many bugs and developers never work on the game the game also stole nearly all its ideas from nethack along with those the game is impossiblely hard to play making no effort at all to assist you in the game except on pet normally a dog that falls hundreds of feet down ladders and dies so quickly along with hunger for the pet it gets lost every five steps making you turn round and try for hours with no avail to cox it up a singular ladder but no that is never happening think maybe a shop/merchant might allow some help no 360 gold which is all ready nearly immpossible to get and you buy a scroll read it and boom a blessed scroll of create monster creating up to 13 monsters at once then try fighting them your dead in fact at full health with a level 9 charecter you can still die to one kobold weilding nothing but a short sword so i must so strongly discourage this game because it was such a massive failure at what could have been a great game and frankly a waist of money			"

												Could get into this roguelike turn based game.Decent graphics, but the gameplay felt too loose and repetitive.  I am sure that multi-player is better and if your into that play style.  However, I would stay way from the single player version.  For that, there are much better roguelike games on Steam.			"

												After around 50 tryes im done with this.Game is all about getting lucky. If u dont, you are dead. 1sec or 1h into the dungeon dosent matter.  Sadly there is no way to lern the machanics of the game cause they arnt shown. There are no numbers to tell you why u failed. Just try and error.And i really like to build my own class cause u need fighting skills AND magic to beat this game. Sadly i cant.Preset classes are scam. Weak mage or stupid warrior is all this game hast to offer.Good idea, bad game.			"

												Roguelike, fantasy dungeon crawler with multiple classes to choose from, hundreds of items, spells and weapons? Sounds awesome! But WazHack struggled to live up to my expectations. WazHack is a platforming dungeon crawler set in an epic dungeon called WazHack which I suspect was once part of an epic sewer system.Like old-school dungeon crawlers, when you’re not moving, neither is anything else; items are numerous and often cursed and likewise with the enemies (numerous and cursed that is, since they’re all skeletons). Why didn’t this game hold my attention? It turns out that WazHack is also available as a phone game and the graphics don’t translate well onto 32 inch monitor. The interface is a little clunky. A little more than clunky. While moving around and attacking was easy enough, using, equipping and consuming items was an ordeal of scrolling through menus, reading stats, and on-screen text.I did not enjoy my time playing this game. Considering the nature of roguelike games is that you die a lot and have to restart, there has to be a huge motivator to compel you to keeping playing. Going lower and lower into  a dungeon is just not enough to compel me.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/07/02/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-wazhack/ "

												Horrable multi-player, shows a picture of where the other person is but there is no interaction between you and the other player, only buy this game if you are buying it for the single player.This game is not worth anything over $2.00 you can get much better games for free, it is a basic side scroller game with very low quality graphics. No creativity was used in the making of this game it just runs off the ideas and creativity of some of the first side scrollers, very outdated and if that is what you are into you should go buy the old games they are worth much more at a cheaper cost.The only time i would ever reccomend this game is if you had a computer that could not run anything else and are unable to aquire any of the original side scroller/platform games, if your Computer can handle downloading this game you can download many games that are much better for alot less money.

												This game is simply a plagiate of the old nethack game. It's a tad simpler in some sense and has added graphics. But besides that the ""developers"" seem to simply have copied the old nethack game straight off, even down to the mock scroll names. That is disturbingly bad creativity and also misleading in the game presentation. I would even go as far as question whether not explaining that this is a bit of a dumbed down graphical nethack in the presentation being dishonest.			"

												Awesome roguelike that gets more addicting the more you play.  Tons of classes.  At first was a little turned off by the sidescrolling style instead of top down for a roguelike, but it works out nicely.I tried it out on android and was a little frustrated with trying to play it on a phone and misclicking all the time, but the PC version makes it much harder to misclick because of the screen size.  Though shutting doors and some stuff can still be troublesome.  I recommend  adding some kind of outline on PC to show what your mouse is hovering over.  If these problems are resolved the game definitely would be top notch.			"

												Blindly unfair, and extremely fun despite that. Everything, and I mean everything, is determined by random number generators. You never know what something does until you either identify it or test it out. A wand of magic missile may become a wand of polymorph in another playthrough. You may get extremely lucky and find a genie lamp on floor 1, only to find out that it's cursed and the genie inside isn't too pleased with you summoning it. No matter how many times you play it, it's always a new experience.This game really stands out to me because of its unique take on 'turns'. Nothing moves until you do. As long as you don't perform an action, everything stays still as a statue. Every action, whether it's eating, equipping, attacking, or casting, takes up a certain number of frames, and monsters can take that many frames to act as well. It's an incredibly tense experience. Just imagine this: You're surrounded by kobolds and goblins, and you need to guess which unidentified scroll will teleport you out of there, or pacify all of the monsters, or, more likely, do nothing to help you, or even get you killed.WazHack has put me in some pretty incredible situations, both good and bad. More than once, I've tested a wand on a monster, only for it to summon three more, or transform a rat into a troll, or something to that effect. On the flip side, I've had runs where I found incredible items (like a ring of invisibility, an amulet of life saving, or wands of death) early on and had a fantastic time destroying everything... only for a wildly ricocheting magic bolt to end me. This game is all about the stupid deaths, and learning from your mistakes, and planning for the unknown so that you may find the elusive Amulet of Zaw and emerge from the dungeons victorious.			"

												I came across this game while looking for an interesting, challenging dungeon crawler.  Innumerable deaths later, I have yet to complete it, and yet I can't stop playing.  Between the multiple character classes, randomly respawning monsters, and the fact that each new playthrough generates an entirely random map with no guarantee of what you will or won't find, it's a very enjoyable time waster.  Add in the regular updates, in-game item rewards for reaching certain milestones, and the developers' decidedly quirky sense of humor, and I can't recommend this game enough.Fair warning: This game does have mature content (humanoids getting stripped to their underwear, potions of booze, hallucinogenic mushrooms/potions/fountains) so I wouldn't suggest it for anyone under 16.

												Wazhack is a great roguelike with a great deal of variety and options.You can pick between many classes, each of them feels different and offers another playstyle. Throughout your journey you will meet all kinds of creatures, items and people. This game is about surviving and making the best out of the situation. Scavenge for food and better equipement in order to stay alive, sometimes you might be lucky and somtimes you die pretty fast. Such is the nature of this game.But it's not frustrating, the game has a lot of options in terms of combat and choices. You get stronger by leveling up and getting better gear. Very typical stuff.The great thing about Wazhack is that is has quite a humorous character to it, some situations can be ridiculous and some effects might alter your game into insane situations. It keeps the game fresh and has always something up it's sleeve to screw you over. This is the biggest draw for me personally as it doesn't get boring and keeps you motivated.The only thing I dislike about the game is the awful aesthetics, I don't mind outdated graphics but I think the art style is just ugly. Definitely worth a buy, especially if you like roguelikes.			"

												I have read people compairing to the NetHack, I've never played that one so I'm not sure how it compairs. Althought, if you are old enough to remember the original ADOM or DND (google: ascii dungeon game) and loved how difficult and stressful those were, then this game is for you. It's like those but with graphics and no save scum (you know you did). This was worth the $5 it cost me, as I will propably get a few dozen more hours of play out of it.Things of note:1: You are going to, at some point, want to thrown your computer out the window. Don't, just try again. It will be different this time (maybe), I promise ;p2: Screaming at your monitor doesn't help, nor throwing the keyboard, it just freaks out the other people in your home3: If you are new to this type of game, Roguelike, start with the Fighter or another melee class			"

												Very fun game. Love the random dungeon and items; every time you play it's a step into the unknown. Really great game for teaching cause and effect to my 6 year old nephew, as every decision you make has consequences. You have to eat, so you have to find food. You need better gear, so do you risk equipping that sword you found or wait to identify it? Swarmed by monsters, do you fight it out or try to escape? Also, the game has a lot of text, so it forces him to play attention and read in order to know what is going on. It that a cursed sword, or a blessed sword? It that a scroll of identify, or of destroy armor? Game also has no blood and is not scary, so very kid friendly while still being a very hardcore rogue-like game. Highly recommend for both big boys, and little kids. :)			"

												Seriously, this game can be kind of unfair and each new game has a learning curve, meaning each time all items will have to be identified through random trial and error.  This does increase it's replayability, though.  I first foud this game on the app store for my phone and it was one of my favorites.  The quality and the sense of adventure is fun, and the way time only passes when you are taking an action adds a casual feel to the sometimes intense situations you stumble upon.  I kind of like the new set of characters that the developer added.  One thing that would make this game perfect is if you could custom build characters.  Starting each game with the pre-made characters can get repetative after a while.  I highly recomend this game.  It is worth the money and I feel the developer deserves it.			"

												This ia a fast-paced rogue-like/RPG/action-adventure set in a 2-d dungeon crawl. Inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, with the traditional stats, alignments, and classes. Pick a class, tweak the stats and alignment, then jump in the dungeon and explore your way to the bottom. I really had a blast playing it, and will be revisiting when I get the time.			"

												Came for the Hack; stayed for the Waz.Is it Nethack?  No.  It's a simpler, sillier game.  And Nethack was pretty silly to begin with.   It appears as a 2D game, but I think it's closer to 1 and half.  The majority of the gameplay happens on levels, with ladders connecting them.  Mobs can follow you up and down the ladders, no stairscumming here, but for the most part it plays like a 1D leveler.  With Nethack rules.  Mostly.  It's indisputable roguelike in its permadeath and its randomly generated items.  It's indisputable hacklike in its choice of items, punishments for testing scrolls and potions, and there are so many elements taken directly from hack it's beyond mistakable for anything else.  However, some of the most defining elements of hack are missing: prayer chiefly among them.  No more turn count, no more hoping your god will uncurse that item, and no more foodless achieves.  The E-Word is also unavailable, as are most of the options that were available from the # menu in hack.But it isn't Nethack, it's Wazhack.  It's added so many new things, it's got its own flavor.  The cartoony graphics are fun, especially when hallucinating.  The different classes are really different, even the male and female versions of a class have different playstyles.  I've only been playing a short while, but it seems balanced and just the right amount of accessibility.  It's hard, but I don't think it's too hard.  If you play it like an action game, you will lose.  If you play it like a roguelike, you'll have fun.It's not Nethack.  It's Wazhack, and that's ok. "

												I have read people compairing to the NetHack, I've never played that one so I'm not sure how it compairs. Althought, if you are old enough to remember the original ADOM or DND (google: ascii dungeon game) and loved how difficult and stressful those were, then this game is for you. It's like those but with graphics and no save scum (you know you did). This was worth the $5 it cost me, as I will propably get a few dozen more hours of play out of it.Things of note:1: You are going to, at some point, want to thrown your computer out the window. Don't, just try again. It will be different this time (maybe), I promise ;p2: Screaming at your monitor doesn't help, nor throwing the keyboard, it just freaks out the other people in your home3: If you are new to this type of game, Roguelike, start with the Fighter or another melee class			"

												Hopelessly Addicting. Or Spelunky Plus.I was never a huge fan of Rogue-like, Hack-likes, Bands, etc. The only one I loved was Alphaman. That said I am a fan of games like Spelunky and Dark Souls and this game will scratch that certain itch. It's just like the old random dungeon crawlers you remember but from a side scrolling perspective, and much more streamlined. Rolling a character and jumping in takes a second, and dying could take even less time. The game becomes addictive when you just want to try one more time, thinking you can do a little better next time, and never being sure of what's going to happen next. I was skeptical but was pleasantly surprised after playing. This VERY quickly became my favorite Hack-like.			"

												This game is exactly what it promises to be. And it promises to be a more accessible NetHack. The recent update (Oct 2015) has been great in that it solves most ragequittable situations and makes the game winnable even if you're not a hardcore RogueLike player.Let's first address the elephant in the room: The graphics are primitive. Yes, but that does not detract from your enjoyment of the game in any way. NetHack's graphics are ASCII-only - as are most of the RogueLike games - and it's still the most advanced and engaging RPG ever made.The gameplay heavily references NetHack, but it doesn't feel like a carbon copy. For example: you have weapons that can be enchanted, and magical scrolls that are unidentified at the start of the game. However, the movement is simpler - it's 2D instead of 3D. Hunger is less punishing and there aren't as many difficulty spikes on specific floors.All in all, this game is a great intro to the genre for new players. I have been playing NetHack and the like for maybe a dosen years and WazHack was still entertaining to me as well.			"

												Rogue-like, permadeath, a goal . . .I have been thinking a lot how to recommend Wazhack.It has all the elements to succeed, but has one major flaw too.On the positive side:- a great blend of item fever as after each death the specifications of each per wand, potion, book, scroll, gem, ...are re-shuffled.- interesting blessed & cursed items- weapons of all kinds, they sometimes even attack you- spells of life & death, light & dark. - traps & deadly monsters- healthy & poisonous food- nymphs & fountains- shops, bakeries, temples, greenlight machines, . . .- dogs, hatchlings & prisoners as companions.- romans & gnomes- dated rendered graphics but somehow they fit the game very well- nice music & atmosphere- all is random- the one more go feeling in the depth of the night/early morningOn the negative side:- all is 100% random & 100% luck and your very survival depends on it - finding the initial useful items, spells, shops & encounters. If you end up with lazy survival items arriving at 500 ft below or you find huge doors/holes in the wall on your only path down, consider yourself dead already. Especially spellcasters rely heavily on finding usefull spells which they usually don't most of the time.- Most offensive spells are hugely underpowered at higher skill & experience levels. - Initial survival - especially non-melee characters - hugely depends on their pets- A huge amount of unfairness: Sometimes monsters sense when you arrive by ladder/portal/teleport at a floor level and all home in on you - even bursting thru doors - for the kill attacking you from all sides, as if the program rolled your immediate execution/death.- Hungry? You sometimes kill mountains worth of food without finding food !- Your heroes who survived and won the game are not saved anywhere & cannot be played with again. They are just reduced to an entry in the Guildhall of Fame. New Game is your only option.Conclusion? +200 hours, 3 survived - a knight, a valkyrie & a wizard - and a myriad others died.The huge amount of deaths, randomness & required luck to keep your characters alive can very discouraging for most gamers and only harcore or some persistent gamers will give this a further try and at the end can get rewarded with a huge - but brief - feeling of accomplishment.Brief because you next tries will end up again in countless deaths and you get the feeling it was all just 100% luck. Not your skill, not your intelligence, not your resourcefulness. . . just luck.This game is a 50/50 deal. The fun comes at a high price of wasted time & many deaths.A more balanced drop of class specific survival items and a spell level/power revision will do wonders for this game . . .			"

												It's a very deep and strategic game that presents itself simplistically and comically.  It's a permadeath game, so the successes you have and the wealth you build all feel very rewarding.  Every skill and every talent that you can take upon level up is immediately evidenced in the gameplay mechanics.  There is no grind feel that you must burn through useless levels to reach a singular strength.  If you upgrade something, you'll see the difference.It's also the best use of RNG I think I've ever seen in a game.  There does not seem to be any restriction related to level or location that results in something not being potentially available to you.  It's not a boring wash/rinse/repeat of ""this is what to expect at level 1, and this is what to expect at level blah"".  You can literally start a game and have an amazing stroke of luck that puts you into a very positive flow.  You can also play very deep into the game and the whole way having felt like every breath may be your last.  This last point means that even the worst deaths that make you think you hate the game will also be the reason why you start anew and get back to it.  The next attempt can quickly outshine your last.A suggestion for potential new players:  There are online sources (wiki) which can quickly guide you toward big success in the game.  For hardcore players, I recommend you don't use those online sources and first attempt to completely use your imagination when playing through this.  There are incredibly sensible and logical mechanics built into this game that make it very different from the normal dungeon crawler or rpg.			"

												Classic rogue-like gameplay, and very difficult. The game is completely randomized, and you'll die a lot just because you can't find any helpful items or because you run into a situation that you can't get out of. That's really what makes it fun, though.You have to take risks to get stronger: testing wands, trying on equipment, or opening doors. When they pay off, you end up more prepared to go deeper, but when they backfire, you can find yourself surrounded by enemies or locked into a really crappy set of equipment. Most games are pretty short, though, and the terrible runs are mixed in with the fun ones enough to keep me coming back. That said, I've never beaten it.			"

												Strangely addictive and plenty of things to do.Edit: After the latest update, Waz proves there's even more ways to die in this never-gets-old game.			"

												Great game, so many monsters and items, and fun for people who like Roguelike and dungeon crawlers. But it is very hard. When I got to atleast 600 feet, I thought I was ""mid game"". Turns out, this game is a lot harder than I first thought.			"

												This game is so derivative of NetHack that they even use the same random-sounding names for scrolls.If you like NetHack, you will like WazHack.  I like NetHack, so there you go.  Nevertheless, after playing this for a while, I felt a strong urge to go play the vastly superior Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup instead.I recommend this game, but not unreservedly.			"

												Rogue-like, permadeath, a goal . . .I have been thinking a lot how to recommend Wazhack.It has all the elements to succeed, but has one major flaw too.On the positive side:- a great blend of item fever as after each death the specifications of each per wand, potion, book, scroll, gem, ...are re-shuffled.- interesting blessed & cursed items- weapons of all kinds, they sometimes even attack you- spells of life & death, light & dark. - traps & deadly monsters- healthy & poisonous food- nymphs & fountains- shops, bakeries, temples, greenlight machines, . . .- dogs, hatchlings & prisoners as companions.- romans & gnomes- dated rendered graphics but somehow they fit the game very well- nice music & atmosphere- all is random- the one more go feeling in the depth of the night/early morningOn the negative side:- all is 100% random & 100% luck and your very survival depends on it - finding the initial useful items, spells, shops & encounters. If you end up with lazy survival items arriving at 500 ft below or you find huge doors/holes in the wall on your only path down, consider yourself dead already. Especially spellcasters rely heavily on finding usefull spells which they usually don't most of the time.- Most offensive spells are hugely underpowered at higher skill & experience levels. - Initial survival - especially non-melee characters - hugely depends on their pets- A huge amount of unfairness: Sometimes monsters sense when you arrive by ladder/portal/teleport at a floor level and all home in on you - even bursting thru doors - for the kill attacking you from all sides, as if the program rolled your immediate execution/death.- Hungry? You sometimes kill mountains worth of food without finding food !- Your heroes who survived and won the game are not saved anywhere & cannot be played with again. They are just reduced to an entry in the Guildhall of Fame. New Game is your only option.Conclusion? +200 hours, 3 survived - a knight, a valkyrie & a wizard - and a myriad others died.The huge amount of deaths, randomness & required luck to keep your characters alive can very discouraging for most gamers and only harcore or some persistent gamers will give this a further try and at the end can get rewarded with a huge - but brief - feeling of accomplishment.Brief because you next tries will end up again in countless deaths and you get the feeling it was all just 100% luck. Not your skill, not your intelligence, not your resourcefulness. . . just luck.This game is a 50/50 deal. The fun comes at a high price of wasted time & many deaths.A more balanced drop of class specific survival items and a spell level/power revision will do wonders for this game . . .			"

												This is my go-to game when I want to just relax. Until I get killed, then I'm not so relaxed....This game is easy to learn, but I will probably never master it.  Even after all the hours I have put in, I still haven't beaten the game.			"

												Explore a dungeon, kill creatures, find treasure, and try to stay alive! While delving deeper and deeper, you will meet helpful shopkeepers and menacing kings. Try your luck with a mysterious potion, of drinking from a (hopefully) refreshing fountain!Wazhack has quaint charm in that your characters get a pet as a companion. This turns out to quite helpful, and personally kept me company as my character entered more and more dangerous levels.You learn as you go - challenging but fun. If you find that this style of play is something you enjoy, it has good replay value.Overall rating: 7/10			"

												I love this game for imploring the player to use exploration to FIND OUT THINGS FOR THEMSELVES! Yeah, that's right, each time you start a new run, scrolls, potions, wands, gems and much more objects each randomize their effects, so you have to figure out what each type does, otherwise you won't get ahead in the game.This game wants you to play the game how ever you want to, you can pick from a vast range of classes, who start with different items, and sometimes come with pets you will have to take care of (or send into a horde of enemies). Overall, it is a difficult rogue-like game with interesting randomized features and a menagerie of cool monsters to slash to pieces.TL;DR: It's got random stuff, and monsters, and it's fun.			"

												Classic rogue-like gameplay, and very difficult. The game is completely randomized, and you'll die a lot just because you can't find any helpful items or because you run into a situation that you can't get out of. That's really what makes it fun, though.You have to take risks to get stronger: testing wands, trying on equipment, or opening doors. When they pay off, you end up more prepared to go deeper, but when they backfire, you can find yourself surrounded by enemies or locked into a really crappy set of equipment. Most games are pretty short, though, and the terrible runs are mixed in with the fun ones enough to keep me coming back. That said, I've never beaten it.			"

												It's a very deep and strategic game that presents itself simplistically and comically.  It's a permadeath game, so the successes you have and the wealth you build all feel very rewarding.  Every skill and every talent that you can take upon level up is immediately evidenced in the gameplay mechanics.  There is no grind feel that you must burn through useless levels to reach a singular strength.  If you upgrade something, you'll see the difference.It's also the best use of RNG I think I've ever seen in a game.  There does not seem to be any restriction related to level or location that results in something not being potentially available to you.  It's not a boring wash/rinse/repeat of ""this is what to expect at level 1, and this is what to expect at level blah"".  You can literally start a game and have an amazing stroke of luck that puts you into a very positive flow.  You can also play very deep into the game and the whole way having felt like every breath may be your last.  This last point means that even the worst deaths that make you think you hate the game will also be the reason why you start anew and get back to it.  The next attempt can quickly outshine your last.A suggestion for potential new players:  There are online sources (wiki) which can quickly guide you toward big success in the game.  For hardcore players, I recommend you don't use those online sources and first attempt to completely use your imagination when playing through this.  There are incredibly sensible and logical mechanics built into this game that make it very different from the normal dungeon crawler or rpg.			"

												Amazing roguelike. This game actually is a roguelike, not a roguelike-like like Spelunky or Binding of Isaac. It's extremely fun, although the learning curve is pretty steep.			"

												WazHack is incredably addictive and sooooo much fun. I would name it my game of the year 2k13 and 2k14 I have sunk hours into this game, and yet the best ive ever gotten is 2800ft down. Its devilishly difficult but it never makes me want to stop playing. If you think dark souls is hard, youve never played wazhack ;DUpdate I've played it for hundreds of hours and it still keeps owning me yet I come back for more. This is a testament to how good it is!			"

												Played this alot on the mobile port and browser.Permadeath, randomly generated dungeons and the huge variety of classes, items, spells, creatures and encounters make this game closest to infinite replayability as games can get with current tech.You can play this game so many different ways; from a lichen harvesting druid, to a witch with an entourage of tamed citters. U can play a bard using musical instruments as ur primary action.Every class has a variety of passive skills to unlock and level up to teir 3. The skills are shared by some classes but every class has a unique combination. Spells are unlock by finding a book and being smart enought actually read it.So many little logical things can be combined that arn't just some menu button. For example crafting a wood construct is done by dropping a pile of wooden items and casting polymorph on it or dropping a bunch of mushrooms to attracts pixies.Also one of the main systems is indentifying items. you might pick up 10 swords and until u identify them they will seemthe same froma glance, but using them will quickly reveal some may be cursed or have negative damage or maby resistant to rust. There is just so much to this game, if you are still not sure, their is a FREE DEMO on mobile.Now to mention the mobile version to unlock both genders of a class is $1 for a total of $10 and th mobile version is just as good.

												Death is the lesson - something to learn with each playthrough while conditioning your knowledge for the next attempt. Hardcore in one of its simplest forms, yet vast as far as decisions go. Luck can be your best friend and salvation, but learning whats available in game and the possibilities can it be played through rationally..sometimes you feel.Only 311 Fathoms deep and still have no clue how deep the rabbit hole goes.

												MAKE PERMANENT DEATH OPTIONAL!  This would be my favorite dungeon crawling game were it not for the perma death feature.  I enjoy finding unidentified items.  Using or reading them with unknown consequences is part of the fun of this game.  So why permanent death permanently?  Please modify this game to set perma death as a player-selected option.			"

												Good grief, please keep the coloured eggs as an option after the event, Theyre the most cheerful, life saving thing and excellent for people not only new to the game, but new to the genre, to feel out the rules until they want to turn it off and learn to be precisely conservative. Either way, the joy of finding an egg to open it up is excellent morale buff when youve had a few bad deaths. Doesnt have to be eggs, anything. They're cool. I like eggs.			"
