												This game is $35.It adds HD graphics (it is pretty), controller support and windowed mode. That is all, at least that I've seen.The DLC for this game is $25. It consists solely of costumes you will never use and are inferior to the base-game armors.I've had the game lock up on me several times, unable to progress until I loaded a previous save from about an hour ago. You cannot save in the middle of missions. Good luck!Fable: The Lost Chapters is available for $10 and includes all of the same content minus the DLCs and the aforementioned additions. Unless your hobbies include frivolous spending and frustration regarding games not working correctly, you should save your money.			"

												The biggest issue with Fable Anniversary is that if you didn't play the original around the time of release, or if you're not a Fable fan, then this game will feel very dated by todays standards.I personally find Fable 1 to be the best in the series, it was full of potential, it didn't have a rubbish co-op mode tacked on, you dont get forced to have a dog, the story is somehwat decent, & the humour is there as usual.If you've never played Fable before & this will be your first, you may struggle to enjoy it the way we all did years ago. So we have two ratings for this mini review, one for previous players, one for new players.7/10 - If you played the OG title, this ratings for you, it's the game you remember, but shinier & with The Lost Chapters included.5/10 - If you've never played Fable, you may enjoy the game but it will seem very mediocre & dated.

												I was very excited about this game considering that Fable TLC is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time. My expectations were simple: that this would be an upgrade to the beloved game I grew up playing. My mind was open when I first played Anniversary, knowing very well that the nastalgia from the first game would be influencing my feelings. Nevertheless, I would have expected my bias towards the series to lead towards a raving review. Instead I'm overwhelmingly compelled to advise other potential players to not waste their money on this lazy production.""Laziness"" on behalf of the developers is truly the best summary I can offer. The graphics have been updated  but that's where the careful effort ends. This game is loaded with bugs and glitches. I had to stop playing about maybe 1/8 of the way through because the pause menu got stuck. Let me repeat that: the pause menu got stuck. This is the only bug I'll take the time to mention because I think it's the most telling of how severely poor of a job the developers did porting the game. At some point, for no identifyable reason, I stopped being able to access any of my clothing, inventory, or skills through the pause menu because it would continuously scroll through every tab and option. It was as if whatever key was supposed to scroll down was stuck (it obviously wasn't). To be unable to level up, use items or view quests in a game such as this simply means that it is unplayable.Take a moment to look up other glitches people have encountered. Even if they are not quite as critical as this they are indicative of the experience you'll have with this game. It falls short of so many basic, fundamental expectations; it is a product without soul or passion.My final, most disheartening complaint is probably trivial in comparison, but I have to mention it: you can't get drunk anymore. I don't think it's much to ask for -- it was a quirky feature that made frequenting the taverns fun. I can't even begin to tell you how many quests I would go on in TLC with my character knocking beers back one after another. When questioned about this absent feature in public forums the developers claimed that it was ""a low priority"". They've sacrificied gameplay, gutted stability and tossed away functionaility for better graphics in a new game engine. I remember playing the first game and having fantasies of how it could have been better. The game was great, but there was something about it that you just instinctively knew there could be so much more to it. I kind of always hoped they'd somehow justify building it out some more, drilling down on the gameplay elements and turning it into a more immersive experience. The Anniversary release managed to step down that road then subsequently run in the opposite direction. It is a graphically-polished abomination.			"

												(This is a rereview and I got this game as well as its dlc for free as a beta tester)A little bit about the game: Fable Anniversary is a remastering of the 2005 remake of the original 2004 title ""Fable"". This 2005 remake is simply known as Fable: The Lost Chapters and was quite a sizeable overhaul in that it added new items, weapons, spells, monsters, quests, locations, abilities and more. In addition to minor tweaks, the remake also featured a slightly extended story as well as small subplots and relatively unimportant characters being made far more prominent in the game. Apart from this, Fable's still very much the same game at its core. It's an action/role-playing/semi open-world game and it has you playing as the Hero of Oakvale. I use ""open-world"" loosely as some areas are not unlocked until certain missions are completed (think Grand Theft Auto). Anyway, you start the game as a young boy who is to journey across the fictional land of Albion and make a name for himself.Right from the start the game's unique sense of humour, somewhat dark story and moral alignment system are all put on display. It's totally up to the player as to how you interact with everyone else and what kind of Albion you envision. Gameplay and controls are solid and very typical of a third-person game, so they're not hard to get used to. Satisfying combat, the variety of enemies and the 3 distinct fighting styles (melee, ranged, spells) all keep the player engaged. While the main story takes around 10-15 hours: character customization, numerous sidequests and the various activities will massively inflate your playtime. There's also the memorable soundtrack to look forward to, however, the overall voice acting is something I struggle with - its serviceable but it's not amazing either. All this being said, Fable's still a fun RPG and a game anyone can pick up and be entertained with.PROS- runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and well optimized when compared to the original game (as of the latest patch)- true widescreen (unrestricted resolution with appropriate field-of-view; V-Sync caps the game at 60 FPS but disabling it will allow your PC to run the game at whatever FPS it can manage)- textures and “character updates” mostly look decent (although some will prefer the old look)- the new lighting system + particle effects, better facial animations and improved lip-sync are all great- audio quality has noticeably improved and surround sound is now supported- controllers are supposedly fully supported (I used a keyboard for all my playthroughs though)- new control schemes (one control scheme is inspired by Fable II and III which is neat)- new Heroic difficulty mode is fun and surprisingly challenging- most bugs, exploits, balancing issues and major complaints from the original game have been addressed (e.g. you now age 50% slower and scar less from combat unlike the original game)- Steamworks integration (cloud, achievements and workshop) and Steam trading cards- a few new outfits and weapons that weren't in the original game (these are free DLC from the Xbox 360 version)- free modding DLC (this didn't take off though and you only have clothes and animations to work with)NEUTRAL- severe lack of Steam workshop mods- 2 pricey DLC packs that bundle together DLC from the Xbox 360 version (both are optional and give you additional weapons and outfits that weren't in the original game)CONS- the $35 price tag (for new players it's okay but I can understand why owners of the original game would feel it's a bit too much when the original game is great and still holds up well)- the near-perfect UI from the original game has been swapped in exchange for one that feels more orientated for controller users (it’s clunky but still serviceable and feels less cluttered)- the Hero of Oakvale’s face for all ages was changed (this visual update might frustrate some people as some of the faces in the original game looked better)- some minor bugs still remain unfixed- a few old animations that stand out nowadays- no mouse sensitivity option (mouse-related options can be tweaked externally though)It's always hard to recommend a remaster because of the new-game price tag but if you really enjoyed the original Fable or are new to Fable altogether: I can recommend this title. For those who own the game already... there may or may not be enough to justify purchasing this game. Some who liked the original game may even prefer Fable: The Lost Chapters over this and that's fine. Indeed, Anniversary contains a lot of changes that can be noted as both good and bad but if you expected a remaster and just a remaster - it should deliver for the most part. I think that's why it deserves a 8/10.Reason for rereview (optional read): I was never really happy with my original review so I deleted it and started a new one somewhat from scratch. When Fable: Anniversary first released I thought it was great but I somehow managed to avoid almost of all the technical issues that were reported. As soon as I found out about them though, I became more active on the game's community hub and incorporated potential solutions I found into that old review. Other issues that I did experience - such as the mouse cursor not being used in menus and the inability to rebind most keys - I carelessly failed to mention in that same review because they personally didn't bother me much. While all of these issues shouldn't have been in the game to begin with, I'm happy they got patched out in the end and relatively quickly too. So that, along with my original review looking admittedly a bit nostalgic (which I was told by a few Steam users), were the reasons I decided to rereview this game. With this rereview I also decided to add a pros and cons list which hopefully get my points across better.P.S. If you like these reviews and want to see more of the same, you're more than welcome to follow my curator page. If you don't like curators or groups, I completely understand (I'm not a big fan either). It's just a much easier way to find old and new reviews I've made: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rblc#curation "

Fable, an old, great RPG!Fable Anniversary is a remake of the original Fable - The Lost Chapters. But to be honest, it hasn't changed much since 2004. I bought this game because I had lot of fun with it in the past. The only things that had changed are some textures, dynamic shadows, the sunlight effects and the screen size (original 4:3). That's all.If you compare the two versions the remake looks definitly better, but this doesn't justifies a price of 32€!To the positive facts:++ nice storyline (same like original)++ individual character++ decisions affect the story+ ""Legendary"" difficulty!+ you can choose between good & evil+ graphic is o.k.+ nice soundtrack (no big selection, but o.k.)+ many sidequests+ nice design (of the area and NPC's)+ an active, changing world+ about 15 hours playtime (acceptable for a RPG)+ achievements and trading cardsnow the bad things...- I liked the textures more in the ""normal"" version- you can't change your face and skincolour- ugly old, tattooed, scar plated character in the end- 32€?! 15€, o.k. 32€? - gtfo.- some bugs, but no big deal- DLC are not necessary and cost way too much!- you CAN'T change the keyboard layout!- the inventory looks awful- at all nothing big changed, so the price isn't justifiedI tell you, if you liked ""Fable - The Lost Chapters"" you will also like the remake version. But don't buy it for the full price, it's way too much. Wait for a sale and than grab it! :-)For all the other players outside there, I think it will be interesting for you, if you like RPG's and games were YOU make the story (in some little ways).because of those negative aspects, I have to give ""Fable Anniversary"": 6,5/10thank you for reading my review and have a good day :-)			"

												I really wanted to like this game, I played the original and really enjoyed it and I played the sequels and with each prgoressive game the quality got worse. Sure the visuals got better each time, but each time the humorous additives lessened until they were eliminated in Fable III. This return to the original is very disappointing. They upgraded the graphics yes, but that seems to be just about it. The controls are the same but can thankfully be retuned to their better counterparts from later games. The animations are a HUGE disappointment. The models look a bit better but definitely nothing like what we saw in Fable III, the animations for them are not even remotely changed and this makes the new models pointless if they don't have updated animations as well. They still remain stiff and awkward and very simple. The models themselves don't even do the original characters justice. Maze looks awful with that awful goatee that just sticks out like a sore thumb. Whisper's head is all wrong for the entire prologue looking like it should on a young adult whisper as opposed to a kid a little older than the player. The child character, oh man is that a monstrosity. It doesn't even remotely match or even harken to the old child hero. The new character models for villagers are at least decent. But overall the lack of attention or faithfulness to the original character designs does not bode well. Thankfully the music is still quite good, but it is disappointing that nothing appears to have been remastered or redone as would be normal for a HD remake. The cutscenes appear to not be changed at all, still using transparent renders from the original version. Overall this ""HD"" remake appears to be not even worth the effort Lionhead put in it, I had high hopes the new creative head would lead the company to better endeavours but clearly this is not the case. The HD remake hasn't done the game justice in my opinion and is definitely not worth 35 dollars. Maybe 15 if you stretch it. This isn't a HD re-release, it's a nostalgia trap. 4/10 While the original game is still there, there's not been near enough done to improve on the old and just leaves the remake a flashy mess.			"

												While this is a ""Remastered"" version of the original X-Box Fable, gameplay elements certainly aged. You will notice the story has no pace at all and things just happen too quickly in cutscenes.  Combat is all about mashing the attack button.However the game is unique and still has its charm. Lots of silly fun can be had with it.If you are into action button mashing games and open world RPG, then I recommend to get this game when it is on sale.			"

												Fable Anniversary delivers what it promised; A prettier version of the original game.The game has aged well on its own, but the new graphics definitely make me personally want to play it more than the original. And that's honestly about it; it only ropes me in for the nostalgia.This isn't a game for everyone, however, as it does run into some problems. I can't stand the new UI, which is clonky and harder to navigate than the original's, and the implementation of the DLC is pretty bland and honestly not worth considering. As others have no doubt already pointed out, the pricing is outrageous for a simple HD rerelease. For the full, and best experience of the Fable franchise, you're better off sticking to Fable: TLC which is only 10 dollars. Anniversary is about $35 with DLC being a total of $25. The DLC offers nothing new to the game except fancy accessories that are weaker than the Vanilla armors and weapons. $60 dollars for the full ""Anniversary"" experience versus a $10 fee for the original vanilla experience. The difference in pricing is absurd, and the fact that the developers want 60 dollars for an old game with a new paint job is just stupid.The only bug I have run into personally is one where the game crashes while trying to spend experience points, but that in itself is enough to warrant negative attention as it breaks immersion.Once the game goes down in price, I'd recommend this game to anyone new to the Fable franchise, as it really holds up better than the sequels of the original game. Until then, however, stick with the $10 TLC.			"

												This is hardly a remaster. They put in new character models, and thats it. The animations are the same and the cutscenes were not redone and all have the resolution of a baked potato. Even the little gifs in the level up menu are the same. They show the old graphics and are compressed to all hell. On top of that, all the same bugs are present that were in the original. ALL OF THEM. Dialogue clips playing too late and getting cut off, bad camera that cuts off your face in cutscenes or shoots your neck, and for some reason the trader in the arena was closed (how?). There are also NEW bugs, like the animation for chests opening are apparently only 5 frames and look hella choppy. For god's sake the character models aren't even that good and all the hair and facial hair look plastered on. You can see that it starts as a texture and the hair model itself is just sort of hovering on top. At least in the original hair didn't look like it was glued on.They also changed some of the game mechanics. Namely they changed it so that shops suck now. Its been a long time since I played the original, but I don't remember shops being this picky. A shop that specializes in gifts and crap that will buy rubies and diamonds, but not sapphires is ridiculous. Shops that will buy dark versions of armor but not bright or regular, shops only having 2 health potions in stock, shops that will buy my obsidian katana, but not my steel katana. What the hell kind of economy is this? I shouldn't have to go town to town just to find someone who wants to buy my ♥♥♥♥ing sapphires. They're sapphires.This is a prime example of how bad a remaster can be. It's less ""mastered"" than the original. They managed to lose some master while remastering.			"

												If you want Fable, go back to the original plus Lost Chapters. I loved the original Fable, but this port is not worth the extra money. When first announced, I was excited because I thought they'd improve upon the original. Fix issues with the old one, gameplay or glitch wise, maybe add in a couple new quests, and fix the bad user interface and player menus.Instead, it's really only a graphical difference. Worse yet, the graphics aren't really that much better. Sure, they smoothed things up and fixed up some lighting effects, but the models (especially the faces) are ugly as sin. I was hoping (more than anything else) they'd take a page from Fable 2 & 3, and give the option to buy a house without killing the occupants. Instead, it looks like that's still the plan. At least they looked at the menu options. Well, they looked but they did not fix. In fact, they made them worse. I bought this game for the PC, I WANT TO USE A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE. You cannot rebind keys. The default Keyboard/Mouse keys I cannot imagine are good for a right-handed player. For a left-handed player like myself, they're murder. The menu is horribly clunky. If I want an to equip a sword, for example. Imagine I've already navigated the maze of menu options to get there. Then, to actually equip the sword, you don't push enter. you push A. ON THE KEYBOARD. If you want to go back? B. The letter B. Not escape, that won't work.Yes, I know controllers are available that work with my PC. I don't want them, I'm comfortable with my keyboard and mouse. As a big fan of Fable games (I own them all) this is insulting. The graphics are softer. The cutscenes still look like they're from the original (pixels EVERYWHERE). There's no customization to how I want to play a game that's all about customization. The User Interface is worse than before. There's a stupid book opening animation that has to play everytime you open the game or want to exit back to menu. This is a horrible addition to the Fable family. I'll probably play it again, I paid for it. Don't make the same mistake.EDIT: Upon assistance from another player, he revealed that you actually need to be on your sepcific character before the option to change controls appears. While this provides immense relief, left-handed players may be distraught to discover you cannot rebind end, delete, pgdn or pgup, home or insert. Further, the numberpad keys cannot be assigned to the hotbar keys. Still, I count this as a victory, and a lot of my stress about the game has been removed.			"

												This game has a very specific character. On the one hand, it displays a dorky, sometimes childish type of humor (fart joke level), on the other hand, it gets really dark at certain points: I am talking about villains slaughtering helpless civilians, torturing children and murdering hostages in front of your eyes. There are summarizing scenes at the end of each story chapter in a seriously epic tone, presenting you as the heir of a mysterious power and saviour of the world from the rule of demons and the undead. In contrast to that, you can donate books to a school and watch the little ones recite the lines on stage, giggling at the mature content, or you can go to the beach and participate in a competition called Chicken Kickin' (yes, the name is a literal description!). And it is not just comic relief, the overall atmosphere, at least for the most part, is playful and self-ironic. Slay an ugly monster, then take its head, go to the next town, and run around showing it to everyone to enjoy the applause. Choose a fabulous nom-de-guerre, like ""Liberator"" or ""The Hood"", and listen to everyone you see talking about you until you cannot even hear it yourself anymore. Find a sick child in the poor quarter of a town, learn that you need certain mushrooms to save it - then get one of those by performing a Russian style dance number in front of a woman to make her laugh and give you the shroom as  a reward... These examples should give you an idea of the vibe.The production value is undeniably excellent: The artstyle is captivating and flawlessly executed, in all departments from graphics (both environment and animations) via sound (atmospheric and beautiful music, the voice acting always top-notch!) to the writing (actually interesting lore-texts,  diversified quests with creative solutions and twists) - I feel that a lot of love went into these aspects.The character development I find a little unbalanced. You have access to high level gear pretty early, and then, armour and weapons don't change that much any longer. Other games have succeeded to give you more intermediate goals to work for. Also, it does not help that the title everybody knows you under (like ""Liberator"") is not earned by heroic deeds, but purchased from a trader after you have become tired of hearing your default title all the time (""Chicken Chaser""). Nevertheless, I appreciate that you see your hero growing up from his traumatic childhood experience via the training as a youngling (which is, at the same time, the tutorial thus integrated in your personal story - kudos to whomever had that idea!) to the point where you are a grown man and a famous hero in the end. This organic development of your story is a big plus. There are a few annoying things though: - The inventory is divided into different parts and subparts, which makes sense somehow, but you need many clicks and scrolls when you want to find a specific consumable or tool. - NPCs are only available during a limited part of the game day, and there is no ""wait x hours"" function, which makes you run around and look for some public mattress with a suspicious blanket to sleep in - it is not only kind of ""ew"" and underwhelming, it is a lot of unnecessary running. - Some quests give you too little choices; e.g. I wanted to complete the game as a noble hero, including the charitable task of collecting books for the local school - but you cannot do that legally, you have to steal certain books from the houses of people who just welcomed you with cheers of love and admiration; that bothered me a little. - There are too many loading screens!- Also, I never like it when enemies respawn endlessly, it belittles the achievement of having defeated those enemies before and encourages farming - a technical, non-immersive form of playing an RPG. But that is a matter of taste.The combat is not very well designed in my opinion. It is interesting for a while, specifically when you are still discovering all the new types of enemies, but after the waves of identical opponents in the Arena quest, you have seen (almost) everything and can only expect repetitions of the same patterns while you mash your buttons. The most annoying thing about the whole game though is the ease with which enemies stagger you, even if you parry and wear heavy armour. Some types like trolls, nymphs and the final enemy of the main quest send you to the ground every few seconds (!) because they spam unblockable power attacks from a distance. That does not feel good, you don't feel powerful and heroic at this point, and you don't feel well entertained either when you constantly watch your toon picking himself up. I think this is a cheap way of adding artificial difficulty and takes away from the immersion and the fun. Still, there are many features to enjoy: Minigames within the game like the aforementioned Chicken Kickin' or the numerous cardgames in the taverns, the various demon door riddles you can solve for bonus loot, or the challenge to buy and upgrade houses in all the towns, maybe even marry one of your nameless, but quite attractive groupies...If you don't take this game (or life in general) too seriously, you will get the most out of it.Bottom line: A game with character and a lot of creative content, some (mostly technical) flaws, but nevertheless good entertainment; overall a 7/10.

												Fable Anniversary is a fairly underwhelming remake of the original Fable.The original Fable is a classic hack and slash/rpg. It's a simple game with a lot of humor and a nice focus on character customization. I greatly enjoyed playing through it as a variety of characters from an Archer who only used bows to a guy who just used his fists. It had a nice story and had lots of content with it's Lost Chapters release. To coincide with Fable's 10th anniversary the developers at Lionhead went about to remake the game. While I think their hearts were in the right place the execution is way off.The things the remake does well can be seen in the screenshots. They ported the entire game to the Unreal 3 engine. They made the environments and lighting look absolutely steller. The way they made the lighting look on the player's armor looks impressive as hell but that's to be expected from such a modern engine.That's... about all the improvements that are worth noting. The game plays identically to the original. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing it means negative aspects of the original game like the pathfinding and the friendly AI are still terrible. They also refused to add any new content the fans begged them to add like a female protagonist option. It is just a straight up port of the game to the Unreal 3 engine and it feels almost like a fanmade remake of the game.This would be all well and good but a huge problem with this release of the game is how they decided to replace the character models. The characters in Fable Anniversary look like goblins. It clashes heavily with the exaggerated proportions the game has. The hair looks like plastic, and as a result half of the hairstyles from the original game look like absolute garbage. The lipsync is completely out of sync. Which would've been acceptable back in 2004 but is completely unprofessional for a game in 2015. The absolute worst part of this release was the changed user interface. They replaced the very PC style user interface with this extremely clunky unintuative gamepad interface. It's hard to find what you want in the interface and you constantly select the incorrect parts of the menu. I HATE the interface in this release of the game. I don't understand how they could've dropped the ball so hard. I can see the reasoning behind remaking Fable. But this really needed more care and attention put to it. It feels very paint by numbers like the developers really didn't know what people liked about the original game. Apart from the very welcome addition of xinput support, there is virtually no reason to buy this release over the original. Especially since the original is also on Steam, 30$ cheaper. I don't really know who to blame for this release of the game but considering how good Halo Anniversary was, I'm more inclined to blame Lionhead.			"

												This game was a little rough at the start, I admit it.Lionhead seems to be taking quick action with the PC Game and listening to the community.Patches were deployed and the game is now PC friendly with mouse menu support and official workshop support.The artwork has been entirely redone, but not to the point where it doesn't feel like Fable.This game is for people who loved the Fable franchise and want to relive it in HD.If you're expecting an entirely new game, you're going to be sorely disappointed. The remake is well done and will make Fable have longer replayability for that much longer.			"

												I had played the original Fable mutiple times and it was pretty enjoyable. So when I heard about the anniversary edition I was very excited to see what they improved upon.Unfortunately, what they mean by ""Anniversary Edition"" is ""Retexture Pack.""Yes, it does introduce the Heroic difficulty, has some new DLC, and now allows for modding. That said, the new DLC is just costume packs and the modding is a joke. They had wasted a wonderful opportunity to improve on what is widely considered a classic RPG. For instance the slogan for this game ""FOR EVERY CHOICE, A CONSEQUENCE"" is a joke! Nothing you do has any major impact on the game. Whether you're good or evil (there's no in-between here) you end up in the same position with, at best, minor fluctuations. The animation is still a clunky mess and so is the dialogue. I liked this game for what it was, but what it is now is an old game that hasn't aged well. With that and the failure to improve on anything of greater value, I would not recommend this game to anyone who played the original. Your memories of this game are better than the game itself.			"

												Great game. I see why people might not like it, but for a person who really liked Fable 3 (got into the franchise there), I like this game so much more. After playing this one for 25 hours, I tried to pick up Fable 3 again, and wow I just realized how bad that game is. If you liked any of the fable games, this one will be a good addition to your collection.			"

												Real talk:It's a good game, but there is literally no update to this and the original. The physics, gameplay, movement of characters, story line (given, but I was hoping for an extra treat), etc. is all the same from the old fable. The graphics are muddier than before, and I feel you should get the entire game without needing DLCs. Honestly, save your $60 for the full game and buy the old one which has great graphics for its ages, for $10.			"

												As soon as you gain control of your character, you can feel this is an incredibly lazy port. The movement and camera are still very awkward, stubborn and juttery. Even though I'm using an analog stick, it feels like I'm playing a game entirely designed to work with a d-pad; I don't quite seem to have control, as though I'm telling my character where to go, and he's moving only in the vague direction. The character constantly gets caught on walls, boxes, anything he can find really.All of this was in the original game, and it was forgiveable a decade ago, but now, they should really have done better. I know it sounds like I'm nitpicking, but poor movement and camera in an action RPG really mars an otherwise great game.The graphics have been improved. Though they aren't fantastic, they are enough and make the game far more playable than the original, which has certainly not aged well in terms of looks.Other than the graphics, all that seems to have changed is the UI. Parts are far better, other parts are the same if not worse. The d-pad menu in the bottom left is still atrocious to navigate, but the other menus are good now.I have been recommending this game since the day it was released, and I will continue to, but I cannot recommend this port. The bare minimum effort has been put in, and it's clear within minutes that this is nothing but a cheap cash grab. I want more people to enjoy this amazing game, I really do. I just can't lie and say this is worth buying.Fable deserves better than this.			"

												Coming back from school, and firing either Fable: The Lost Chapters or Black & White 2 in your old, clunky PC, then spending the day playing them, those were the days, and oh, how great they were.This review will be simple, for players that already played The Lost Chapters, and are feeling nostalgic, this is a must, basically an improvement over the original game, just putting it up to date with better graphics and fixes, just buy it and enjoy again those days.Now, if you've never played The Lost Chapters, nor any Fable:This is third person adventure/action game combined with RPG and the premise of: Will you be a hero, or a villain?Indeed, the choice is yours to do whatever you want to do. Kill villagers that are traveling to the city to buy stuff and steal their precious posessions? Go for it! Want to defend the poor villagers from robbers? Oh, you sure can. In fact, lots of missions can be accepted in 2 ways, example being 2 missions that are either; robbers that need help stealing from a farm and will hire you to defend the farm, or guards needing an extra hand with the security of said farm. Now, actions have consequences, if you're truly bad people will be afraid of you, your skin will shatter and horns will grow out your head, and if you're good, your eyes will turn blue and a halo will be put above your head. Of course, it's not as simple as good or evil, your choices have direct impact on your character and they'll show a bit of horns if you're just being a bit evil. Also, want to mention about dying; if you die, you'll forever receive an scar in a random place in your body that is impossible to remove.The story is alright, you're a kid with a great family in a village, and you start the game in the birthday of your sister, you need to buy her a gift, which is a chocolate box if I don't recall badly, that is 5 coins of gold, and you need to get 5 coins, and this is basically a tutorial that doens't feel a tutorial at all, you can choose a few things to do. You will see a woman angry that her husband isn't home, and you need to find him, and then decide wether or not to be good or bad (I don't want to spoil), and then twist! You're in a hall of heroes, and you'll need to train and grow up to be a hero, and then choose your path.Gameplay is not really dated, it feels great to use your bow to kill enemies from far away, and with a simple touch of a key, you're holding your 2 handed sword ready to blow them off, or you can always use magic. Lots and lots of magic abilities to choose from, leveling up is so good because as I said, actions have consequences, and the more strenght you put in your character, the more he'll look like a bodybuilder, and there are quite a few secrets in which you'll need certain amount of strenght/speed/magic abilities :).Sounds and graphics are nice, nothing extraordinary, they're excellent if you think of a game that is this old, but they're only good if you take into acount that we're in 2016 already.Overall; buy this game and feel for yourself what everyone has been speaking about for years. You WILL have fun.			"

												Fable Anniversary is a ""HD Remake of the Original Extended Version Fable: The Lost Chapters."" Keep in mind it is the ""HD Remake"" not ""Fable 4."" So many people are giving this game a bad name for the wrong reasons, its been 10 Years since the release of the original game and to celebrate Lionheart have done a HD Remake of their game, of course it will run the same.Now lets talk about the gameplay. Fable Anniversary has been masterfully re-crafted the original Fable with beautiful textures. Its absolutely stunning, I could not help myself staring at the landscape while being ganked by couple of those filthy hobbes and bandits. The game ran smoothly for me and could not help myself reminicise good moments when I was playing Fable TLC. Combat system is still fantastic like its predecessor although some of the enemies I thought were just cheap and annoying. The NPCs are still funny and a tad stupid like one time I just went to the Bowerstone Inn for a Quest when random villagers kept applauding and laughing at me when I was trying to have a chat with a Quest Giver. The story for me is still excellent and lovely. Pretty much my experience with this game have been awesome the only problems were some of the bugs that were initally on before the update. Controls for the PC are a bit strange and would personally recommend controller. Now everything is great. Even though the game might not seem new this game has ""mods"" which will definitely have some bonuses. So overall, this game I would recommend to people, even though people might say this game is trash it is their opinion. For me I love this game and is a great HD-Remake Port for the PC.			"

												I played Fable 2 and 3 before I played this one and hooo boy was it worth my money.This game really does have a really interesting vibe to it, like the two sequels. The story on it's own can be a bit shallow as there is very little background information, but if you've played the sequels, you will love this one. Gameplay is not as variable as fable 2 and 3, but remember: This game is over 10 years old (initial release 2004) and this is merely an improved texture to the original. The combat can feel a bit clunky at times, but when it doesn't it does combat right in all the good ways. When you get into the flow of the game, the clunky feel rarely occurs. All in all I'd rate it a solid 9/10THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT CONTAINS A BIT OF INFORMATION ON THE SERIES' SITUATIONLionhead Studios has been shut down. It happened april 29th of 2016. I never saw this whizzing by, but when I did, I realised a Fable 4 will never happen. I read up on how this happened and Lionhead Studios basically got screwed over by Microsoft. Microsoft felt the game was not profitable enough, and tried to force the series into an server-based game of some sort. They invested 75 million in this and soon realised this form does not work for this series and cancelled it. Lionhead asked for proper budgeting and a fair chunk of time to create fable 4, using a part of the discarded game in the process, but Microsoft denied this because they felt it did not rake in enough money. Honestly, money is one of the reasons good games like this appear less and less frequently. Fable truly was a masterpiece, but has been brought to a halt due to moneygrubbing. A sight which is sad to see.(Info gathered from gaming news articles by a simple google on ""Fable 4"")			"

												Amazing Game.I don't care whether the Graphics are the only difference in this game blah blah. I'm not going to join the mass amount of players that complain about the dumbest things or smallest problems that can be fixed via Google.I genuinely had fun with this game. Upon pre-load and launch, I had NO problems at all. I was very excited to play this as I have played it 100+ times since it came out in 2005 on Original Xbox, then TLC and TLC on the PC. It took me little over 9h to fully complete and 100% the game and after every playthrough I just want to do it again. It's immersive, the quests are great, I had no bugs at all and most importantly, I had fun!Sure it doesn't support mouse and keyboard on the menu(at this time), but is it that hard to use A and B when it says? Anyways, I'm not going to dig at the moany bams on the Community.It's Fable, it's the original. 10/10.Also, take a look at some SweetFX settings and guides if you want to clean up your blurs and turn on AA etc, it really helps alot.Can't wait for modding.

												I must admit, I expected more of this remaster. I was so excited when this was announced that I immediately bought the game at full price (which I almost never do). The fact is, apart from a graphics update, the game offers little more than the original did. I am generally someone who enjoys the feel of the game more than the look, and for anyone who tends towards the same perspective, the Anniversary version is probably not worth it. However, I can say very little against the game itself; it is still one of my all time favourites. It's witty, intelligent, story-rich with plenty of side quests to sink your teeth into, and it offers a surprising amount of character development considering your controllable 'Hero' doesn't actually speak. You also get to kick chickens. My only niggles with the game itself are that you can only play as a male character, which I find limits my immersion somewhat, and that the camera occasionally refuses to do as you tell it. The quests are also very binary good/evil - no grey areas here. And the guards are totally fine with you wandering around opening fancy chests, but as soon as you try to steal a moustache from a bookshelf, OH NO THAT'S NOT ALLOWED.I am still glad I bought this version of the game. And as I would confidently say that Fable should be played by everyone, I can hardly not reccommend it.			"

												I would really like to recommend Fable Anniversary .... but as someone who played Fable TLC till the end i can't really get how banning the mouse from the inventory/journal/abilitys menu and replaceing it with insert, delete, home and end is going to make it less difficult to operate.  I can't say if controller are more helpfull for I have a GameStop controller and not an Xbox one. If you haven't figured it out: the game doesn't recougnice my controller. If you play with mouse and keybord you should also be notified that changeing controlls from the main menu isn't (yet) possible - it works from the ingame menu - neigther is changing the the four previous keys{fixed}. Hope i can return to change(/delete) my review without adding new contra points.			"

												...Before I shall say more, it is important for you to know that I never played Fable in the 1st place. I heard a lot of good reviews from my friends, so when they released Anniversary I knew that this game will be for me.Despite the huge lot of negative reviews, I loved this game from start to finish. And yes, I have encountered a few techinical bugs on the way, but this was so unimportant in the long run, that I never seemed to care much.Graphics were decent (and I was playing on low settings because my current setup is long outdated), the menus and loading screens were bright and colourful, and the game itself is pretty much the same Fable so many players loved, so what's the deal?You may not agree with me, but I think it's a good idea to pick this edition during a sale or promotion for a lower price (price tag is kinda too high), better with all DLCs available (also discounted price) to play the game, get some nice achievements, Steam badge, cards and stuff like that. Not to mention a whole lot of fun which comes with the package....And that wraps it up, for me.P.S.: sorry if this looks a bit messy. I hope you might find it useful anyway.			"

												Overall, if you're a fan of Fable, then pick this one up for the flashy new graphics, with a ""old time/new look"" timey-wimey wibbly-wobbly stuff game.There were some hiccups at the initial launch though, and I covered them honestly in the text below.I was skeptical at first about buying this game (mainly because I already own Fable TLC), but after checking out the screenshots of the interface and spell effects I decided to take the plunge and buy it.There were some Keyboard and Mouse control, nonassignable buttons, oversights at first, but the devs were quick to respond to the forum users asking for the ""BLOCK"" function and other keys to be able to be user-assigned.So that oversight was quickly ironed out.The other initial oversight was that it was very clear that the menu system was designed with a controller in mind rather than a K+M setup, but yet again, the devs have hopped on that, and I can currently, (and happily) click away with my mouse in the overall menu (Inventory/Quests/Maps etc)I have to give a thumbs up to the devs as well, they LISTENED to our feedback and FIXED things. How great is that?They get a double thumbs-up for that in MY book :)Now where's Fable 2 for the PC? ;)			"

												When I first played fable the lost chapters on the original xbox I thoroughly enjoyed it, and so I was excited for the anniversary but I am very dissapointed. yeah they redid the graphics and audio but their no where as good as what we saw in fable lll (fable lll story and combat is crap). The controls are different to the lost chapters (on pc) which I found confusing at times. It severely droppped for me when I was stuck in a mission and couldnt leave without going to a previous save I made 3 hours before so I just stopped playing. There are so many bugs and glitches its not funny, its a waste of money you might as well buy the lost chapters for $10. I do not recommend this game for anyone because the price is way too high.

												When Fable first came out in 2004, it had years’ worth of far-fetched promises and frothing hype to live up to. Now it’s got rose-tinted recollections to satisfy. I’m not sure which is worse. Happily, though, Fable Anniversary gently retouches Lionhead’s original action-RPG without doing unspeakable violence to its memory. Fable Anniversary is a reminder of the things that established one of the Xbox’s most recognisable franchises - its lovely art, silly personality and playful attitude to good and evil. It doesn’t play like it was made yesterday, but this is a good adaptation, even if a few annoyingly anachronistic features remain.Fable has aged well, partly because some of its best ideas have since become action-RPG staples - things like real-time combat, good-evil alignment and a world that reacts to your actions. Fable didn’t invent any of these things, but it does them well and uniquely enough that it’s still fun to play today. It’s easy to feel at home in this fantastical version of England’s green and pleasant land, where the countryside goes on forever and nobody is from inside the M25, and you’re greeted by cheers and applauding admirers whenever you step into the village pub for a pint. The place feels alive.Fable is a simple and recognisable heroic tale at heart - you go from young boy to storied warrior, leaving your mark on the land of Albion, and eventually avenging your family - but the setting and sense of humour make it much more endearing than the usual po-faced videogame fantasy. Fable’s fondness for the ridiculous yields chicken-kicking minigames, Union Jack underpants, a legendary weapon in the shape of a frying pan, gloriously eclectic accents and dialogue, and a playfully disgusting range of fart and belch emotes.Fable Anniversary looks far, far better than the original Xbox version, with beautiful new textures and updated models and effects, although everyone has a bad case of the scaryfaces. The old-fashioned looping animations date it -  there’s no motion-captured fluidity here - but if you were a fan the first time around, it’s wonderful to see it looking so good. The extra Lost Chapters content, too, is worth seeing if you haven’t before. For me, though, the best reason to play again was that the first time was so long ago that I’d forgotten almost everything about it.Everything revolves around the Hero’s Guild, where you go to pick up quests ranging from tedious beastie-bashing to epic treks across the Albion countryside. How you shape your Hero depends entirely on where you spend the experience gained from these quests - you can pile it all into magic spells and skills, beef up his melee muscle or improve stealth and ranged accuracy, or spread your experience across different categories.This, in turn, affects his appearance, as does his alignment on the good-evil scale - magic users go bald quicker, for example – but the main determining factor is Fable’s binary and simplistic take on good and evil. It’s satisfying to see a halo and butterflies materialise around good heroes whilst evil ones sprout horns and go ghastly pale, even if those actions don’t have wide-reaching consequences in the wider world beyond making you more famous and recognisable. Without any of the shades of gray that make a morality system truly interesting, it’s more of a cartoonish fantasy.Fable’s combat uses a mix of magic, melee and ranged attacks, and in the original game it didn’t gel together well. Melee attacks used to be on several buttons, you’d have to press the Back button to aim with the bow, and the lock-on was pretty terrible. For Anniversary, the combat controls have been adapted to be closer to the one-button system of later Fables - melee is on X, ranged is on Y and magic is on B. This is a vast improvement, and makes it much easier to use all your available skills in fights rather than brute-forcing through with melee alone.Frustratingly, though, a few persisting control problems make prolonged fighting feel like a slog. Firstly, the lock-on still isn’t good enough - too often it targets a faraway enemy or a friendly when there’s a mob of undead right up in your face. This isn’t helped by an imperfect camera. Dodging is clumsy, and when you’re mobbed by enemies they have an irritating tendency to catch you in a hit animation loop and leave you unable to strike. Fable Anniversary’s fighting is fun in small doses, but after a while it’s tempting to just smash your way through with basic X-button strikes to get things over with, which is just about possible in many situations even if it is less fun. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the extremely long and tedious Arena quest, where you must fight a sequence of mostly generic enemies that feels endless.Fable Anniversary also preserves the original’s combat multiplier, which builds up when you land blows without getting hit. The combat multiplier was ditched for later Fables, and you can see why - the irritation of getting caught in a hit animation loop or caught by a cheap shot is compounded when it causes you to lose a multiplier. The later Fable games’ combat is simplified, but also more honest - frankly the original combat system was never quite good enough to pull off the complexity it was shooting for.There are fundamental things about the way that Fable was made that Anniversary can’t change. Albion is divided up into small corridor-like areas separated by loading screens - a technical necessity back in the day, but an anachronistic annoyance now. The loading times are quick, but they’re a constant interruption. The menu system, meanwhile, has been improved to give quick access to items and emotes, but it’s still a chore to dig through its many, many different sub-menus. Fable has an odd habit of mapping random things to the D-Pad, which once caused me to give a prized ruby to a barmaid rather than belch at her. She was impressed, but my husband was not.Some of these 9-year-old systems are showing their age, and the later Fables are more frictionless to play, but the things that really established Fable as one of the Xbox’s most recognisable series are totally intact. Just being in Albion is a pleasure - it really feels alive, with traders and villagers bustling about their business, applauding you when you step into the pub after a long day’s questing. The sense of humour, too, is no less charming than it was in 2004 - outside of combat, I was usually playing with a smile on my face.The strange thing about Fable is that for all the choice it offers, there’s very little consequence. You can get married, but after that you can run off for literally years and leave your wife or husband alone and they don’t seem to mind. You can murder shopkeepers, but everyone soon forgets about it. Its morality is very simplistic and unsubtle by modern standards. This makes it feel rather shallow, but it also enables you to be playful with its morality, if the mood takes you. You can muck about with flirting with admirers in front of your spouse or getting drunk and vomiting in public or attacking people for no reason, and none of it really matters.The best advice I can give when it comes to Fable Anniversary is to take your time, speak to people, pick up side quests and play around, otherwise you might suddenly find that it’s over. It can be completed in around 10 hours, but there’s nothing to be gained by rushing - and conversely, there’s a lot you won’t find out unless you take time to mess around and experiment.OVERALLFable Anniversary’s personality has proved truly ageless, even if some of its mechanics haven’t. Inevitably, its doesn’t feel as fresh today as they did in 2004, but the strange and beautiful world of Albion, with all its weird idiosyncrasies and wildly varied accents, is as absorbing and lovably, peculiarly British as it ever was.

												It's been just under 24 hours since Fable Anniversary has come to PC. I'd been waiting for this edition since it had been announced, and now I have my hands on it (so to speak). However, looking at the review section on Steam shows no shortage of angry gamers complaining about what they see as a shoddy console port. Almost never do initial reactions approach level-headed, so I want to take a step back and try to tell potential players exactly what they're getting.Let me preface the rest of this review by saying that I don't strictly give this game a 'thumbs up' or 'thumbs down'. I'm not trying to be contrarian by labeling this review as positive, it's just what the system will let me do. We'll get back to this.So, 'Fable Anniversary' is a remake-remaster hybrid of 2004's 'Fable', and includes the content from its expanded edition 'The Lost Chapters'. It was a very good game, and is now widely regarded as the best entry in the franchise (especially with regards to TLC). Unfortunately, the game suffered the fate of being way overhyped, by both creator and games media, and upon its release, fans were disappointed that some things were notably absent. The very first achievement you earn, “From The Smallest Acorn”, is a reference to a statement made by creator Peter Molyneux about just how deep the game world was supposed to be. Players were supposed to be able to knock an acorn off a tree, and it would grow into an oak. [NOTE: Molyneux DID say this, having discussed it in many interviews since, but I can't find the actual direct quote. If someone could source this I'd be grateful.] This was very obviously unfeasible given the time and technology, but it became a symbol of broken promises for people who bought the game with high expectations, and finished it feeling like something was missing. Again the acorn rears its head (or cupule if you're into trees, I guess), falling from the tree of the Lost Chapters, and foreshadows what is to come.When I say this game “is a remake-remaster hybrid”, what I mean is that this is Fable 2014. This is Fable as you (probably) know it. Oakvale and the Guild and Bowerstone and all of those places are still here, and look mostly untouched, but more polished. If you played Fable back on the Xbox and remember being impressed by the graphics, this is probably how you remember it looking in your mind's eye. The boost in visuals comes from the game being rebuilt almost ground-up in Unreal Engine 3, which is what blurs the line between remake and remaster. Ten years of advancements in 3D technology will yield obvious results, but the game itself is mostly identical to the original Fable (more specifically the Lost Chapters, which was Fable but with a bunch of new quests and items). The acorn is planted.This purist approach is a double-edged sword, though. One one hand, it means that fans of the original can be assured that the team isn't fixing what isn't broken, and new players can experience the same game without being taken aback by blurred textures and models that speak only by moving their jaw. These two groups can discuss the game with no real barrier between them. On the other hand, there really are some things about the game that could have been done away with. As an example, the game world is divided up into little sections. The Greatwood Forest is not one big forest you can wander through, but 8 smaller maps separated by loading screens. This was a necessity at the time because the Xbox couldn't have handled such a map, but 10 years later we have machines powerful enough to handle Skyrim and Just Cause. Not every area has a cullis gate, and it becomes tedious to run through these small areas and hit a loading screen between them just to get to some quest or secret. Also, the FMV's (pre-rendered videos) haven't been changed. At all. The opening cutscene shows what your character can look like in the future, and it's footage from the original release. I don't mean just the cutscenes, either. I mean every instance. When you go to upgrade your skills, you'll see a video on the right side of the screen showing what a particular upgrade does. These videos are straight from the original, not redone, meaning that you'll go from looking at the remastered visuals of Anniversary to seeing low-quality video of the original models lifting rocks and casting spells, which is very jarring. No sign of any oak tree.Frustratingly, however, they didn't change these things while introducing new problems or altering things that shouldn't have been touched (or at least, should have been better thought-out). I'm not terribly near-sighted, but enough that I wear glasses for it. If someone wants to know what things look like to me without glasses, they just have to play this game. Distant trees and objects have this weird blur to them that can't be disabled in the game menu, instead relying on config file edits. The average user probably won't know how to do this, and the entirety of the video options menu really needs an overhaul. Speaking of which, the menus are horrendous, and they're what people have been pointing the finger at when they complain about Anniversary being a lazy port. These menus were very clearly designed with controllers in mind, and while I've been playing with one, I recognize that not everyone plays the same way. Rather than describing what's wrong with the keyboard and mouse controls, here's a video from TotalBiscuit going through the menu and showing how bad it is

. Maybe the acorn was a dud?“But this is a PC version,” I hear some say, “surely the modders will fix these! Maybe the acorn will grow better if other people help water it!” Well, no. There are modding tools for the game, but they're strictly cosmetic. Head to the 'Modding DLC' store page, and you'll see that the tools are described as “only able to modify art and animation assets”. More than the menus, this game is screaming for fan-made content. Mods for Fable existed, but were very few, and even less worth installing. But in a game where the protagonist never says anything, players should be able to go nuts. They should be able to make new maps and characters and quests and add so much to the game, but instead we got dress-up. At least we can retexture the acorn to be gold.I know I've spent most of this review criticizing the game, but that's because I was discussing the quality of the remaster and porting job rather than the game itself. The thing that made me choose to label this review positive over negative is this: Fable is a great game. It wasn't what everybody dreamed of, but I missed out on all the hype, and enjoyed the hell out of the final product. If you're the kind of person I'm trying to reach with this review, you want to know if this is worth buying. All I can say is that it depends. If you haven't played Fable before, or you have but just don't own it for PC, then I would recommend 'Anniversary', keeping in mind that the K/M interface is sub-par. If you already own the Lost Chapters, I can't justify recommending that you pay the current price for the same game, but with better graphics, controller support, a harder difficulty and achievements. But keep up with the news about this game. By the time this game is on sale, it will have been patched. Coupled with possible expansion of the modding tools, maybe this game will be what it should have been on release. Maybe, just maybe, if we wish for it with all our hearts, we'll see that oak grow.

												While I understand everyone's opinion I don't agree. This game is a lot of fun and relaxing. I didn't buy it at launch so I didn't experience all the glitches and performance issues but I don't think that would of changed my view. The combat is nice and simple and it looks beautiful. However it does have it's issues. All in all I think if you like RPG's you should pick this up. But wait until it's on sale, I don't think this is worth $35.Verdict: 7/10			"

Posted: September 15, 2014
												I've decided to make a review for this because I've seen so many bad reviews, I feel nobody is outlining the amazing new features in this game. I haven't finished the story yet but I've played enough to know the ups and downs.I've seen a few issues mentioned, I'd like to say that so far they seem based entirely on personal preference. Not that they're wrong but issues like ""crashing"" I've not experienced any crashing what so ever and all the graphics are maxed out with TV being streamed on my second monitor. I would suggest that issue may be due to something else not that I'd know for sure but I've kept a solid frame rate without a single stutter.There was a mention of issues with the controls. I have to agree slightly when I started playing I noticed they changed the controls by default to a new layout which is not so great for mages; To fix this just go to the controller settings and you can switch back to the original controller scheme which I prefer as you can access all spells rather than only having access to one spell at a time. The menu navigation isn't great but it's new, after a few hours I was used to it like any other game. The game clearly was only meant for controllers so it can't be faulted for not being perfect on keyboard/mouse.Graphics seem to be hated on? I love the redone graphics! It's certain changes that you really notice a difference, especially with some of the spells (I've not tried them all yet). I'm sure if you compare the 2 versions the graphics are much better on this! It's one thing that's kept the game fresh for me. Some of the faces are creepy in HD but really compare the 2. Also this isn't a next gen game you can only improve the graphics a certain amount.This is a huge positive for me. The harder difficulty! I'm not sure if it was the same for anyone else but the original was far too easy once you worked out what spell combos to use. Hero mode has provided me with a new challenge, especially approaching The Arena! I made the mistake of assuming I'd ace it but multiple times came close to death meaning I'd have to restart it all. It really has added a new side to the game for me.The additions to the game; I love the new additions, the new outfits and weapons. The original game was rather dull when it came to outfits and weapons so it's refreshing to have more choices now. I will say, the DLC is definitely TOO much! I mean this is a HD remake, an ""Anniversary edition"" I expect these new features to be included to justify the price! To expect another £10/£15 is taking it too far. I'm not paying double or triple the price of the original just because you made the game ""pretty"". Yes, DLC seems to be a fad in every new game but DLC isn't for Fable TLC. I would love to experience all of the new features you've worked so hard on but I will not pay such a high price for these menial extras.My overall opinion (Trying not to spoil anything for people reading); I love it, it's revived a classic game without taking away what people loved about Fable. The graphics are improved, the new difficulty keeps you on your toes and the new features are what make this a worthy remake. I will say the negative reviews seem to be.. overwhelming but I didn't see a single reason that justified so much hate. I will agree, the price if you include the DLC is a lot I would say too much for what it's for but if you can wait for it to go on sale or if they reconsider the DLC prices then yes this is a definite buy.Truth is, if you loved Fable you will love this. I would definitely recommend it to any fan and for those who have not experienced Fable TLC then this will be the best version for you to start with. Try not to base your opinion on everybody elses, try it for yourself and decide but remember it's a HD remake, not a brand new Fable game. I preordered this because Fable has so much replayablilty (if that's a word) that this will only enhance that for me. If you would like me to elaborate anything or have any specific questions I'd be happy to answer, my opinions generally are not biased so if something is broken or wrong I will include them but I feel that the 'negative reviews' have snowballed for no real reason. Hopefully this or another equally positive review makes it to the top so people considering buying the game have different opinions instead of just a bombardment of unjustified dislikes.			"

												I do very few reviews-normally only on games that I feel strongly about. As far as Fable Anniversary goes, save your money. Especially if you already have the original version, if you don't just spend the 10 dollars and buy the original instead of throwing money away for this 'paint job' as most are calling it. The game runs smoothly with very few bugs that I've run across yet, got stuck in a wall once, rolled into a rock and got stuck, couple of game crashes- nothing major since the game auto-saves for you quite often. However, it is still the original game! Nothing has been added besides a few extra colors, sure it looks pretty that your shadow now follows the lighting properly but most of us don't really care about that beyond the first couple 'ooohs' and 'ahhhs'. The extra colors add a few more hues and textures but nothing mind blowing or game altering especially since most of the maps are darker toned anyway. All the in game movements of the characters, both your own and npc's, are blocky and out dated. The original game itself is still great and in all honesty with this play through I really haven't noticed anything that was worth the money I spent on the anniversary edition even at 50% off with the holiday sale. I have a feeling the developers were just looking for a way to make a quick buck with little work.Now that my ramble is done here's my point again: DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION OF THE GAME UNLESS IT DROPS BELOW  THE ORIGINALS PRICE!

Fable AnniversaryInitially, few words from Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia:Originally posted by Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia:  Developers Big Blue Box StudiosLionhead Studios (The Lost Chapters / Anniversary)Robosoft Technologies (Mac OS X)   Publishers Microsoft Game Studios (Xbox, Windows)Feral Interactive (Mac)   Designer Peter Molyneux   Composers Danny ElfmanRussell Shaw   Release dates Windows:USA: 20 September 2005EUR: 23 September 2005POL: 17 March 2006Xbox:USA: 18 September 2004EUR: 21 September 2004   Genre Action role-playing   Mode Single player   Platforms WindowsMac OS XXbox Reading above-mentioned informations, we can conclude the game is really old. However, we can find everlasting games like Gothic or (in my opinion) exactly Fable. Group of fans of this game isn't large, but climate is epic. Even better than other old, classic games.The story is going around fantastic world named Albion. Textures are really imperfect, but what we can expect from so old game. This is forgivable, because the game has good graphics, audio, gameplay and story. Fable is straightforward although it has 'personal' charm.The main character is nameless - no, no Nameless from Gothic saga. Authors just from the beginning to the end don't reveal name of hero. Furthermore the hero doesn't speak anything. So we can boldly call him nameless, speechless orphan - yes, orphan, because in childhood he lost his father, which strangely enough has a name - Brom. Maybe this is diminutive from Bronislau (Bronisław)? Nevermind. Going further, our hero has lost his father, bandits have kidnapped his sister, his village has been burned - generally suck. Having no choice we are hired in Heroes' Guild, which will order quests for us. Sometimes funny, sometimes difficult, but for me all of that was really simple. But about difficulty I'll speak later. Quests are various and when we will choose some of that we can create horns or halo on head of our hero - literally. I don't want to reveal details, because it will destroy already short gameplay. At the end I would to mention about skills progress. In few words. It's really interesting. When we are killing monsters, we can collect green experience balls - however it sounds... we can collect green experience spheres, yeah it sounds better. Our nameless hero could be powerful warrior, annoying thief or omnipotent mage.Now few words about difficulty and two editions of game. The game was released at the end of 2005 and at the time it called ""Fable The Lost Chapters"". But about 8 years later, game developers was reminded they released really good game. Then they decided to remake 'Fable The Lost Chapters' and release new version which was named 'Fable Anniversary' with improved graphics. They added two difficulties of game - chicken and heroic. I do not have to say anything more.Summarizing:6.8 / 10.0 textures/graphics7.9 / 10.0 story8.3 / 10.0 gameplayArithmetic average: 7.7 / 10.0.Bonuses:+0.3 to general pool for remake and for add new mode+0.1 to general pool for many mystery secrets which game containingThe final evaluation: 8.1 / 10.0.

												I played the original Lost Chapters on the PC, saw this in the steam summer sale and thought I'd give it a go. TL;DR Can recommend! (Runs fine on Windows 10 btw)Pros:-Fantastic dialogue and humour, you will appreciate this even more if your British as a lot of regional accents and stereotypes are used.-Very well done linear RPG of old. It's easy to navigate around and you always know where to go. At the same time there are some nice touches on thi sides such as buying a house, getting married etc-Game looks beautiful. The unreal engine really brings this vibrant game to life, some of the old characters look a little weird at first but you'll get used to it.-Good/Evil decision making split. I played this game years ago and then transistioned into The Witcher Franchise.  Your choices have an impact and make the story consequences split, as well as how towns folk respond to you.-Combat is fast paced and satisfying. Hurling your sword around smacking foes feels great, at the same time there's a nice mixture of spells to choose from tooCons:-Little buggy here and there. Had 1 CTD throughout the whole thing which is fine. But sometimes, particularly at the start some NPCs bugged out and wouldn't attack me.-Shows its age. If you played Skyrim and Witcher 2 & 3 get ready for a step back. Game is still fantastic but respect the fact it came out 10 years ago.-Sometimes you accidentally attack friendly NPCs mid combat when using the lock on mode, NPCs are quite patient and forgiving but still kinda annoying.I heard some people moaning about keyboard controls, can't say myself, I used an Xbox controller throughout and the button set up ""Traditional"" was great for me.Overall smashing game worth a pick up!

												Somehow it's worse than the original in every way. They just ported everything into UE3 which not only ♥♥♥♥ed all the textures up and made them look worse than Fable 2 on xbox, they left the animations and character models exactly as they were which don't blend together as well as they did on the old version. Not worth the money when the original is 3x cheaper and plays 3x better. I absolutely love the Fable series (and I'd pay full price for a PC port of Fable II), but there is literally no reason to buy Fable Anniversary when Fable: The Lost Chapters is still on the steam store.Even worse off, I can't request a refund for this♥♥♥♥♥♥because I was two months outside the scheduled window!

												Fable is a great RPG with lovable character and great story. The gameplay is simple and addictive. The world and graphics are pretty and gorgeous and you will be wanting to see what is the other area you will travel to. The music is amazing - i still remember from 2002 that great melody in Oakvale. Now we are back with this remaster in which the graphics are improved and most of the game is intact as every good remaster should do. The only problem some people may have - the game is not that mouse & keyboard friendly and it is recommend that you play with a pad.			"

												This is essentially a graphics update for the original Fable PC release from 10 years ago. If you've never played it before, it's still a great game (despite its issues) and if you can get this version at 75% off, it's worth it.Otherwise, it's exactly the same game from 10 years ago if you've played it already, with all the same issues (and a few new bugs). Steam workshop support is worthless, the modding tools don't actually let you modify the game (only change textures and sounds) so don't expect to see any community expansion packs. At least cloud saves and trading cards are a nice addition.Now that Microsoft has shut down Lionhead I don't expect anything to improve regarding this title, and I can't recommend it at the asking price. Get it on sale, or go buy the original version of the game.			"

												Honestly there isn't much here if you already played Fable and the lost chapters. They improved the graphics... but somehow they just don't seem to look as nice as i remember with the original. I'm not sure why that is, perhaps it's nostalgia but the original just seemed more colorful and ""glowy"" this version is a bit more mundane looking. All in all, the price is just wrong here. I got it on sale for $11 but i'm pretty sure the initial price was $40 and regular is $30 which IS NOT worth it at all. $10-$15 fine. But this is nothing but a very lazy upgrade if you can even call it that really. If you haven't played the original and you catch this on sale... fine be my guest but i prefer the original, again, maybe that's just nostalgia goggles idk. In terms of gameplay, the game hasn't aged well and the camera is still very clunky, there are still bugs present like people freezing in time during a speech while training early on in the game. The combat is very basic, it always was but doesn't hold up well with current gen gaming. All in all i feel this is a missed opportunity here, they could have expanded the story and added in AT LEAST 2-3 more hours of content like what they did with TLC. But no... we get a lazy visual upgrade with optional microtransaction DLC because F-YOU GIVE ME MONEY... skip this, it's a turd.			"

												Okay, this is a super sad review to write, because I was really enjoying this game.The graphics are great, especially for a remaster! The sound is decent as well, though the soundtrack is mixed incredibly and is all-around fantastic!Then why the negative review? Alright, well, it's because of the ending and the lackluster modding capabilities.Without spoiling anything, the story ending is by far the most disappointing and lackluster I've ever played.It seriously just drops everything, and there's nothing to do afterward. As someone who never played The Lost Chapters, this is heartbreaking. The journey up was pretty fun, but there was such a drop in content around the last quarter of the game. It became just story, with very few side quests. There aren't enough upgrades or unique loot drops to add any more replayability to the game. And the whole legacy of Whisper and Thunder just ends, regardless of the choices you make! What the hell, Lionhead?The DLC in this game is $25 for skins and a few new weapons. There's nothing else. The modding in this game is completely unpassable -- it requires 9 gigabytes of files just to run a mod! And there are only a small handful of them on the Workshop. Also, the way they made the modding tool only allows you to change very specific details, such as lighting in-game and skins. That's literally it -- and the tool is so user unfriendly that few people have even gotten around to making anything. This game has been out for a year, and there's only six or seven mods out for it. That's pathetic. And there's no one but the developers to blame on this.Overall, if you get this game on sale for 75% off or more, then I'd go ahead and pick it up. I spent $12 when it was on sale, however, and felt cheated. I did get some good hours out of it, but the ending blew so hard that it made me feel like I hadn't really accomplished anything. Not a bad game, but holy crap could they have done better!			"

YouTube™ Video: Fable Anniversary for PC seems a bit naff 

			Views: 345,029		

			TotalBiscuit takes a look at a few problems in Fable Anniversary for PC and discusses whether or not we even needed a remake to begin with.		

UPDATE - 1st posted on 09/28/'14 on raptr. I forgot about this one. GomenasaiAt launch Fable Anniversary had subpar graphics for a 2014 HD game and the genius who thought up the K&M controls should be fired.It’s been patched (more than once) and now the graphics are what they should have been at launch and only now is it a better looking game than Fable:TLC.When I tried, at launch, to remap Inventory to Tab and use the ‘E’ key for block, (a holdover from my TLC play throughs)  it wouldn’t allow remapping to the Tab key and all the remapped ‘E’ key did was sheath whatever weapon I had equipped.The patches have fixed those keyboard issues, added Enter and Backspace as alternatives to the A & B keys and you can remap all keys.Using the mouse in Inventory and Main Menu is still not possible. I don’t know if Lionhead is responsible for that stroke of genius or if some asshat bean counter at Microsoft thought it would be a good way to increase controller sales. From the size and positioning of the different HUD displays, it makes me think they were holdovers from a design for nearsighted console gamers.The size and positioning of TLC’s HUD is still much better. Overall it was a lazy, substandard port that still hasn’t been completely fixed.I just finished a couple of play throughs (Chicken Chaser & Heroic Mode) and you get used to not having the mouse where you would normally use it. Not optimal but workable.Heroic Mode was a nice addition but once you got good weapons (Skorm’s Bow and Cutlass Bluetane can still be gotten early in the game) and can buy (trading was completely nerfed. Even with max Guile you can't make any money trading an item back and forth with a trader.) or steal good armor, it’s still harder but not that much harder. If you don’t own Fable Anniversary yet, play Fable:TLC and wait for a Steam sale to buy FA.			"

Ahh yes♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on PC gamers. its just never ending from certain companies.Avoid this like the plague.It looks like crap, like the screen has been smudged in something. Its blurry, full of bloom. I felt like i was going blind. BTW The Hero looks like an asian when he is young. Jees, that is a good thing as i love asians.worst controls for a menu ive ever seen. Of all the ♥♥♥♥ing buttons on the keyboards. They choose A and B for confirm and back. They choose. Insert, delete, home and end, instead of i dont know, arrow keys or WASD., and lets DEFINITELY not use the mouse, who uses that piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥for menus. Nobody owns a mouse. All pc gamers have controllers now.They did this on purpose, unless they are ♥♥♥♥ing MORONS. Oh buy a controller. yeah let me just buy your 35 dollar game and a controller. or how about just flushing 70 dollars down the drain, or giving it to some homeless guy, thats a way better entertainment.Was really looking forward to this port, and we get this, its like the♥♥♥♥♥♥all over you, make u eat♥♥♥♥♥♥as they set u on fire and then charge money for that.EDIT: i find the game has improved a lot. After recent patches it wont even launch on my pc, crashing on starting menu. I find this new feature really great as i dont have to suffer in hell trying to comprehend its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls system and my eyes feel way better now. I really feel like devs spend some time improving my game expirience.			"

												Oh boy. Where do i begin? Oh yes, this remaster sucks. First of all, the port is horribly done. The camera is locked on a slow as hell sensitivity, and it moves strangely. Mouse support in menus is non existent.  You have to use your keyboard purely when you're trying to navigate menus. And even that's poorly done. Sometimes in menus, the highlight for selecting will go into a random direction as if the arrow keys were sticking, making actually using these menus almost impossible to use. No matter what i do, it won't stop doing it. Some of the default keybinds are so random feeling. It's almost as if they attached printed image of a keyboard and threws darts to determine which key will do what. The combat lock-on is horribly done. You zoom in way to much, making your character take up half the screen. Fighting more than one enemy is extremely difficult. The dodge and block is the same key, which screws you over even more than most games that have multiple functions for 1 key. The delay in actually blocking has a massive delay, and not from doing other actions either. not matter what i do there's always a massive delay, making blocking almost impossible. Thankfully, dodging is actually useful, compared to blocking. The graphics have barely improved. It mostly looks like the textures were slapped onto the old fable 1 models. They look out of place and it makes the characters look hideous. Same for the lighting and environmental textures. Sure, you could say it's because it uses the same engine, but even then they were lazy in actually improving the graphics. The keyboard and mouse control scheme are horrid. Most of the time you have to go to the other side of the keyboard and back to actually do anything. I really wanted to like this game. I really did, but they were so lazy in actually making this as good as the original. If you really wanted to play this version, at least play with a controller. If even that doesn't work, get the Fable: the lost chapters. It's not only cheaper, but the combat mechanics are more enjoyable, and in general a better version.			"

												I would not recommend this game, I loved the original Fable TLC  and because of its age you could accept certain  glitches.However as this is a remake and they apparently did an overhaul I think you might expect a little more polish and maybe some extra content.- The animations are clunky compared to todays standard- There are  visible texture seams - Loading times between different sections - (G)UI design is terrible and clunkyAgain I could have accepted this for a game released in 2001, but if you decide to do a remake make sure that you give it a bit of an effort and not just load some levels in the UNreal engine and add better dynamic lighting and upres some textures and recompile again.

												Attention, this review is aimed at people that played the original game, since I don't review the game itself, but rather the quality of the remake.Well, I've been thinking about buying this game since quite some time now and I have to say that I don't regret it even one bit. I've always loved Fable; it's probably the game I've played through the most (like 8 times now). It's one of my favorite games of all time and it was a part of my childhood. I played the original version on my old Xbox and I played The Lost Chapters on PC. So I think you realize by now how hyped I was for a remake. But despite all of that I always hesitated buying Anniversary, because of all the negative reviews about how buggy it is and such. Well, after my playthrough I can freely say that I didn't encounter a single bug and I didn't have any issues at all. That's why I could have an awesome experience with Fable yet again and I could re-live my childhood to a certain degree. My point is that you should buy this game, because it's one hell of a lot of fun, it runs smoothly (even on not too good computers like mine) and because it looks amazing compared to the old game. If you're a Fable fan don't hesitate to pick it up and even if you're not a fan you should consider buying it, but you might want to wait for a sale because 32 euros kind of are a bit too much, eh?

												Does anyone else play Archer/Spellcaster mix? The game calls it ""Witchhunter"". I just started doing it and it's amazing. If you've played this game a lot I recommend giving the Witchhunter playstyle a go, it's a blast. That being said, let's write an actual review. Ths definitely does right by the original, the only area where it falls considerably below it is npc faces. i think they look better in the original, but that's subjective, so take it as you will. I love this game, though I don't recommend geting the dlc.  A total waste of money, and it doesn't add anything new except new wearable outfits, and it costs pretty much the same amount as the game. Trust me, you aren't missing a single thing if you don't get the dlc's. So don't.			"

												get the orginal fable. ill be playing this game and sadly got sucked into getting the dlc, which doesnt give you ANY OF THE LISTED ITEMS. instead you have to buy said items form traders. i mean sure thats cool, but not when you spent real money (like i did like a true sucker) to get them. now for gameplay, i thought this was supposed to be an improved version of fable? frame rate drops (i can run metro LL on high- not redux), very little graphical settings (sure this game was console only first, but you would think they would add a few more options), inventory access is well... crap. get the game if you so happen to be a huge fan of the series, like me, but have your hopes way down for this. DONT GET THE DLC CONTENT. on a good note though; the same humor that ive loved is still evident in this remake, and with certain items having descriptions and ""challenges"" that reference a few notable things, it makes the game still rather fun.

												This is Fable. You need to know that at the outset. If you didn't like Fable, TLC, 2, or 3, you're not gonna like this. If you had complaints, the odds are, they're still there. The keyboard/mouse control scheme isn't as good as it should be. DLC is a little wonky. You'll have to play around with your video settings to find what works for you.But you know what? Every piece of that is worth it.This is Fable. It was an incredible game ten years ago, and it's an incredible game now. Don't buy this because it's a brand-new AAA title that all your friends will be hardcore with, because that isn't Fable. Fable is funny. Fable is immersive. Fable is reminders about potions, food, and combat multipliers. Fable is mixing and matching pieces of armor to make your Hero look like you want them to. Fable is about single-player fun.And this game delivers on that. If you liked Fable before, you'll like it now. And if you didn't? Then you probably won't enjoy this one. I love it. I think you could, too.			"

												I have always loved the Fable games, black and white; and most things from the developers etc. So It comes as no surprise i enjoy this Anniversary edition too. I will comment, I have yet to understand how it was possible that the developers actually made the child version of your character uglier than it was in the original game.... that is no mere feat... that should be a bloody medal worthy award given to them for that alone.The game is very much like the original, obviously graphics upscaled, runs significantly better, more reliable. Still possible to make your character look like a Fat Troll with a battleaxe; so definately like the original.			"

												Fable Anniversary is a colorful Action RPG set in the pomporous fantasy world of Albion. The player takes control of the hero and progresses from childhood to adulthood, making critical choices that affect your story. Quests are a dime a dozen, and although there might be more loading screens than most would expect from an open world game, it does nothing to contain the exploration of the wondorous realm. Albion is a fantasy like none other, with humor and intense action waiting behind every door. The combat is fluent and enjoyable; Not easy but not difficult to grasp. If you've played the other Fable games, it plays just the same. Yet the thing that stands out the most for me is the players interaction with the rest of the world. The expressions are fun and make for a very interesting mechanic, and the whole alignment system (as in good/evil) is one of my personal favorite mechanics of the game. Seeing the halo hover over my pomporous hero's head is very satisfying to say the least, and really gives weight to the choices presented to the player. Acclaimed as the best in the series, it's easy to see why this game receives so much love. Most of everyone is fully aware that this is a remake, and the original is available on steam. So is it worth $30? To me, very much so. It is a vast improvement from the original in all the best ways, without straying from the original greatness of the earlier edition. I know that some people prefer the original version, and there's nothing wrong with that. But this game isn't for those people, it's for new players to enjoy the game with a new and modern life in it, and for the true hardcore fans who are excited to revisit this beloved world in a new way. I understand that a lot of people are having problems with framerate and texture (which i haven't experienced my whole time in the beta), but the developers have been and will remain active! They have been great at addressing everyone's problems and fixing them, and i'm sure they will continue to do so. As for me, I'll continue to support Lionhead in hopes that this is the beginning of something great. Fingers crossed for Fable Legends and Fable 2 Anniversary!			"

But there are various issues with the game, poor menu design for a PC, audio cutting in cutscenes, and vital keys to the game which softlock it, making it unplayable. I recommend you pick up The original for $10 as it is far superior as a PC port and 3 times cheaper			"

												Just how I remember the fable games! I played all of them on console, fable 2 and 3 being my favourites. I pretty much forgot about this game after playing those, but it's all coming back to me and it is DEFINITELY worth playing if you're into genres such as this, or if you've played any other fable games. Even if you've already played this through on console, play it again! I love that it's been remastered, just like all fable games, the story is a bit repetitive but it's real easy to get in to, just don't skip the cut scenes or you won't know what the hell has happened. Also, there is a bit of an annoying 'issue' in the cut scenes, 2 black lines appear sort of like making the screen a cinematic view however it just looks dodgy, like some sort of glitch, but that's only during the cut scenes so it's not a big issue.Either way, I definitely recommend this game whether you've played it or not. The combat is pretty easy but super fun! The quests are sometimes story rich, and sometimes they're just comical (like searching for a man who's cheating on his wife, then snitching on him and watching her rip his head off.. not literally). You can get haircuts, get married, get tattoos, there's loads to do!The greatest thing about the fable games is the good deeds or bad deeds. You change the way people view you, they could be scared of you or dislike you because you chose to follow an evil path and perform bad deeds, or they could root for you and clap every time they see you because you're known as a hero and perform good deeds!So yeah, I recommend it, it's old, but it's gold!

												A lot of people are salty about this release, I get it. The Lost Chapters (which will be TLC from now on, go ahead and take a moment to load up Waterfalls on youtube) kept the faithful graphics that give it more of an edge, a grittier organic feel and the price difference is almost absurd.But don't go chasing those waterfalls just yet. On a Chinese based website hosted on American based webspace ('g' two 'a' .com) this game is actually less than TLC, because of demand a lot of private sellers are able to sell this game for less than eight dollars, TLC is selling for just under nine.So about my experience; I grew up watching my friends play this game when I was young. When it was originally released I was 13 and I didn't own an xbox. Many sleep-overs were spent watching my friend's epic adventures through Albion, at the time the game was pretty groundbreaking.Now 12 years later I am finally experiencing the game from the pilot's seat, damn does it feel good.The graphics are great for its age, the worst part of the remake being the camera which didnt quite survive the tinkering process; it is a little wobbly but I got used to it after an hour. Like I said I never really played the Fable games for myself in the past so I do not need the older graphics for nostalgia reasons but it would have been nice to have the choice to toggle between old and new.So since the price between the games are so close on that Chinese site, I can only say that either one will satisfy you, just get the one that you feel makes the most sense to you and please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.R.I.P.

On one hand, some of the textures do genuinely look better, however others have been left as is and the contrast between old and new textures leaves a lot to be desired.Finally the stability of the game is also a problem.

												Fable Anniversary still has control issues, though the patches have improved the game.The menus are probably the worst.  The old menus, though unresponsive in their own right, are gone and replaced with something worse.  The mouse control functions like a d-pad, moving only one option at a time and requiring multiple clicks to change to a certain tab.  The menu keybinds (F4-F11) present in TLC are missing from Anniversary.  The hotbar keybinds are gone also.The game is probably fine for casual play, but it's far too expensive to make up for this.  Fable: TLC will have much better menus, and look better to boot.			"

												This is quite possibly the worst port I have ever experienced. Most of my time has been spent figuring out how to use the inventory menu (mostly because I kept trying different things to use the mouse cursor, but it was all in vain). This port is so lazy they translated A and B from the controller to the keyboard for accept and back. All clicking seems to be disabled, for a game that has had multiple ports I expected them to at least copy paste the pc controls from the last ones but they couldnt be bothered to even do that.Final score: 0/10 - same as the effort they put into the pc version.Edit: eventually the mouse thing was fixed. kind of. This tricked me into giving it another chance which was fun until the side quest ""bandit spy extraction"" the quest bugged, its impossible to progress and there is no abandon quest feature in this game, i have to either finish the quest (impossible) or reload to before it happened, but because the game already resaved both the auto save and checkpoint save slots my closest save is now 3 hours before i took the quest. effectivly ending my entire 9 hour game playthough.Final Final score: -5/10 - worse than having done nothing with my time.

												Fable Anniversary is a fully remastered version of Fable: The Lost Chapters. It features a graphic overhaul, new save system and incorporates achievements. And well, that's it. And that right there is the problem. The reason everybody loved the first Fable was for it's slapstick humor and eccentric characters. But the game aged pretty badly. Sloppy animations, simplistic combat, stiff and eerie looking characters, finiky movement, oh and don't forget all the bugs..... So when Lionhead announced Fable Anniversary I was pretty stoked and could not wait to play a remastered and polished version of Fable.However, even though the visuals got an upgrade, characters, animations, movement, interaction, combat, etc. all remained the same. I've played through the entire game and nearly 100% completed it, because I do love the world of Albion, but in the end there's more to a game than nostalgic value. And this game delivers no more than that. I would only recommend getting the game if you are a fan of the original Fable: TLC.			"

Something seriously wrong here, makes the game unplayable, as the long loads destroy any sort of fluidity or immersion.			"

												I've been a Fable fan since I used to be a plebby console player. But the moment I saw this game on for sale in my  recommended list, I instantly bought it... I usually do some research before buying a game, but you can never go wrong with Fable...I don't want to spoil much, but what I love about this game is that your actions change everything. If you're an ♥♥♥♥♥who rujns around killing people and stuff, people start to fear you and give you discounts at stores out of fear... But if you're extremely nice, they give you discounts out of respect. If you're neutural then no one cares about you.You hear people constantly talking about you in the background, you go to bars and hear bards sing of your heroic or cruel actions...etc. It's very interactive			"

												The menu is super clunky. Many people say the old menu was bad (I didn't find a big problem with it though, it was straight forward.) I actually had problems locating where things are. There's large tabs and several submenues. That being said, its still organized, its just ironically counter intuitive. So is the way you navigate.I mean, who uses pg up, down, home, end, delete, to navigate a menu? where's the mouse? It says ""KEYBOARD AND MOUSE"" and...IM NOT ALLOWED TO USE THE MOUSE to navigate the menu. Excuse me? Who managed the design overhaul for this game? Keep in mind, I own every fable game, and still replay fable: the lost chapters on PC to this day. since it came out. I love that game with all my heart, but the hero's face is disgusting. There's a few faces that look decent, like the guildmaster, and I like whisper's, but the hero's is awful. that and the mouse is overly senstive and I cant change that. It makes camera controls a bit awkward, but still manageable.Also, does anybody know how to change the hotkeys on the numpad? I had a very specific layout for them in the original, and I cant find a way to edit.Aside from all that, I find it interesting to see what's changed, and will continue playing. If you're new to Fable, I wouldn't recommend at all, but I would if you're a vet. I still want to support Peter Molyneux for his faithful devotion to the series, I just wish they'd try to mix innovation with practicality, as I think sometimes, they leave that later part out.			"

												Even though I'm used to the Keyboard and Mouse from playing Fable: The Lost Chapters a hundred times over, I went straight to the controller because I wanted to see how that felt and I was plesantly surprised. I haven't tried Key+Mouse, and looking at the reviews here, I don't think I will, but if you're willing to play with a controller, you shouldn't have any problems.As for the game itself, I could tell you to save yourself some money and buy the original TLC, because it's the same game exactly, minus the graphic update which is nice, but not at all necessary to enjoy the awesome game it already was.I'm still gonna recommend it for one little detail, and that's the Heroic Mode. Shops will have a limited supply of Health and Mana Potions, although you can still find both as loot for defeating enemies or from Traveling Merchants at a slightly marked up price. Vendors will now purchase whatever you sell at 50% of what it costs, which means no more making a fortune by Buying/Reselling Emeralds in Oakvale, no more Resurrection Phials, more expensive and less effective Physical Shield and Enflame and all enemies will be buffed and give you 40% less experience.Heroic Mode feels a bit more like what the game should have been initially. Now, at the same time if you're like me, and you like to powergame, it'll just make it a bit grindier  but overall more challenging, which is nice.			"

												Fable is one of the greatest RPGs ever made. This game is a true classic, and the fact that this version has controller support makes it all that much better. This was one of the first games that allowed you to choose a good or evil path for your toon. The only bad part about this game is that none of its sequels measure up to the quality of this one. It leaves you wanting more and has one of the highest replay values of any game. I would say that the controls and combat system was a big inspiration for the Souls games.			"

												They remastered the graphics and that's it, you will notice the aged gameplay immediately and the new graphics don't really fit in at all.I loved the old Fable artstyle. it was whimiscal yet realstic, it had the best of both worlds. This ""Anniversary Edition"" completely changes the faces of characters you once loved, making you turn your head every single cutscene, it's hard to decide if this 'upgrade' is worth it or not if you played the original to death.They advertise that there is 'new gameplay', but I have yet to experience any of it, and maybe I am missing it but I thought they maybe meant new controls.This game does not control particularily well if you're used to modern 3rd Person games, it was awesome when it was released, and still is if you ask me as a long time fan. However, if you find this game as a newcomer who plays the Witcher 3 or similar modern titles, you might not feel the same. I personally love the controls of this game and honestly I believe it's because I originally played the game on the Xbox.I'd personally say buy the original, the graphics still look decent and the gameplay is pretty much identical.

												Now now, let's get this straight. I've played Fable since it originally came out in 2004. (My first genuine game, ever, aside from black guy stealing bicycle in that one first mission.) The original Fable was fantastic, beautiful, full of dank memes of the early 2000's like farts and bullying children. The story is twisted, engulfing, and lit af fam. The Anniversary edition includes some really great texture updates but makes your face look like you're carrying a bow, a sword, and an extra chromosome. It sadly also includes a brand new Menu that is clunky and absolutely f**king ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If they hadn't changed the Menus and also made you look like Rosie O'donald this game would be a solid 11/10, but it's easy to deal with so Fable Anniversary still holds strong with a 9/10. I play through the story at least once a year to get my Fable FIXXX. Fable 2 and 3 should've never been made.11/11 Jack of Blades best antagonist			"

												Ill keep my report short.  If you once owned Fable, and youd like to own it once more, this version of it is a nice makeover.  However, if you currently own Fable, it isnt worth a cent.  I bought this game on sale, and i still wish i hadnt bought it.  Shoulda listened to the reviews, but i was stubborn.Pros: The new look of the enviroments... thats about it... the trees are pretty...Cons: Character models are hideous.  Whoever put them together clearly did this as a rush job.           New menus are far more clunky.  Sorry i cant use a better word to describe.This is a game that was only put out as an ""HD"" anniversary edition as a means to make money.  I dont even blame the company for that.  I mean, thats what companys do.  I only mention this as a warning to all: There was no heart put into this.  None.   The only good thing they did was add the ability to modify the game.  Perhaps with that feature, someone will give this game a REAL makeover.Once again you have failed us.  I am the fool for trusting you, and this is my confession.			"

I have yet to crash and I have enjoyed every second of playing as much as I did when this game came out ten years ago.I have played Fable and Fable TLC countless times, the game is stellar and to see it remade with HD graphics brings me another layer of joy. Its like when you don't play a game for years and years and years and when you look back on playing it with rose colored glasses and then you see the HD remake and you think yourself, this is what I remember. They didn't cut anything but they didn't really add anything. I got the game on sale and it was well worth the 15 dollars that I spent on it. Fable will provide you hours and hours of entertainment and is way better than any of its sequels. Pick this game up and you will not regret it.			"

All and all it was a huge bummer for me as I am a huge Fable 1 fan (Not the ""1"") and I was looking forward to some good comeing from that♥♥♥♥♥♥company. Why can't couldnt a company who did everything right the first time replicate it in 2 or 3? I have no idea.

												Do not buy the game. Just don't. Not for yourself, not for others. After much time and effort, I've only managed to be able to play this game for about 3 sessions so far. Every other time I try to launch or load the game I'll get hit with an infinite load screen, a freeze glitch, or there will be no sound and I'll have to close and restart it all from the beginning.. Obviously this isn't happening to everyone but it is to me, and probably to a few others too. Personally I just can't stand to deal with it anymore. I was really excited to finally get this game after finding it on steam and on sale for so cheap. I'd been wanting to replay Fable lately too, so I thought this was a golden opportunity to replay a great game with a few new things included. Even as cheap as it was though, it really wasn't worth it, and this is coming from a Fable fanboy. And though I call myself a fanboy I don't think I'm biased or unfair in my gripes with this ""updated"" version, it really does just feel like the changes made to this version are just worse than the way things were in the original. The unintuitive menu system that makes makes you constantly switch between WASD and arrow keys for no reason, the new opening menu which lags and doesn't load the proper save that you're trying to load (no matter which save I selected to try and load it always tries to load the same one). Also, am I the only one who thinks the characters were made so incredibly ugly in the visual updates? I mean really, they're  hideous. How is that an upgrade?...And then therey's the skippy framerate, even though I have over the recommended specs on all accounts and I've turned all of the settings to the lowest possible configuration. I don't know if my pc is to blame or if the game is, but something is just clearly messed up in this whole situation. The one good thing I have to say is that for the keyboard and mouse route, combat still holds up, but between the menus being abysmally annoying to go through, the game just isn't worth it. Even when it's on sale for super cheap. For the sake of being fair, I'll also mention the good things. The visuals were really nice. Character design aside, the environments and buildings were pretty sweet to look at, even with the messed up framerate. The DLC was really cool too. I'd always felt the game lacked a wider variety of armor and weapons. A lot of the dlc stuff feels fillerish and pointless, but quite a bit of it is cool too. If your game works properly then it's worth having. The most exciting thing to me though was the new difficulty level. It added a new level of excitement to the game that's been lacking for me after so many playthroughs. I died 3 times on my way to Oakvale! I would never come close to dying in the original mode. So yeah, it's neat to be kept on my toes again. Shame the game turned out to be a bust. With all of that stated for the record, Based on my experience, I can't recommend this game to anyone. Not even mega-level Fable fanboys and not even if the game is ever on sale for $2. If you do DL the game, I hope you have better luck than I did.UPDATE: After building a new, and much more powerful computer, the game is running fine for me. All the framerate and sound issues I mentioned above aren't happening anymore. I still choose not to recommend the game though because even my last pc was above the recommended specs and well above the minimum recommended specs. And I still stand behind the character design issues and the menus. Maybe the menus work better with a controller but for keyboard and mouse it's pretty lame. I guess if it's on sale for under $10, maybe you can take the risk and buy it though.			"

												Fable is a great game. The combat is simple and fun, with a good variety of weapons and spells that you are fully encouraged to explore. There is a lot of great British humor, and a lot of charming character is put into the environment and the people and things that inhabit it. There is a cool simple morality system, wherein the world and the people in it react appropriately to your deeds and if you are a good guy/bad guy. There are also a lot of little extra role playing touches, like the ability to get married and have kids, that ultimately don't change the game much but it is really nice that they are there. So yeah, if you like RPGs, you should totally dig up a copy of Fable for Xbox (or maybe the GFWL version if you can find it) for a very fun and light Zelda-esq adventure experience. Unfortunately, this port does not do Fable justice. This port feels like a step backwards from the original Xbox version in almost every way. The first glaring issue is the menus. The menus are incredibly clunky and hard to navigate. Bafflingly, some of the menus seem to allow mouse navigation, and then other menus force you to use your keyboard to navigate them. As far as I can tell, there is no rhyme or reason as to which menus are mouse navigable and which are not. It is not uncommon to start off browsing through the first tier of a menu with your mouse, then when you get to the next tier you suddenly can't click anything and have to use incredibly clunky keyboard commands to continue through.The next issue I have with this mess would be the controls. To put it simply, this game controls like absolute poop if you use a keyboard and mouse. The mouse feels jittery and not accurate. As for the keyboard stuff well, any time a game makes you use the ""Backspace"" key as a common control, you know you are in trouble.Graphically, this game is a mixed bag. On the one hand, some of the lighting techniques seem to have been modernized, and there seems to have been some modeling work. On the other hand, the new higher poly models that they added to the game just don't look very good. This issue may be entirely subjective, but the new models just kind of look weird and lack the same interesting character that the original models had.As for the kind of graphical options tweaks, this game is your typical lazy PC port in that it offers you very little in terms of video options.To sum this up, this just feels like a cheap, not particularly good port. Combine that with the ludicrous price tag, and I'd say that you should never touch this game with a ten foot pole. This is a shame, because the core game of Fable is really, really good. Fable deserves better than this. Moreover, YOU deserve better than this. Don't buy this game.			"

												I've played Fable: The Lost Chapters for hours when I was younger, this remastered version has a few improvements. Positives Sound has been enhanced,  Cutscenes are ever so slightly clearer...just - you have to squint even with a side by side comparison. Marginally better textures for some items and areas, they still look considerably outdated.  Meshes for buildings and objects are quite a bit better. Controller Support!!Negatives A blurry filter over the whole game - FXAA?? The new lighting has completely changed the colour and look of the game. The vibrant fantasy colours are now gone. The new character models look like they're made of wax/plastic. Combined with the new weird shadows, they all look like their faces melted. The main character as a child actually looks like some kind of goblin. This is the most glaring and visually offensive problem for me. Not all of the keyboard and mouse controls can be rebound as in the original. The redesigned menus have no mouse support and take longer to navigate because of the way they're layed out. The game is a port of a port (TLC > X360 > PC) and is very poorly optimized. It does not run particularly well.At the end of the day, save £20 and get Fable: The Lost Chapters instead. It runs in 1080p, all the keys can be remapped to your comfort and you can force anisotropic filtering using your graphics card control panel to make the game look nicer apparently.			"

												tl;dr More bugs, less charming, too expensive.I spent the last few days playing Fable Anniversary, and I've come to my conclusion.It's not worth the full price whatsoever, I'm glad I got it while it was on sale for 5 dollars. Under no circumstance would I have paid more for it.Fable is cool on the unreal engine initially, but after my first hour I realized how much I missed the old, charming style of the original game.Not to mention the bugs, Fable Anniversary makes completing the Fist Fighters final challenge way more irritating, amongst some other things exclusive to the anniversary addition.So to reiterate, do yourself a favor and do not buy this game at full price. Wait for a massive sale if you're that curious, but even then be prepared for the good times to die off quickly.			"

												I'm having fun with it and that's all that matters to me. in the beggining it was a little blurry but once i got through the childhood stage i've been having good fun. although the graphics aren't necessarily better then the original (more clay like) the surrounding map areas definitely are. the combat is smooth and a little more challenging compared to the original when the block button was never utilized. also a new difficulty makes it so you cannot use resurrection phails upon death. don't be fooled you will have trouble playing this without a corded 360 controller, but the good news is it has the exact same controls as the origianal xbox version when you do use the controller. i was hoping for steam workshop or a co-op pack but we can't have it all, I guess.If you love the classic original Fable more than any other Fable in the franchise (like me) then pick this up when it's on sale. Ignore the DLC's they're just stupid outfits that are made to waste time anf money.			"

												Fable has been an all time favorite of mine since my first experience with it back in 2010. I was inexperienced with video games back then, and I loved fable because it was challenging and had a very user friendly interface. Everything from the story, to the combat has made me love this game. I would recommend it to anyone. I'm reviewing the ANNIVERSARY version, however the origional is just as amazing! (this version just has a few tweeks)Not gonna lie, it can take a little bit of time to learn all of the best ways to get the best powers, armor, and weapons, esspetially if you're new to the game. Fortuanetly the internet is full of great ways to find the best things if you're having a hard time.Something that I don't like about the game: The game doesn't feel very open, in stead of great fields to run through, it's more like corridors and pathways through forests. (not as bad as it sounds) I've played this game several times before, and that's perhaps the only thing that bothers me about the game to this day, however it's important to remember that this game was created in 2004, so there's room for leniency. All in all, I'd say give it a shot. :D			"

												I really wished there was a mixed option for this game because it is good but it has a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of flaws so I'am going to talk about the bad and the good please keep in mind that I'am not english and at the time of writing this review I have not finished the game but I have finished the original one years agoso let's start with the good-The game stays true to the original the gameplay feels the same-The graphics are decent I think that it could've have been much much better -There is a lot of thing to do (Marriage,house,explore)-lots of fun minigame like fishing and digging stuff up-Good story -decent voice acting-new inventory menu (best part LOL)-you can kick chickensNow the bad things-The game is full of bugs like audio not working in major cutscene -glitchy camera -bad optimisation -repetitive quest-not enough area to explore-short game-small community -stuttering-STUPID AITo finish up this review I would recommend only buying this game when it's on sale or if you are feeling nostalgic (go buy the witcher instead if you want a good RPG experience) "

This is the stuff memories are made of.For a long time, I decided against acquiring a remastered version of Fable. Having previously bought Fable: The Lost Chapters a year after its' release, I saw no real advantage in buying what was essentially the same product a second time. But the call of nostalgia eventually got the better of me. That being said, objectivity obliges, I'll try not to drift too much down memory lane.Fable is the incarnation of Molyneux's vision in so many ways, it would be tedious to enumerate those aspects. It suffices to say that the game follows a pattern which was already present in Black & White: that of the choice between good and evil. But instead of playing as a god, you are a simple child who will grow to become a hero after a fateful, traumatising event. What kind of hero you will become - a good magician, sneaky fighter, etc.- is entirely of your choosing.Even down to its' very name, the world of Albion is a fantasy-folkloric rendition of medieval Britain. And it particularly excels in that area. The variety of English (mostly Northern and West Country) accents, Monty Pythonesque dialogue, landscapes, myths (e.g. Huw's longsword, King Arthur anyone?), creatures, map (which oddly ressembles Wales and the Irish Sea) are always there to remind you of the inherent Britishness of the game. From the bandit-ridden forestlands to the Ale-brewing taverns, it succeeds in creating an aesthetically pleasing rpg and is more-than-atmospheric-enough to bring about a credible world of its' own. To put it differently, Albion sure looks like a beautiful place to live in.Also worth noting is the musical score, the opening theme was composed by the ever so talented Danny Elfman (you might also remember him as the leading member of Oingo Boingo, the author of the Simpsons theme, Tim Burton movie soundtracks along with countless other film scores). Russell Shaw took great care of the rest, and much to his merit, one cannot understate the monumental influence of music in this game. It is literally the heart and soul of Fable.This game easily ranks up amongst the best titles to have graced the Xbox console. So what of this new version?Given that it is mainly a faithful reproduction of what was made a decade ago. There is very little in there to criticise.One of the main criticism I can bring up against Fable is that it is two-sided. Playing neutral won't really satisfy you. This game badly wants you to vouch for one side over the other. Either become a total♥♥♥♥♥♥or an angelic figure. On the other hand, playing evil is great fun (even hilarious at times). This system offers double-replayability down to the smallest side quest.What of the DLCs? Unless you seriously intend on looking like a total reincarnation of Jack of Blades at the end of the game, most of them aren't really worth buying. Of all the weapons featured in the game, only one will give you a true upper hand over your enemies (Solus Greatsword for the win), the DLC ones are no game-changers.As for the graphics, it's a bit of a mixed bag in my opinion. Sure, the landscape looks splendid. But the characters look too plastic, especially when it comes to their face, it's almost like something straight out of Spitting Image. The original Xbox version had a charm of its own which this Anniversary edition can't surpass.All in all, these are minor flaws in contrast to the game as a whole. As someone who bears the unpopular opinion that Fable 2 was a downgrade and Fable 3 a slight improvement, I wish Lionhead studios had carried on the Fable franchise in the direction of the original game. Here's to hoping for a Fable IV reboot set in a prequel Old Kingdom world, much like I long for an Age of Empires IV (another franchise which Microsoft mindlessly destroyed).Highly recommended for first time players.

												I usually won't write a review for a game but for this one, I thought it was nesccary.Fable has always been a game that I've liked, It's a good series of a games, even if they're not the sprawling epics usually promised there usually always solid games.Fable Anniversary is no exception.First, Every action having consequences is a bit of an oversell. Every choice has immediete consequences, but  that doesn't mean every choice changes the world. in fact very few choices actually change the world around you. You'll get bounties for committing a crime, and people may react to your characters differently, but your actions don't change much how the story goes.An example of this is, in one quest you're given the choice of killing or sparing someone. If you kill them they're dead you never see them again in the game. If you let them live, you get a few moments of dialouge with them, than they leave Albion forever so you never see them again. The choice's don't have any real weight, except affecting your players look and how npcs react to you.The Combat is solid enough, although it kind of punishes you for not being a Jack of all trades. I would never suggest only doing Will or only doing Skill or only doing Power, All 3 are needed for combat (Although skill less so) You will likely be fighting with a mix of Power and Will. Skill is alright for bosses but the time you'll need to charge a bow makes it almost usesless against the regular mobs of enemies you'll face.The Social and Property side, If you're coming from Fable 2 or 3 you know how much the Social skills and Property are important. In this game not so much. You have about 1 house per town you can buy without killing the owners and the Social actions are not nesccary at all if you can get a certain level of atractiveness, Seriously I don't think I used a Social action once in the game but I had a full level of affinity with every elegible bachelor and bachelorrette.Game time, I currently have 14 hours, that's what it took to beat this game (Both Main game and Lost Chapters) while also doing Bronze quests and most of the silver quests except 3, The last 3 were basically quests I couldn't see a Good way of doing so I skipped them. It's short for an rpg but it's fun enough to make up for it.What does Anniversary add? Now I haven't bought any of the anniversary DLC so I don't know how good the weapons are it adds, but what I do know about are it's Steamworks compatibility and Graphic/Audio remaster.Steamworks: Definately in it's infancy, there are not a lot of mods and a lot of them are Heavy Weapons guy at the momement. If playing as heavy weapons guy with a Heavy Weapons hammer and Shrek wasps sounds good than this is the game for you.Graphic/Audio remaster: It's amazing, the whole thing looks like a brand new game, on my machine enemies with a bit more detail like the White Balverine or Twinblades, too a little longer to render but for the most part it was seamless.What would I suggest you pay for this game? 15-20 dollars. While the Remaster looks like a brand new game it's really the same Fable The Lost Chapters you can pick up for 10 here on steam. However I definately think it's worth an extra 5 or 10 dollars, but don't buy it for the full 35. However if it's on sale I'd say pick it up in a second. If you're a Veteran of the Series or a new player Fable Anniversary is a solid game that will give you at least 28 hours of enjoyment (14 for Good, 14 for Bad Charachter)			"

												Before starting this review, let's all bow our heads in mourning for Lionhead: they may not have been the perfect studio, but they had a lot of good ideas, and the next Fable game is going to be a fantasy based card game, because clearly we didn't have enough of those!  I played through all of the Fable games in their original incarnations (Yes, even the Kinect one, never have I waved my hands in such fury!), and I had heard that the 360 version of Anniversary was saddled with performance problems.  Fortunately the PC version seems to have resolved this and the gameplay has dated really well.  Obviously the combat doesn't really stack up to something like Witcher 3, but that isn't really the point, this is a quirky, quintessentially British fantasy game with a lot of heart, and many years after it's over the top prerelease promises its possible to see it as exactly that.  If you played it before then its a lovely trip down memory lane, and I you have only played the later installments then it's essential.			"

												Fable was great back in the day.  This not so much.  The remake has glaring sound issues, the cutscenes are low res, and the menus are not mouse driven.  I don't mind the textures so much but they are inconsistent. Some look decent, others terrible.  This is all within the first 10 minutes of the game.  I'm shelving it until they fix the sound issues.  They are frequent (every minute or so) and annoying.It is immediately apparent this is a pretty crap effort.  It's one of the laziest PC ports I've seen in a few years.  Until they patch and fix it forget it.   "

												After several updates I am happy to say the game has been made a lot better.  Mouse support has been added to the menus and the game has become a lot more polished.  So now I'll break it down into the pros and cons like I should have done in my original revirew.Pros+ Runs fairly well which is great considering this is an Xbox to PC port. + Graphical Fidelity is actually not that bad and looks a hell of a lot better than the original did+ Most keys can be rebound if you so desire+ Full 1080p SupportCons+ Lack of mods in the workshop+ Weapon balncing is a bit off.  You get really strong weapons early game but later near the end game the weapons you find seem a bit weak. + Menu navigation is still a bit tedious.Can I recommend this over the original Lost Chapters? No if you've already got it, yes if you haven't played TLC before.   Since the updates the game has become a lot more PC friendly which is a good, and isn't actually a bad game in its own right.			"

												When I played it back in the day it seemed and felt amazing. Now... Not like it turned bad or something, but... I guess I started noticing more flaws in games recently. Minor things, mainly, but still it makes the game feel old to me. Old and imperfect. Like I know that some things could (or even should) have been done a bit different.But despite that, Fable is a good, solid RPG game. If I'm not mistaken, it even affected GTA: SA with its ability to change your looks. At least approach is very similar. So, if you had not played original - try this one. It does look better and Fable 2\3 controller scheme does feel more convinient, as well.			"

Mouse support is not optional in any PC game ever.Couple that with DLC skins two thirds of the price of the game and you're better off just buying the original Fable: The Lost Chapters.Fable is a fantastic game. The anniversary edition has actually taken 10 steps back and is incredibly sloppy. They have overpriced and underproduced this game and I would steer clear of it until they (or their fanbase once again) fix their problems.			"

												Alright, so let me say I may be a little biased, because Lionhead has bribed me with all the sun shaft effects. Ok, so basically, this game is a graphical enhancement to Fable: The Lost Chapters. And for all these other people reviewing, they are downvoting because they expected even more stuff to be in the game, which I find quite stupid because the whole point of re-making games like this is so that people who haven't played it yet can experiance it where it looks even better, or for nastolgia's sake. Alright, so here is the basic run down of good and bad:GOOD:- All the models, animations (Some of these are still the origional), textures, and light FX have been redone- The game looks really pretty on the max settings, and some of the movement is even smoother than before- Combat is still massively fun- Stays true to the origional's everything, but they did add some outfits though- The game supports modding, and even gives a free DLC to get the SDK- They are releasing some new content packs to add more to the gameBAD:- When you save, it only saves from your last checkpoint, sometimes you have to redo a thing or two (not very game breaking though)- The eye's pupils are too big on some characters, making the game look a little awkward- Textures can sometimes be a little lower resolution than would be expected- Texture poping sometimes happens (Unreal Engine's fault, not the devs)Overall, I would have to recommend this game. All the people asking for this need to stop complaining about the little things, all of them will either be fixed by lionhead or by modders. I don't know about you guys, but I am having a great time. So overall, about an 8.7/10EDIT; They added keyboard and mouse support in menus. It could have been better, but its on par so I dont really view it as a bad thing			"

												Most people I know got their introduction to the series with 2008's Fable II on the Xbox Tree-Sickidy. From what I remember, it's not a bad game, but it was a bit of a step down from the original. And the third and final entry was even worse. I believe Fable / Anniversary is the only truly great game in the series. Truly a one-hit wonder. Why? I guess it just has a charm that it's sequels did not possess (as much), from the characters to the world to the soundtrack. And the sequels were also too simplified, especially the last one, from the breadcrumb trails to the combat. Still, it's a shame Lionhead shut down recently, so there doesn't look to be a chance of a redemption for the series. Even the cancelled Fable Legends didn't look all that promising in my opinion.At least before Lionhead went out with a whimper, Anniversary was released, a remastered version of the original game. Being an Xbox hipster when all the other kids had PS2s, I played it back in 2005, not long after it's release. I remember actually not being too keen when I first started, what with starting as a kid and having to earn money to buy your sister a present. I thought, wow, how lacklustre is this... And the world and goofy-looking characters with thick-accents I found somewhat freaky.I didn't play it for long, and lent it to my brother to play at the hospital where he was staying with hella-bad tonsilitis. He played a ton of it and convinced me it was a great game, so I tried it again, and got very much into it, eventually falling in love with it. And I fell in love with it all over again with Anniversary.The world is a medieval interpretation of Britain, of course with the addition of magic and the threat of dark forces and whatnot. So yeah, sounds pretty darn familiar. But this exceeds with the way all that is portrayed. With colourful charm and humour, the choice between a good and bad alignment, either which alters you physically and changes the perception of those around you, and easy accessibility (but not too simple as it's sequels, as I said).You start as a little boy, scatting about your nice little town trying to get money to buy your sister a birthday present. And the choices start here. Do you earn that money with good deeds (i.e watch a bloke's barrels for him while goes off for a♥♥♥♥♥♥ or earn it with bad deeds? (agree to watch those barrels but then smash them and earn the approval of a little shitbag trying to peer pressure you). You get many of those choices throughout, some harder to make than others.Bandits attack your village, and♥♥♥♥♥♥goes sideways. You are rescued by a member of the Heroes Guild, where you begin training as said Hero, and grow up there, eventually leaving as an adult. As it goes in video games, whatever alignment you choose, you still end up saving the world from the big bad guy.In games with moral alignments, I tend to stay on the good side, because that's just me. And I did when I played the original. But this time round I became as evil as possible, doing bad deeds, assisting bandits, betraying my family and murdering innocents. Either side of the moral spectrum grants you exclusive items and weapons. I was so evil I grew horns, had red eyes and skin like a zombie. I looked awesome. On the higher end of the light side you have nice skin, a halo above your head, and all the people love you. And if someone loves you that much (you can further earn their affections with gifts and flirtatious gestures), you can ask them to marry you; man or woman. Pretty impossible to earn trust and affection if you're evil though. Everyone just screams and runs away. Just like me in real life ohhhhhh!All in all do I recommend this? You bet your big♥♥♥♥♥I do. The thing to take into consideration though, is that while this is an RPG, it's not entirely open-world. It consists of many individual chunks of areas, many with very narrow paths. And there isn't a colossal amount of things to do, once you've unlocked and collected everything. So those who are more used to the gargantuan games of today (i.e Skyrim, The Witcher 3) with literally hundreds of hours of content, stunning graphics and modern mechanics, might not be so impressed. But there is certainly enough to keep you going for a good 25+ hours or so. Especially now as it has achievements, and some rather amusing ones at that, like getting a headshot with a crossbow while dressed as a woman, farting while dressed as an assassin, and choosing whether to explore every single region or just get fat (they unlock the same achievement).A personal niggle from me? It's possible to miss one of the silver keys out of the thirty you can collect. If you leave it too long before starting the fishing competition, the NPC you talk to can disappear forever. As an achievement geek this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. You have to get all thirty keys in one playthrough for an achievement, and I have twenty-nine... So to get it again I'll have to start again and get the thirty all over again...Still, I gotta give it full marks for everything else.10/10			"

												EDIT: It's worth noting that Lionhead have been good enough to update the game and have fixed many of the common gripes. This is good as it indicates that Lionhead are putting their money where their mouth is.However I still, honestly, believe that the incredible cost of this - around 3.5x more than the Fable: the Lost Chapters - makes this not worth it. At the end of the day it is, by and large, a ""HD"" redux of the original that doesn't look ""HD"" - Fable 3 looks notably better in everyway except the faces (which are done very well). With the mod support it has, maybe in time this will become a game that is worth the money it's asking for, however at the moment it is staggeringly overpriced.If you don't have the game, the cost of the other one is better. If you do have the game, the graphics are not actually that much better (or, really, that good to begin with - they use a DirectX package from 2010, and honestly, it looks like the game would fit that age quite well).[note: I use a 360 controller for many games anyway (the Fable series, in particular, does not need a mouse+key), so the pretty bad port mechanics aren't all that for me.]The big selling point of this game is the graphics and, based on the iffy model and texture quality, I highly doubt they're going to get noticeably better. In Oakvale there are areas that, graphically, look lifted from the base game.It looks like there will be mods (and if there can be mods there will be mods), but it also looks like there's some D1DLC.This is not worth $USD35; skip it and be happy.

												I had fond memories of this game and was very much looking forward to its PC release. The graphics are improved, and the game itself seems well preserved but.... yet another console port where keyboard and mouse support is terrible. Unlike its much older non-anniversary sibling, the menu is navigated by the insert, delete, home, end, ""A"" and ""B"" keys. Your mouse does nothing in the menu.The controller issues coming out from these console ports (looking at you Dark Souls 2), that are never likely to be fixed or optimized are very disappointing- especially in this case- a re-release with worse controls than a decade old predecessor. If keyboard controls are what you prefer and their poor implementation is a pet peeve for you, I would advise against this purchase- stick to the older version (still available on Steam)- and yes you will want frequent access to the menu so it is a bit of a game breaker (when i scroll through armor it all gets unequiupped).Edit: (22/8/2014) Since I wrote this review the game has been patched twice with small but significant improvements. If the developers continue to patch and update the game it will likely become the gem we were all hoping for. Might be a good X-mas purchase.			"

												Don't listen to the people complaining about controls. The graphics are done well, it still looks like Fable, just better. The controls are odd but not unplayable, and it's only laggy/choppy if you're running a potato. I have an i3 and a 2gb 950x with 8gb of ram and i run it full without any problems. P.S: if you're buying it for the mods, there's only 15~ on the workshop.			"

												Fable Anniversary is the same Game as Fable the  lost Chapters, only with a better graphic and achivements and Card drops. If you love Fable and you think its worth to pay 32€ for the same Game you already bought maybe 5 or 10 years earlier, then buy it. I bought this Game as Preorder with 20% off and Preorder DLC, and I can deal with it.I realy love Fable and I enjoyed this Game, for me it was worth and the graphic are much better then before, at least for me, well at the beginning the Charackter looked ugly but then it was okay, I had alot of fun playing this game again and I would buy it again.If you are a player who ask a Crysis 3 graphic or better, then don`t buy it, this is a XBox Port, its the same game only with a better graphic, like all HD remakes the graphic isn`t HIGH END GRAPHIC.Game run well with XBox360 Gamepad, i would recommend to play this Game with Gamepad.From me this Game get a 9 of 10 Points, no metter if the graphic isn`t much better but for me its good enough. (Resident Evil 4 HD looks compare to Resident Evil 4 worser, at Fable you can see that Graphic changed a lot)			"

												I enjoyed Fable: Lost Chapters when it was first released years ago; and it did not age well.This update to the aging game was a welcome sight, so I purchased the game when it was on a flash sale, for a third of its normal price.The graphical update is fairly well done, and keeps to the cartoonish look of the original, it looks like they tried to fix some of the issues with the original game as well.That's where the good parts of the game come to an end though.It's a good thing that you can now save anywhere, as you'll see your desktop more often than you'd like. The game crashes during entirely mundane activities (walking, etc.) for no apparent reason.The controller support was a nice touch, and they tried to make it more user friendly (failing mind you, as it feels as though the 'improved' controls are somehow worse than the original). However the game is sluggish and unresponsive. I find myself being struck where I wouldn't be, had I been playing the original.Taking everything in consideration, I can't recommend this game at it's normal price. Pick it up on the cheap, during a flash sale, or holiday sale; otherwise, look for something more worthwhile.			"

												It was fixed some but no enough. Too many people still have problems, the mod creator can't really mod anything either. If you want mods you're better off not even buying the anniversary edition but the normal one from 2005 and then get mods off websites, or if you wanted you can just use Photoshop and ushc programs to do it without the modding client at all in the case of reclours and retextures. The animations are still choppy, and the game can lag on itself even afetr you turn off the blurring effects. The old modding community thought slow now has some amazing mods which sadly don't seem to work with the anniversary edition which makes sense but is sad because there were really great mods. (Fable The New World, being a personal fav) but this version yes has prettied some graphics the trees look no better then they used to, argueably they in particular look worse. Microsoft promised a lot with this version and failed to deliver...not worth the money. (Was false advertised)			"

The Good and Evil choices are represented very well here and your apperance and reputation changes depending on what you do. Good customization with armour, weapons, beards, hair, tattoos etc. Loads of hours of content with DLC and its all in full HD which has made a 10 year old game look great.P.S please get Fable 2/3 on Steam!!Set-up: i5-4460 3.2ghz, GTX 960, 8GB RAM and Win10.

												Quick fixes in this review so read carefully if you want a great play experience.Alright, so I've read all the other reviews and I agree with most of them; however, there are some easy fixes to most of the problems.  Yes, there is a stuttering issue that is incredibly annoying.  It is rough being able to run Crysis 3 on ultra and not being able to run Fable on anything.  To fix this - cntrl alt delete and set fable's affinity to cpu 0 only.  The game was originally designed during a time when almost everything only ever used 1 core.  This does fix the issue and it runs perfect after.  I have a gtx 780...it is not nvidia that is the issue.  Nvidia runs fine with this program.  The FPS problem people are complaining about are because they have both integrated and dedicated graphics.  If you have an AMD APU or 4th gen intel the integrated graphics should be fine and you won't even notice (I have a 4th gen intel and just leave it running off that).  If you are still having issues though,  ""just go to Nvidia control panel and select the Manage 3D Settings tab. After that “select Program Settings” and find Fable Anniversary and switch the game to your Nvidia graphics card"". quoted from segmentnext.com because I'm lazy.The game is best ran with a controller.  I have a cheap logitech i use for my emulated stuff and it works fine.  If you are going to use the keyboard, it isn't too bad but it isn't anything like the original.  I think people don't like change and just love complaining.  It is what it is.  Another complaint I heard plenty of was the lack of ""video"" options.  There are some assumtions made by the developers, if you have a computer today it will be able to play everything from 2009 on max.  They have some distance and shadow options for slower computers.  Fine assumption for a port, I'm not complaining - graphics are amazing compared to the original.Overall - great port/remake.  Lots of new stuff to play with, higher difficulty option, amazing graphics that will stun you.  If you have the original, do a comparison just for the wow factor.  I'll give it a solid 8/10.  I'd give it a 9/10 to have my mouse back and a 10/10 if you didn't release it before fixing the bugs.  Although I'm sure they'll get fixed in the near future, I hate paying to beta test.  Recommended to all fans regardlless.  Enjoy the nolstagia.Update - Through the nvidia control panel I increased all the settings to max (had to add the program because it wasn't there originally), enable the option to allow/optimize multiple CPUs and this helped a lot.  I'm now running perfectly with all 8 cores firing.  There is no delay when skipping dialog now and everything is much smoother.			"

												This game is quite dissappointing.Fable is a classic RPG probably every gamer is familiar with, and it deserves a proper reconstruction, but this is not it. Fable was ahead of its time and as you might expect lacks a number of modern design principles we all know today, but which did not exist back then. There have been a few new features added (mostly just some spells and new armors/weapons), as well as some things taken away, including some plot elements. Beside that, this game is the old Fable + hi comp art + poorly executed KB/mouse control. They haven't done any bug/flaw fixing so your imerssion is just as regularly interrupted by mistakes in the game as it was in Fable for XBOX. The control and combat system is also quite awful. However, they've made the combat easier than ever because the enemies seem tremendously easier to kill and deal far less damage to the player's character. It is pretty much impossible to die, yet they throw extra lives at you like they are going out of style. Frankly they've made what was a fairly entertaining combat system into something unenjoyable and unchallenging. Special points like renown and alignment accumulate much faster than they used to, so they max out shortly after starting the game. So, if you're really not interested in a good, fun game to get into, and you just want to relax and goof off for a while with something graphically-rich, this may be a good option for you. Otherwise, go play the original Fable on XBOX, it is far more satisfying.			"

I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that this game includes the DLC for the original game, and the game had a minor graphics overhaul.  The game runs very smoothly, looks better than the original, and I didn't encounter any bugs/glitches during my playthrough.  It's a great PC port, and I would highly recommend this game whether you enjoyed playing Fable on Xbox or if you're just looking for a good RPG to get lost in for a while.			"

												     This game lives up to the original and is so nostalgic for me, its a bonus I only played the core game and not the lost chapters edition so the added/new quests are a treat.      Runs great, however on its highest settings it even has my gtx 980 at 100% usage at 120 fps, but the visuals are very impressive for a remaster.      The game itself can seem short lived even though its probably 30+ hours of grinding to get through the story, but that time goes quickly due to it being so fun. I have yet to try heroic difficulty but a higher setting is something the game has always needed.      Compared to other RPG's this game seems alot more present than say Oblivion or Skyrim, which in their case give you TOO much to do, so it feels overwhelming.      But this seems to be a game that is timeless for me, I always have to make myself quit to save some for later, where most other games eventually you get bored and need a break.     My only issue is playing with a controller it sometimes randomly vibrates. I can ignore it and you have the option to turn it off but I see how it could annoy some people, and to me this is on of those games best enjoyed with a controller.			"

												Fable Anniversary is a prime example of how NOT to handle a re-mastered game. I love the Fable series to death. TLC remains my favorite RPG to date. Some compatibility issues prevent me from playing the original Fable TLC on my PC, so I purchased FA in order to still play it. While the general gameplay is exactly the same, they destroyed everything else. First of all, this was supposed to IMPROVE the graphics: not just add more polygons and change the lighting. The textures are horrible, the models are even worse, and the lighting makes me want to carve out my own eyes. Everything is incredibly dull and grey - the opposite of the original, bright and colorful Fable. What's worse than the graphics is the menu system. At first there was no mouse support for any of the menus. NO MOUSE SUPPORT ON A PC GAME. Okay, it's not THAT big of a deal, right? We can still use the arrow keys and ""enter"", right? Nope. You use Insert and Delete to navigate. Explain this sh*t to me. They have since updated the game, and we can now use a mouse in the menus. However, they are still the clunkiest, unnecessarily difficult menus I have ever used. This is the worst part of the game being ported from Xbox. All in all, this game is the worst console port I have ever played. It's literally a port of a port, and it shows. I'll still play it because it's Fable, but as usual I'm quite irritated with Micro$oft and Lionhead Studios. If you're going to continue milking this franchise, how about you give us something we want: like FABLE F*CKING 2 FOR PC.			"

												Sadly I can't recommend this Anniversary version.TL;DR - Get the original Fable: The Lost Chapters for 1/4th of the price of this Anniversary version.---------Fable still a very good game, specially considering when it was made (10 years ago, already?). However:1 - While it was great for its time, the game didn't age so well. Mostly because other games took this formula and improved it (which was a natural thing to happen);2 - This remake still has A LOT of bugs, glitches and things like that. While the textures are good, the models still the same as 10 years ago, with lots of clipping and ugly things;3 - And not ALL the game has been remade for nicer looking graphics. There's still some Low-Rez bits, like the cut-scenes. Shame, really;4 - You simply can't pay 4x the price of the current Fable: The Lost Chapters for having some new HD textures.Fable Anniversary has been a MAJOR disappointment to me. For the price I was expecting a hell lot more than just new HD textures.			"

												Probably one of the worst PC ports of recent games, ESPECIALLY considering the fact that the original Fable's pc port was AMAZING  and way better than the xbox version. Aside from the Interface and Menus being MUCH MUCH worse the ""Fable: The Lost Chapters"", and apart from the nauseating camera shudder, the supposed ""HD Visuals"" is laughable. ALL the characters look MUCH worse than they do in the original, and the environment only rarely looks measurably better the original release.All in all, this is a waste of money. If you haven't played Fable 1 before, then you should buy ""Fable: The Lost Chapters"" and NOT this garbage pc port.			"

												Like many other people I was verry excited for this game.  i pre-ordered it.  I downloaded it the day that it came out and happily  installed it.  I have not been able to play it at all.  The game has more time spent in lag than it dose running.  not just the video but the audio as well.  Untill this game has some major fixes, like if they actually spent at least a little time, trying to play the game themselves and saw how crappy it looked and ran and actually did something about it rather than just saying ""screw it, we will still make money"" and just releasing it anyway.  If you want to play fable get an origal version as it might at least work.			"

												Edit: a few butthurt sissies have downvoted this review because they bought the game upon first release and encountered a few bugs. Even though these bugs are gone, they are still mad and downvote any reviews that speak about the bugs having been fixed. Just shows how stupid a lot of people really can be.Some negative reviews bang on about bugs. I have encountered none so they have been fixed. Some of the more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviews are moaning that there is no extra content added to the game other than the greatly improved visuals, controller support and new difficulty option - well erm yeah? its a HD remaster which means improved visuals. It does not mean extra content - that is purely at the discretion of the devs if they want to but is by no means a contributing factor to what a HD remaster should incorporate to be worthy of the name.Anyway, the game is exactly what it says on the tin. It looks ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. The nostalgia value is absolutely present. I could not recommend it enough to both old skool fans of TLC and newcomers to the series. In my personal opinion this is the strongest game in the series. well worth the full price.			"

I'm incredibly disappointed since I really enjoyed Fable:TLC a lot.   Do not buy it unless they fix the crappy console port problems.			"

												Update 9-29-2014: One of the updates fixed the stuttering, so that's good. The morality logic is still messed up in the intro, I got positive karma(and a thank you from the barrel guy) for breaking the barrels. In fact, nothing horrible I did would lower my karma points, my points only went up. The guards keeps harressing me though for my bad behaivor though. My biggest pet peeve is the rigid keyboard controls, it feel like they didn't put much time into mapping these controls for a PC enviroment. The controls aren't going to annoy everyone, and the game seems playable. If you get this game, hope your experience is better than mine.--Stuttering graphics every few seconds, buggy morality logic(got a good point for breaking all the barrels), audio skipping, the control implementation is just flat out stupid; I feel like I bought $100 ""foakleys"" from the Oakley store. For comparison, the in-development alpha games(ie kenshi) I bought in steam are more complete than this, and some are new developers. The launch day of watchdogs ran flawlessly compared to this remake, and it's graphics are leaps and bounds more complicated. I've been a PC gamer since the 90s, I understand launch day is going to have bugs. But this is the worse I've seen, maybe ever. If you want to play this game, save some money and get the lost chapters.			"

												Only 1.4 hours with this version, but nearly 60 on the one I owned on my old computer (may it rest in pieces), so I can say now what I thought about the game then:The tl;dr version is simply: funny little game with a lot of wasted potential.Much longer version: I bought the lost chapters edition some years ago, played through it a few times as both good and evil characters, and mainly enjoyed my time. However, the game always seemed to be missing something, and with this new version, I realized what it was. Unlike many of the other RPGs I've played over the years, Fable never gave me this sense of nostalgia or longing to play it ever again once I deleted it off my older computer and put the box on the shelf.Fast forward to now, and the feeling remains the same. Sure, it's still a funny little game with some great moments to it, but I don't feel the same sense of wanting to play for hours at a time that I have with others in the genre. I've likely gotten spoiled with more modern games, but that's not just it. Fable always seems to hit a point where it is just on the edge of being a truly great game, but then falls short in far too many areas.My biggest gripe is with the alleged improvement in graphics. My computer is not a monster rig, but it plays most games well at high specs. With Fable Anniversary, I've had to mess with far too many things to get it to run properly in the manner in which it is supposed to be played. I can run it, but not at ultra-high specs, and that's just stupid for a game that's now eleven years old.The second gripe is with the combat, which was always my problem with the original version. The lock-on is terrible, especially when there are several enemies on the field of battle, which can lead to quick deaths if not properly managed in the first place. With the bad camera slinging around like a loose sail on a schooner during a hurricane, boss battles involving fast enemies can be nearly impossible to finish without dying numerous times, even on easier difficulties. The biggest problem, though, is when the battle is over...every time a dead enemy drops an orb, there's a really good chance that it will end up in a spot where you can't get to it (say, in a non-accessible water source), so you lose that power-up that round, even with the button that allows you to essentially vacu-suck them towards you.Finally, I just wish what had been improved had extended to more than just the graphics. Some new music would have been nice (all of it gets so bedamned redundant after the six thousandth repeat that I have to turn it off eventually), some re-voicing of the more squeaky little brats would have done my ears a favor, and some of the quests were just so dumb that I'd play them evil just to amuse myself.Fable was, for many, a failure because it never delivered on the developers' promises. I wouldn't have gone that far, but there was too much wasted potential for me to able to recommend it to any but those who enjoyed the game initially. New players will likely hate Fable, with all its improved graphics, and with good reason. It just doesn't stack up to more modern RPGs, from any country.			"

												There is a large list of Cons for this game, and not too many pros.There is no menu mouse support and the in-game mouse is very VERY wonky, they put almost no effort into porting it from Xbox with controls in mind.The graphics are not a big enough improvement to warrent a 300% price increase from the Lost chapters.The day one DLC that was not included with preorder is a thorn in the side of the gaming community. It is obviously already made, so add it into the game without trying to charge us more for this cash grab.The modding support is a sham, with players only able to change textures and animations (Supposedly) I'm sure the community could find a way around that but we should be given what we were promised in ACTUAL modding support.All in the all this remake feels like like a remake, and more a retextured cash grab that you should stay away. Instead spend that money to get Fable: The Lost Chapters on steam, it is still perfectly playable even 9 years later.			"

												It is rare that a game can make me angry within three minutes of play but Fable Anniversary has managed to make me want to give up PC gaming within TWO minutes. This is a lazy, half-baked port if I ever saw one. Something as basic as mouse support for menus should have been included on day one. I wait, with anticipation, for weeks now to play this. I even considered buying The Lost Chapters on Steam to tide me over. I probably should have bought it and forgot about Fable Anniversary. How can I enjoy the immersive world of Fable when the menus are so awful and the game lags on my reasonably powerful PC? The chicken chaser developers have shown utter contempt to PC players with this port. They advertised this port as a 'favour' to all the loyal PC fans out there who have waited and waited. Lionhead and Microsoft shouldn't have given us the favour if they were not going to be bothered to do it properly.EDIT:The laggy graphics can be improved on NVIDA cards wtih a bit of rigging around. Improves experience greatly.			"

Gorgeous art design, beautiful music, and if you ignore the ""social interaction"" system, (which is the most effecitve simulation of antisocial personality disorder I have seen in a video game, shaming the GTA series), it was a really fun ARPG. It has NOT aged well.There are so many games that do this better, for less. I found it much less pleasant than reinstalling Kingdoms of Amalur. If you really want to play a Fable game on PC, Fable 3 is pretty good, and should be nice and affordable. But seriously. I was thoroughly disappointed.			"

The models, lighting, and textures are all Xbox 360-level, so it should easily run fine on my PC, but I struggle (with an i7 and GTX 660 as well as 16GB RAM) to run it on mid to low settings at a decent framerate.

												Bad Port, Terrible Controls, Same Old GameFable: The Lost Chapters was a wonderful game, but if you've already played it, you've already played this. This is nothing more than a high res texture/shader pack for Fable: TLC. This is not a full scale remake, leaving audio, animations and engine untouched. The character have been given higher detailed and higher resolution models, but they are stuck on the same old skeletons and use the same old animations. The worst offender are characters' eyes, which like the original game, still do not move. It looked weird 10 years ago, and it looks even weirder now. With the more realistic looking characters, with the old robotic movements, dead unmoving eyes, it really does give you the feeling of being trapped in some sort of fun house animatronic hell. The faces of the characters also feels like a downgrade from TLC, while they are higher resolution, most of the characters have rather ugly faces, and look a lot more generic than in TLC, losing a lot of their cartoonish look which gave them life in the first place.It's also a bad port directly from Xbox, with absolutely no attempt at making PC controls. This game is practically unplayable with a mouse and keyboard, even if that's how you typically played Fable: TLC in the past. In-game controls can be remapped (only once in game, NOT in the main menu) but all UI controls are ripped straight from xbox, meaning you have to type ""A"" ""B"" ""X"" ""Y"" on your keyboard in order to interact with the menus, and there is no option within the game to remap these. Other control flaws exist such as needing to press ""Insert"" and ""Delete"" to go to different pages in your inventory/journal.As for the environments and lighting changes, all is not well either. While a lot of the houses and scenery do look better with more detail than in TLC, the lighting kills the experience in a lot of places. They have in places put in some new real time lighting effects, but these are very localised. They look good if you are directly in that spot (in front of a fireplace for example) but look really out of place if you are viewing them from afar in an overall scene. You end up having a scene that is primarily ambient lighting, with a few spots of real time lighting that completely look out of place with the environment. You will end up with scenes like the Oakvale raid at the beginning of the game, where the scene is tinted heavily red, but the shadows and real time light sorces remain unshaded. It's hard to explain, but it ends up just looking very WRONG, like a badly photoshopped image.If this was a fan made free overhaul mod for the original game, or a forum collaboration (which is what it feels like) I would really be on board with all this, as a work in progress. But this is not fan made, this game had a team behind it and a budget. It is not free, it costs more than a lot of better games on steam at full price. And it is certainly not a work in progress, this is as good as it gets. And it's certainly far from good.			"

Posted: September 14, 2014
												Lengthy review ahead; skip to bottom for TL;DR version.The review:* General stuff: Alright, so in a PC port, they excluded a few rather *key* items. Obviously, the first major item on this list is mouse support in menus. However, you still CAN navigate the menus using the keyboard's arrow keys + 'A'/'B' keys for selection/back button. Although it's rather annoying, it IS there... so, there's that.* Options: The other thing that got to me before I even got into game was the (lack of?) options for graphics. You can set a few basic options from low, medium, or high. Basically, there's really no graphical options for the game. That being said, for a port from a game that was based on Xbox 360 graphics, I really cannot complain. Is it better than the original? Of course. Is it modern PC graphics? No, not by a long shot. But hey, it's a port. It's not like they went out and hired an entire staff of PC programmers for this single game (I wish, though).* Bugs/glitches: Well, again, for a port it's kind of 'to-be-expected'. Honestly, I'm kind of surprised about how many people are talking about this specifically. Does Darksouls get a bad rating because it natively cannot render 1080p, or display text/textures in HD? No. Everyone goes and downloads DSFix and then stops complaining. I really feel like this is something that people spend too much time on. I found that if I let the game load (e.g. I sat there for a few minutes), it would load the entire level and I'd continue without any disturbance of FPS issues. Later in the game this became extremely uncommon and within 4 hours of playing, I stopped experiencing this issue altogether. Other than a few brief run-ins with a laggy screen, I didn't experience any downsides of 'programming' on their behalf. (Note: I do have a gaming PC, I don't know if that makes a difference when experiencing these issues...)* Overview: Overall, it still feels like the same Fable I played years ago. The dialouge is the same (whether you decide that's good/bad is up to you, I didn't even care that it wasn't HD... you really can't tell, stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing), so the story still really hits home. Everything you used to do? You can still do it. With the exception of some really broken exploits, of course. I was still easily able to navigate the game in my old manner; I had a Master Katana within the first hour (first few quests), and by the middle of the game (before Arena), I was donating hundreds-of-thousands- to the Temple of Avo for all the glory they could bestow onto me. Buy/Sell schemes still work on merchants, the house buying/selling still works, etc... it's pretty much all there. I didn't ever try the time-stop glitch, but only because I didn't need it due to buying/selling Emeralds in Oakvale (honestly why would you need to stop time when you can buy anything?).* Combat: Alright, so I've been playing the whole game (yes, I completed Fable + TLC content) with a F310 Logitech controller. Honestly, combat is a little awkward, at first; having to hold 2 buttons (L2 trigger for lockon; R1 bumper for blocking) + pushing 'X' to attack, + rolling the thumbsticks for directional/camera changes is a BIT much, but after all, it's Fable... You can stop pretending you have to block attacks after you purchase Plate armor and upgrade your Health/Toughness. It becomes less hectic and becomes kind of mundane, but that's how the original one was as well (about to attempt Heric Mode), so again, I cannot complain. Magic use is a bit frustating too, as by default you can only have ONE magic spell readily castable. The way you cycle through them is R2 trigger + 'B', which becomes slow if you have a lot of spells and sometimes, you over-rotate spells and have to re-cycle through them just for the one you wanted... sometimes, in combat. Not fun.* Other Thoughts: I pre-ordered this game, so I was given Scythe's Pack for free. The items it added are interesting and, to say the least, are fun to mess around with. They are not game-breaking and give no edge over someone who does not purchase the pack. Again, I played this game with a F310 Logitech controller and found it rather easy to control after a while of getting used to the controls. I played my first play-through on Normal mode and plan to play again on Heroic and go for 100%.TL;DR version:* I do recommend this game, but remember, it is a port and is not designed for the PC. Please, do not hold it to the same expectations as a newly released PC game. Also, if you happen to encounter some of *many* bugs/glitches, instead of complaining and whining, maybe contact Lionhead support and let them know? Help them fix the problem so we can all enjoy the game. Use a controller for the gameplay, it'll make your life easier. Enjoy the game.			"

												After purchasing the game I found it to cause my system tremendous lag. Even after lowering the game settings, changing my computer settings, even downloading some mods for it, I still could not run it. Looking online, I found that many other people were having the same issues I was. This is with a system that meets and even surpasses the requirements.			"

												Fable Anniversary is the exact same game as Fable: The Lost Chapters (a great game) with somewhat improved graphics. Well, almost exactly the same... Technically they changed the menu layouts. Unfortunately, not for the better.    It's pretty clear that this wasn't intended to be released for the PC originally. This new version is NOT mouse friendly. Unless you use a controller you'll have to rely heavily on the keyboard for most things, which I personally find frustrating; when there are a lot of things that would be much simpler if I could use a mouse. This isn't the only issue with the Anniversary version of Fable either.    The picture looks blurry and washed out on the PC. There is a fix that resolves this issue completely, but it involves some very minor editing of a couple game files. It's fairly simple, but shouldn't be necessary.    As stated though; textures, faces, and such are improved noticeably. A couple of the faces (like the hero as a kid and Maze's) look a bit odd to me though. The only reason to get version is if you really want a the modestly improved graphics and the added outfits & weapons in the DLC. Just be prepared to deal with the mouseless menus and to fix those files I mentioned to clear the picture.			"

												I'm writing this quick review to counter a lot of the negative reviews. I've almost completed the game with every side quest done, and I haven't found any of the issues people are talking about:- Gamebreaking bugs. Not seen any at all. Plus, thanks to the new save systems you can reload often if something happens.- Horrible optimisation. Runs easily at 60fps even on my sub-par laptop. Game looks a lot more pretty than regular fable- Awful camera controls. The camera controls are almost exactly as it was in the original Fable, which I played extensively as a child and had no complaints with. Maybe new people to the game aren't so happy with this? But it seems absolutely fine and easily playable. I was using an Xbox controller to play, and it works seemlesly.Not worth the full price, but it was on sale for £5 and so I definitely recommend it if you can grab it on a sale.			"

												Fable Anniversary is the same thing as Fable: The Lost Chapters with more items, and 'remastered' visuals that makes everyone look like a burn victim. The controls are horrible, there might as well not be keyboard and mouse support, and this game is in no way worth the money they're asking for. It's amazing that Lionhead re-released Fable in this quality and is trying to pretend that it's worth over $30.An absolute regret in every way. I love Fable a little bit less.			"

												A great game although it is currently not worth buying. I have a fairly powerfull laptop with a 750m and this game is completely unplayable. This was terribly optimized and there is no mouse support in the menus. There are almost no graphics options in the menu and you can't rebind keys or view a key mao from the main menu.  I will likely buy the dlc if the game is patched and all current issues are resolved. I bought this game out of anticipation of being able to play my favorute game again but they have been crushed for now.			"

												While the graphics were improved, the faces looks so bizarre. Light catches on their faces really terribly and for a game that had such a cartoon-ish charm to have faces that are, I guess, supposed to look more realistic is just awkward as Hell. The menus not having mouse support is sad. The way that camera ""bounces"" when you turn it from side to side is dizzying and irritating and cannot be changed.The original game was great, this remake, in my opinion, not so much. But it is prettier. And that's really all it has going for it.			"

												I'm very disapointed... Let me inform you of the pros & cons. Pros: ""Most"" textures & models look nicer, a few new items.Cons: Why was the mouse & more importantly middle mouse button not only stupidly chosen to be ""block"", but intentionally locked from us changing it back from this infuriating decision!The hero looks like an ugly thug, not anything like ""a hero"" nor even the hero we knew & loved being.No new quests, zero improvments noticable to justify what I've payed for it, not to mention the let down from being hyped about a childhood game.""""Imagine my foul language here:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------""""			"

												Big thumbs down.  While the textures have a higher resolution, etc, the art just isn't as good, IMHO.  Buy Fable: The Lost Chapters instead, and crank up the detail level.  It actually looks better -- the models, characters, etc, clearly had more effort put into them in the original than they did for the remake.Big, big waste of money, especially when the original still looks and plays fine.

												Played Fable on Xbox originally. Played through the pc Version whith lost chapters included, Played fable 2 and 3 on xbox 360, and now the remastered version of fable also including the lost chapters and completely redone graphically. The game is still great. I have played through 2 times on Anniversary and collected everything possible so its sad to say there is no longer anything to accomplish after the time i have put in. If you originally enjoyed fable on xbox and more specifically you played the pc version this one controls much the same. A little wonky with the mouse but you can get used to it easily in an hour or so. The character model for the main heros face looks kind of weird in the remastered version. The new additions to fable anniversary are Hero mode and the dlc. Hero mode is fable hard mode. There are more enemies they seem to be more agressive and harder to kill. This is also particularely noted with the bosses. That being said you can do whatever you want in fable so you can get quite good weapons and armour right from the start depending on your strategy. Also noted in hero mode there are no resurection phial which means instead you will be given 1 health potion where a phial would be. The shopkeepers also hold very little health and mana potions and mana is consumed alot faster when using magic abilities. Having played alot of fable in the past the hard mode was not really much more hard and it just meant that it took a bit longer to accomplish objectives . Unless you really like fable this is where i would recommend this game. Also unless you are really into cosplay in fable i would not recommend the dlc as the weapons and armour are not adding much to your experience.			"

												The original Fable holds a place in my heart, and the idea of a HD remaster of this game should have been a pleasant, nostalgic experience. However, due to clunky programming, thrown together UI, frequent clipping issues and overall lazy efforts on behalf of the developement team, this game is only a glimps of what it could have been. The core game is still in tact, and just as enjoyable (and recommended) but the original has had a lot more love put into it and is more deserving of your money.Fable remains a very enjoyable experience, and worthy of multiple playthroughs. Either version is worth picking up, as the remasters pros are equalled by it's cons. Pick this up if you're a hardcore fan or if it's on sale, otherwise the original remains cheaper and more authentic.			"

Over 9000/10 would recommend this game	 to anyone who has missed out on the original, whether they've played any Fable titles or not, and I would recommend anyone who's previously enjoyed this game to buy it again. You can never go wrong with Fable or Fable 2. Gve me crap about liking F2, but gun's aside, and even partially included, it was another great, fun, time consuming game. Fable 3 was still some fun, but  very  lacking IMHO. However,  this game  is one of several that win the test of time award in my book. It's been ages since I've thoroughly enjoyed this game, so I can't give it much more word than that, but I will go through the game again and re-do my review to highlight pro's and cons. Happy gaming and have fun with Fable!			"

												If you don't own this game, and have never played it, I honestly suggest you try to find the original version first. If you owned the original, and maybe still do, do not buy this game. The only new content is the DLC, and the menu went from PC optimized with everything clearly laid out and accessible, and a whole host of options to choose from to adjust your gameplay experience to the barest minimum of options, and a consolified UI that is more confusing than useful.In the end, this was a fun game with a decent story that was badly updated with an eye only for strip mining nostalgia for the original and maybe making a bit more money off DLC, rather than actually providing a fun return to Albion for old players, and giving new players a chance to fall in love with the series.

												I played the original fable and to me this feels like a well due tribute. Even if you have already beaten the original I would highly recommend this as a nostalgic rerun. In my honest opinion though, As a word of advice, I would only buy this when it's on sale only because of the limitations of the game due to when it was actually created. Nowadays people are used to giant open world maps, but this game still delivers that in a sense being able to pick up where you left off. All in all I would give this game an 8.5/10 only because the controls feel quite wonky at first, but once you get used to them or make your own adjustments you will most certainly find yourself spending well enjoyed, reminiscent hours of fun even if you've never played this before.

												This reveiw is coming for a slighlty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off DIE HARD fable the lost chapters fan.i played fable the lost chapters as a young child more then once probablly 9-10 times all the way through and i loved it to no end i would have given it a 9/10 and have nothing super bad to say about it but fable anniversary♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off quite a few times, first it changed the inventory form pressing esc to F which i thought was pretty ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and after 12 hours i'm still not used to it, but the worst part of it is the ♥♥♥♥ING INVENROTY GLITCH. i hate this glitch to no end and it never seemed to stop once it started, it would take your inventory either all the way to the left, bottom, or top and wouldn't let you move it. in order to fix it you had to save, reload and bam its gone. nothing to serious right well if you in thr middle of a quest it starts it all over again if you didn't finish the quest first this game has been out a year and this glitch is still in it like WTF WHY FIX IT ALREADY.Okay now that that is off my chest i can finally get to the game itself. It plays pretty much the same as TLC (the lost chapters) and i'm glad that they did that seeing as the combat system and what not havent been ♥♥♥♥ed with i'm glad and don't have to ♥♥♥♥♥ about it.so the final vertic is it worth its price, no, unless your a die hard fable 1 or TLC fan and even then its not worth full price buy it on sale or don't buy it, its not as bad as some say but its not perfect either although i don't reccomend to new players to Fable (buy TLC its also on steam and plays♥♥♥♥♥♥tons better at the price of graphics but who cares about graphics, TLC's graphics are fine in my opion) if your super die hard and want that one last play through pick it up on sale and give it ago.although i'm giving it a negitive reveiew i don't hate the game or Fable i just hate how they ♥♥♥♥ed up the inventory so much and how the ingame DLC iteams are SUPER over priced.

												I saw that this game had some mixed reactions and I honestly don't understand why. I like that this is just a touched up version of the original. That is what a remaster is after all.While Fable II is my favorite in the series, Fable was a go-to on my Xbox before The Lost Chapters came to PC. At it's time, it felt like the first game where you could just do anything you want. The game is very light-hearted and secretly cruel. In this version, they've updated the graphics for modern PCs (while still looking like Fable). They added native Xbox 360 controller support, and they've added Steam achievements. I'm really impressed.			"

												Fable Anniversary....You were the chosen one! I had so much hope for you!The original PC version (TLC) was beyond a doubt one of the greatest, underrated games of its time. The pile of, well frankly,♥♥♥♥♥♥that has been made available on Steam is a pale comparison to the game of old. Sure the graphics are a little bit smoother, but that is the one single thing that has been improved on. The actual graphics themselves are no better than they were 10 years ago. Couple this with the fact that the game stutters it's way through sections for no apparent reason other than that that is what it wants to do. The controls are horrendous unless you use a game pad, with no option to key bind for the keyboard and mouse, you're left with some un-intuitive system that seemingly was designed by someone with no background in PC gaming.For Lionhead's sake I hope they patch this quick, they're losing a large audiences attention very quickly with this. Pull your finger out and patch it, before the modders beat you to it!No vote until patched.../rant			"

												Ok, so they have released a patch to fix some of the issues. The UI is still broken however. You still can't navigate though the menus with a mouse, nor can you reassign the (stupid) menu keys.  You can map more of the keys (note thats STILL ""more"" not ""all""). While trying to reassign the keys to something a little more sane I discovered you can't map anything to ctrl or alt, and that left shift and right shift are treated as the same key.  also the ' key is forbidden for keyboard mapping.  No idea why, it just ""is"". Oh, and ""accept"" and ""back"" are still hardcoded to ""A"" and ""B"".  Nice first try, now how about giving us a patch that actually FIXES the issues we're all complaining about.-- ORIGINAL REVIEW STARTS HERE --I wanted to like this game, I really did. I even played it past the intro level (which has an annoying about of cutscenes) in the hope I'd get used to the UI and controls. But this has to be the worst port I have ever had the misfortune to pre-purchace.  The User Interface is horrible, the ""new"" graphics are nothing much (and some of the ""new"" faces are appalingly ugly).  This is a quick and dirty port of a console version rather than a PC version.  How quick and dirty?  The ""A"" and ""B"" buttons from the joystick have been assigned to the ""A"" and ""B"" keys on the keyboard so they didn't have to change anything else.  Half the keys (and as far as I can tell, all the mouse commands) cannot be redefined, some of the special moves (flaunt, first person perspective when using a bow) either don't work at all, or work so sporadically as to be unusable. Quest markers for secondary missions are either missing or randomly vanish (and so do some guard quest NPC's, don't tell someone to wait then go kill bandits, you'll come back to find they have vanished and the quest is now unplayable).If there was a reasonable way to hand this back for a refund I'd be at the head of the queue.  Until they release a patch for at least the UI and quests, I'd advise leaving this alone and trying the older ""fable lost levels"" instead.  It's cheaper, and apparantly has a UI that actually works.			"

												This game seems to be getting a lot of bad reviews, but my experience has been nothing but positive. I haven't encountered a single bug, glitch or crash, if the game had problems they've apparently worked them. The graphics and animation look fine to me, better than I was expecting, but then again I'm not the type of person who expects every blade of grass to be rendered in stunning detail in order to enjoy a game. The UI and controls all look and work fine and the menus are easy to navigate.  Keep in mind, I use a controller so I can't speak to the keyboard/mouse use.I never player the original Fable but I was a big fan of both Fable II and III on Xbox 360 so it was nice to add to that experience. I've already got over 50 hours into it and I'm already looking forward to a second playthrough. As I said, I never played the original so I can’t say how much difference there is, but if you haven’t played it than it’s definitely worth the money in my opinion.			"

												Would definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoyed Fable 1/The Lost Chapters. Make no mistake, this is Fable 1 all over again with really nothing new other than a visual overhaul. You're getting the authentic Fable experience, quirks and all. I bought this game, on sale, right as I was getting ready to play through Fable 1 again anyway. Playing this instead definitely scratched that itch.I've tread across the original too many times to count and know it pretty well, and it was really cool to see how everything looked in Anniversary. All I know is that every time I saw a familiar face or location, I sat there with a stupid grin on my face seeing the updated graphics. This is a prettier version of the original Fable, and that's perfectly fine with me.			"

Fable is geniune enjoyment for the pure sense of enjoyment. If you are a fan of RPGs and good humour and are looking for a casual game, this is the game for you.Pros:Easy and flexible control schemeHilarious gameplayCons:Lack of challengelimited character optionsrailroad plot "

												Edits for the previous updates: I won't be spending any addition money on this title soon, and I don't think you should either, unless its on sale. The updates have been coming in, and we have recieved what we demanded in a quality game. This still doesn't change the fact that I feel the original remains superior.There are a few big issues I still see in this title. The graphics, while improved from the original, fail to meet the current standards for games of this art style. There are many textures that don't even meet the debatable quality of the rest of the game. Many of the characters that looked fine in the original, now look disgusing.Mouse support on the menus is enough to make me consider playing it more, but I'm experiencing frame-rate issues for no obvious reason. A shame, as I have complete the original many times, and want to play the harder difficulties that Anniversary offers.TL;DR My opinion on the game has increased immensly from its original release date, but it has yet to meet the standards it should. If the game continues to be improved by the developers, then it may just get my approval someday.			"

												In short: This is a great game. Any bugs or glitches that were there, are no longer there so don't worry about that when purchasing this game. It has a great storyline, one of the best combat systems, a huge arsenal of weaponry/spells, and a great system for customizing your character.Storymode: The storymode in the game is one of my all time favorites in rpg's. Getting scarred as a child, then living a life where you thirst for revenge. And like every story, when seeking revenge, betrayal is not far behind.Combat Style: I've played a lot of rpg's and this is a combat style that I wish more fantacy rpg's will focus on. You can easily organize your massive library of spells to work with your combat when needed. Unlikeother games I found this one a lot easier to defend myself against enimies, yet still gave me a challenge if I wasn't paying enough attention.Character Customization: As you play the game you begin to aquire more clothing/armour, as well find some tattoo parlours/hairsalons. With clothing you can mix and match or easily set it to the presets. Each set of clothing not only helps you with your armour, but with how you look to other npc's, Rather you're trying to attract a babe, or scare a gaurd the Algorythm in doing so is very simple to understand. When it comes down to tattoo/hairstylists, there are several locations in doing so. Each location has different styles, and certain artists don't have a stationary building so you are able to go on a random walk in the woods and end up getting a haircut and a new tattoo along the way. Bugs and Glitches: I didn't buy the game when it first came out so my following statement is how the game is currently. Mind you I 100% the game so I was still able to experience everything, and I'm not reviewing this whilst I'm in the middle of the game. The only bugs that I did get are the following: Getting stuck between two objects, when this happened I simply tp'd out and continued on (This happened only once through my entire play through). Near the end of the game I tried to kill an enemy with my sword and when doing so my game crashed, I resolved this problem by killing him with my bow instead. After doing so I had 0 problems with that quest and at no other point did I have that problem. After I 100% the acievments I was awarded the achivment via game but I wasn't via steam. Which is frustraiting but nothing to cry over. In simple terms the game has very minimal bugs, all of which were easily resolved. "

Posted: September 13, 2014
												I loved Fable TLC and have played it at least 4 times over the years.  When I heard about Fable Anniversary and saw some of the preview pics I made a point to pre-order.  That was a mistake.The graphics are largely better than Fable TLC, but still underwhelming.  On close up the hero's hair looks bad, and Whisper's looks even worse.  There's odd lighting around the hair and face of the models.  The hero's eyes look dead - totally a 2 dimensional surface.  You can see this in TotalBiscut's review at about the 11:25 mark.  The eyes in TLC by comparison look much better (which you can also see in his video).  There is a bit of a blur over everything and some of the ambient occlusion looks pretty bad.  There's already user-made .ini tweaks on the Steam forums to deal with some of these issues and using them does provide some improvement.The real problem is the horrible controls.  There is no mouse control for the game menus and the keyboard controls are nonsensical.  They literally mapped the A, B, and Y keys of the Xbox 360 controller to the A, B, and Y keys of the keyboard to manipulate many of the menu functions in the game.  I've never seen the B key used to manipulate menus in a game before.  It's not a great innovation.The inventory screen is completely changed from TLC's for the worse.  To do anything inventory related in this version you start with the Insert and Home keys to navigate tabs, then use the Delete and End keys to navigate sub-tabs, then switch to the arrow keys to navigate lists and sub-lists, then the A key wear, equip, or bind something, then B to exit out.  Sometimes Esc will get you back directly to the game, sometimes not.  It's really clunky.  The layout itself has a ton of wasted screen space on colors, tabs, and subtabs with only a small amount of screen real estate devoted to actually display the items you are carrying.There is no mouse sensitivity adjustment.  When I first started playing in Oakvale just turning the camera was strikingly jarring.  I don't know why, I just finished Skyrim a few weeks ago and had no issue with swinging the camera around in that game, but here in Fable Anniversary I found it terribly jarring visually.  I thought maybe turning down the mouse sensitivity would help...but there's no way to do that.  Maybe this is just a personal thing that I'll get used to.The oddness of combining orb gathering and spell use on the left shift still persists and is just as troublesome as it was in the original.  Blocking and dodging are on the middle mouse button.  Maybe that was fine 9 years ago when I played with a gaming mouse that actually had a middle mouse button, but today I have a scroll wheel there and that scroll wheel button is a terrible way to control such critical functions like block and dodge.  It's not as sensitive and fairly uncomfortable.There is some key remapping available once you have loaded a game, but critical keys (like the A and B use to navigate the menus, attack, block, dodge, etc.) cannot be remapped.  I wish I could remap dodge and block to some of the other mouse buttons on my Death Adder 2013, but that's not possible.  Exiting game is probably the worst I've seen in any PC game in years.  You hit Esc, then A to select save game, arrow keys to choose a save slot, A to save, B to go back to the menu, hit the arrow down key 4 or 5 times to select Quit, A to quit, wait for a loading screen to the main menu, hit the arrow down key 7 or 8 times to select exit to Windows, hit A to exit. Every.Single.Time.You.Quit.The.Game.  In 2014 it should be substantially easier to save and quit a computer game.Some of these control issues can be mitigated by using an Xbox 360 controller.  I happen to have one and tried it but I thought the quick menu to access the many expressions and inventory items to be atrocious.  There is no key remapping for either of the 2 controller layout options.To sum up: I'm disappointed.  I expected better graphics.  For regular (non menu) gameplay the keyboard/mouse controls aren't too bad or too changed from the original but they certainly weren't updated or improved.  The inventory menu layout is overly complicated and the menu controls are abysmal.  It all works, mind you.  It's all functional.  But it's not very well done and absolutely mars a really great game.As for stability, I've only played a little over 2 hours and haven't had any stuttering or other visual issues being reported on Steam forums.  No crashes either.  I have an i7-3770, 8 GB RAM, and an Nvidia GTX 770.I wish I had waited for this come on sale on Thanksgiving or maybe Christmas. I still love Fable and still think it's a great game, but Fable Anniversary did not live up to expectations.  There's a really great game underneath the clunky interface and inventory menu system.  It's a shame that Fable Anniversary didn't really polish up Fable TLC and really make the game shine.			"

												Played this for about 15 minutes before I got a headache. The screen is so blurry that your eyes can't figure out what to focus on, and everything in the world seems to somehow jitter whenever the camera moves. This gave me a headache faster than Antichamber did which is impressive. Beyond that, graphically it's not really much of an improvement and somehow looks like 15fps even when running at 60+. Quite an accomplishment.The controls were stiff, and as you probably already know are not changeable. It's an awful port in general and I can safely say I wouldn't recommend this even on sale. I feel like I got ripped off for the first time in a long time on Steam.			"

												I wanted to love this game. I really, really did. I played the original Fable, and the Lost Chapters, way back in the day on XBox, so I was excited to get this version. And to it's credit, yes, the game is still the Fable I know and love.However.The game is so ridiculously touchy and prone to freezing it takes a whole lot of the fun out of it. Trying to alt-tab freezes the game and I have to reload from a checkpoint. Multiple times the game has frozen so badly I had to restart my entire computer. In fact, that's what happened just now and what prompted me to write this review: the game decided to randomly start hardcore freezing on me when I entered Darkwood, and I couldn't even get to my Task Manager to force close it. I've had to restart my computer twice so far. Googling reveals these problems have been going on since the game's launch with no clear source. Save your money and give this one a pass.			"

												First off I have been a long, long, long term fan of the Fable series.  Always loved Lionhead, but this is just broken.  Mouse/keyboard is a fail.  Worse is the game is jerky, laggy, and crashes.  It is not my PC, as I have had no issue ever playing other much more hardware demanding games.  This port is the nail in the coffin for me and Lionhead.  I'll probably still play due to nostalgia of the old days, but I really wish I could get my money back.  Playing this port brings me back to the days of DOS games and their mad user interface.  Always loved the Fable series, until now.  Please fix the issues, that should have never happened, and I would gladly re-review.  Buy it for the old days, and yell at it for the utter failure of an attempt to update a really great game.			"

												Wait before you buy.I've made it to the Bandit King, and there is only one problem I have one into and it is the freezes. It seems the farther into the game you get the more frequent the freezes happen and longer the duration. Other than that, the game is better than I expected. I love this game as a child and I have waited for this PC port for quite some time. I'm not sure what most of these reviews complaining about the game being blurry are, the game is beautiful. All I did was turn off Vertical Sync and went on my way. Nothing was blurry, no texture problems, anything. It's the old game I remember, just touched up a bit with a few added bonuses. Hopefully they don't just ignore us PC users and fix this freeze, but until then it isn't worth the buy, sadly.			"

												Fable: The Lost Chapers, was one of my favourite games as a child. When I heard about Fable Anniversary, I bought it withotut expecting much; I thought it would just be a HD remaster. Maybe fix some of the glitches. What I got was:+ Improved shading.+ Improved sound qualityImproved texture resolution and models, though the faces are all hideous.- Interface that's about as user-friendly as forks being jammed under your toenails.- No mouse control in menus.- HORRIBLY clunky camera that seems to have trouble going around corners without jumping around.- Sound cutting off and crackling whenever it feels your headset and/or ears aren't being tortured enough.- Random Crashes- Combined key commands that shouldn't have been combined- such as dodge/rolling- Not being able to edit all of the controls without digging around in the filesFable Anniversary is not worth the $35 price tag. The original Fable:TLC is superior in every way, unless you put graphics over gameplay. The graphical improvments are not enough to make up for the technical trainwreck that is Fable Anniversary. This is a shoddy port that simply feels unfinished. Alot of work has to be put into it before I would consider it supeior to the classic in any way.			"

												My sympathies to anyone that shelled out the £27 for this game expecting a quality remake. Let this be a lesson to us all.This remake has been designed for a console and not PCs and the shoddy porting does not justify the price tag. Porting a console game for PCs and not redesigning the control interface to take advantage of the versitility of keyboards is just outright lazy. The developers should be ashamed.The simplified interface is a big problem. My impression is they designed it to be attractive instead of functional. Menus do not support mice and are awkward to navigate.Another couple of flaws with this game are hard-coded keybinds and non-reprogrammable key functions. First off they are scattered all over the keyboard [Menu navigation keys especially]. Secondly if you are using directional keys you will find that a lot of the neighboring keys cannot be rebound. Unless you are born with a third, usuable arm it is difficult to use the controls effectively.Lastly, for a game that is focused around cosmetic improvements it does not offer much fine-tuning for the graphics. It offers very few options [Which is a huge problem for lower-end computers, since minimal settings are still overstrained by the games poor optimization]. The only way to modify specific graphical features is to root around the files and modify configs. Players should NEVER have to do this.I have no found no notable qualities that makes this game superior to the original Fable.P.S - You can take your enforced Depth of Field and Bloom and shove it up your asses. If I wanted those on all the time I would just save my GPU the trouble and smear grease on my screen. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												100% Exactly like Fable, except with 2010-2014 graphics! So many great childhood memories flooding back with every step through this game. Music, sound effects, voice acting, all the same. Completely worth the money. The additional content adds a bit more flare, but doesn't overpower your character by allowing you to just have it. You must purchase everything, and they range in price because of their quality. This is a good thing, because you wouldn't want the best sword in the game before you become an adult. They still make you play the game to get the good stuff.			"

												Bad stuff:Cinematicas are renderred at a poor bitrate.Textures are far away from HD.I know when the original was released, but now they could do motion capture, cause characters' emotions and movements are so awkward.Shaders are not applicable for 3D stereo, some fixes are needed.Now the good stuff. The main thing-this is like a real fairy tale, the plot and voice actors play is great(except women speaking for children squeezing their voices to seem immature-that's ugly, sorry...). The music was written by a genius. It's so true and impressive.If they make motion capture-this will be a really amazing game.I had no any troubles with controls, everything is fine for me. At least you can remap your keyboard keys almost for everything.			"

												Fable is one of my favorite game series of all time. If you liked the original, picking up the remaster is a no-brainer. It's funny how little it seems upgraded until you fire up the old version and are reminded how old it actually is. The graphics are actually MUCH better now, not just in terms of poly count and textures, but also in the lighting and post processing. Fable probably won't play well on a keyboard and mouse. I have always just used a controller on my PC to play it. The 360 version works great. I love that they also ported over the control scheme from Fable 2 and 3 so you select either that or the classic Fable controller setup. Now, Lionhead: WHERE IS FABLE 2 FOR THE PC?!?!			"

												This remake is a bit of a disappointment. The graphics, like lighting, models, and textures, look better. However, they have made the interface worse! It is not a PC interface, by any stretch of the imagination; the menus are built with controllers in mind. You even use the A key to select menu options, and PAGE UP/PAGE DOWN and HOME/END to navigate through the menus. Ridiculous!I have myself noticed a bit of dodgy mouse control when moving the camera. It lags a bit, and it seems to be certain predetermined positions the camera ""nodges into"" when you stop the movement. Not very smooth at all.The rest of the game is just as the original Fable: The Lost Chapters, but the better graphics does not really make up for the worse interface.The game does however perform very good. I get almost constant 144+ FPS on my GTX 670.			"

												I never had the opportunity to play the original, but heard so much praise for the series over the years that when I saw this I jumped at the chance, and I'm glad I did! It's certainly a little dated and clunky in places, but that's to be expected from a game originally from 2004.The graphics look great, and from what I've seen of the original, are a huge improvement. It runs at a steady 60-120fps and fully supports 1080p-4K. I've been running it on a 1920x1080 screen, but downsampling from 4K using GeForce DSR, so it looks very nice.I've been playing with a 360 controller and it works perfectly. Havn't tried M+KB much, but they seem to be well supported.I havn't finished the game yet, but I've enjoyed every moment of it so far; a well-rounded RPG that gives you quite a lot of freedom in how you tackle quests. Coupled with the traditional British Lionhead humour and passion, good & evil choices, and addictive gameplay, it's a lot of fun!			"

												I played this on Xbox when it first came out and absolutley loved it (I never could get into Fable 2 or Fable 3, though my kids played them a lot). I thought I would purchase this for myself and have a go at it to see if I could rekindle the old adoration. Nope, it's just not there. Despite the facelift, this game hasn't aged well. If you have never played it then perhaps you will enjoy it, but the game simply can't live up to the memories for me. The graphics are dated, I am having all kinds of problems aiming with the left stick with the bow (Too used to right thumbstick now), and dungeons that repopulate with the same monsters once you have cleared them, had me uninstalling after a few hours. There are better dungeon romps out there and for me, this one is better left in the past.It does have it's charm, and maybe for some younger gamers, it might still have enough oomph to draw you in. It's not a terrible game by any means. Give it a go if you have never played it, and judge for yourself.6.5/10			"

So far I have 6 hours in the game and I can see why people hype over Fable! It is lots of fun. They don't make RPG's like these anymore. Sure, it is a bit outdated, but if you are a RPG lover you'll love this game. The storyline is cool too.However, I don't really think its worth 30 bucks. The game doesn't fully run smoothly for me, which is kind of annoying.If you like RPG's: Get it when it is on sale :)			"

												It seems like a lot of people who have reviewed this game poorly either played the game before the implementation of the newest patches or were expecting the game to be on the visual level of fable III. This game is an HD remaster of a 10 year old game, so of course it's not going to look quite as good. Having said that, I still think it looks great. If you already own the original version of the game and are still content with it, then it probably isn't worth it for you to buy the anniversary edition. However, if you have never played fable before and are looking to get into it (or you just don't have it on steam) then I'd highly recommend spending the extra cash for the anniversary edition. Excellent combat system, captivating storyline, and this is one of the few games that make me feel like my decisions have an impact. 10/10			"

												I feel a little bad giving this a thumbs-down, because I don't strongly dislike it... but I probably wouldn't give it above about a 7.5/10, and to me, that deserves a thumbs down. I never played the original Fable games myself, but I remember seeing friends play them and they looked like they'd be a lot of fun, so when this went on sale a few weeks ago, I thought, ""Hey, I should check this out!""In some ways, I'm glad I did. I got 25 solid hours out of it, for $8.74—which is not great, but is also not bad. But then I hit a wall. I'm the kind of person who has to get all the achievements in every game I play. I played WoW for, like, three or four months (most of it during Mists of Pandaria) and got about 85% of the achievements that the entire game had to offer, to give you an idea of how I play games. And for most of the game, Fable was working just fine.But once I beat the game on the standard difficulty, I ran into some problems. There were a couple missing achievements (like beating Whisper without getting hurt) that I hadn't even noticed in time to get them on my original playthrough, so I figured I could just go through on Heroic and take care of those. I got that one, but found around the same time that hitting three enemies with a single flourish is essentially impossible to do on purpose, and I hadn't had it happen on accident throughout my entire Normal run. Likewise, there was the achievement for getting all the hero dolls that seems like it's going to be nearly impossible to do, without just sinking hours and hours into it in hopes of getting lucky. That's not how achievements should work, I'd say.And then there's Heroic difficulty. It started out just fine. I got through the training, ventured out to Bowerstone, did the first few quests, and then tried to make my way through Greatwood Lake. First I ran into an Earth Troll. ""Uh oh,"" I thought. ""This could be pretty difficult to beat on Heroic."" But with some careful dodging, I took it down—only to run into three bandits who had such an incredibly high amount of health that I couldn't even take *one* down with ALL of my MP into lightning AND all the crossbow firing I could get out before they caught up to me and killed me.Now, I don't think I'm bad at this game. I made it through Normal without EVER dying. But I tried this same spot of Heroic three or four times and had the same result each time, despite gaining some experience from each of the failed attempts before dying, and then using it to boost some of my stats. I would have had to spend an inordinate amount of time grinding experience to just get past three random bandits in Greatwood Lake, much less that first Balverine you come across in the swamp area. This seems like poor scaling to me, and essentially made me quit the game.It wasn't the only thing that pushed me in that direction, though. I thought the Good/Evil system was pretty good for a while. I went through all of Normal trying to make the most Good decisions possible, because I'm a good little boy. Then I found out that Good players just don't get as many options or as much good stuff as Evil players. It's quite limited, and I object to that design as well.All in all, this game does have quite a few things going for it, and it has an overall enjoyable game style. That's why I'd give it about a 7.5/10. But no higher.			"

												This game brings back some memories, but after about 5 hours of running just fine on my computer, the game now runs exxtremely slow and choppy. I really just turned the game off, went to sleep, and now it runs so slow I can barely play it at all. I really don't think it is my computer, other games run as they did before. I wish i could keep playing it though.			"

												Would definitely recommend this game to anyone who has played the Fable on the original Xbox, or is looking for a time consuming, open world, character destiny choosing RPG. Game brought back alot of memories, and is very pleasant to look at. After you finish the main story, you have many side quests to keep yourself occupied. If you finish the game as a good hero, why not play it again as a not so good one? The possibilites are endless in this vintage diamond of a game. I love it. 10/10 in my book.			"

DLC mainly which is♥♥♥♥♥♥ The graphics look lovely and the sound as been redone. The gameplay is just like the original fable. I still love the Fable and the gameplay still drew me in. however it also made me want to play fable 2 more. unfortunatlly it was never ported to PC so i will have to play Xbox. worth a buy in my opinion.

												Not as good as Fable 1 & 2, but still a good game. I'm just gonna list the cons,1. The difficulty, dont play on the easy mode, you are practically immortal(with potions ofc). I didnt die once in a full playthrough. I never failed a mission once either.2. Optimization/Graphics, well its HD, it does look good. But, some animations lag. My system should be able to run 4 instances of this game at the same time. Dont get me wrong, its not a constant lag or anything, just some animations do lag, so I guess it isnt completly optimized.3. The interaction with NPCs, for example, if you want to have sex with your SO you'll have to court him/her alot. Then get married. Then court them again alot more before you can have sex. I dont really play games like Fable for the static 15 second moaning and a black screen, but still. And particulary Lady Grey, you have to court here like a million times. Literally.4. The short gameplay, mainquests took about 6 hours for me. In 13 hours I completed all sidequests aswell, including the 2 godly weapons you get from the 'good' and the 'bad' worshippers. I didnt get all Demon Doors and Silverkey-chests though, so I guess you can add 1-2 more hours if you include those.5. The money-making method, for obvious reasons, I'm not gonna say it here and spoil your potential gameplay, but did they really think this through, spend 1 ""skillpoint"" and be able to resell everything right after you bought it to gain gold? Thats uncool. But then again, you dont have to use it.6. Lack of buildings that you can buy. Also, you cant decorate your houses manually.7. Gear, the lack of diversity is absolutely ridiculous. The best weapons and armors is available for you after 10 minutes of gameplay. It doesnt matter that the town you start in has supereasy surroundings and the last places you visit has semi-powerfull enemies, they sell the same gear, for the same prices. Some items cant be bought, but only found through secret quests, which is a good thing.8. The controls, dont play this with your keyboard+mouse. This game, as all Fable-games, is designed to play with a controller.9. The story, its just dumb and dull. I'll shorten it alot so I dont spoil it. Someone kills your family. You get training to become super OP. Your joruney to seek out revenge on your familys assassins begins. No more, no less.I bought the game on Steam summersale 2016 for €5(+ €4 more for the DLCs). If Fable Anniversary was my first Fable game, I would give a bad rating, because Fable Anniversary isnt any more than a mediocre game to be honest. But as I've played the other games and really loved them, I'm able to see behind the flaws. Im glad I bought it at a saleprice. If you're a fan of RPGs, its a must-buy, but dont expect alot of it. If RPGs isnt your niche, dont get it.			"

												If you love the original Fable/TLC then this brings back all the nostalgia you are looking for with all new graphics. Most will tell you to not pick this game up and just buy the $10 TLC version due to the ""obsurd"" price of this game, I agree completely. If you just want to play Fable only for the nostalgia factor than get the $10 version, but if you want hyped up graphics and nostalgia then grab this or wait for it to go on sale. I only see this game getting better with the implementing of modded versions of this game.			"

												This game doesn't hold up very well.  I loved it when the original came out, but playing it now I realize how pathetically basic it actually is.  I got a laugh out of one of the achievements called ""Definitely Not on Rails"".  It's as if the devs were responding to very rational criticism about how linear the game is by throwing in that passive-aggressive jab.  There are tons of awful game mechanics that haven't changed a bit since the original.  In fact, nothing has changed outside of the HD textures from what I can tell.  The map and fast travel system are awful.  It's amazing with so few choices how easy it is to get lost.  The Quest Area system seems super bugged to me.  You can't leave a quest area without reloading a previous saved game.  Anyway, you get the gist.			"

												This game fails on so many levels and I could not honestly recommend that any serious PC gamers buy this game until it has some serious patches and enhancements made to it.Firstly, IT IS THE MOST BLATANTLY OBVIOUS CONSOLE PORT I'VE EVER SEEN.> The Main Menu does not have mouse support.> Key rebindings can only be accessed in-game, and not through the main menu.> Key rebindings are extremely limited, with hard-locked keys for certain things, and dual functionality keys.> The key rebindings were far more extensive, customisable and USEFUL in Fable: The Lost Chapters.> The in-game Inventory/Quest/etc. menu also lacks mouse support, and is terribly designed for a PC game - with poor use of real-estate, bad structure, etc.Secondly, THIS BARELY EVEN QUALIFIES AS A REMAKE.> It is a HD remaster at best.> Some graphics options that were available in Fable: The Lost Chapters are mysteriously missing in Fable Anniversary, namely Anti-aliasing (I believe Fable Anniversary is hard-locked to some sort of FXAA  - which results in the game looking like a blurry, murky mess).> The only real improvements that I can make out are texture improvements, some mesh improvements (though I was expecting a little better, especially for characters faces), and some nice shadows/post-processing effects.> Due to the lack of a decent and accessible anti-aliasing, I actually find Fable: The Lost Chapters more aesthetically pleasing, because the image is sharper and not as murky or blurred.> On my 16:10 (Native Resolution 1440x900) monitor regular gameplay (not just cutscenes) also has thick black lines at the top and bottom of the screen. I am uncertain as to whether or not this is intentional, and whether or not 16:9 monitors get this as well.All in all, this is a terrible PC port. It needs a decent bit of work before I could honestly recommend it.Totalbiscuit (the YouTube Channel host) also did a good video outlining some flaws of the game and comparing it to Fable: The Lost Chapters.P.S: If you are an Australian citizen like I am, and you are unhappy with this purchase, I believe you can ask for a refund if you have played less than 14 hours of the game. Under Australian law the vendor is REQUIRED to provide you with as refund if the product is not deemed 'Fit for Purpose', which I would argue it is not, as it does not fulfil it's purpose of being a fully functional PC game.

												I'm not going to write a conventional review on this game but I will leave my thoughts after playing it for about an hour.WARNING: This will be a rant in most places, but I will do my best.What I liked:- The Nostalgia: This is the reason I bought the game, and in most places, it delivered, at least aesthetically.- The Graphics: This is a bit of a double-edged sword... They look impressive enough (certainly an upgrade) but there are issues.What I disliked:- The Voice Acting: This is only a small point I suppose, but something miffed me about it... Much of this has remained from the original game, which is fine, absolutely fine, but the very first opening cutscene seems to have been re-recorded or remastered or they've done something to it, and it sounds terrible. The actor does not sound enthusiastic about this heroic tale that is about to unfold, and not only that, the sound quality is awful. Not sure if it's a problem on my end but it wasn't terrific, and for an opening cutscene I would expect something to excite me about indulging in my nostalgia and playing one of my favourite childhood games again, but in HD - the concept grabbed me and I threw my wallet at them, I really wish I hadn't now and spent it on something else, and I will explain why in the next point.- The Menu, Inventory, etc......... : I have no idea who designed this menu, but I do not think they were human. It is just so fiddly, so much so that it irritates me too much to even want to play the game. You can assign things, sure, but doing that takes some real jiggery-pokery, a little too much if you ask me. It's like trying to crack the da vinci code, when all I want is to eat an apple pie from my potions and produce tab. It has NO MOUSE OPTIMISATION. This is the big one everyone is talking about and I feel it needs to be heard. The original game had perfectly fine mouse optimisation. To call the game a HD remake and not have mouse optimisation is absolutely mind blowing to me. I know HD more so focuses on the graphics, but if its a testament to the original, I would expect everything to be in place that was originally, such as being able to use your mouse to select things in a menu... When I loaded the game up I was all excited to get stuck in, but my heart sank when I tried to use my mouse and realised I could not. That was the point where I realised that this would be a bad port, and it was from the very start.- The Options Menu: You are able to keybind some things... When you actually get into the game, mind you. But not the attack function, block function or anything important... The controls are fine for me, as I said previously. I can get on with them fine, it's a perfect setup for me. But for other people that's probably not the case, it's definitely something that should be there, why? Because Fable: The Lost Chapters had it. You could keybind anything.It's a terrible port at the moment. I really hope that a patch is released to make things easier for people who want to enjoy it on their PCs with a keyboard and mouse. I enjoyed Fable: The Lost Chapters perfectly fine on my PC, in fact I have done at least 4 seperate playthroughs of the game because I enjoyed it that much. This was one of my main childhood games. I feel as if its ruined, all because of this console focus they have gone with. ""Play it with a controller"" some people are saying - no. Why should I? If you're going to release a PC port of a game, do it right. I play on a PC. If I wanted to play it on a console I'd buy the console version of the game. I don't. The Graphics: As mentioned before, there are issues. Nothing major, the graphics do look okay to me. They didn't exactly blow me away, but they are certainly an upgrade, which I appreciate. I am not technically minded about this kind of thing, so forgive me for my simplistic manner of explaining it. There appears to be blur on some of the models. Yup. It's like blurry textures, and eventually they fade back to being detailed again. Its weird. It's only a small thing, it doesn't bother me that much, but the fact that they can't even get the graphics 100% right and they're calling this HD makes me laugh. Oh yeah, and the graphics options do not give you much freedom to do anything either.At this point I am terribly disappointed and would not recommend to any like-minded PC gamers like myself. If you can enjoy the game with a console controller, fine. You will probably have a blast, but that menu is enough for me to put this game down until it gets fixed, if it gets fixed.			"

												I want my money back.  This is another example of a crappy PC port.  Could have been great but the designers just didn't care about supporting the PC interface.  The keyboard and mouse don't work on the menus at all.  Once started up you can't even shut the game down without a controller!  I dug one out, dusted it off, installed the drivers - and found out that you can't configure the keyboard/mouse controls once you do select them.  Having wasted an hour and $35 dollars I'm walking away from this and playing something else.  What a ripoff.			"

												I'm not going to write a conventional review on this game but I will leave my thoughts after playing it for about an hour.WARNING: This will be a rant in most places, but I will do my best.What I liked:- The Nostalgia: This is the reason I bought the game, and in most places, it delivered, at least aesthetically.- The Graphics: This is a bit of a double-edged sword...

												The game looks okay graphicly (and the game play is the same so far as I can tell) , but the port Is awful! You have to use the arrow keys to navigate the main/ options menus and the ""A/B"" keys to select things. This shows almost 0 effort to accommodate for PC users at all and tells me that they were too lazy to change the controller schemes over. This IS PC we have mice, let us use them or at least bind ""okay"" to enter! It does, however have rebindable keys (only one set though) but this will not recognise any extra keys you may have on you mouse or keyboard unlike the old port (also in steam) were you were free to use any extra buttons.on top of this for some unknown reason I was unable to bind to ""TAB"" ( I only tried the auto targeting[default ""Space""] so it may work elsewhere however it seems ""TAB"" is defaulted to chat which I find disorientating ) it did seem to register the button but just flashed red instead of using it. As for the new graphics, they are fairly good but seem washed out and not as bright as they should. (after some fiddling I found that you can correct this by reducing the gamma) That being said, I do have issue with the character models, they look like there from TF2 (very cartoony) and it ruined the feel of the game for me. To me the game was like Skyrim is now. It was not dark per-say, more rustic and I feel that this is lost in the remake, however this is a personal gripe and not a big issue. As for performance, I run a moderate rig (SSD hard drive and a GTX 660 on a 27 inch 1080p acer monitor) and cranked right up to max I get minor lag (25-34 FPS according to audacity) so I feel the optimisation of the game is good if not great.  All in all I think that it is amazing to think that the OLD port is better than the new one in many ways, the graphics do stand up today too if a bit low res, in my opinion. Its sad to see games like this are still coming out from MAJOR companies In this day and age and they will keep happening if we just ignore poorly designed game ports like this.			"

I've had a lot of bad camera angles during cutscenes, floating objects, and the AI companions usually stand around without assisting during fights. Wait for a decent sale to pick this one up if you'd really like to see the ""better"" graphics. Same recommendation for someone who hasn't played the original Fable before. The comedy is there, but the presentation is just a mess.			"

												One step forward, 10 steps back pretty much sums up this retexture.Unfortunately this is a rather poor Xbox One port, that removes all of the good aspects of the original Lost Chapters PC version. Mouse functionality is no longer available in menus, instead navigation is controlled though the Home, End, Insert & Delete keys. You then make a selection using the ""A"" (!?) key.Whilst basic key rebinding is available, the main abilities are locked and cannot be reasssigned - block and dodge are both set to the mouse wheel which makes combat really fiddly for mouse and keyboard. The control scheme was clearly designed for use with an Xbox  controller.  The game seems to use built in FXAA that cannot be toggled off, which gives the game a blurry, unfocused look hiding a large amount of the  higher resolution textures.Until large improvements are patched into this game, save your money and play the arguably much better original that was actually designed to be played on the PC.

												Unfortunately atm I definitely reccomend against getting this game, so far I've experienced crashes almost everytime I try to start a new game, stuttering, bluriness and tbh the graphics aren't really that much of a leap forward. Tried some of the fixes from the community hub and while they did improve performance the fixes also made the game kinda look like garbage. Hopefully these issues get patched soon though and the modding tools let the community make the game actually look like a proepr hd remake.EDIT: After reading up a bit on some of the forums I found that people have been reporting that the stuttering issue only really takes place in Oakvale (the starting area), for me at least it still persited into the Guild area but outside of that it seems to be fine most of the time thankfully.

												I want to, oh how do I want to, but I can't write a positive review for this. It runs fine, the graphics are nice, but here's the thing...You don't play a game for graphics, I don't care who you are but if you give a positive review for this game, I'm calling bs. I'll give a few pros and cons that I have encountered in playing this.Pros:Graphics are better than the origional/Lost chapters.DLC stuff (Trust me I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel with these pros for this game)Personal Pro: You can dress up as a guard and beat up people with a Lute, I love that.Personal Pro: It stays true to the story/doesn't add extra bs to an already told story that isn't needed.Now for the Cons:Buggy menus, I cannot tell you how many people I've talked to where its impossible to buy certian items cause, when I press down on my keyboard, it would instantly snap back up. I am forever Chicken Chaser with a normal haircut and normal beard cause of this. Hopefully this will be fixed one day but as for now, not happy. One other thing I nearly forgot, you have to have at least one item in one of the equipment tab if you accedently buy too much and you want to sell a few back. Sell all your sellable items in one of the tabs and you won't be able to get back into it without exiting the traider's menu and retalking to them, which if it was any proof in the origional Fable or The Lost Chapters, they usually decided to talk your ears off before you could talk to them agian, leaving you to simply wave till they shut up.The animations are daited and it shows. Sure, The mouths move more naturally but holy ♥♥♥♥ you have one of those demon children stare at you or one of those really stiff guards talk to you its almost like your in a world filled with robots.Buggy Combat, I found this out fighting wisper and the wasp queen. I would hit wisper several times then suddenly she decided she didn't want to be hurt anymore, actually blocking some strong attacks till I eased up on her and decided to put away then requip my sword, giving her a free hit on me in the process. The wasp queen was a diffrent story, after hitting her several times with my Crossbow, suddenly she was invinceible to it and I couldn't use it anymore, even after unequipping and requpping the crossbow, thank god they start you out with lighting as a spell, though I nearly died to her cause of this. Agian, may be fixed, but I never once got hit in the origional fable unless I made the mistake of trying to block a power shot, or my mana shield went down. Not. Happy.Now I understand that's four pros and Three cons, but keep in mind that two of those Pros are personal and those cons are pretty damn big. Let me put it how I explained to my friends about the Fable franchise.Fable, the origional fable, was a nice girl, and when she told me about The Lost Chapters, she was very ""adult"" when she talked about it, we still call eachother sometimes, but we've moved on.Fable two was the kind of party girl, the perfect girlfriend who had everything almost completely perfect, even with how she ended. we still hang out on weekends and she still knows I LOVE the blunderbuss/Greataxe combo and her jokes never fall flat for me.Fable three is the girl that forced me to play by her rules with her guns and weapons, a cruel woman who would usually tell me I have to be evil to get the most out of my weapons. I told her no, we don't talk anymore.I have never met Fable Journey, so I will not say anything about her till I have.Fable Anniversary is a tart that trys to act like Fable, saying that she's better looking. Sure, she's better looking, but she acts way too much like Fable that, honestly, it makes me sad that I decided to actually buy her things thinking that she would also act better when its quite clear she doesn't. I'm not planning on talking to Anniversary and I'm going to talk with Fable.TL;DR I am an idiot and I do not like this game, buy the origional fable, fall in love with Fable two, but don't buy three or Anniversary. If you really wanna try it, get it as a gift, you'll feel less like you waisted your money if you do.			"

												I was never much of a fan of the sequals, however the first Fable and its expansion will always be one of my favorite games, one that i'll never get bored of. When I heard that there was a game that was exactly the same but with a graphics/physics update I thought great! Pre-ordered it without a second though. I've been quite disapointed with it though. Considering the graphics are the ONLY update to the game, which is priced at a hefty £26.99 I was expecting amazing graphics, although the graphics are better than its predesessor, they are by no means impressive. Rocky terrain is still completely smooth, and the game for some reason is quite blurry. Not even close to being worth £26.99. The game is also an obvious console port. You have to use the keyboard to navigate the menu's which can be quite frustrating and you are unable to bind the keys to the mouse, for the price tag its unacceptable and just lazy. I've already had an unrecoverable crash.If you are a die hard Fable fan im sure you will buy this anyway. If you havnt played before, I suggest waiting until the game is at a more reasonable price. In conclusion this is a slight graphics update, with a lazy console port feel and leaves the impression that the developers just wanted to make a bit of easy money from a known title.			"

												While Fable is a wondeful game, the PC port falls short in a lot of ways. If you're looking to own the game to play it normally, or just bought it to have in your collection like me, i'd highly recommend it. However with that being said, it's version of ""Modding"" is in fact hardly modding at all. You can supposedly change the art and animation. I say supposedly because the feature to start the game in the editor for me is missing an executable file. The main problems with this game are the counter-intuitive UI and the embelishment that this is going to be modable. Don't get me wrong, wonderful game, fable was my first RPG, and I own this game for multiple consoles. I'm certain the modding community will be able to crack this one wide open, but don't hold your breath for it being any time soon.			"

Fable anniversary fixes none of the problems the original game had and features a jarringly ugly art style. It does the complete opposite any hd remake shuold, it actually makes you wanna go back to the original Fable. The framerate is also garbage, I have a pretty good computer that can run several games on the highest settings but I suppose it wasnt built to run games programmed by mentally challenged grey apes. This game is not worth anyone's time, not fans of fable and not newcomers; stay the hell away from this unholy abomination.			"

												I played and beat the original and then TLC's when they came out so I wasn't really planning on getting this itteration of it until I saw the addition of heroic difficulty. What a bad choice it turned out to be. The first half of the game I found myself questioning if I had really picked ""heroic"" in the beginning. The only way I knew for sure before I beat it, was the enemies did infact have obsidian & master weapons. That was it, just a visual indication. It's been a long time since I had last played TLC's but I didnt notice a lack of potions, experience, money or even an increase in enemy damage like they said.

Im going to have to say I wouldnt recommend this game till modding support comes out and the community fixes these problems. Like I played Fable a couple months ago and for a console port that game was good. but the Fable anniversary the port is so bad controls are so buggy. to use the menu you need to use A and B key on your keyboard you cant even use your mouse. Trying to change your armour is a pay in the♥♥♥♥♥you have to use HOME and END keys. when really you could of just clicked on the stuff you wanted to use. I also read on the forums they chose not to add mouse  support because they had to choose between modding and mouse support. Im no game expert but seriously??? come on this game is ment to work on pc and the whole thing about pc is to use a MOUSE!So really I would say buy the game when there are mods and the community has fixed the game.

												Fable Anniversary offer no noticable improvements over the flawed but charming original. Furthermore, wonky camera, unless alternate views (first person bow mode, WTF where they thinking!?) and totally disfunctional Z-lock style target make arcade style combat, formally Fable's greatest asset into a frustrating mess. The ""HD Graphics"" offer little noticible improvement over the original, and absolutely no improve over the sequals. And through all of this, the pointless utterly superficial ""morality"" system remains pointless and utterly superficial. And the barely there story line remains barely there. Countless titles have been released since Fable which actually suceed in doing what Fable tried and failed to do upon release. This remake was the perfact oppurtunity but completely missed oppurtunity to step it up. Instead, what we got was a too little, too late re-release of a 10 year old broken game.			"

I've only been able to play for a short while but the bugs and lack of options are ridiculous for this kind of title.  No mouse support in menus blurry graphics and dark muddy textures.  Audio and graphical glitches popping up everywhere.  This could be a lot of fun but it needs a seriously good patch.			"

												Don't ignore the other reviews as I did. Anniversary edition is NOT worth it, in MY opinion. The graphics, are not even better. I am looking at this game and wondering if they even spent more than a days worth of work, tons of stuff still looks like it was made in 2004. I do not recommend this, because it is exactly the same as The Lost chapters, which was an incredible game, one that i played several times now. This just felt like  a way to get us all to buy the same exact game again, ""instead its HD"" in my opinion, the game does not even look much better. I personally prefer the games graphics from 2004, it had more of a Fable feel to me. I'm disappointed that i purchased this, I am happy to support Lionhead, but they could at the very least put some effort it. This game runs the same, it is true, it feels the same, which is true, Is there a point in buying it when it practically looks the same? I didn't expect graphics that are of todays ""AAA"" standard, but i expected more than what we got with this game. Lionhead makes a good game, but not a game you should buy twice. Don't waste your money, stick with the original, its alot better.			"

												I can honestly say that I have never been this dissapointed in a game EVER before. Fable anniversary fixes none of the problems the original game had and features a jarringly ugly art style. It does the complete opposite any hd remake shuold, it actually makes you wanna go back to the original Fable. The framerate is also garbage, I have a pretty good computer that can run several games on the highest settings but I suppose it wasnt built to run games programmed by mentally challenged grey apes. This game is not worth anyone's time, not fans of fable and not newcomers; stay the hell away from this unholy abomination.			"

												I'm a huge Fable fan, it was the game that really got me into RPGs and made me fall in love with the genre. I was so excited for the reboot after playing all the different versions dozens of times. The game looks okay...but the characters faces all look very waxy. The menu system doesn't support a mouse. Instead you navagate the menus with the A and B key which is odd on it's own. Then you get into the complicated menu system where you must use Ins, Delete, Home and End to navagate through the different categories of items.I got the game for 44% off and the pre-order DLC so I'm not to upset with my purchase, I'm hoping they'll fix it as time goes on. To anyone curious about this game, if you haven't played Fable: The Lost Chapters I highly reccomend that more, but you're a long time Fable fan like myself I would suggest this game during a sale event.TL:DR - Game looks good, better in my opinion (Other then weird character faces), but the menu system will drive you crazy.

												I played and beat the original and then TLC's when they came out so I wasn't really planning on getting this itteration of it until I saw the addition of heroic difficulty. What a bad choice it turned out to be. The first half of the game I found myself questioning if I had really picked ""heroic"" in the beginning. The only way I knew for sure before I beat it, was the enemies did infact have obsidian & master weapons. That was it, just a visual indication. It's been a long time since I had last played TLC's but I didnt notice a lack of potions, experience, money or even an increase in enemy damage like they said.

												I was never much of a fan of the sequals, however the first Fable and its expansion will always be one of my favorite games, one that i'll never get bored of. When I heard that there was a game that was exactly the same but with a graphics/physics update I thought great! Pre-ordered it without a second though. I've been quite disapointed with it though. Considering the graphics are the ONLY update to the game, which is priced at a hefty £26.99 I was expecting amazing graphics, although the graphics are better than its predesessor, they are by no means impressive. Rocky terrain is still completely smooth, and the game for some reason is quite blurry. Not even close to being worth £26.99. The game is also an obvious console port. You have to use the keyboard to navigate the menu's which can be quite frustrating and you are unable to bind the keys to the mouse, for the price tag its unacceptable and just lazy. I've already had an unrecoverable crash.If you are a die hard Fable fan im sure you will buy this anyway. If you havnt played before, I suggest waiting until the game is at a more reasonable price. In conclusion this is a slight graphics update, with a lazy console port feel and leaves the impression that the developers just wanted to make a bit of easy money from a known title.			"

												Even though I give it a 9/10, honestly speaking, I cannot recommend it.Better buy the lost chapters, even dated the graphics appear more beautyfull.Water animation was gone compeletely, and everything darkened downit is not that game that did not wanted itself to be taken seriously, this onebeing that game removed the fairytale out of fable, and became quite generic.Most of the makeovered characters are a bad addition, the guildmaster being the first most noticeable of them. to be honest though it is also a bad portas the mouse cannot be used to navigate the menus, but it is very easy to understandhow to do it as the pointers show the specific buttons.Overally it was not a great addition, just an exact remake, but the better graphics removedthe atmosphere from the game that it had in the past, the battle system a little bit betterbut not much to justify that loss.

												Fable Aniversary is very nicely visually freshened. If you liked the original, this update is a no-brainer. Still highly entertaining and addictive as ever.  The controls are a little quirky, but should not be a problem for novice or veteran gamers.  There was an update to the controls in the middle of my second playthrough, but the originals still worked so I didn't change. If what you want is a good time, with some campy style and an unusual sense of humor, Fable Annivrsery is for you.			"

												If you love the original Fable/TLC then this brings back all the nostalgia you are looking for with all new graphics. Most will tell you to not pick this game up and just buy the $10 TLC version due to the ""obsurd"" price of this game, I agree completely. If you just want to play Fable only for the nostalgia factor than get the $10 version, but if you want hyped up graphics and nostalgia then grab this or wait for it to go on sale. I only see this game getting better with the implementing of modded versions of this game.			"

												Due to being a Fable fan, I decided to pick up this game once more. I played the original and fell in love with it. Fable is a game that I can never get tired of even after 10 years. It is a mixture of both badass and funny. I believe that the story to this game is very well developed and each character is kept interesting. One thing I do have to say about Fable Anniversary is that the quality looks a bit odd and I still prefer the original one, but that's just probably because I grew up playing the Lost Chapters. Either way, I really do reccomend this game to those who like RPG's because the story is great and easy to follow along. CHICKEN CHASER!!!!			"

												This game fails on so many levels and I could not honestly recommend that any serious PC gamers buy this game until it has some serious patches and enhancements made to it.Firstly, IT IS THE MOST BLATANTLY OBVIOUS CONSOLE PORT I'VE EVER SEEN.> The Main Menu does not have mouse support.> Key rebindings can only be accessed in-game, and not through the main menu.> Key rebindings are extremely limited, with hard-locked keys for certain things, and dual functionality keys.> The key rebindings were far more extensive, customisable and USEFUL in Fable: The Lost Chapters.> The in-game Inventory/Quest/etc. menu also lacks mouse support, and is terribly designed for a PC game - with poor use of real-estate, bad structure, etc.Secondly, THIS BARELY EVEN QUALIFIES AS A REMAKE.> It is a HD remaster at best.> Some graphics options that were available in Fable: The Lost Chapters are mysteriously missing in Fable Anniversary, namely Anti-aliasing (I believe Fable Anniversary is hard-locked to some sort of FXAA  - which results in the game looking like a blurry, murky mess).> The only real improvements that I can make out are texture improvements, some mesh improvements (though I was expecting a little better, especially for characters faces), and some nice shadows/post-processing effects.> Due to the lack of a decent and accessible anti-aliasing, I actually find Fable: The Lost Chapters more aesthetically pleasing, because the image is sharper and not as murky or blurred.> On my 16:10 (Native Resolution 1440x900) monitor regular gameplay (not just cutscenes) also has thick black lines at the top and bottom of the screen. I am uncertain as to whether or not this is intentional, and whether or not 16:9 monitors get this as well.All in all, this is a terrible PC port. It needs a decent bit of work before I could honestly recommend it.Totalbiscuit (the YouTube Channel host) also did a good video outlining some flaws of the game and comparing it to Fable: The Lost Chapters.P.S: If you are an Australian citizen like I am, and you are unhappy with this purchase, I believe you can ask for a refund if you have played less than 14 hours of the game. Under Australian law the vendor is REQUIRED to provide you with as refund if the product is not deemed 'Fit for Purpose', which I would argue it is not, as it does not fulfil it's purpose of being a fully functional PC game.

												I've been a fan of the Fable series ever since I first played the original, but I can honestly say I'd much rather be playing the Lost Chapters over this ""Anniversary"" edition. While the overhauled graphics are nice, that's really all it has going for it and personally I think it killed a lot of the charm that the original had. What other improvements the game claims to have like the UI looks pretty good but feels very clunky and unoptimized. The save system is a complete mess and if you're not using a controller it just feels like you're playing a lousy port.Overall, I'd say it's definitely not worth the price difference compared to Lost Chapters but the game itself is still a classic and I highly recommend it. If you really have to have the Anniversary edition I suggest holding off til it's got a good sale going.			"

I've only been able to play for a short while but the bugs and lack of options are ridiculous for this kind of title.  No mouse support in menus blurry graphics and dark muddy textures.  Audio and graphical glitches popping up everywhere.  This could be a lot of fun but it needs a seriously good patch.			"

												This game is great! At the current price, yes, it is pretty expensive. I bought it at a discount for preorder, and I am not disappointed in my purchase. There are caveats to complete enjoyment like I have encountered.1, I play this game with a controller (mouse is not supported in the menu)2. I downscale the game for better visuals (the game is slightly blurry due to DoF)3. I anticipate modding making the game even better. (this is the real game changer)4. I try to get my combat multiplier even higher!!!

												This is exactly what i have been waiting for, I loved the first fable and the original gameplay but each sequel ""dumbed"" the game down more, which was not a bad thing because the control scheme got much more better but you could not control all the aspects of the game because they were trying to make it simpler. But i already played fable once and I felt that buying The lost chapters did not really warrant me buying a new copy of the game. Then Lionhead announced this game, and I was almost going to pass it up, until I looked into it further. Some people don't seem to appreciate the effort lionhead put into this, they COMPLETELY remade the whole game in a new engine. They had to port all the old textures and remake them into higher definitions which is pretty much saying they made new textures just the same style as the original game. It is not as buggy as the old one is on newer systems as well and thats a plus.TL;DR It is a complete overhaul of a remake, they left no stone unturned. If you liked the original game and never bought the lost chapters you should buy this. If you have the lost chapters, consider if all the bells and whistles are worth the money first.P.S. I also suggest you get a xbox controller to play this game with. It really makes this game shine and works flawlessly.			"

												Lionhead could've done way better remaking this classic compared to the guys that did such a poor job on this awesome game.The model for the hero just looks awful, the colors of everything just seem to be washed out & dull compared to the original.The original game animations just look awful with the new models.It has a awesome HD graphics engine I'll give it that.I actually regret spending $10 on this game & I can't even imagine how other people probably feel that spent $60 on this game before it eve came out.Do yourself a favor & buy Fable The Last Chapters it'll be worth your money.

												I'm actually pretty disappointed with this game. If you really wanted to play Fable, buy Fable Lost Chapters for 10$. Yes they did a touch up of each character but the controls can be slightly faulty (or atleast from my experience). I feel like for the HD remake they could've done a better job. Or for the job they could've lowered the price.  But benefits are the Achievements, Steam Trading cards and the capablity of modding.			"

												This had so much potential to be gussied up and remade to play and look better. It barely counts as an HD remake. All the character models and animations are still archaic. Some quests are still buggy and broken. The game is fine for a nostalgia trip but ultimately lacking as a worthwhile investment. Pass if you've played Fable...*any* Fable game before. This just feels like a cheap cash-in.			"

												You better hope you have one powerhouse of a computer to run this game, because there's no way to reduce lag in this game that feels more like a slideshow than an updated version of an amazing RPG.  My computer can run Skyrim, Fallout, and Neverwinter on medium settings perfectly fine, but this game is entirely unplayable from lag.			"

												You know, I'm not usually one for reviews, but I felt I really needed to say this. Did you like Fable?Like me, did you miss the fantastical land of Albion, the first adventures of our hero, balrog hunting, lightning throwing, and Whisper♥♥♥♥♥kicking? Did you miss being called Chicken Chaser?Well if you did, then you would think to buy this game, yes? Ho ho hold your horses, friend.First off, I am shocked that after.. Lord, how many years to get this right, they still ♥♥♥♥ed it up? So, the graphics are so god-awful they make the first game look fantastic by comparsion. All the people look like their skin is melting right off their faces and look like cosmic horrors when they speak, like everyone is covered in melted plastic and♥♥♥♥♥♥ The land looks more lazilly put together too. Again, looks worse then the decade old original.As for mechnaics? Remember all those bugs that tucked you to bed each night? Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are still around after 10 years! Fighting? Still as clunky as you remmeber. Magic? As unbearable to control. And you know how in Fable three they made it where when you upgrade you Str as a woman, you didn't become Shiela, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Nordic Mountain?! Well, I guess they felt that was too big a change fromt he original. Hope you like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looks! No new voice acting, same annoying lines, everything you hated about the original, minus the creativity, spark of life, and amazing wonderment that made this title stuck out.All in all, looking for a nostaligic tromp though Albion? Go buy the original. It looks better and at least has a modding community.			"

												So basically its just a port from the console version, and not a good one at that. The interface is just plain horrible. Using insert, delete home and end to change between sections of the menu? The feeling of TLC is there, but not enough. Could've at least try a bit harder on the port. I rather play TLC with mods again if there aren't any changes to the interface. Why would you remove mouse from a menu on a bloody PC game. It makes no sense, unless its just a lazy port just to milk money from a series that a lot of people love. Way to disappoint us again Lionhead. With a certain someone no longer part of the studio, I expected much more. I guess a good port to PC is too much to ask.			"

												Im seeing a lot of negative reviews for this game, however i certainly enjoyed the play through. I've played this game 3 or 4 times when i came out and i was not dis-satisfied in anyway with this purchase. True there was one bug that caused me to have to load to a previous save, but in the 20 hours or so it took me to beat the game i found it to be pretty minor. Dont buy this game if you are expecting drastic changes from the original, i was glad that they kept the core game the same as the original because it was enjoybale on all levels. If you want this game to be a little more challenging then i would play without the revive vials but i just played it for the enjoyment and died maybe once when i was stoned a ♥♥♥♥. Anyways i would reccomend this game especially if you have yet to play any of the fable games, this is by far the best out of the series.			"

												Amazing remake of the first fable game, Fable The Lost Chapters. Love the graphics, the story of this fable game is just the best! And they have also added a few extra cool weapons, along with all the other ones. There's also a Heroic mode, a harder gameplay for those who are looking for a challenge, it gets harder but it's so much fun. And a huge plus; there's achievements in this game. So there's lots of fun to do.Reccomend this for anyone regardless if you have already played Fable or not. This is a game that everyone must play. :)			"

												I bought this game as a fan. I have already played it a million times. So, I know I really like it.  I like how my character looks amazing as he progresses.  I also like that this game is about choices and how the world reacts to those choices.  That's what made this game so innovative in it's day.  I really loved this game in it's day. I played it so much I killed my first xbox.  But, as amazing as this game is, I still had my issues with it.  For a game about choices and change. The first one did not give me a choice to be a female. Here I am in playing this amazing game, in this amazing world, kicking butt as the male I have always dreamed to be. Uh no! lol. Sorry, but I want to kick butt as a female thank you.  I wanted to look good in that shiny armor as female. Then the 2nd one came out. I have the choice to be a female.  But, now the armor sucks cause the the story goes into the future a bit! Still I played because I enjoyed kicking butt and I really enjoyed the rest of the game.  I did like the steam punk twist to things. I really enjoy that. I still would recommend this game. Because for gaming sake, it is still a fun game to play.			"

												Absolutely terrible.  Not only were the graphics nearly identical in all the environments I have so far experienced, but the small changes they made to important characters were awful.  Maze's hair/tattoos/face is broken, and all spell graphics are either the same or for some reason downgraded in quality.  My hero is uglier than sin, regardless of what type of tattoos, facial hair, or scars I try to apply to him.The audio is, as far as I can tell, the same.  I have noticed that the natural pauses in conversation that I remember being present in the first game were either shortened or deleted in this game.  The worst part is probably the menu and lack of hero save.  The menu is terrible, clearly ported directly from console, as it does not support the mouse and you must use the 'insert, home, delete, and end' buttons to navigate.  In addition, you cannot re-bind any skills on your mouse  (since as far as the menu is concerned, it does not exist.  Last but not least, there is no hero save.  That means if you're like me and work hard to get very powerful early in the storyline, you'll be age 65 when you meet your *maybe 20's* older sister.  And you'll be old enough to be your own grandfather when you meet your mother.  Awful. 1/10, would not waste time with.			"

Posted: September 18, 2014
FABLE ANNIVERSARY: DO YOU WANT IT!?Have you been looking at the new Fable Anniversary relaease, wondering if you should pull the trigger and add that pup to your library? I asked myself the same question almost two months ago when I decided to shoot for the stars with Fable Anniversary. Here I have for you a few words of caution and/or encouragement. My first exposure to the Fable franchise was a few months after the release of the original on the XBOX, I was blown away and drawn back, simultaneously, to the alluring pull of this new, ambitious and anglo-centric adventure. This was like re-living the debut of Ocarina of Time! Fable, however, was of an entirely different realm. Putting much of the focus into the adverse gameplay style and the design of this beautiful reimagining of the British Isles, Fable left a little to be desired of the story. This was remedied with the addition of The Lost Chapters which made the game almost perfect, aside from a few problems that still exist in the new Anniversary version. Foremost, the game is supposed to be about making choices and becoming your own hero; the game is constantly trying to force you into being the well rounded and skilled player that the game needs you to be which makes certain boss fights or other missions difficult or undoable if your hero build isn't right. For example: Fighting Jack of Blades the first time the game wants you to use a bow. I dont want to use bows with my spellwarrior. I WANNA USE MY MELEE AND SPELLS!!! (fighting the Kracken will also take two hours if you try and use a sword and a lightning spell). This is a major problem with the Anniversary version because it still exists in every facet of playing this game making all of your decisions practically pointless and almost all the time reversable (i.e. you can go from good to evil with relative ease). It was ignorable the first time because all of this was so fresh and never really done like this before. After a decade of making games based on free will and adventure, you should be able to recognise the little problems that make your whole morality matrix and character role development feel a little redundant and pre determined. (i.e in Fable you always end up with A or B, never is a C or D involved) Fable was and is a game which does not require much time to complete the core of it but potentially doubles it's playability when you add in the side missions and all the other quirks of Albion. This was done extremely well especially with the addition of The Lost Chapters. I hoped and expected that with the new release we might get another 9 hours out of this game, but here we find much more to be desired. Moving on to the NEW issues with Fable Anniversarry, we take a look at what Anniversary does to leave the gamer longing for more, which isn't always a good thing in necessity. No new missions. If you remembered how to play the last game through, you know this one. Some might see this as a good thing, I figure my expectations were too high. But when I learned not even a single new side mission or interactable character was added to the Anniversary version, I was quite dissappointed. So what did they do? Is anything in this new-old game different or improved? Not really, its still the same semi-goofy adventure. Its the same. The game is the same. It is the same. IT'S THE SAME!!! However you do get a new and slightly longer Heroic mode: There are no ressurection phials and some healing abilities are somewhat gimped. Slightly prolonged eh? HOW IS POSSIBRU IF NO CONTENTS R NU!?!? Well if you never died before whilst playing Fable (this is not uncommon) you probably will die and if you haven't played a Fable game in a couple years like me and decide to jump right in, you may die a lot. All of this dying and reloading is what gives you those extra hours, especially if you're trying to be a good guy (the hardest kinda guy to be). The game is not necessarily more difficult, it just takes longer and sort of forces you to try and gain more experience to level up as you bump along those good ol' core quests. The difficulty in the boss fights comes from getting too bored to actually follow the attack sequences in order to hit the boss amid the 15 minutes of minion fighting/dodging before the 5 seconds you actually get to hit the boss with (assuming you have the right spell, weapon, blood type, zodiac sign, character alignment, age etc.) Here is the attack sequence for every major boss in the game *SPOILER ALERT*: DODGE, KILL MINIONS, DODGE, KILL MINIONS, DODGE, HIT THE BOSS (with the one and only attack), FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, RELOAD, DODGE, FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, FIGHT MINIONS, RELOAD, BEGIN ARHYTHMICALLY POUNDING KEYS/BUTTONS *with specifically designated spells/weapons for that boss* PROFIT!? It isn't even subtle the way the game trys to force you into being what it needs you to be rather than what you want to play with. If you have the same sense of conquest and need of self reassurance that I had when I started off, I would reccomend doing the heroic mode first to get it out of the way in order to enjoy the far and few between favorable little pieces that have been reworked in Anniversary. The controls cannot be criticized too heavily as Lionhead was sort of venturing into new territory with operating systems being different these days on the PC, as well as two different controller formats, a total of three control types to be programmed and supported. I'm no expert but that probably sounds easier in type than it is in reality. I use a 360 controller, which can be tricky but you will get used to it and once you do it's almost like the good old days. So, have I gotten older, more mature or more jaded in the decade between the original and the anniversary. Yes I'd guess so. SO TO ANYONE NEW TO THE FABLE FRANCHISE, MEANING YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED FABLE BEFORE; THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! BUY IT TO SUPPORT LIONHEAD AND FUTURE VENTURES![/b] Words of warning; if you're a fan like me, you will most likely find more to complain about. But I'm no Negative Nancy. The second you step into Albion it is beautiful. The updated graphics are what I wanted, not too pristine but volumes more detail than the original. The integrity of the art is indeed intact. The new outfits, weapons and armor are also a great leg up in the game because you finally get more sets that can be more specific, even more condusive to building the kind of character you want to play...Assuming it still fits the Lionhead template. There is no damage done to the story, interactions with characters or any of the little running jokes and insider quirks we all adore hidden about the game. Would I have been willing to relenquish some of the humor or parts of the story in order to make way for new grounds in exploration of the map or exploration of different characters and I dunno, maybe a new mission or two? Definitely. Perhaps the most important and beneficial aspect that Lionhead added to the release of Anniversary was the ability for the community to create their own mods to the Fable program. I am very excited to see what the more skilled enthusiasts will creeate. Keep in mind this is all being written around/about the game that I wanted. Something slightly newer, something a little more in depth, something with a twist and above all something with a little more to explore. Some might say that what I wanted was a new game. In some ways, some people are right. But if you want something a little redundant, a little repetative, a little fickle, a little quirky and/or a little nostalgic, maybe even a little new; Look no further than Fable Anniversary...or this review Remember friends, keep your expectations and your promises low, but over-deliver with every opportunity.

												This remaster is very well done and while it does have some issues, is still very enjoyable. Fable: TLC is my favorite game of all time and this version is a welcome addition to my collection and one that I will be spending a lot of time with. I have had no problems running this game, no crashes, no stutters, no blur problems that others have had and I don't really have the best setup.Now there are two issues that I have with this game, but they do not make the game unplayable. The first issue is that there is only partial Mouse Support. You cannot use the mouse at all in the menus and the developers chose some convoluted keys to navigate the menus that are difficult to use, especially on a laptop. The keys that you use to navigate are ""A"", ""B"", ""INSERT"", ""DELETE"", ""HOME"", and ""END"". I have to press and hold the ""FN"" key just to use three of them. There is also no way to rebind these keys. Hopefully there will be a patch or a mod in the future to add mouse support to the menu.The second issue is the targeting or locking on system. It doesn't always work and sometimes the system chooses the furthest enemy or, even worse, a friendly target. Again, this does not make the game unplayable, but it is annoying.8/10 overall a great gameOS: Windows 8.1, 64 bitCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3610QM CPU @ 2.30GHz GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M LE "

												First couple of hours---------------------Nice, generic, light hearted and simple RPG. Maybe too simple.The whole style seems a little bit childish to me as if it's aimed at young teenagers or even younger, yet there's murder.The UI and Keyboard setup is non standard and awkward.As of now I can't recommend this at £27.It reminds me of Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, but not nearly as good.I'm fully expecting to have better impressions a few hours from now as it generally has good reviews.After 9 hours------------------------I'm getting slightly used to the UI and Controls but they are still very clunky. It's obvious that the UI is a port from consoles and a very bad one at that.Getting frustrated with the way some quests are laid outShop NPCs frequently seem to disappear at random times to nowhere when it's daylight.Not enough portals in map locationsAfter 15 hours---------------------A lot of the game is just fillers, like the boxing ring thing and the bardEnvironments seem very small and almost fake.. no compelling reason to exploreI'm quite bored now and want the game to just endAfter 20 hours--------------------Finished the main questline and I'm very bored. Skipping past all dialogs and just wanting the game to end.Conclusion----------------Game is far too short, too childish, gets boring quickly and didn't live up to the hype or anywhere near it.Only worth £10 not £27 so can't recommend at that price (I got it in a sale)			"

												It's a solid remaster of Fable: The Lost Chapters. If you already own TLC then this may not be worth the money, but if you don't then this version is worth the increased price. There are a few things to be aware of though:CONTROLLER RECOMMENDED - The keyboard/mouse controls are pretty broken, mostly concerning menus.The graphical improvements, while significant, are not on par with a new release game.As of release there are some bugs - I've only experienced minor graphical bugs but there have been reports of serious issues.If those things don't bother you then this game is excellent!

												Yikes! This game is unfinished and nearly unplayable. Apart from the poor menu system, and the general difficulty is reassigning keys, the framerate is poor, doesn't look HD, and the camera jerks all over the place if using a mouse. Anyone who has motion sickness, you may actually vomit. It is obviously made for using an Xbox controller, but this is a PC game. Why a controller? Why not have mouse function in menus for an RPG game that's all about customisation? I hope a quality patch fixes these issues, the game seems like a rushed port and many will be feeling the burn from forking out good money for a barely functioning game. In the end, I'm sure if Lionhead came out and said 'we need on more month to make it perfect' I'm sure everyone would understand. To release it as it currently is, well that's just unprofessional and a stab in the heart of the diehard fans who were hanging out for this game. WIll cross my fingers for a patch, as I know there's no chance of a refund. What a shame...			"

												Fable: The Lost Chapters was my first Fable game and the only one that really sticks out of all the others, but this Anniversary is a joke. Lionhead Studios/Microsoft didn't bother to add new voiceovers or overall sounds. The gameplay is just the same clunky like in Fable:TLC, nothing has been touched there, except for the controller option. And probably the worst, NO NEW QUEST? NOTHING AT ALL?! I was hoping for a sandbox mode with new quest and maybe activities once I completed the game. but there's nothing!  Just your daily Fable life with your imaginary wife and sometimes helping out a wandering trader. The guildmaster also became silent and no one has something to say that I saved their life from Dragon Jack.Improved graphics doesn't make an Anniversary game Lionhead Studios/Microsoft, especially if they aren't that good. And how can it even be that an Anniversary release has less options than the 10 year older original game?This said, I had my share fun with the game. The nostalgia was big walking through Albion. I still don't suggest anyone to buy this version of the game. Go get yourself Fable: TLC which is just the same and cheaper! Atleast I bought this game via a thirdpartysite.			"

												i have played fable anniversary when it first arrived to pc, it had a lot of problems as a port so i was kinda giving this one up, after all those updates it got much much MUCH better, the ui works like it should, the graphics are improved from the color problem the game had, it runs better than it did before and much more.i know most people wanted a full remake with new animations, better voicing but it's a anniversary, it's supposed to be like the original but in HD so if you ask me, this have a lot of improvements like real facial animations and how the game looks is just awsome.there is bugs there and there but nothing game breaking, is the game i rememberd i played on my original xbox when it first came out and fable the lost chapters i brought for pc (still have the original disc)i say when the game is atleast on 20€ or lower, buy it or if you are a huge fan for fable tlc also buy this when you can, it's a good remasterd game.just don't buy the DLC's unless you really can spend money and want to look like other characters in the game. the only thing i like about it is jack of blades armor but even then, it's not worth 15€ for only 1 armor so don't buy unless you  really want and can spend money.PS: if you say this is not fan service, :jackofblades: will get you.

												First couple of hours---------------------Nice, generic, light hearted and simple RPG. Maybe too simple.The whole style seems a little bit childish to me as if it's aimed at young teenagers or even younger, yet there's murder.The UI and Keyboard setup is non standard and awkward.As of now I can't recommend this at £27.It reminds me of Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, but not nearly as good.I'm fully expecting to have better impressions a few hours from now as it generally has good reviews.After 9 hours------------------------I'm getting slightly used to the UI and Controls but they are still very clunky. It's obvious that the UI is a port from consoles and a very bad one at that.Getting frustrated with the way some quests are laid outShop NPCs frequently seem to disappear at random times to nowhere when it's daylight.Not enough portals in map locationsAfter 15 hours---------------------A lot of the game is just fillers, like the boxing ring thing and the bardEnvironments seem very small and almost fake.. no compelling reason to exploreI'm quite bored now and want the game to just endAfter 20 hours--------------------Finished the main questline and I'm very bored. Skipping past all dialogs and just wanting the game to end.Conclusion----------------Game is far too short, too childish, gets boring quickly and didn't live up to the hype or anywhere near it.Only worth £10 not £27 so can't recommend at that price (I got it in a sale)			"

												Fable was one of the original games that allowed you to decide who you wanted to be. It was a very popular game for that reason. Fable 1, TLC and Anniversary will always be better than Fable 2 and Fable 3. Not that I didn't enjoy those games either. It's nearly impossible to see sequels or anything further, best the first and original game. With a large community that has loved and cherished this game through the years; there can be a LOT of mods and new content on the approach. Not sure what happened with the Custom Tattoo feature that was previously in The Lost Chapters.I'm sure that most of you, if not all, have beaten the story line at least once. The story line was superb and I will pretty much leave it at that. You must see the story for yourself, since there are multiple ways of gameplay.The new updated graphics are very appealing. Runs a lot smoother than TLC and deifnitely the original. They had fixed some glitches from the previous versions and they have also developed new ones that are currently being addressed. I've been enjoying this game like I have when I first got it. It has a lot of replay value. If you are new to RPGS, I would definitely recommend this game to you for a starter.5/5			"

												Ok if your a big fable fan then go for it. I've had no issues with this myself, I wasn't expecting anything more than a flashy Fable and that's what I got. All the negative feedback seems to be because you all wanted lots of extras in the game. I don't remember reading anywhere that it was going to be old game with all new adventures or anything. It play's well and is far better than trying to play the old blocky version. If you missed out on the first fable then buy this version and not the original, controller support on its own makes this worth buying over the original release. If you enjoyed it but it didn't capture you then probably worth giving it a miss as theres nothing different. All in all it's what I expected.			"

												This game is truely promising after its remake. It promises the old school nostalgia that i was hoping to get and many other features that it was implemented. With its move to the Unreal 3 engine, it has done a very good job with its graphics and gameplay that has lived up to my standards. Even with some of its minor bugs ( Only 3 that i have noticed ) It is still a worthy game to buy and gives alot of hours that can be played. For an old game, this will definetly be one of the best RPG games that really stepped up in its era and has had a huge reputation for a truely amazing game. This game is and will always be one game i will always love and will always play over and over. My rating is 9.5/10 simply just because of its minor bugs, and i realy do mean MINOR bugs.			"

												updates 3-4:while they finally enabled the mouse for all menu's the menu system is still jacked up big time.they fixed some of the graphic issues with clothing and clipping with skin/underwear or whatever the base textures are.- still need to work on combining all menu's so that keyboard and mouse changes can be made from main menu, instead of being forced to do it while playing the game.- still need to upgrade skeletons for male characters, specially PC; which currently looks like a walking toothpick, and mesh morphing.- still need to work on invisible items that are still somehow selectable... (at least one glitch like this with the haircut shop in bowerstone).- still need to work on updating intro videos or get rid of them, both logo and intro to main menu are still pixelated bigtime, still no excuse for this lack of work, its just pathetic.- still need to work on invisible walls that dont match the terrain.- need to work on how stat/equpiment/etc. menu's are laid out and work.- still need to work on GUI sizes, should all be included with the hotbar 'options' which really isnt a option right now.- still need to fix blue plastic look for player character.- still need to fix animations (would be less of an issue if skeleton on PC was made more masculine instead of stickman).- still need to fix quest text, given quest text is non-informative... unless you remember exactly what you were doing when you start the game and load/continue a save, the quest text is so vague as to be completely useless... it needs to be fixed or removed entirely.- random item pickup respawns for house objects that are actually searchable, also you would think that you would be able to use those objects (shelves and cubaords/etc.) in your own house, to store stuff or to search for what might have been there previously.- better modding support for textures/animations/skeletons/etc. so people dont have (forced?) to use texmod to play/use mods at all.- some textures and item placements need to be updated (delivery boxes, garden walls, 'retaining' walls).still major work needs to be done on this game before it is worth spending ANY money on for PC... the original port is still 100 times better than anniversary.the modding DLC that is 'free' still has nothing in it to download... even if we wanted to mod the game we currently cannot because there are no tools available via the free DLC download, there isnt even a place setup to add override or mods for the game to use (plus no options in-game yet to load override or mods for the game at all)MS/LionHead have a TON and a half issues to fix still, specially for those of us who where hoping to mod the game.final thought:even with the (3rd?) update, it is not yet worth actually buying still.

I've completed it a zillion times over and it was only logical to buy Anniversary so I could get acheivements and trading cards and stuff for a game I've loved for over a decade.But do I love Fable Anniversary? Nope. Do I love Fable? Yep. Will anybody new to Fable love this game? Probably not. Which is why I really would struggle to recommend it to anybody who doesn't already like fable.

												I loved Fable on XBOX and each of the sequels - that's what it's incredibly upsetting that Fable Anniversary is so choppy that it's nearly unplayable. I'm playing on an HP Pavillion Laptop with an AMD A10 2.10 GHz processor and 8 GB of RAM - which should be able to handle the game. Instead I'm spending my first few hours playing around with settings to try to get my character to not pause for a frame between every step he takes. The cut scenes look terrible too - the sun rising took a quick break halfway up due to this choppiness - and the character interactions look worse than on the original XBOX version. I'm going to keep looking online for ways to improve the performance but 1 hour into the game it's pretty clear that Lionhead didn't put much effort into this. Thanks for the huge dissapointment :(Update - I ended up playing through the main story and mostly ingnoring the bugginess. The choppiness gets better after the Hero Guild Graduation - but not completely. I used the Slow Time spell to make the lagginess seem less out of place, and tended to skip all the cutscenes. I did put in a lot of hours, and did enjoy myself, but if I had a choice to go back and buy this again I wouldn't. I'd take a train out to my mother's house in the subburbs and plug in my old XBOX and play the original instead.			"

												I shouldn't have bought this game out of nostalgia. I'm not a fan of the new textures, they remind me too much of fable 2. It should have been like Halo Combat Evolved remake where you could switch between new or old textures.They patched some things with the combat, making it harder to keep knocking people down into the ground. Plus, there are other things that seemed to have been patched. The achievements just seem annoying, especially when it updates you on how many more silver keys you need to get the achievement. I just feel like I had a better time playing this on the original xbox than on pc, but that's just my opinion.			"

												You have to ask yourself how important Achievements, Cards and native controller support are to you versus the original expereince. The old bugs and exploits are gone, but this is not to imply the game is bug free. There are no real ehancements to the gameplay itself or to the graphics. The cinematics are a blockfest. Anything new just isn't worth the extra cost. Only recommended for the diehards looking to round out their collections/experience.			"

I bought this game for $20, and loved the whole thing. That said, this game is not worth $35. Get it on sale and it's well worth the money.			"

												Hey guys,I've been playing this game for a while. In my own opinion, it is one of the great games, as I never got to play the original Fable:TLC as a kid. Objectively, the gameplay is the same as original, as I have watched the TLC's videos on youtube. It doesn't deviate in anyway. Pros:- Same gameplay controls as original (From what I've seen in youtube for TLC)- Their UI is different to the original (In my opinion, that's pleasin' to my eyes compared to the original)- Their graphics differ greatly, as they use Unreal Engine. Anniversary has more colours, shadows and details- It is moddable- It does have ALL TLC's DLCS included in it.- They did add new equipment to this game such as  Snowspire Guard Outfit and the Jackarse- It has the new difficulty that makes this game a bit challengingCon:- For anyone that have played TLC, they won't see any differences in it.- No mouse support in the menu and inventory. TL;DR - Worth getting it if you want to relive nostalgia in a new skin, or you never had a chance to play the original Fable in my opinion. You may not find it any different to original Fable, just loaded with a bit of new equipment, that's all.			"

												I want to like it, I really do...but it keeps crashing every time I try to start it. It's BULLCRAP!!! So I've learned two valuable lessons 1. Pay attention to reviews more, especially if they're mixed and for sure if they're negative! 2. The original is almost always (if not, it is always) better than the remake, and judging by this and the reviews, this isn't. Save your money and frustration and do not buy this game, instead buy Fable TLC, because it does in fact work, and is still a good game (minus the good graphis, but never buy a game for graphics, but instead for gameplay and a good story).

												DO NOT BUY FROM STEAM. BUY ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!!!The Fable series is excellent. Definitely my favourite RPG game of all time. I was introduced to the game in reverse order, this being the last one I've played. All of the games are well worth the money. I was ecstatic to see Fable Anniversary on sale and I jumped on the opportunity to buy it. Waste. Of. Money. I shouldve just bought the CD. Now, on to why YOU SHOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME FROM STEAM.Steam does not offer suport on this game, obviously. There are some game crashing bugs that ruin the entire game, even if you try to work around them. The spells Multistrike and Berserk DO NOT WORK. Instead, they immediately crash the game, losing any progress you had made since the last checkpoint. I have researched bug fixes and have found absolutely none and Steam doesn't seem to care that they're selling a broken game. This has been an issue since 2014 as far as I can tell, YET STEAM DOES NOTHING TO FIX. I have validated my game caches, and messed with every setting under the sun to try to figure out the cause. Nothing works. If you buy, NEVER PURCHASE MULTISTRIKE or BESERK. You cannot avoid them once purchased; they're an easy accidental button press away from losing all your progress. THIS GAME IS WORTH 5 STARS.      FIX IT, STEAM.   IT'S BEEN YEARS SO THERE IS 0 EXCUSE TO STILL BE SELLING A GAME WITH HUGE BUGS LIKE THIS. I'll reccomend this game on steam when it stops crashes for stupid things.			"

												I cannot believe they ported the xbox game, which ALREADY WAS A PORT FROM THE PC.It's still your beloved Fable, but the inventory is completely screwed. What's worse, the game does not have mouse integration. This means you will have to click on buttons to navigate the menu, the inventory, your weapons, stuff, basically everything. This is unacceptable and completely cuts the games flow. Its as if the game is trying to stop you from playing it.As for the graphics and what not, the game looks worse now because the amazing lighting and atmosphere that the first game had is now replaced with darker colours and tons of shadow. This game does not feel like Fable.Stay away from this. It's an insult that they even dare to ask 35 dollars for this.EDIT: Now that some time has passed and key remapping has been implemented with patches, I can recommend the game. The inventory is still hard to navigate, but with mapping options it becomes less of a battle and more of an enjoyable thing. And they have fixed the graphics issues as well, which means the game looks sharper and brighter.			"

												Fable Anniversary is exactly what you should expect from an HD remake: the original game with modern graphics and improvements to the gameplay. The models and textures are updated, gamepad, widescreen, and windowed modes are now supported natively (as opposed to 3rd party workarounds), modding tools have been added (hopefully to be expanded upon at some point in the future), and a new difficulty has been added to the game for an added challenge.Speaking from my personal experience with the game, I never had any issues as far as crashes or drops in framerate. The game ran smoothly from start to finish, and I was able to beat the whole of the game without much trouble. The biggest issue I had was with the in-game menus. Fable Anniversary is a fairly straight forward console port from the Xbox 360 version of the game, just with the resolution and graphics options unlocked. Normally, this isn't an issue, but since the 360 is not controlled with a mouse, you need to navigate menus with buttons. Besides this one annoying quirk, it's the same as playing Fable: TLC.If you already have Fable: TLC for PC or Xbox Original and feel fine with shelling out some extra dosh for HD graphics, then Anniversary is perfect for you (at the time of writing, Anniversary is on sale for $12). But if you're new to the series or this version of the game isn't on sale, I would recommend buying Fable: TLC over this.			"

												I love Fable! My brother got me this game based on what I liked as far as the limited knowledge of games I had and preference as far as taste levels go. (I love me some fantasy!) It was so easy for me to grow accustomed to and learn as a previous gamer getting back into the swing of things. It's quirky and fun, but it also has a heart warming story line. I enjoy the weapon choices, as well as what preferences you have on your magic skills and levels. You can hone your character in to be exactly what you want: evil or good. Maybe even a little chaotic if you can run away without getting caught.			"

												Great game, I have played both Anniversary and TLC.Fable I has a great storyline and is totally worth the money. It has a few bugs tho.TLC is great for the oldschool feels if you have played it before, if you haven't played it ever dont worry graphics and sound are pretty good for the release date.Now what should you pick, TLC or Anniversary?- Anniversary has controller support, mods (not alot) and updated graphics. So if you love your controller and/or have never played TLC and have the money I would recommend you Anniversary - For the oldschool players around: I recommend buying TLC, you are gonne have them oldschool feels... Anniversary has some differences from TLC you might find annoying, like different faces on your favourite characters, mobs spawning in later than usual, etc.  - You can find TLC  here: Anyway, good luck and have fun in Albion			"

												A port of the 360 re-release. Any time you die or lose a mission, the game freezes and crashes. The game mechanics are wonky, and it looks like several kills that should be credited to your character go to other characters (particulary the Killing Hobbes missions). The graphics are pretty, but not as pretty as on the 360 (lookin at you, spell graphics). The throwback to the original Fable 1 controls is nice, but...not enough to make it worthwhile. Just as sluggish as the 360 version, in terms of moving around menus.			"

												Fable Anniversary offers the chance for many to relive one of the First Gen Xbox Cult classics that is Fable and for me personally, a nostalgia trip. For the time Fable looked stunning, played fantastically and was packed with rich lore. FA just makes it's look nice compared to  todays games yet delivers the joy that was Fable. One of the best RPG experiences ever, I only got to play the basic training since buying but I'll be clocking up 100s of hours again, a must have for all RPG fans. RIP OAKVALE.			"

												Updated: After one of the developers contacted me stating the game has indded had many of its bugs fixed I decided to give it another whirl. The game is now fantrastic. I got the same feeling when I played it on the Original ten years ago and a wave of nostalgia opened up. I'm now very happy to own the game, yet still highly angered the fact Lionhead pushed this out the door with so many faults.Old Revier: I waited so long for this, it could have been amazing. It is, at present; god awful. Avoid until bugs have been fixed.			"

												(Note: While I can't say I recommend this game just because of the nature of this review, please don't let me stop you from at least trying it if you want it. Fable is a great game, and if remasters are your thing then it's worth buying. But this is a serious problem that has not been addressed despite the fact that I'm far from the only one who's experienced it, so I have to give a negative review.)The game has serious issues.Whenever I walk around, the camera is constantly stuttering and jerking every. single. half-second. It's absolutely unplayable. My computer can clearly handle the game, that much I can tell. All while the lag is going on, the background stuff (flowers waving in the breeze, fire, idle animations, etc) are going at full speed. My processor is more than enough to handle this game, it just... doesn't work.And I've tried everything from screwing with ini files to lowering graphics to as little as possible to making the game use only one core, but it's unfixable. Some people have reported that this stops after Oakvale, but it doesn't, and I couldn't stand playing anymore to see if it stopped after the Heroes Guild.Even in the in-game cutscenes, I hear the audio play at normal time as the characters stutter on, while the voices play at the correct time, so you have things like hearing the sound of the villager getting shot and 10 seconds later you hear ""Got one!"" and it's complete silence for the rest of the cutscene except when the characters are speaking. It's bewildering.The main thing that's crazy about this is how my computer meets and even exceeds the recommended requirements (I've seen reports with people as high as i5 processors encountering this problem), and the game itself seems to run just fine. This isn't even like normal lag or processor overload. It almost seems like the game is doing it intentionally, because everything else in the game except for me isn't lagging! So buy this game if you'd like it, but be prepared to get a refund (and a punch in the nostalgia) if it doesn't work.As for the game itself, I'd be pretty happy with it if it wasn't for this game-ruining bug. Yeah, it's just Fable with better graphics and a nicer lighting system. There's also Heroic (hard) Mode, which is definitely worth a play, and the aging is slowed so you're not 40 years old by the time you beat the bloody Wasp Queen. It's a minor quirk that always bugged me, so heyo. Oh, and you can save anywhere. Other than that, there are no differences. I got it on sale so I can't complain.If that's your thing, don't let me stop you. But if you also encounter this problem, you might just want to get a refund and buy the original Lost Chapters instead.			"

												If you were a fan of the original Fable or of the Fable Franchise this is a must buy, dont let my hours played foul you, I had this for the 360 before it came to PC and Ive put so many hours into it. And for those of you who are new to Fable, you love it for its simple on the outside yet deep and thought provoking story/lore on the inside, and also for its well known qorky and brash humor, Fable is a classic everyone should experiece			"

												I do not care how well a sculpter can carve an ice statue if they will only do so in hell. It will melt before anyone can enjoy it.If you are going to remake a game, you should try to improve areas that need improving while not destroying areas that are fine(such as the camera). And if you are going to make a game for PC, step one is to allow your paying customer the ability to change keybindings. A game that will not let me control my character in the way that I would like OR let me see the surroundings I like? An Ice swan in hell.I regret paying for this game, this studio has disappointed me for the last time.  "

												After and eternity away from this game I am glad to be able to buy it again. This is probably the greatest game I have ever played. It has its flaws but the way your character develops and the feats he performs makes you so proud as the player and knowing that you are destined for great things makes you feel terrific as you are playing the game and the gear and combat. As well as becoming so powerful and unstoppable. It was the game of my childhood and now I am happy to play it again and happy to know that it is still such a wonderful game.Edit: Just wanted to say that if you guys want to get fable 2 on pc then have a look at the community on the fable anniversary page and sign this petition https://www.change.org/p/we-the-people-request-fable-ii-come-to-pc "

												For those of you who may have played Fable II and Fable III and liked those, but never got to experience this original game, I would highly recommend this game. I will say that $35 is a bit steep for a graphical overhaul, as most of the mechanics (as far as I can tell) haven't been altered. For first timers it might be worth it, but if it goes on sale for 25% or more I would definitely recommend picking it up.For those that have played/own the original version, the $35 price tag is way overpriced. I would recommend waiting for at least a 50% off sale before picking this up.Bottom line... I picked this game up after get one of the mass distributed coupons for 60% off and I jumped on the offer, and I say it was well worth it. The graphics are beautiful to look at. Nothing revolutionary or next gen, but a great enough improvement over the original that makes playing through it again a whole new experience.As for the few things I dont like...- If playing with a controller... Even though I have been using 360 controllers since '06 I still find myself attempting to hit those Black/White buttons to use my bow and sword, but those are now assigned to the LB and RB. There is an option for a more Fable II and III control scheme, where X is melee, and Y is the bow. I like that control setup more, overall, but it messes with my instinct to push Y to block like the original controls do.-The faces are the one thing that seem to have suffered in the overhaul. The Hero's, Maze, and the Guildmasters faces all look wrong, compared to what I expected from the original game. But it is easily able to be overlooked and ignored.The things I have mixed feelings on...- The new menu interface... It is very different from the original. If this is your first time playing the game, dont worry. The menu setup is still logical, just different. lol It definitely looks nicer, I am just still adjusting to using the LB/RB and LT/RT to navigate rather than just having a list you scroll through with the thumbstick.- The difficulty... I recall that during my first one or two playthroughs of the game on Xbox, I used many Ressurection Phials. And then I got to the point where I could sell all but one or two, as I very rarely needed them. The Anniversary edition has two difficulties (the original just had one IIRC), the classic difficulty, and a harder one. I seriously debated playing the harder one right off the bat, as I remember that I had stopped playing the original in part because it felt too easy. But now... maybe the default is harder, or more likely I just lost my ""edge"" in the game from not playing it for a long time. I have only played about 4 hours I think at the time of writing this, and I have already used 4 or 5 Phials. lolThe things I like...- The graphics, obviously. I like seeing the detail on my gear now, and the world seems more vibrant. I have enjoyed just running around and looking at things.- Even though it seems I would have been committing suicide, I am glad that there is a harder difficulty for when I am ready to attempt that.- It is the same game I fell in love with so many years ago. Yes, including bugs lol. They had debated redoing the entire game, but I am glad they didnt. It would have been nice to see the bugs fixed, but there arent even enough to be concerned about really. This game gives me a rather large sense of visually updated nostalgia. Aside from the Halo games on Xbox, this game was my next favorite.			"

												Fable was a game backed by huge promises and a lot of hype. Although it didn't live up to every claim that Lionhead Studios made, it did manage to deliver a great action RPG, with a lot of character and humour. Fable Anniversary on Xbox 360 gave me so many problems, that it left a sour taste in my mouth, and I flat out put that console back in the closet. I found it on here for sale the other day, and I am glad I gave this one a second shot. I got to relive all the epic moments and see all the sights Albion has to offer, but this time with a fresh coat of paint and a few slight changes to bring this game up to par. Aside from a few problems here and there (nothing game breaking) and some freaky looking character models, Fable Anniversary was 20 hours well spent, and I actually look forward to my next adventure in this wonderful game!

												Didn't get a chance play it the orginal then this is worth your time and money. The game is legendary open world game that uses lionhead studios world renow implemnation of good and bad moral system. So your choices actually matter to legendary ( at the time) AI or Npcs in the game. Notes- You get old- Their eyes don't blink ( someone make a mod pls) - magic, you like potions right?- You can kill the villagers or become their hero? ( Take out your passive agreesive in a healty manner) - Chicken abuse is okay unlike skyrim - The NPC have lives. ( I saw one reading a book then chatting with guy who was eating an apple) Soultion1) Changed the system config - Boot proccesses to 4 2) Put the game on a faster external hardrive ( using this one)3) Use the xbox controllerTLDRYou own or played the orginal  than don't waste your time or money. The next one comes out soon. You don't own this then buy it and put it on external hard or look for a mod/patch.  "

												Not sure how this game was at launch, as i waited 2 months, but ran fine for me since I got it, started playing again recently now that I can.Yeah, the Hero can look a little bit strange in this game, but it is smooth, fun to play, and of course good story like the original obviously and as well, it has awesome enviroment's.If you have the orignal Fable (lost chapters), you don't NEED to pick this up, especially not at full price, wait till its on sale for sure. But if you new to the series and want a new RPG game to play, honestly this is a great palce to start if you do not want to play the older game. (BIG FAN of the Fable Series. Even parts of 3 were alright with me, had fun on COOP with old friends. But this, is much better.)			"

Sure, it's not as polished or pretty as a modern game, but fans of the original game will love it. The updates are nice.

Posted: July 4, 2015
												Where to begin,Let me start off by saying the original Fable game was one of my first Microsoft gaming experiences (Got it with the Crystal EDition Xbox with Fable and Crimson Skies). Since then however many years ago, Ive owned 6 copies of this game whether it be the original, lost chapters, or anniversary. It was on sale on the summer sale and for the low price tag, I had to try the PC port.Im a huge fan of the game, and the series, however this PC port is less than what is desired. Lets start off with the basic skeleton of the game, the graphics.GraphicsThis Anniversary edition is pretty much Lost Chapters remastered, with a very linear reskin for graphics. The graphics have improved by a little bit yes, but some animations are still quite static and robotic. For a game they are asking $40 full price I guess there isnt too much space to complain about, but when you look at other aanniversary games (Halo 2 Anniversary as an example) that offer full redone and appropriate next gen reskin, its hard to pass this as acceptable. For owners of Lost chapters, its not worth spending that kind of money for minor graphical enhancements. The thing with graphics that drive me nuts with this game is the color palette and shadowing. Original fans like myself will notice this when you first start off, as the green and red outlines around foes/allies are a murky and dull shade, where these colors should be vibrant and identifiable such as the original. Id give the graphics 3/5.SoundFor me this games sound component has always been stellar. The composed music in this game is well written and very recognizable. The music composure fits the game well, and changes appropriately without being abrupt as situations in the game change. Whether its browsing throughout the guild, to entering the woods and entering into a combat scenario. As far as sound effects go there is quite abit of repitition, but its to be expected in an older title, and its only going to bug you if you focus on it. Voice acting is another strong point of this game as some of the main characters (minus your hero obviously!) have very interesting voices, and some of the scripting the speak is quite funny and entertaining. Overall, with the music being a strong point for me and the mix of it all into one works well, id give the sound 4.25/5, especially considering the age of the game (unsure if sound was remastered for the anniversary edition, will have to look)StoryAnother great part of this game. Original fans will feel quite at home and know what they are getting into. New fans will have a great story mode to get into and see how it all intertwines. From the original Oakvale raid, to the battle with Jack of blades, its quite a nice vengeance based story mode that will keep you interested. The transition from the original game to the added extention of Lost Chapters has always been odd for me. You can definitly tell where the original game ended, and where they slapped on the added part of TLC. However, the variety in missions and rewards make this well worth looking into. 4/5 ControlsHere is the major flaw with this PC port. The controls are awful. Controlling the camera with the mouse while trying to balance out everything else out on the keyboard is less than desired. In High tempo, higher ranked combat it is quite difficult to go from say a range attack, to melee, to will in a smooth way. I find myself getting lost on the keyboard trying to remember all the silly Hotkeys (Clicking in the mouse wheel to block?!). I havent looked to see if I can change these or not, but even fresh off the install, better controls should be offered as you seem to be all over the keyboard to map simple combos and interactions. Again im very new to the PC port, so I dont consider this part of the review to be fair. Im going to look into other control options, and test out the full control compatibility and update this. But as of now, 2/5 for controlsGameplayBeing a fan of this game I knew what I was getting into. There are gold quests which are your main storyline quests, while silver are selective. Theres a great balance between these quests and none of the main quests seem repititous in anyway. They are all interconnected and feel smooth, while the silver quests seem to be less polished. Whether its combat in the Arena Quest, or racing in your underwear in the prison, I think most gamers will be quite happy with the versatility offered in this game. Its nowhere near as in depth as other RPGs as Skyrim or WoW, but for a casual common gamer such as myself that doesnt want to put 500hrs into the game, its great for pickup and play. The combat mechanics are simple, yet effective. You have a decent selection of basic weapons (Swords, Hammers, Scythes, Bows, Crossbows, etc) which are then placed into damage categories based on level (Obsidian, Master etc). Not to mention the Legendary weapons you can find in game through chests, quests, and other means. Like previously stated, the only amjor hinderance with the combat in this game is abmysal controls.Gameplay 4.25/5Overall, would I recommend this game? For the $9 I paid for it, definitly. For users looking to get into it I cannot recommend it at $40. Owners of Lost Chapters especially, save your time and money,ID RATE THIS PORT 3.5/5Its a great game for a great series, and those who didnt experience it on both xboxs like I did, I would recommned picking up this port and checking out this great story and game. For myself, I can look  past the flaws as im a huge fan of the game, and hopefully you will do the same and experience the core of Fable and where its popularity came from.*Thanks for reading my first review, I will update as I continue on with the game as obviously I dont have much time played right now.

												Revisiting this makes me realize how poorly thought out certain aspects were, like the easily exploitable bartering system and dodge roll. Putting the soul crushingly shallow gameplay aside the story is almost worthless and makes no attempt to flesh anybody out-you can seriously skip every cutscene and you won't be missing much. I can't make any progress in Hero mode because the instant I try to attack the game hangs and I can't kill the process, necessitating a restart. Controls are serviceable enough, game crashes from time to time.			"

I have only played about 4 hours I think at the time of writing this, and I have already used 4 or 5 Phials. lolThe things I like...- The graphics, obviously. I like seeing the detail on my gear now, and the world seems more vibrant. I have enjoyed just running around and looking at things.- Even though it seems I would have been committing suicide, I am glad that there is a harder difficulty for when I am ready to attempt that.- It is the same game I fell in love with so many years ago. Yes, including bugs lol. They had debated redoing the entire game, but I am glad they didnt. It would have been nice to see the bugs fixed, but there arent even enough to be concerned about really. This game gives me a rather large sense of visually updated nostalgia. Aside from the Halo games on Xbox, this game was my next favorite.			"

												Really not any different (Graphics wise) from the original game if you turned it up full. I wouldn't recomend it unless you want a little extra content than what the original had. Ultimately just seems like a way to make more money without making a new game.			"

												Fun game, feels very close to the original but with better graphics. only downside is if you do the side quests when they are available your left with nothing to do when you defeat the final boss. but i still strongly recommend it to anyone who likes action rpg style combat with a very different experience system.

The game is great now aside from the menues still being terrible with a key set. The graphics are smoother, the eyes aren't taking you out of the game because they are so poorly done (decent now) and although esc doesn't back you out of menues, ""backspace"" does and that in it's self is nicer than having to use the letters on the key set.

												Very pricey for a simple retexturing, but for me, it was worth it. Fable was my favorite Xbox game of all time, and being able to replay the entire thing in HD with a controller was like a dream come true. I do own the old PC version of TLC, but having full controller support just made me feel like I was sitting down at my Xbox again and reliving one of the greatest video game experiences I ever had. My only regret is that I rememebered the entire game, so there were no surprises.			"

												As a fan of the original Fable and Fable 2, I felt compelled to dip my toe into this fantasy world once again and revisit the series, and I'm glad I did. The setting is beautiful, humourous and exciting, the gameplay ranging from complex to simple depending on how you want to play and is a good fit for all types of players and the controls, whilst a little awkward at first, fits well by the time you have finished the earlier quests.If you enjoyed Fable on the xbox, I'd say you will enjoy your second time around, and if you are new to Fable, you could do much, MUCH worse than this adventurous RPG. A must buy. You SHOULD buy. Or are you just going to stand there like a lemon?			"

The choices are actually meaningful albeit the story does not dramatically change.Combat is good (if you have played number 2 the spells here are 10000x better no hold to charge bs).The face they have updated the graphics is great.

												I never played Fable on the Xbox when it came out, but I had heard good things about it so when it was on sale durning the winter sale, I decided to pick it up.  I am sure glad I did!  It has a great story, the combat is fluid and easy to control and the inventory system is very good, although I will there was a little easier to tell what you have equiped. I highly recommend this game if you have not played Fable before, if you have I have heard not much has changed so it might be a waste of money unless you a die hard Fable fan. Bottom line: Get it if you have never played Fable before.			"

												This is a remaster of a 12 year old game whose core gameplay is good enough to stand against the giants available for purchase today in the genre - the definitive version of Fable/Fable: TLC. I spent countless hours playing Fable for the Xbox growing up, and when I saw Anniversary up on the winter sale this past December I jumped at the opportunity to experience the version of the game I never had when I was younger (I never played through TLC).What a great experience! I've loved every single minute of my playthrough thus far, and will probably do a second one shortly after!Controller support is great (I use a Steam Controller when playing), but I'm sure the KB+M controls work fine as well. The old hero save glitches are gone which could be a boon or a negative depending on who you speak to. The graphical updates are noticable but still retain the charm that the original Fable had.If you played this game when it was originally released and you were a fan - GET THIS! Get it on sale, get it full price, whatever you may do - just buy it. If you have the patience to wait, pick it up on sale (it goes on sale frequently) and get the best value for your dollar. You will not regret it.			"

This Game is full of Action, Adventure and fun, i have not had a game like this in a long time. IT IS AMAZING!!! Very interesting story fun gameplay and the game lets you choose between good and bad all the time you can either save some farmers or help rob them, you can Guard a diplomat or kill him it is totaly up to you but remember ""FOR EVERY CHOICE, A CONSEQUENCE"" now the graphics are not the best but still pretty good. How old should one be? Absolutely no problem at the age of 12+ at least 11 would be good since there is a lot of violence and a tiny bit of blood.All in all this is a must have for every adventure RPG fan, has a lot of action and an awsome story			"

But if you new to the series and want a new RPG game to play, honestly this is a great palce to start if you do not want to play the older game. (BIG FAN of the Fable Series. Even parts of 3 were alright with me, had fun on COOP with old friends. But this, is much better.)			"

												Fable was a game backed by huge promises and a lot of hype. Although it didn't live up to every claim that Lionhead Studios made, it did manage to deliver a great action RPG, with a lot of character and humour. Fable Anniversary on Xbox 360 gave me so many problems, that it left a sour taste in my mouth, and I flat out put that console back in the closet. I found it on here for sale the other day, and I am glad I gave this one a second shot. I got to relive all the epic moments and see all the sights Albion has to offer, but this time with a fresh coat of paint and a few slight changes to bring this game up to par. Aside from a few problems here and there (nothing game breaking) and some freaky looking character models, Fable Anniversary was 20 hours well spent, and I actually look forward to my next adventure in this wonderful game!

												Didn't get a chance play it the orginal then this is worth your time and money. The game is legendary open world game that uses lionhead studios world renow implemnation of good and bad moral system. So your choices actually matter to legendary ( at the time) AI or Npcs in the game. Notes- You get old- Their eyes don't blink ( someone make a mod pls) - magic, you like potions right?- You can kill the villagers or become their hero? ( Take out your passive agreesive in a healty manner) - Chicken abuse is okay unlike skyrim - The NPC have lives. ( I saw one reading a book then chatting with guy who was eating an apple) Soultion1) Changed the system config - Boot proccesses to 4 2) Put the game on a faster external hardrive ( using this one)3) Use the xbox controllerTLDRYou own or played the orginal  than don't waste your time or money. The next one comes out soon. You don't own this then buy it and put it on external hard or look for a mod/patch.  "

												Revisiting this makes me realize how poorly thought out certain aspects were, like the easily exploitable bartering system and dodge roll. Putting the soul crushingly shallow gameplay aside the story is almost worthless and makes no attempt to flesh anybody out-you can seriously skip every cutscene and you won't be missing much. I can't make any progress in Hero mode because the instant I try to attack the game hangs and I can't kill the process, necessitating a restart. Controls are serviceable enough, game crashes from time to time.			"

Sure, it's not as polished or pretty as a modern game, but fans of the original game will love it. The updates are nice. I do miss the old level up menu though.In any event, it's worth playing for about $15 or less, I say. Full price is hard to justify but I got it on sale at $8.74. Very worth it for that price.			"

												Recommended definitely especially with dlc this was the game that got me gaming in the first place it's like my childhood this game goes from a kid to an adult and the best part is u choose how it plays out u can raid a village or save it from a dire fate of the amazing story it's well designed mechanics and it makes u feel like ur in control u get aspects of horns if ur evil but if ud like to keep most of ur hair maybe hero side is for u there's numerous glitches that can break or make the game funny like the exploit between shops if u already played through and want to skip right to the millionaire levels of course it's time consuming but isn't that y u play a game anyway to consume ur time I had this game on xbox 360 I got every achievement and beat the game in less than a day I didn't sleep of course but this game make u not want to I can say on my opinion it's the best game to exist in its time and I wish I can forget everything just to play it for the first time again if u can't run this game I suggest fable the lost chapters it's exactly the same this is only a remake of the beloved game with enhanced graphics I'm still trying to decide wether I like the old graphics more or not but it's older and u may come across glitches but it's worth the $10 I got both this game is like a harem of goddesses granting u anything I strongly recommend  and in sorry it's so long didn't mean to rant this is my first post thanks if u read it all or even some and enjoy the game for those who have it think ima play it through one more time :jackofblades:			"

												This is an awesome game and it's worth buying! I used to have it for my Xbox 360 but after selling away my Xbox 360, I greatly miss this game so much. It is my favorite RPG game! Thanks to LIONHEAD that had made it a FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT so I can finally get to play this awesome game again! I'm not good at playing with keyboard and I really hate to play PC games that are not supported by controller. This game is awesome and there are no glitches, bugs or any crashes.			"

												A very nice facelift to a fun RPG.  I had not played Fable since the original game on XBox I was worried the game would have not aged well.  While the visuals and story still hold their own almost 10 years later, the combat controls can be a tad clunky if you are using a mouse/keyboard.  I would recommend anyone that is a fan of the series give this game a try and hopefully we will see the rest of the series on Steam down the road.			"

												This is more a remaster than a remake of Fable. Nonetheless, this is probably one of the greatest RPG's ever to have existed so it makes sense to remaster it to preserve it for upcoming generations. What is Fable? Fable is a game about the life of your in-game character. You will follow him from childhood to his elder years (age is simulated through playtime rather than story). Your decisions shape your character's appearance, reputation and social standing. The way people react to you differs depending on your in-game actions. Did you raid a farm in order to gain some gold, or did you defend it from bandits? Fable is a game filled with lore and really gives you a good sense of growth. You will feel yourself and your character improve with gameplay. Fighting often with swords makes your character's muscles grow. Eating too much food will make him fat. Using a lot of magic will create rune lines on his skin. Doing good deeds will make your skin lighter and your eyes glow blue. Doing evil deeds will make your skin darker and your eyes glow red. Whatever your decisions, you can bet that the game will reflect it.I will not spoil anything, but this is one of the greatest RPG stories because of how varied it is. It really feels like you've lived a lifetime by the end of the game; the game feels that lengthy.The combat is enjoyable as it is a hack n' slash game. This version gives you a 'heroic' mode which really ups the challenge. More tactics is required in heroic mode as you need to plan before heading into battle, ""which enemies do I kill first, what spells should I use, how should I initially attack"". One false move and you will die (and die for good as you will need to restart from a checkpoint).If you've already played the game and are purchasing this for the upgraded graphics, then you're reading the right review. The graphics are a great improvement. However, I feel like the game 'feels' different with the new graphics. It feels more like 'clay' rather than the old World of Warcrafty graphics. Hard to describe unless you've played it yourself. In terms of gameplay, NOTHING was changed. Everything is the same; the bugs, the sounds, the interface. They have 'improved' the HUD (which isn't necessarily an improvement, just a reskin). All in all, it's a solid remaster but not worth the $40.00 price tag. Wait for a sale; $20 and below and this remaster is definately worth it.This remaster gets an 8/10. It lost 2 points due to no improvements/innovation.			"

												Fable 1 is like dollar store candy- cheap and unsophisticated, but still tasty none-the-less in a junky kind of way. It helps that it doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Anniversary, then, is like the candy makers going over the recipe again, fiddling with the sugar quantity, maybe sourcing a slightly better supplier of chocolate liquer, upgrading their factory machinery, and investing in a more professional-looking packaging. Its still junky dollar-store candy, but now its the BEST junky dollar-store candy. Patching has done much to resolve stability issues, and my gripes are few, mostly in relation to non-functionality of Boast UI and the continued annoyance of trying to buy property in Bowerstone South.

												I cannot play this game.  The camera ""wobble"" is terrible.  Anytime you try to turn while moving forward the camera wobbles in the opposite direction.  This makes the game visually nauseating.  It seems to be some auto-correct or auto-pan feature, but there is no way to disable it.  The original games (which I also own) are so much better than this version.Conclusion: but a used copy of the original game w/ DLC and you'll save money and be happier.			"

												It's pure classic this game, you'll finish it, and finish it over, and over again !!! one from the best of all fable series (at least to me)...Always getting nice ""nostalgia"" when playing this game (reminds me good old times!)Game itself it's very good, and fun. Plus now it have ""HD"" textures so it's even more badass. I am happy that developers resurrected, and improved this legendary game (in graphics, audio, UI, new features, Aspects!)I recommend to you guys, to buy this game on huge sale. Because even it's an improved ""HD"" game, but still standard price it's way to high. Same stuff with ""DLC"" some new weapons, and outfits it's cool and nice to have, but as i said buy with huge discount. DLC's price is overpriced, unless your huge ""fable"" fan so yeah grab it :)Overall my verdict - 8,5/10 great classy game!			"

												I couldn't wait to play this game when I heard they were going to remaster it. Fans have been asking them to do an HD remake for years. The gameplay is exactly how it was on the original game (animations and all) and the only thing changed are the graphics. A lot of the reviews are negative for this reason but the majority of the people who were asking for the remake to happen did not and still don't want the original gameplay changed. Yes, there have been some features in Fable 2 and 3 that would have been nice to have on the remake (better animations once again), but a lot of fans, myself included, wanted to play this game exactly as it was. We just wanted to see this great RPG in full HD glory and updated so it ran better, so if you were a fan of the original but wanted improvements on top of the HD remaster, this probably isn't the game for you to buy, but if you, like me, just wanted to see this game in stunning HD quality, this is a great game to buy. The only con I have is the new inventory menu. It takes some getting used to and I'd have prefered the original one, but oh well.			"

												As a huge fan of the original Fable, I just had to pick this remaster up and I'm truthfully glad I did. It is still basically the same game, but with a major graphical overhaul and built on a new game engine (Unreal). I'd say the graphics look 20x better than the original did despite some naysayers who say otherwise. The only problem I noticed visually is often times textures will take a while to load when talking to NPC's and their faces will look a little muddy for about a minute until the texture loads, but other than that it looks great and way better than the original. The character faces are what shine the most and have been improved dramatically, but overall the textures and colors are far higher resolution and more rich in color. Another plus is the addition of achievements and full gamepad support (I mean afterall, this is 2015, every PC gamer should own a gamepad). Aside from the obvious, this also has some cool DLC (I haven't bought yet, but I've seen it), mostly just new clothing and armor like being able to wear Jack of Blades' or Thunder's outfit, etc.Aside from the obvious, it is still the same classic Fable fans will know and love but optimized for people who have the latest computer hardware and Windows 8/10. However, the price is a little steep. I would wait for a sale before purchasing as the normal price they're asking for is a little too much even for a remake as worthy of a purchase as this. I think $15 to $20 is fair, but anything more than that is a little overboard honestly.Do I recommend buying it? Of course. Even coming from someone that played the original countless times this game doesn't ever get old.			"

												If you played Fable in it's original iteration, it's basically that only more awesome. Buy it. Play it again. If you haven't played Fable, here's your mission should you choose to accept it: Install game, start new game, watch story. Punch your sister in the face 25 times before you give her those chocolates. Fable, the ""seriously punch everyone in the village in the face before you give your sister the chocolate"" simulator. There's just no reason not to do it, guys.			"

Same stuff with ""DLC"" some new weapons, and outfits it's cool and nice to have, but as i said buy with huge discount.

												The original game with some graphical textures is arguably a much better game overall. The lack of menu and key binding options, the lack of hotkey porting especially (there's no F key bindings I have found), makes this game not only lazy but extremely frustrating to play.Don't buy this if you are thinking about it. If you haven't seen already, you can't actually use your mouse in the menus. WHY? I assume it would have taken 2 or 3 hours at the very worst to put the capability back in, or copy and adapt the code from *any* other game from the studio.Edit: 2 months of fixes later and it has become quite a good game, happy to recommend it now.

												If you plan on playing this game with an xbox 360 controller, then you have nothing to worry about in regards to controls with this game. Most of the negative reviews were made when the game first came out, before all the patches and bug-fixes were released. The game right now is pretty solid and I'm enjoying every moment of it. The price for it is a bit high, in my opinion. I would have thought $19.99 would have been a more suitable price for an HD remastered title. If it goes on sale anytime soon, I would definitely recommend getting it, then. Or if you don't mind paying the $34.99, then I would certainly grab it now.			"

												Updated 10.11.14So we finally got mouse support, reason to check all patches and take another look at controls, keys and graphics.The game improved, navigating the menu with the mouse is behaving strange, but thats not unusual for console ports, and at least we can do that now.So that works argueable well, in comparision with the 4-key system from before its a 400% improvement. The menu was the main reason i didnt play Anniversary so far, it just made the task of doing anything in the menu unbearable. Thats fixed now. It could be better, but its ok.Contols and fighting system are still like the original, i like that. Yet we werent able to fe. use special mouse buttons or rebind individual actions. All this is possible by now.Graphics had to live through some changes and are now less blurry and sharper overall. Nice to actually see the better graphics now ;)For a review of the game itself (story, world gameplay) check my Fable - The Lost Chapters review, the games are 99% identical and control the same way (aside from menu as discussed before).  I'll just say that the old version was/is one of my most favorite games of all time.http://steamcommunity.com/id/st0l3nid/recommended/204030Fable Anniversary finally got the curve, there is still some room for improvement, but we can finally enjoy with mouse and keyboard and nice graphics.

												Absolutely just. . . .the exact sound I made when we saw the hero's face was ""gyuh!?"",. . . This is a good with the same kind of horrendous aesthetic choices. Characters and objects (training dummy e.g.) don't fit with the environment, the low camera with the new visuals make the buildings look like some weird low-budget 3D movie set, and the Fire bridge that looks epic even today is just..underwhelming, clashing, and not at all nice to look at. They done %$@#$ed it up. That clay-ish colour palette, that doesn't help. Fable is meant to be bright and vibrant and  .. . well . . .cartoony. The more realistic colouring and texturing looks really, really wrong on the basic designs of everything else. That said, game runs better than TLC, windowed mode works properly, and finally get a controller on PC. Plus, if nothing else, the hard mode -does- remove both the trade and the sell house with trophy money cheats. There's still stuff you can do, but the worst offenders have been dealt with, and the only real limitation the limited funds put upon you is how many potions you can burn thru. EDIT:The above has been edited as well, so update is a better term, but anyway . .. .The patches do make hard mode more interesting, the worst offenses as a port (keybindings) have been addressed, and just all in all, they're doing a lot to improve things. I still HATE the new aesthetic, but I'll have to begrudgingly offer up a recommend now.			"

												After updates:Works better now, they've added mouse support. There's still no excuse for it not being in the game at launch, and this IS just an HD remake of a game you can get for less then $10, so I wouldn't recommend purchasing it for the full price but if you can get it on a significant Steam sale for <=$20 I'd highly recommend it if you enjoyed the original (or if you haven't played it but really like RPGs). I have had a lot of fun with it and the fact that it's on Unreal Engine alleviated some of the issues I had with the original on newer OSes such as Windows 8.1.Old Review:Poor console port.Doesn't even have mouse support for menu navigation.Do not buy.

												NEW REVIEW: So they fixed all the bugs and issues, the new graphics are alright (nothing special, especially for a PC game). Gameplay's always fun (since it's fable). Of course, usually a remake is the original but reimagined, where you'd expect an entirely new game based off the original, though really it's still the same exact game, I think most of the animations are the same, weapons are mostly the same with a few exceptions. I honestly expected an expanded story, maybe more adult with the Fable Fan Community now all grown up, no longer in their teens or childhood. Honestly I wouldn't really ""recommend"" this game, though it's an improvement from TLC, it's nothing new or different. If you already have TLC I wouldn't say this is worth 60 dollars, though it won't freeze and crash like TLC did often.OLD REVIEW: This is subject to change, since this is only the first day, but essentially it's the same exact game as TLC, only with a new GUI that doesn't allow you to use your mouse in menus, and a screwed up combat system. If you want to learn more I have a nice big rant in the forums. I just hope Lionhead fixes this.			"

Lionhead Studios did a great job on Fable Anniversary and they did it the right way. They did not change anything except graphics, added a new diffuculty level which is not easy and a bunch of cool DLCs. Definitly worth the money. Hopefully they do a remake of Fable 2 or release it on PC. I will not buy an Xbox.			"

												Great Game, Great Franchise, Great reboot.Thoroughly recommend.Gameplay is a little un-polished but it is overall a fantastic game with a fantastic plot and a lot of terrific quirks, combat is fun, camera is a little odd and jittery.Microsoft if you love money so much why haven't you ported Fable 2 yet?

												The only problem I have with this game is that the dynamic lighting kills my framerate. The game runs a lot more smoothly with it disabled, but I like to play with lighting in my game and not have the world look like it has cloudy weather all the time. But really that's my only beef with Fable. Hopefully a the devs could patch the game so it runs better with dynamic lighing enabled.			"

												Fable has and always will be one of my favorite games. The restin the series not so much but Fable gets a gold star in my book. Lionhead Studios did a great job on Fable Anniversary and they did it the right way. They did not change anything except graphics, added a new diffuculty level which is not easy and a bunch of cool DLCs. Definitly worth the money. Hopefully they do a remake of Fable 2 or release it on PC. I will not buy an Xbox.			"

												Good ol' Fable!A game me and buddies played for hours on end, oh the memories.I understand people aren't quite pleased with the anniversary edition, but I'd say it's worth a buy.Keep in mind, I bought it during Summer Sales so I got this work of art for a whopping eight dollars!As for any game, this one is a definite buy when on sale.  Especially if you're susceptible to nostalgia attacks.I found the controls quite smooth, despite what everyone else is saying.  I'm using a PS4 controller, and I'd definitely  recommend a gamepad or controller for Fable.  The updated graphics aren't horrible either, granted I am using SweetFXand I'd suggest you do to (everything looks so vibrant)!I'd recommend buying the game, the DLC's on the other hand I wouldn't.10/10			"

												People are saying that this game is just Fable TLC with slightly better graphics and this is a horrible remake. Well, that's what a remake is. The same game, but with better graphics. If they had changed a lot of things, then it really wouldn't feel like the original fable now would it? I've played Fable Anniversary for hours upon hours, and I get a nostalgic feeling when playing it, which means Lionhead did great on this remake. Because that's what the remake is susposed to do, it's suposed to make you relive those awesome moments you had playing Fable 10 years ago, and that is exactly what this game does. It has great graphics, has the original gameplay and it just feels overall amazing.Great job Lionhead, and thank you for allowing us to relive this legendary game.			"

												Many felt cheated. Well the benefit of steam is: you get discounts....lots of them over every single month. So just wait out till price drops. I expected nothing more than was it used to be. Considering that most so called HD remake tend to slightly improve the game, I had little to no expectations regarding improved graphics, sound, control, and contents. It's still a solid good ol' rpg. If you played fable before: Wait for price drop. Unless of course you can ignore the aforementioned lack of 'improvements', then by all means, buy and experience it again. This time with achievements!If you haven't played fable: Buy it, but don't expect it to be like fable 2 or 3 in terms of contents or graphics. Still the best fable out of all 3 I think. Or you can simply wait until price drops.  "

My computer easily meets the recommend specs for the game and yet it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ The frame rate is atrocious, the cutscenes are insanely glitchy and it renders the game unplayable. Very dissapointed in this♥♥♥♥♥♥port. In the little time ive spent playing, when it wasnt stuttering or glitching out, I also found the graphics to be somewhat dissapointing. Ah well, lesson learned. Avoid this game in its current state.Edit: Patches made the game much better. Enjoying it now, however, still not an improvement on lost chapters apart from controller support.			"

												UPDATE: As of 21/12/2014, the game is playable, even enjoyable. Most major problems and concerns have been ironed out and the addition of mouse controls in most menus (but oddly enough not all) has made this an actual PC port worth considering. With this in mind, I'm changing my review to a recommended. I will not remove the original criticism, though, as I feel the ""release broken port, then fix all the faults afterwards"" trend has got to stop, and we as the consumers have to tell the developers and publishers that this practice is not okay. TL;DR: The current state of the game is acceptable. What we got at launch, was not.ORIGINAL CRITICISM:If you thought the original port was bad, boy are you in for a treat. This game features endlessly loading textures, with the graphical fidelity of a game from 2006. The menus seem like they've been made by aliens with no idea of how humans use their hands, and the most annoying controls are not rebindable. I think this is a crying shame, as I loved the original as a teenager, but as an adult PC gamer, I'm insulted by the lack of effort made on lionhead's part, to make this remake playable on PC. The least they could bloody do is make the mouse cursor available in the game. I'M PLAYING ON A PC, WHY CAN'T I USE MY MAIN INPUT TOOL FOR NAVIGATING YOUR MENUS?That rant aside, just buy the lost chapters instead. It is at least playable, something that this remake is not.			"

												The probem with these hd remakes, is they never seem to capture the exact feel of the original game. Fable has a weird sheen over it now, but is quite lifeless compared to my nostalgia. If the cheap original has controller support, play that instead. (If you need controller support anyways) Sure it's fun for my faux OCD to collect achievements for a game that I beat 4 times 10 years ago, but its not as fun as I remember. I am spoiled by modern rpgs that do so much right, whereas Fable always faltered then, and still does now. If you loved the original (or even liked) don't bother with this version. It's not worth it. If you have never experienced Fable, jump right in. I'm sure its quite enjoyable, if a bit embarassing and antiquated. 6/10			"

												All the negative reviews on this game seem to be about a lack of added content... I didn't see anywhere in the description that they did anything to the game aside from bump up the graphics and add the hero mode. That being said, this is a great game, matches the first one (and TLC) perfectly. Being able to play a game i grew up with and the added bonus of the much higher graphic quality was very enjoyable. The people complaining about the lack of added content are all morons that can't be bothered to read a description before hitting ""buy"".TL;DR?

												Fable: Anniversary is the bare minimum for what constitutes as an HD remaster. Sharper textures, better lighting and higher quality sound. The game feels and plays like the original game with the usual loading screens in between sections that you often see in games released back in the day. It's still the same old Fable at its core, but for some reason the developers made some pretty major changes to the artstyle which make the characters look a bit off. If you've never played Fable before then this is the game for you. If you, like me, have played the original Fable then this is just an okay remaster that does nothing better than the original. Hell, it does some things worse.			"

  // RATIONALE FOR PURCHASE AND WHERE I'M COMING FROM //:   I played the original Fable to death on the original xbox.I played Fable: The Lost Chapters to death on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ old lappy from 2000 in my adolescence.I picked this up for the summer sale price of $8 USD.Didn't see this product at launch and it may have been quite buggy. Stayed away for a while as I felt my copy of TLC is all I needed, but the sale price seemed worth it at the time as replaying TLC with the dated visuals wasn't as appealing with this existing.   // EXPERIENCE //:  Nothing more than a HD remake of the TLC game in the Unreal Engine, but thats not bad by any means, just worth noting. Visuals are ok, but the animations for the most part have seem to have been reused, with only facial animations having a minor overhaul. The other animations sometimes clip through some armour sets and it detracts from what they are trying to achieve.Having played it recently, the game is reasonably stable, with a few very, very minor bugs. It plays very similar, if not identically to TLC.It mostly lives up to expectations and its quite enjoyable, but doesn't provide any new content above what was included in TLC. Some find that infuriating, I don't personally. However, I would welcome new content in the same vein as the original titles.   // BOTTOM LINE VERDICT //:   The remake is  worth a sale price value (e.g $8 USD)  ,   NOT    its current full asking price.If you've played TLC through and through, then the value of buying this is just updated visuals and I recommend  buying it at a low sale price if you really want it.If you haven't played TLC or Any Fable games, this remake will do the series as much justice as TLC, so the value to a consumer in this category is vast in comparison, however I still only recommend purchasing at sale price as I feel purely updated visuals isn't enough to merit the full price.

Stupid narrative and voice acting. Seriously.2.) Everyone who plays this game will end up EXACTLY the same by the end (maxed out strength stats, full plate armour, using physical shield ALL the time).The thing is, if you REALLY love Fable 1, this is the definitive version.

One thing I liked is how a few minor bugs were fixed, such as how you can use the spell called Slow Time to influence the gambling minigames.

												Don't be fooled by the low rating because this game is as great as the original, if not better. The reason for the mixed rating is because of the price, which is understandable because this edition is simply a remastered HD quality version of the original. When it comes to the story and gameplay, nothing has changed (as it should be).  But that's what makes this edition so great, it brings life back to the original Fable. With the enhanced graphics, it makes the game more enjoyable and playable in todays standards. I'm actually surprised that many were disapointed because they felt that this edition was ""lazy"". It's a remastered edition. It's not any different than getting a Blu-Ray of the Wizard of Oz.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time. Fable Anniversary is the complete package (Fable:The Lost Chapeters HD Edition basicly). It has controller suport with the old control scheme for xbox. A lot of patches have been released and keep being released to help this game run super smooth at even the highest settings in the most intense scenes. The modding comunity is small sadly, and only has a few mods on the nexus that can extend your stay in Albion. The inside achevments are worth checking out too, and with multiple save slots per hero and extra lore friendly DLC that adds a lot of in game content to all the merchants, this game is definitly worth buying for fans of the series. TL:DR Its Fable:The Lost Chapters but with HD visiuals/effects, up to date support and more content.(if you buy the DLC)			"

												Fable is what I would call a fantasy classic: You, the protagonist, suffer hardship at a young age, and then learn the skills required to be a Hero (quite literally) and save the world. I have always loved the combat system of Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters. It feels smooth, and is easy to master. Enemies are always going to be challenging and willing to punish you if you let your guard down. The Fable Series has long been one of my favorite, and I love this remake.However, there are a few flaws to this. Firstly (and the biggest problem) is the menu. Occasionally the menu will glitch out and either randomly start scrolling through whatever screen you are on, or it will try to prevent you from scrolling through it, constantly dragging your selector (is that even the term?) back to the top of the menu. The second flaw to Fable: Anniversary is the colors. The origional Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters were these brightly colored places that captured your imagination. Now, the world feels dull and somewhat bland. However, the balance of the coloring it still good, and you won't be bored looking at the world after an hour.That all being said, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone, both those who have played the series since the first installments, and new players who found a sale going on.

												Fantastic remake of the first Fable Game series, would recommend to anyone who wants to relive the old days with a more modern day look to it. Great story mode and takes a while to complete. Lots to do, all in all i'd say 10/10. Very well worked for a remake & remodel.			"

												I never played the original Fable, only Fable 3, and I actually enjoyed my time. Trying this game was a breath of fresh air. The combat is much better than the third, the weapon system feels very balanced, the story is interesting.As for the PC port, as long as you have a wired controller you will run into no issues.			"

												I played Fable on the Xbox when it came out. Playing this is quite a trip of nostalgia; so if you're like me and you enjoyed playing the original, this might be worth your time. If you've never played Fable, I wouldn't recommend picking it up now. The game's difficulty curve is laughably broken (even on the supposed ""heroic"" or hard mode), the mechanics feel double their age, and the story is nonsensical. It's fascinating to see how drastically RPG (and game design in general) has changed in the last decade-- so perhaps it's worth playing to quench some sort of historical curiousity. Even then, there are probably better games to play if that's your goal.			"

												Good game if you are a fan of an RPG game with a silent man growing up and doing things with out saying a word. Pros- Morality scale- Has KFC in game- Murder- Everyone love you after a point and then men as you to marry them-- side pro can murder people for flirting near you when you got a wifeCon- Tofu is for good morality other then the carrot who do you think I am a PETA member?- Those god damned Demon Doors that require you to do something you do want to do like giving them your silver keys- silver keys are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get why would I give that damn demon door my keys.- same as Fable: The lost Chapters so if you own that dont buy this.

												Honestly, its just fable with slightly upgaded graphcs at best. none of the beginning or end cutscenes are remastered only the core gameplay graphics are. The animation is still very clunky aswell as the controls and targeting, don't even bother to attempt to try to play it without a controller as the keyboard controls are just awkward and just don't feel right. i bought this on the summer sale so im relatively happy with the game; however it is not worth buying at full price.So to sum this up if you must buy it, wait till it's majorly discounted around 60%-90% as itts just not that much of an upgrade from the origional fable the lost chapters.

												I was weary of buying this because of the mixed reviews and I don't know if they just worked all these bugs/glitches out or if for some reason I didn't notice but I thought the game ran great.  There is the very occasional flickering face or typical game glitch now and then but I would say generally it is a good improvement over the original.  I thoroughly enjoyed playing through it back in 2004 I think was on my Xbox, and again now with improvements across the board.   I did get it on a pretty good sale too so my expectations were not as high as someone who paid full price I'm sure.			"

												First of all, I've not played the ""Original- Fable"".Fable Anniversary is a rework of the original game ported into the Unreal Engine, providing upgraded graphics and “upgraded” menus. It is a HD remake of the original Fable developed by Lionhead Studios for the original Xbox.The level of customization you have over your character is Ok.""Change your hairstyle or your clothes, be good or evil, help the townsfolk or watch them burn--the choice is yours."" - ""I'm not sure if the good-evil alignment playing one time only will give more than a touch of reacts to your actions.""Take your time on playing Fable. Speak to people, pick up side quests and play around, otherwise you might suddenly find that it’s over. There’s a lot you won’t find out unless you take time to mess around and experiment.You may not be overwhelmed, but it's still a good action game that everyone should experience at some point or another.

												Fable is a decent enough game. Anyone who was playing on an Xbox in the very early 2000's knows how strangely disappointing this game was, due to good ol' Peter Molyneux and the Hype Train Express that he rides all over the place, but at the end of the day the game isn't necessarily bad. It is an enjoyable and simplistic RPG with a lot of great ideas that never really seem to be fully explored. It's the lack of exploration into these ideas that makes Fable strange, as there are truly a lot of really cool things in the game. It just feels a tad lackluster.Nonetheless, this is a great 15-20 hour RPG, worth playing at least once in my book. It's not very complicated, the combat is satisfying, and there are enough sidequests and hidden things to find to satiate most appetites. It is not an incredible or deep experience, but merely a game that is good-enough-to-pass-for-fun. There is an alignment system, you can give yourself tattoos or haircuts, you can run around on a murderous rampage if you feel the need, and you can walk around a town dancing and farting to please the locals. Go and get drunk in a bar, eat some apples, and beat up an innocent guy in town. Woo!For what it is worth, I've managed to beat the game three times, twice on the original Xbox and once just now on the PC. I've always enjoyed it, even if the game seems to come to an end a bit early.The PC port, as far as I could tell, was just fine. I liked being able to use a controller for this game, as I feel like it controls better on one. I didn't have any crashes or bugs, and it even alt-tabbed without a hitch. My six year old computer kept 60fps on all high details, as well. If you're looking for an interesting RPG to play through in 20 hours or less, Fable Anniversary would be a good choice.			"

												Fable Anniversary is a great game with much better graphics than the original Fable, But you should also give this game a try if you are new the series. + You can make your own choices in being Good or Bad and the best part is that the sotry adapts with your choices wich makes the game have a great replayablity, because you want to try all the chioces. I have tried all choices in the game and with every choice you make there is always a something new to find out. This is what got me hooked on the game at the start.+ Story is great and the lore in the world of Ablion is good.+ The voice actors and the dialoge are great, This makes it really worth doing all the Quests because you want to know more about them or the story.+ The large variety of creatures in the world Albion are great with special abilities and combat styles to beat them, Though it gets a bit repeditive at the end when you have seen them all.+ The scaling of the combat and your Hero is great, if you want to rush trought the game it is gonna be hard, but if you take your time and learn more about the game.+ The are alot of extra Quests apart from the story that are great and will make you explore the things are Areas in the world witch you haven't seen yet.+ Boss fights in this game a great are unforgettable, and hard enough so that you need to have a stragery to beat them, if you don't know any OP combos that could make so the the fights really short.+ Nostagia, If you you have played this game before and wants to relive some of your emotions from the past. Just do it, the game won't dissapoint you.-+ The combat it self are Good but lacks more depths. It does have great variety but you will probably just stick the a few combos that are OP, But you could always roleplay and be and Archer, Warrior or magician if that is what you want.- Controlls from mouse and keyboard as default are awfull. I recomend using a controller or rebind the key so you feel comfortable. The Magic Scroll trought spells system is just a joke for the mouse, DON'T use it, assign the spells and skills you use the most to your hotbar or you will get frustrated.- The new graphics are poorly optimized but have been getting MUCH better with the updates to the game. If you have played alot of the original the you will be dissapointed by how ugly some of the heroes look compared to what I remember from the original. Jack of blades face and your face when you are a little boy.- Menu and inventory layout it BAD, It takes way to long to get used to find things in the inventory. Which might make some people not use it and when you have you will miss some of the quests because you will need to use thing from your inventory to figure out how to solve the quest.So, Is this game worth 32€?Almost, It is just like the the original game but with better graphics and I would say that the gameplay is a bit outdated.But when it gets to sale for 20€ or less this game is worth your money. ^^			"

												Yes. Get this version. Full, native controller support is the only real selling point of this over vanilla Lost Chapters, but it's a damn good one.I only wish 2 and 3 were available on PC (I know 3 is, but you can't legally get it anymore), as Fable 1 has a lot of flaws that the ol' nostalgia glasses can prevent one from seeing.1.) Stupid narrative and voice acting. Seriously.2.) Everyone who plays this game will end up EXACTLY the same by the end (maxed out strength stats, full plate armour, using physical shield ALL the time).The thing is, if you REALLY love Fable 1, this is the definitive version. Unfortunately, workshop support for this is virtually non-existent.			"

												Back when Fable first released, I was young and owned nearly the entire series of nintendo consoles. But I remember wishing for the first time that I had an X-Box just so that I could play Fable instead of The Legend of Zelda. Eventually, I did get to play it, and now Fable Anniversary brings it all back with the kind of polish that makes the game stand-up to your memories. Will you be a shining beacon of hope to the people of Albion? Or will the bottomless depths of your darkness sew dread in their hearts? Containing all the content of the ""Lost Chapters"" edition, remastered HD visuals, and a new ""Heroic"" difficulty setting for verterans; Fable Anniversary is the perfect reason to either return to land of Albion, or explore it for your first time.

												Good ol' Fable!A game me and buddies played for hours on end, oh the memories.I understand people aren't quite pleased with the anniversary edition, but I'd say it's worth a buy.Keep in mind, I bought it during Summer Sales so I got this work of art for a whopping eight dollars!As for any game, this one is a definite buy when on sale.  Especially if you're susceptible to nostalgia attacks.I found the controls quite smooth, despite what everyone else is saying.  I'm using a PS4 controller, and I'd definitely  recommend a gamepad or controller for Fable.  The updated graphics aren't horrible either, granted I am using SweetFXand I'd suggest you do to (everything looks so vibrant)!I'd recommend buying the game, the DLC's on the other hand I wouldn't.10/10			"

												One of my favorite games of all time. Fable Anniversary is the complete package (Fable:The Lost Chapeters HD Edition basicly). It has controller suport with the old control scheme for xbox. A lot of patches have been released and keep being released to help this game run super smooth at even the highest settings in the most intense scenes. The modding comunity is small sadly, and only has a few mods on the nexus that can extend your stay in Albion. The inside achevments are worth checking out too, and with multiple save slots per hero and extra lore friendly DLC that adds a lot of in game content to all the merchants, this game is definitly worth buying for fans of the series. TL:DR Its Fable:The Lost Chapters but with HD visiuals/effects, up to date support and more content.(if you buy the DLC)			"

Pros:-Solid remake of the original with updated graphics-Fun, whimsical atmosphere-Variety of weapons and armor sets to suit your character-Great amount of content-Fantastic story-Morality system that reflects your choices well-Modding supportCons:-No additional content in the remake-DLCs are overpriced and only offer armor and weapons-Very occasional graphics issues (her eyeball was clipping through the side of her head!)-Same old camera angle/clunky control frustrations-Fable: The Lost Chapters is available for $9.99 and is the exact same game, minus the graphics upgrade and mod supportOverall: This is the original Fable game.  If you haven't played it, it's fantastic, and worth the price.  Whimsical humor and deep gameplay make it a fun RPG.  Choices matter and change the way the world reacts to you.  There are several approaches to combat.  The voice acting is good.  The controls get a bit clunky no matter what version you have, but it's a small flaw in a large gem.  If you can get it on sale, great, or you can pay the cheaper price for the older version as it is the same game.Bottom Line: At full price, you should probably get Fable: The Lost Chapters, but this is still worth it even paying full price, as it stands on its own.  Get it on sale for the mod support and updated graphics, and support these types of projects!			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed Fable when it first debuted on the original Xbox. Gameplay feels somewhat outdated although it still fits with the game. Overall feel of the game is humorous and it never really takes itself too seriously. The updated graphics are a HUGE welcome, although nothing else has really changed (for better or worse). If you missed it then, now is a great time to try it out. If you had already played it and can still remember the game you may want to skip as nothing else has really changed. I didn't remember it at all and it felt like a new game, for that reason I would recommend this game to both new and previous players.			"

												Loved the original on PC. Enjoy the anniversary edition but agree with many reviewers that the gameplay just seems dated. My only major gripe is that the audio in the game is super glitchy and doesn't work well with surround sound.			"

												After Finally getting this classic Gem on the winter sale it brought me back to the good old day's when i was playing this on my original xbox but things have definitly changed and in a very good way this game looks great Lion Head really did a great job remastering this game i would say the only down side is that it felt better playing with a controller and i'm the kind of guy who likes to play his RPGs with a keyboard and mouse but still i would recommend this game to either newcomers to the franchise and for the people who want that nostalgia feeling			"

												Great Game, Great Franchise, Great reboot.Thoroughly recommend.Gameplay is a little un-polished but it is overall a fantastic game with a fantastic plot and a lot of terrific quirks, combat is fun, camera is a little odd and jittery.Microsoft if you love money so much why haven't you ported Fable 2 yet?

												For those that have played Fable this is yet another great PC port. I strongly recommend having a Xinput compatible controller. There are a couple of bugs but nothing that came close to ruining this game or annoying me. I think the majority of the negative reviews are coming from people who tried playing this game on keyboard and mouse.If you have played Fable and enjoyed it this is a must!

												One of my favorite games of all time. Fable Anniversary is the complete package (Fable:The Lost Chapeters HD Edition basicly). It has controller suport with the old control scheme for xbox. A lot of patches have been released and keep being released to help this game run super smooth at even the highest settings in the most intense scenes. The modding comunity is small sadly, and only has a few mods on the nexus that can extend your stay in Albion. The inside achevments are worth checking out too, and with multiple save slots per hero and extra lore friendly DLC that adds a lot of in game content to all the merchants, this game is definitly worth buying for fans of the series. TL:DR Its Fable:The Lost Chapters but with HD visiuals/effects, up to date support and more content.(if you buy the DLC)			"

												Fable is what I would call a fantasy classic: You, the protagonist, suffer hardship at a young age, and then learn the skills required to be a Hero (quite literally) and save the world. I have always loved the combat system of Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters. It feels smooth, and is easy to master. Enemies are always going to be challenging and willing to punish you if you let your guard down. The Fable Series has long been one of my favorite, and I love this remake.However, there are a few flaws to this. Firstly (and the biggest problem) is the menu. Occasionally the menu will glitch out and either randomly start scrolling through whatever screen you are on, or it will try to prevent you from scrolling through it, constantly dragging your selector (is that even the term?) back to the top of the menu. The second flaw to Fable: Anniversary is the colors. The origional Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters were these brightly colored places that captured your imagination. Now, the world feels dull and somewhat bland. However, the balance of the coloring it still good, and you won't be bored looking at the world after an hour.That all being said, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone, both those who have played the series since the first installments, and new players who found a sale going on.

Pros:-Solid remake of the original with updated graphics-Fun, whimsical atmosphere-Variety of weapons and armor sets to suit your character-Great amount of content-Fantastic story-Morality system that reflects your choices well-Modding supportCons:-No additional content in the remake-DLCs are overpriced and only offer armor and weapons-Very occasional graphics issues (her eyeball was clipping through the side of her head!)-Same old camera angle/clunky control frustrations-Fable: The Lost Chapters is available for $9.99 and is the exact same game, minus the graphics upgrade and mod supportOverall: This is the original Fable game.  If you haven't played it, it's fantastic, and worth the price.  Whimsical humor and deep gameplay make it a fun RPG.  Choices matter and change the way the world reacts to you.  There are several approaches to combat.  The voice acting is good.  The controls get a bit clunky no matter what version you have, but it's a small flaw in a large gem.  If you can get it on sale, great, or you can pay the cheaper price for the older version as it is the same game.Bottom Line: At full price, you should probably get Fable: The Lost Chapters, but this is still worth it even paying full price, as it stands on its own.  Get it on sale for the mod support and updated graphics, and support these types of projects!			"

												I was about 3 hours into the game as a first time Fable player. I wanted to see what the fuss was about, so I got the Anniversary Edition on Steam. Escorted some merchants, killed a cave troll and got rid of a red barrier blocking the way forward. Went to a previous map (the camp) to pick up the merchants. For some reason the red barrier was back, but the troll is still dead so there's no way to progress. The merchants even have a dialogue about that ""rumbling noise"" from a non-existent troll. I'm not about to waste my time back-tracking and re-doing a quest for a game that has had over a decade to have its bugs fixed. Wasted money, and lots of frustration trying this and that and checking Google for help. Fable may have been a cool franchise, and I wouldn't have minded giving it a shot, but I'm not about to wrestle with significant bugs from decades past.			"

												This is a great game to just relax to, I've seen people complaining about certain spells making it easy for the harder modes, if you don't want easy mode don't use those abilities simple, those abilities only really exist for those who really can't take the hits, and who are having problems finishing the game. If you are finding it to easy still all you have to do is just unequip your best gear. The game plays great with simple dynamics, which are easy to learn and pretty simple to master. Players used to Dark Souls and watching for certain animations, will find that for the most part you can still do that if you watch the enemies carefully (enemies will sometimes swarm you, and unlike some games won't take turns on you) You can always try and take out the ranged/summoners first, while dealing with some not all of the adds which they create.I enjoy playing this game, it's great for those who tend to get upset and angry and break stuff, this is one game where you probably won't really do that.

												The original game released some years ago so just because it is in HD does not mean it is better in the gameplay department. Comparing Fable Anniversary to Fable 3 is not a fair comparison, the two games are years apart both in graphics and gameplay.  I personally loved the original game for how it felt to play not for how the ""details"" where and the dev team did a great job recreating the feelings of this Anniversary game in HD. So if you liked the feeling of the good old Fable and dont mind playing it again but in HD then this game is a good recommendation for you.			"

I have been a fan of the Fable series since Fable came out on the original xbox. I have played every Fable that has come out other than Fable: The Journey so I think that it is okay for me to say that this is the best one yet and is wonderful edition to my Fable Collection on both my xbox and PC. This game has wonderfully remastered visuals and audio that will take your breath away when thinking about the first Fable in comparison. I spent a lot of time in the Beta for this game playing for countless hours because I could not get enough of it.

The better graphics and controller support are fantastic, seeing how I played this gem on my old xbox growing up. Although the new reskins are quite bad on the main characters. Weird mishapen people giving off way more eye contact than nesscary. The absoulute best one I found was on Thunder, a large black hero. He, no joke, looks like a balck guy in blackface. Briar rose, a sexy nerd like hero in the original, killed my boner faster than the speed of light in the remastered. All-in-all, if you LOVE fable or somehow missed playing the original give this game a try, but only on sale. $35 is an outrageous price for a 10 yo game. I purchased this on the winter steam sale.  If you look at my hours played in this review for length im about 2/3ish into the game.			"

												I have played and modded the original Fable, and I have to say that I love this HD remake. And now, that Lionhead allows us to mod the game with the Modding DLC, it's great! My review point to point:- Graphics. It's an HD remake of the original Fable, the graphics are really good, love that ""Depth of Field"" we have, the lighting, great too. You just have to see the images of the game :P Textures are great, maybe with mods they can even get better, same with the models. Some models have changed, and they got better! The animations, same animations as the original Fable, so... nostalgia :') Great effects too.- Gameplay. It's like the original Fable. I don't really like the movement of the camera, but it's still good.- Sound. Like I said with the animations, nostalgia when hearing the Fable music. The game has also the previous voice actors than in original Fable, and there is some characters that have a great voice acting! Also, the sound with the effects, really good.- DLCs, okay, some of them cost money and only add armours and weapons (which look great!), but for me, the good point is the Modding DLC. I remember modding the original Fable, and get desesperated because the tools (made from the Fable modding community) crashed, or the game crashed and you had to reinstall the game or restore it with a backup... Now that we have these tools, we can mod the game. Still waiting for a Steam Workshop for Fable though :)I think I haven't forget anything :S.In conclusion, Fable Anniversary is a really good game, that have great graphics for the game it is and respects the original Fable things. Great game!			"

												Fable was always a treasured memory for me. So when I heard tell of a remake in the works I quickly pre-ordered with all the DLC (like the massive nostalgia-sucker I am).If you're expecting all-new quests and gameplay mechanics, look elsewhere. This is a faithful remake with beautifully tacky voice acting and broken economies aplenty. You can do all the things you used to do, fight all the battles you used to fight and listen to people call you chickenchaser in just the same tone they used to (""do you chase chickens?""), but now it's actually making use of the full-HD monitor you have sitting on your desk. This was simply a nostalgia trip for me, and that was all I ever expected.The heroic mode is hard, and that's what was always missing from the original TLC. Real challenge has been added and that is welcome. The new costumes and weapons are fun, tiered well and implemented just fine.Now the bad:Most noticible for me were the incredibly jerky animations of the chests opening (of all things) and the entirely unintuitive menu system. The old menus were quick to navigate, efficient and fit the character of the game nicely. The newest ones are clunky, space-wasting and actually hard to navigate (even with the added mouse support!). I dreaded upgrading my character for fear of navigating the quagmire of poor design decisions and rudimentary grasps of UI design.Overall this was fun to play, particularly through rose-tinted glasses. And despite the menu issues, it still feels untimately like Fable. Maybe not worth £27+DLC, but certainly a good one to get on sale!			"

												This is a fantastic remake of a classic game, worthy of anyone's Steam library!Having only played the original Fable incredibly briefly at a friend's when it was first released, I would still consider myself new to the Fable series.  It has always been one of those games that I've meant to play, but when I first heard about the HD remake, it seemed like the perfect time to actually do so.  First off, the game looks lovely - you only have to compare the visuals from the 2004 release to those in Fable Anniversary to see just how much of an improvement this release offers.  It really brings the game to a standard where you can play it today and it doesn't feel dated, and all without losing the original charm and style of the 2004 game.As a new player, I've been really enjoying Fable Anniversary - the game feels open enough to give a sense of exploration (the side quests, mini games etc.) but has an interesting and engaging primary quest that keeps you moving forward.  RPG levelling is there and, whilst it might not be as complex as some RPG games these days, I like that I don't have to spend hours in the menus worrying about to which of the tens of attributes I should be allocating my experience!  It's a great adventure game, and one that you can just pick up and enjoy when the mood takes you.  For those who loved the original, I think you'll enjoy rediscovering a game that you played perhaps ten years ago in beautiful HD (or 4K if you're lucky enough to be an early adopter!).  Get it!			"

												Few hours in, and looking at reviews here it looks like I'm the only one who wasn't severely disappointed.  Yeah, that first trailer with a bunch of people typing chat messages to one another did little to sell this one.  Yeah, the graphics are a lot less improved than I had believed.  Yeah, I preordered this largely because I thought I was getting some one-time shot at bonus content that you couldn't buy as a $5 DLC.  Okay, a little let-down, but it's not a terrible remake so far.  Some of the characters faces have gotten uglier than the first Fable tho.  Was that intentional?  I really expected Briar Rose to be more, um, appealing, given her self-absorbed attitude, and Mace to look less like he's lost some fights with his food processor.Thus far I have played this with a controller, and have had no crashes, no issues, no glitching.  Not even the ability to buy a crapton of apples and buy/sell them for infinity money and archery exp.  Well, I guess they did fix some things, even if they kept some dumb game mechanics like having to murder people to buy their houses.  ""Sorry I had to immolate you with magical fire so I could buy your house, but Bowerstone doesn't allow weapons, y'know...  Hey, I'll use your future rent monies to buy lots of tofu and it'll all be okay!""  Actually, now that I've played a bit more, it turns out you can still amass a small fortune by selling and rebuying 50 health potions.  It's a dumb mechanic, but it does remove any tedium from earning money.  And pretty much any meaningful value to the stealing skill.I have not yet dived in with my trusty mouse and keyboard, but so far so good.  Their latest patch, while fraught with complaints about the size, does seem to address issues I've seen reviews complaining about, like keyboard and mouse remapping.  What's not to love about a developer supporting their game?  Bottom line: maybe not enough improvements to make this worth all the hype (and price tag).  People can complain about how they loved some of the mechanics of 2 and 3, but if you absolutely have to play a female, go play the game that allows it.  Fable was a great game, and this seems to be at least as good, if only ever so slightly improved in graphics.			"

												A blast from the past! It really does look much better (HD) but was moderately hardware demanding on my dual core and caused minor heat lag at times. The Lost Chapters content was refreshing to experience and I truly enjoyed playing through the original ""Fable"" content again. For 30 bucks I feel like I got my money's worth and look forward to playing this again in the future. With a little beefier gaming system of course.			"

												What's amazing to me is the amount of people complaining about the game so far for reasons I don't see as legitimate. A legitimate complaint would be why they're charging 34.99 for this, when Fable TLC is only 9.99. An illegitimate complaint would be all the ones I see about the controls.PC Master Race people, this is a console game that was ported to PC. And there is absolutely no reason they should have to go the extra mile to appease you. The mouse and keyboard were not designed for gaming, a 360 controller was. And as such the keyboard and mouse will ALWAYS be inferior for controls. Unless the game was designed for PC first, which Fable Anniversary was not. Accept that the PC has flaws when it comes to gaming and lower your impossible standards and you'll all enjoy games a lot more. And if you can't handle the fact that your chosen method of playing games is flawed then it is no one's fault but your own. Sorry to burst your little bubbles but PC gaming isn't as perfect as you all like to pretend it is. Especially when the game in question is a port from console.And I know what you're gonna say. ""The game should have been designed for PC first"" Well it wasn't. And no amount of whining (And that is what you're doing, whining, because you're not getting everything 100% your way) is going to change that. And you have no right to criticize the developers for putting their game wherever they like. Because it's their game.Sure, the menu system sucks with a mouse and keyboard, but it wasn't designed to be used by those. And I imagine the developers have better things to do then tool around with this game for the 3rd time just to make a couple of idiots happy.If you can look past the assinine control scheme (Like me, because Fable is really damn good) or have a controller to play with (If the game supports it), I think you'll have a good time with this, it's just Fable TLC with an new coat of paint, and that's all it was ever meant to be.

I'm giving this a thumbs up because i'm happy to play with a controller for now and the bugs are mostly minor, although for what they're selling it at the price is a bit steep for such a buggy game.

There is no mouse support in the menues, the menu system itsel was designed by chtonic monsters with multiple tentacles. The keys aren't rebindable. Just get Fable: the Lost Chapters and play it. You'll have a much more pleasant experience.			"

												Lionhead studios has proven time and time again they don't give a ♥♥♥♥ anymore.  This ""remastered"" version of the original fable oozes laziness to the maximum level. Look at this game. It was released in 2014. IN UNREAL ENGINE. Now it doesn't bother me that much that the game doesn't look as good as it should, or even that they are charging 30$ for a slightly improved version of an 11 year old game. The absolute worst part is that they tried so little to change anything other than the environments. If you've ever played the original version, go and cast a spell in anniversary and tell me there is the same or more amount of glow and particle effects. There are even less particle effects in this version! Why you ask? because they don't give a ♥♥♥♥. And of course Lionhead's signiture mechanic a downgrade to the inventory screen yaay! Oh and everyone's face looks like they've been run over by a truck. With all that, the game still looks arguably better than the original, so if you don't already have the original there's no reason not to pick it up, it's still a great RPG. but honestly this game is only worth 5-10$. Don't buy at full price. Wait for a sale, or get it on♥♥♥♥♥			"

There's a lot of people complaining about it, some of them do have a point and I accept their opinions, but if you want to get this game, don't look at those raging kids who can only complain - they're always out there, first they want it on PC and they whine, and when it comes out on PC - they whine again.

												My first Fable experience was Fable III, on an x-box loaned to me by my son when I blew my PC up early this year. I had all his games to chose from, but only played that :)I pre-ordered this for my son and I, knowing he was a major Fable fan and I kinda liked it :) I read the reviews of others waiting for the download, and was a touch concerned. Nonetheless, I fired it up and got stuck in. My son was watching, telling me how much better everything looked. I experienced no lag apart from during dialogues, the ""A"" button doesn't always register. I've only played for 3 hours so far but it looks delightful. Maybe it doesn't have the famous cast of voice actors that it's sequels had, and the mix of accents were a bit dubious to say the least, but that can be forgiven.The most welcome feature for me is the x-box controller support. I have MS (multiple sclerosis) so KB/Mouse is impossible - my left hand only has a working thumb and forefinger. Even with the controller I have to limit my session times - a 3 hour session was way too long but I was in da zone :)I'm loving Fable Anniversary so far.			"

												This game holds your hand so hard, it threatens to break your fingers.Want the achievement for seeing the whole world without any actual work? Eat pies 'til you get fat! Several achievements make the game almost not even require another playthrough (I've beaten my old physical copy of The Lost Chapters more times than I care to admit, and it was a blast each time), which really tells you something about ol' Lionhead Studios (RIP and also LOL). The HD textures make everyone just as ♥♥♥♥-ugly as the original game, but now in HD, so you can look into their cold, staring, dead eyes as their mouths move in the same ventriloquist-dummy fashion as they do the exact same ten or so animations as they did about twelve years ago. The menus are a god-awful chore to navigate, and only for the sake of looking nice and being charming and rustic and cute and *vomits*.The combat is controller-snappingly frustrating (USE. A. CONTROLLER.), as enemies have finally discovered how to block, and also, how to abuse blocking completely until combat isn't even fun anymore.The fixed the Silver Key glitch in Darkwood. The ONLY thing they fixed, and it's the ONE thing I wanted to STAY broken.Also, the kid Hero looks like he is WAY too high to go get a birthday present for his sister.5/101 point for the music still being good.1 point for it still kinda being The Lost Chapters deep down.3 points because it isn't Fable III.tl;dr♥♥♥♥ this game, buy the cheaper/better/original version; and ♥♥♥♥ you, Peter Molynyucknyucknyucks, if you had just learned how to make a good game, you'd still have a ♥♥♥♥ing studio.

												Fable Anniversary, Although i dont agree with the character models, you get over that. I honestly like the look of the characters in the original alot more the resonibly up to date graphics and amazing story line is just to good to give up. Although one thing i really always wanted is to have my character have its own name xD. for instance. ""Avalon, there is a quest card waiting for you"". i know that theoretically impractical but it still would be awesome. I just finished this game start to finish no breaks and all i could think of is the lovely storyline throughout the game. and how the hell was i able to beat this when it first came out xD. Anyway. Thanks lionhead for letting me re-live my childhood favorite game on my Monster Pc :). Pc Gamers Waited and we got Given! :)			"

												Fable anniversary is a brilliant compromise between great gameplay of the original and hd graphics tweeks. I personally think they have done a great job of updating the graphics they may not be the best graphics compared to other rpgs but they have kept the fun factor by not fully upgrading certain aspects. I personally think unless your a hardcore fable fan its not worth the money to buy this version and to just buy the lost chapters, they have allowed modding support to this version so im sure it will be worth the money when the game has been out a few weeks/months for the mods :-). The only rant i have so far and i know its early days yet but the game has crashed on me and has stutterd a few times hopefully this can be fixed by a patch but other than that a great choise for hardcore fable fans.

												Those of us that were old enough to play Fable: The Lost Chapter when it first came out on PC should be feeling a sense of serious deja vu, and not just because this is a remaster. Just like the original Fable, Lionhead hyped this game as much as they possibly could. At least this time, they didn't make tons of outlandish promises they couldn't keep. Instead they promised a remastering of on of their best games, and instead it's just sort of...updated a bit. Now, I can't play this game on anything but its lowest settings because I am poor, but the immediate reaction I had when starting the game was, ""What's wrong with the controls?"" And then I was immediately repulsed upon seeing the face of the hero as a child. In fact, the entire population of that beginning section has some serious facial issues that made me worry about the game. With the ugly models and the wonky controls, the first half hour isn't very enjoyable. Luckily, as you adapt to the new controls (or get a computer controller) and grow up, the character models settle into their skeletons and by the time you graduate from the guild, the game begins to show its true colors. While probably not deserving of the hype it got, neither does it deserve the immediate bashing. Are there problems? Yes, but the original Fable: The Lost Chapters on PC had plenty of problems itself and unlike the original, this one is going to have some modding support and possibly patching. Even on its lowest setting, post Guild Graduation, this game is a beautiful reconstruction of one of the greatest examples of RPGs ever released. Just calm down, keep an open mind, and enjoy it for what it is, Fable's Anniversary.			"

												As an RPG lover who has never played a Fable game before (because I only had Playstation), hates playing PC games without a controller so I spent $40 on an Xbox 360 controller and waited 3 weeks for Fable Anniversary's PC release, I am pretty satisfied so far. I recognize that the gameplay could be smoother but it's not as terrible as I expected after reading some reviews by long-time Fable players and gaming experts.  The game is definitely playable, just not super smooth when the hero is running, etc. It took me a while to figure out the D-pad items/expressions feature, so that lack of instruction gets a thumbs down (I still don't know why my assigned expressions only appear on the D-pad screen icon when I hold Right Trigger and why certain expressions/items get auto-assigned to the regular D-pad screen icon and why I can't change *those*).I also think there should have been an explanation of the save system at the beginning of the game (or anytime!). I think I'm about to graduate from the Heroes Guild & hopefully I can save anytime after that. Despite the couple annoyances, so far this game has lived up to my expectations. I was hoping for a game like this that would give me future nostalgia, like I have for the old days of playing the Zelda and Final Fantasy series. I'm sure they'll release some patches to improve the framerate but I'm going to continue playing in the meantime; I think it's a cool game and so far, I'm hooked!			"

												Fable Anniversary is a great game!  That said, it is not perfect.  Overall Score: 9/10  My simple review breakdown follows:Pros: - Just like you remember the original Fable, except with better graphics.- One of the greatest RPGs of all time.- Steam achivements!  - Modding!- Classic gameplay.Cons:- Could have had spent more time redoing character motions and reworked their physics engine to make the game more fluid.- I hate to be cliche, but classic gameplay.  While it is a pro, it is also a con, because RPGs as well as all other games, have evolved.  I feel like this should have not just had new graphics slapped on.- No add in of previous Fable advances implemented into the Anniversary Edition?!  This is definitely my biggest pet peeve.  Lionhead introduced us to a whole new realm of customization of our character in Fable 2 and 3, and here we are, back at square one again without the ability to simply have different color hair.  It is my hopes the modding community comes up with a way to fix this.Overall, great game!  Still worth every penny!  Pick it up!!!			"

												Amazing. Would definitely play with a controller though, so plug your xbox or ps3/4 controller in and play with that, it's much easier than using current mouse/keyboard controls. Fable games controls never translated that well on pc. Anyway, it's amazing. So much nostalgia playing this, and it's been so long that a lot of it seems new. I played it long before any of the lost chapter stuff, so after the standard story all this is new to me and I love it so far. Would definitely get it.			"

												Alright, For those of you who are looking to buy Fable Anniversary because you LOVE Fable 1 and 2 or you are just looking for a new game to play, Dont look at the negative comments for this game because all of them are overlooking what is bad with that game instead of giving it a fair analysis, So here is my take for you guys!Lets start with the bads: YES! The game has some graphical issues, Initially the games motion blur on camera movement is horrble, But you can turn it off, And the colour of the game is too 'dark'. But again you can turn this off, I'll leave a ""How To"" at the bottom for you if you are interested The game lags or freezes alot and it drive people insane, But hey guys, Guess what, You can fix that too! jusy Verify the Integrity of the Game Cashe before you play it, It takes a few minutes, But its way worth it! No mouse to operate menus, Yeah thats a bad thing I guess for a PC Port, But its really not ♥♥♥♥ing hard to use Insert, Home, Del and End to scroll through a menu, Is it?Id say thats all for the bad besides just a few little things like hit boxes on the terrain being a little too large or something silly like that. So onto the good things! In all this  game is FANTASTIC and I love the Fable franchise, I even like the shocking abomination that is Fable 3, But this game is great Once you tweak a few things here and there the game runs smooth and you can play to your hearts content Hit up the graphic fix by following the section below and the game is beautiful, Its bright and every works as it should!There I'll leave it on a 3 to 3 basis, Because it really isnt a big deal that the game is a little unpolished, It has the same issues as the original from 10 years ago, It just looks a bit prettier, Thats all, Personally, I think they shouldnt have dont Anniverasy and just let Fable: The Lost Chapters on here and Fable 2 and 3, But hey, This is great and once you get used to the quirks of it, Its great, Ive played for 20+ hours now or something and I am loving it! Hope this helps And that it isnt too muhch text for my fair opinion and non pompus accusation! Graphic Fix  Go to: Documents\My Games\UnrealEngine3\WellingtonGame\Config Then open WellingtonSystemSettings with Notepad Then change AllowRadialBlur to false and change DepthOfField to false too Then TADA, Game looks fine, Happy Adventuring!

But I'm glad they left everything as it was.Because Fable was a great game for beeing... uhm... itself xDIf they'd changed anything it would't be that Fable anymore.It is the game I loved. The game I played many times. The game I will ever love.And now it also looks more modern. Yeah, yeah... it doesn't look better than Crysis or anything. (blah blah blah)But it looks fableish way better than the original. And finaly the weather effects are working on modern systems :DSo yeah... if you love Fable. If you like to see this great game in great graphics.Then this is for you. Buy it! (Or wait for winter sale ;D )10/10 - Would kick a chicken again!			"

Also the camera is verry shaky when running around the map, I dont think it was designed for mouse control.  My suggestion is, if your like me and just wanted to revisit this amazing game.  Dust off that old XBox and buy it used from gamestop.  its just so wonky feeling it realy makes it hard to get into thinking about dealing with the controls and camera for an extended period of time.

												Ignore those tipping their fedoras in disgust. As you'd expect, the game (almost completely) replicates the TLC version of the game with slightly better graphics. Those complaining about lag/frame-rate problems must have some sort of hardware issue (most likely down to their gfx). There are plenty of reviews on websites such as IGN and YouTube and I'm sure that most people should have an idea what they're actually paying for. The game has only just been released and modding has yet to achieve one of the main reasons why you have probably purchased this on Steam, rather than a console (that is if you own one). Whether there will be any new (official) DLC that was not in TLC, is completely a mystery, although one thing is almost certain.  Modders will most likely do so.If there is one thing I would have to criticise about the game, it would be how easy it is to exploit stores to make money. If I had realised, I would've chosen to play at the Heroic difficulty from the start, rather than do a run-through on the original difficulty.All-in-all, I've most definitely enjoyed the game so far. It is what it is. I highly recommend using a controller (preferrably a Microsoft Xbox pad) due to some apparant issues there may currently be with using a mouse/keyboard. The port isn't as 'horrendous' as people make it out to be, although saying that, it could have most definitely have been better.To round-off this review, I'd like to say that if you are curious about buying the game, please do check out reviews/videos online rather than just insta-buying the game and then complaining because 'you thought they'd have improved it more'. 7/10			"

												I can't say I won't recommend this game since overall the game is enjoyable if you don't encounter any freeze or bug.There is a lot of complaining so far and I support almost all of them still the game is the same as Fable:TLC and other than the crappy menu and lack of keyborad/mouse option, the control inside the game are the same they were and if you use a controller you won't notice it. Graphically the game got a decent update but still could have been better. The visual might be good on the xbox 360 but on pc it suffer for a 2014 remake. The texture need better resolution and too much bluriness not sharp enough. During the playthrough I have encounter invisible wall over a little rock in the middle of the road when normally you could pass over it. The character model are a bit strange espacially the face.The game could have been way better if it wasnt only visual remake of the original. They should have corrected the bugs and even mix a bit of fable 2/3 in it to give it more a feel of a new game. Even if I will pass lot of time in this game like I once did in fable:tlc, it will need some fix and some update texture to give it a better feel. Maybe the modding community will make it honor. "

												If you like chasing chickens and enjoy murdering villagers while chasing chickens, you'll love this game.Short review:Game has flaws. Keyboard and mouse controls work as well as Dark Souls. Graphic options are limited. Sound works. May crash, may not. May also stutter with certain hardware. Unreal game so you can tweak anything.There are certain flaws that a lot of people pointed out already but it's not that bad, A few people like myself can play this game no problem. I play with a controller so the mouse and keyboard controls don't bother me as much. I bought this game knowing it would be a console port so keep that in mind if you're interested. The game runs smoothly and I've only had it crash every few hours. Hopefully they'll fix that soon but the game saves frequently so it's not enough to cause me much anger.If you're not a fan of the Anniversary remake you probably won't like this either. The PC port is the 360 version with tacked on mouse and keyboard controls. It feels a lot like Dark Souls. It's rough around the edges but a good game if you play under optimal conditions(using a controller for ex.). Don't expact anything but a console port though and you'll find some enjoyment with this version. Keep in mind there is the original Fable on Steam too if that's what you want but it lacks controller support and that's actually one of the reasons I bought the Anniversary version.I'd recommend this to anyone who's ok with console ports, if you're not don't buy this game. Also it helps if you're a fan of the Anniversary remake because you know.. if you're not then why are you here?			"

												As a huge Fable and Fable TLC fan, this is a great additition to the collection.  I had not yet played the PS3 or 360 version so I can't comment on the increase of quality (if any) over those versions.  What I can say is that I am thoroughly enjoying a re-textured HD Albion from the best title in the series.  I have yet to try the hardcore mode, but if you are looking for a Darksouls experience then move on.  Fable's charm lies in the characters, environments and quarky comedy that the game does so well.  Yes it is easy, but it is relaxing, fun, and thoroughly enjoyable.  If only they woud make a Fable 4 as a prequel to this game (during the age of dragons maybe?) with the same style and feel that made this game great.HUGE NOTE* Play it with a gamepad.  As a PC purist, I still have my wired 360 controller for occasions like this and the game really shines when it is used (can't wait for the steam gamepad!).  I could see how the menu system would be clunky with M&K.			"

												Don't buy this game if you do not have a controller to play it with I guess, apparently it's unbearable without one.However if you do have a controller, than this game is worth getting. Playing with my controller, I have had absolutely no problems whatsoever with this game. I've played all the way through it with not a single drop of rain on my sunny experience. It's even got little bonuses that weren't in the original game that I won't spoil. But it is nice to see additions as well as improvements that bring more adventure to an already really great game.So in conclusion; no controller? Don't buy unless they straighten it out for mouse and keyboard, (but honestly what did you expect?

												Just like the old Fable we know and love Fable Anniversary is a better looking one, though some faces do look a bit off when you zoom in.  The menu gets some time to get used to but i would say its much easier to transverse with a controller (as it is a port from the xbone it is more bias to the controller).The dlc was a bit cheeky but as a fable fan boy i got it, and i had to read around to find out that the weapons and armor were added to shops al around Albion. the weapons aren't game breaking which i like as it doesn't give that pay to win feel, the many sets of armor ( some of which have set weapons ) do look good some are on the better end but not by too much. All of which have their own bio and back story. As i play fable with a 360 controller I've had no problems with the menus, and I've yet to find any game breaking or crashing bugs. All in all that great old fable feel with a new look.			"

												TL;DR: Get it on sale if you haven't played Fable, or if you want graphical pretties. Keyboard+mouse be dun goofed apparently. ------------------------------------I was an avid fan of the original Fable and Fable TLC, and the remastered edition doesn't fail to disappoint either.PROS: - WIDESCREEN SUPPORT AW YISS. Getting the original to work in widescreen wasn't terribly hard, but it was still hackish and bugged at some critical moments. - Very nice graphics, they've predominately kept to the core of the graphical characteristics of the Fable series, but it's amazing what a fresh coat of paint (proverbially speaking) can do with a game. Fable has definitely aged well. - Modding support? I'll be curious to see where this goes, and from what I've read, we may end up having Fable Anniversary coming to the Steam Workshop. Can't imagine it'd be like a Skyrim, though.CONS: - No Borderless Window nor scaleable UI. Just a bit of a bummer that I can't have the window maximised since it then causes letterboxing and the like, and considering this is a UE3 game, I'm surprised that we don't even have a borderless window option, since I often alt-tab between windows and would rather have the game appear full screen. I've tried tools to force the borderless window but it doesn't work. - Some graphical glitches exist where objects won't receive light from nearby light sources, kinda kills immersion a bit but it's not a deal breaker by any means.ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT: - Mainly to do with the overall environmental lighting, particularly outdoors, but we could benefit from variations in luminosity, and actually be able to use the lantern at night, right now it just seems pointless to have the lantern since everything is so well lit. - Some head models can do with some improving too, the child Hero looks like he hasn't slept for a week, and Maze does not look like Maze at all, his characteristic stern look got ruined by an elongated, pudgy, wrinkly baby face with tattoos. |:I can't speak for the copious amounts of people that have whinged relentlessly about the whole keyboard + mouse thing, I do remember playing Fable TLC with a keyboard and mouse and it was working quite fine, though since then I've been playing games with a 360 controller, and naturally given Fable Anniversary was originally made for the 360, it still feels pretty good to play with. I did try playing with the keyboard+mouse combo, but quickly switched back to the controller. :PHaven't played through Heroic yet, but that'll be the next step.			"

												The best source of chicken chasing in videogame history. Fable Anniversary brings you back into the world of Albion that we visited so long ago. A genre defining title that created a perfect balance of fantasy rpg elements and simplicity. While the game might seem simplistic in respect to a traditional rpg or the story cliched you will find yourself coming back for more again and again. The anniversary edition adds many great features besides its remaster, including easter eggs and small content additions mainly aimed at the original players, as well as mod support. While the game launched with some major issues, those were fixed relatively quickly and I would highly recommend this over ""The Lost Chapters"", unless of course you're a big fan and played both that version and continued to replay it with the anniversary edition. 8/10.

I am VERY OCD about what I put on my computer my drivers are all up to date, no viruses, no crap running in the background, win7, 16g ram, quad core 3.8ghz AMD, GTX 480 runs the game flawlessly at about 60fps so IDK whats going on here. its a main quest so its literally a game breaking bug. sad I have to wait for my taxes to upgrade my machine to play this old game..

												A dissapointing remake that lacks any true polish. All that has been done, is a graphical rework. And even then, with the new graphics, almost every model constantly has clipping issues, due to the fact that they did not stick to the original size of the old models, and simply stuck the new fangled graphics on the old ones.If you want an immersive, complete experience, at a cheaper price, stick with TLC. If you want something that looks pretty, but you immediatly see behind the curtain the moment you have the cutscene with you and your father, get the Anniversary package.Shame on you Lionhead.

												Judging by what it was, and not what people wanted it to be, the original Fable the Lost Chapters was excellent, and is one of the most defining games of that generation.Fable Anniversary retians everything you loved about the original; the humor, the combat and spells, the alignment system, and all those goofy little quests and tasks. But the video quality is updated massively; the models are much better, and the textures really pop as opposed to the original. The draw distance is greatly improved, allowing you to see your enemies much farther away now too, which can be helpful. Also the audio is improved too, but its hardly noticable honestly, given that so much of your attention is usally focused on the game itself.Achievments now come with it too, giving incentive to finish all those things you never did in the original, or just giving you a reason to finish them all over again. Inluded in those is one for finishing the game on its newly implemented ""Heroic Mode,"" which among other things, removes exploits, makes enemies harder and removes resurrection phials, allowing for a much more difficult experience.The DLC for this game is nothing more than custume packs, which are fun to use, but a little pricy. Still, even these costume packs can add a little more to your experience without feeling out of place from the original, and can also result in hilarious screenshots.All in all, it's a fantastic way for fans of the original to experience it all over again, and for people who may have skipped it to reconsider and give it a go. It's by no means one of the best RPGs ever made, but its certainly unforgettable.			"

												I was suprised to see this game only has a ""Mixed"" rating on Steam, but after reading people's reviews about numerous technical issues I could understand their frustration. The game looks beautiful and is still just as fun as when I played it on the original XBox. A charming world, fun enemies to battle, loads of skills to choose from, secrets galore, a powerful variety of magic to fit any playstyle, morality choices, I could go on. Game lore isn't overwhelming, giving you just enough to immerse yourself in the world.This game set the standard for all future Fable games as well as being a shining example of how much fun single player action RPGs can be. At the time of playing I only notice minor sound bugs but nothing game breaking; thankfully some patches were released before my purchase.Treat yourself to this experience, you won't regret it.			"

												Pretty okay update of an older game. Always enjoyed the Fable series game.Some of the characters look a little goofy with the new graphics. Lots of NPCs appear to have eyes that point in slightly opposite directions, like they're all a bit wall-eyed now.Missing from the game is the Arena Exploit, which allowed you to save the game at the start of the arena, leave before the final round and reload your save and restart the arena with all the gold and XP you had earned from the first attempt. Great way to grind out XP and gold. Doesn't wreck the game or anything, since it's a single player game.9/10, still gonna play.			"

												Fable Anniversary is a great remake of an amazing classic.I also feel the huge ammount of complaints some people have been having with this game to be very negligable.Negligable Complaints: Art style, A lot of people were expecting a more realistic art style for the game instead of a slight cartoony/fantasy look. I feel the art style the devs used works VERY well with the game, and increases the ammount of charm the Fable games give, so far everything I have seen looks asthetically pleasing.Not RPG enough, If you have never played a Fable game, you MUST realize before playing that this game is NOTHING like an Elder scrolls, Dark souls, or Witcher game. Fable is VERY casual in comparison, and doesn't take itself nearly as seriously. Despite there also being a harder difficulty to choose from than normal, the game is still very much casual.Real Complaints:The AI, The AI of a lot of the NPC's in this game is very clunky, and a bit buggy especially when trying to get people to follow you. Bad cut scenes, During a lot of minor dialogue cut scenes, everything in the background seems to stop moving except for you, and the NPC you;re talikng to. This can lead to some very distracting, or awkward backgrounds with NPC's just frozen in the middle of an activity. Also the audio during chapter progression cutscenes is very low quality, and even crackles at times like the original game.The $35 asking price, $35 dollars is just way to much for ecentially upgraded visuals, and audio especially when the original, and its Lost Chapters DLC are available on Steam as well.Over all though this game is extremely fun and very replayableThe Achievments are also a nice bonus, especially since most of them leave you with two different methods to unlock it, so the path / play style you choose won't impact if you can earn the achievment or not.

												*IMPORTANT NOTICE MUST READ!*Please, do not listen to the lists of negative reviews!The heavy hitting issues have been resolved and the minor ones are being worked on, and for the product it's self...Fable is a very unique game and remains fun to this day (The original was released in 2004) This game is truly a landmark in the RPG genre, the mechanics and gameplay remains untouched by it's sequels despite being outdated per se I would reccomend this game to anyone.On to the new stuff, the improvments to the Graphics and Lighting are indeed incredible! This is the same great game that you should have played, it found small non-game breaking elements to add in; such as Fable II - III game pad layout designs some new gear (via DLC)But more importantly a new addition is mod support! If you are not familier with the term, the simple explination is more mods. Tools like this make it very easy for modders to create new models etc!If you are wondering why I did not mention the story, I think the story is ment to unfold as if it where new as the main goal to this game is to choose your path. (Dont worry, not at all complicated like Dead Rising etc.)10/10 - One of the greatest games of all time.			"

												The game's obvious aesthetic takes some getting used-to... especially since it doesn't follow the theme from the in-game stained-glass style paintings anymore... instead it's almost like the character models are based off of the ""Wacky-Waving-Inflatable Arm-flailing Tube-man""...... *sigh*..... That's about my only complaint honestly.If you've always wanted to play The Lost Chapters version but hated the ""gritty"" or ""old"" style look of the game - then this is for you! It plays faster, looks cleaner, and is every-bit the complete storyline plus moar!Side-note: I've found that if you decide to power-level your character prior even to the ""Orchard Farm"" quest - then you'll notice your character be this horrible-looking ""old man faced teenager"".... yeah... However, once you progress and ""grow-up"" in the storyline, your character's model will catch-up and things will start to be a little more anetomically correct.			"

												This game is getting thumbed down for more reason than it should. Many complaints about this game are so minor yet people let it ruin their experience just because they rage to rage. Pros: Just like the original except better graphics and the ability to mod. New items added and the chance to replay a great game with a revamped look.Cons: Mouse is usless and key set up is terrible beyond belief (this is being worked on). It isn't too hard or expensive to buy a controller. Gamestop sells them for 6-7 bucks used and you will use it more than just fable.If you write a review please write something that hasnt been written a thousand times before and not about sucky controls, we get it. My opinion 8.5/10 once the modding community grows this will be hell of a game dont let others spoil it.			"

												If you loved the magic from the first Fable you will LOVE this, I remember playing the original and always saying that this game would be perfect if I could wear Thunders outfit! Or Jacks robes! Well now that's possible and roaming through the game world is beautiful, Snowspire village they did an outstanding job its so gorgous. On the down side character animation can be a little clunky but I have faith that will be fixed. Plus steam workshop on the way....What more can you ask for? I say finally Lionhead has delivered.

												It all depends really. If you nitpick every little thing, then what game is ""recommended?"" Not, I'm not going to go to the extreme and say it's amazing or it's terrible. To me, it's neutral. Is it a good port? No. Is it ""terrible?"" Again, no. After the dissapointment of Microsoft allowing Dead Rising 3 to be ported to Steam and that being horrible, why was everyones expectations for this so high? With that said, I will point out some flaws about this. Key bindings are there, but not for every key, which people are overreacting about because the keys themselves are fine, except for the blocking, which is the mouse wheel, and that's a bit weird but when they're physique shield and flourishes, who needs to block or dodge? Are people complaining about it because they WANT it changed or because they CAN'T change it? The FXAA does make the game a bit blurry but from what I can tell, it wasn't THAT big of a deal but I can understand some annoyance out of it. The HD graphics are improved a lot since TLC (obviously) and I saw a Total Biscuit review saying something about a door's resolution being lower than everything else... Really? A door? If it was something majoy like the NPCs, or weapons that's fine. But a door? C'mon... No mouse control in menus, frustration is somewhat understandable, but to me it seems more or less people not wanting something changed a bit, pushing a key instead of a couple of mouse clicks, again, seems something stupid to argue about. Performance issues, only problem I've had is in the very beginning as a kid in Oakvale, everything else I get 45-60 FPS with dual Radeon 6770's. All that being said, the game is still as fun as TLC and you get better graphics and higher quality sound. If you're going to nitpick every little minor thing about this game it seems more like you're trying to criticize everything rather than play an old nostalgic game with bumped up graphics and sound. If you're really complaining about it because ""it's not worth the $35"" then wait till it goes on sale this winter, it's gonna happen.			"

												Sure, it's a port. It's buggy, it has shitall graphics settings, the menu's are ♥♥♥♥ing awful, and its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to navigate and there is nothing to tell you how to open your inventory anywhere. But you know what? I love it anyway. Fable: The Lost Chapters, was my favorite game as a kid, and when they announced this for PC, i was crazy happy. This game is awesome, and I enjoyed it immensely. Anyone who complains WAHHH IT HAS BAD SETTINGS WAHHH ITS A PORT, you should've known it would have been, and just enjoyed the game anyway.So yeah, buy at risk that it's difficult to get the hang of the menu, it has FPS drops and its a console port. But if you love Fable, the world of Albion and the humour, you can't go past this game :)			"

												Didn't know what to expect having never played a Fable game before, although I play a lot of RPGs and cRPGs. If you are expecting Skyrim, you'll be disappointed, this is not a game to sink time into for months, but if you just want a light adventure, this game is a 7/10 for me. Short and fun while it lasts. Alternatively, look at Kingdom of Amalur, which has a lot more depth/longevity.			"

												I don't know what major issues are being experienced but apparently from reading the reviews on this page there is a slue of them. I haven't had any problems with the menu's in game or movement and visually this game casts a shadow over the lost chapters and the xbox original. There was added content but nothing that really matters because this is a HD remake not a reimagining or a retelling, personally I think that it is unfair to demand even MORE of a dev after they've already ported it once and now again. The game includes mods support with the engine editor so any problems to be had are going to be fixed whether we like it or not which is far and beyond what a lot of other games on steam can boast about. I've only just started it up and can't seem to replicate the issues so take this review for what its worth. This game probably won't have a good mouse and keyboard support because it was never intended to be played on a pc without a controller, they aren't even that expensive. The issue in the end isn't the game its the coddling of the players that is absent that seems to upset people and that doesn't lend to fair judgement of the game. tl:dr - if you like fable / lost chapters, get it. it looks amazing it has all of the replayability and it has the editor. If your a bargin shopper christmas is coming and we all have wallets that will hurt afterward this should go on sale by then.			"

Posted: September 18, 2014
												Splitting this into 2 parts, Review of the game itself and then the enhancements.The actual Opinion is right at the bottom if you want to look and if you don't feel like reading through detail.The game sets you out as a little boy, who has his home town raided by bandits and then saved by a mage known as 'Maze', He then makes you join the Heroes guild, a small guild dedicated to raising people into heroes so they can help Albion, from there it's a very big adventure. Now first off, it's not Elder Scrolls big, there are certain things you can't do but can do, It's between massively open and limited, You can marry, have sex, Buy houses, kill townsfolk (Good luck fist fighting in Bowerstone), Open secret doorways to treasure, buy houses in the towns of people you kill, become incredibly evil or incredibly good (This affects your appearance massively, Evil causes you to lose hair, grow horns, create an evil aura about you and causes your hands and feet to become demonic, while being good causes you to emit a good aura about you, grow white hair and have a Halo above you), but you cannot customise appearance at the start (You can get a haircut, get a beard, tattoo's, become fat by eating too much, becoming good/evil, old, Muscly and scarred), you cannot create your own adventure, your name is always 'Hero' and titles you can buy, Not immersive that highly and do all that creating weapons (There is more but I didn't want to keep this going forever).Now is this like Skyrim? Certainly not, the only reason I compared them with openess because everyone recognises Skyrim as the big RPG. It's a medium sized fantasy RPG action game, most people would think that because it's a fantasy RPG action game, it's similar to Skyrim, however it has it's own unique style, instead of being an entire fantasy world populated with elves, orcs and all that, It's basically medieval britian with magic and monsters, Does this ruin the game? No, not at all, for the time it was a incredibly refreshing change from Orcs and Elf fantasies (Still is).The combat for this game is quite basic, You have heavy weapons, light weapons, Bows/Crossbows and magic, Basic combat stuff like Swing, Block and a heavy attack, Heavy Weapons are incredibly sluggish to use (Don't expect to use them right away until your Physique is high enough) while light weapons are quick (No Dual wielding), Bows can be used to engage fights from a distance at first so they come to you, however headshotting an enemy will do high damage and can instantly kill them if strong enough and magic is something you can use to get around enemies, slow time, do deadly AoE attacks or summon/turn enemies against them. Leveling in this game is hugely different, in fact, leveling doesn't exist, you get EXP drops from enemies you kill or quests you complete, and you spend them at the guild to upgrade your magic, your skills (Speed, accuracy and guile) or upgrade your power (Health, Physique and Strength), killing enemies without getting hit will give huge boosts to EXP drops so make sure to be quick on your feet. Now for Actual opinion, The game is quite a great game, despite the series never living up to it's expectations, it's still a great game and the beginning of a great adventure, the story does better than most RPGs and keeps you invested to the end at least, the world is quite a lovely place, the gameplay is basic but good enough to get through the game, the music is absolutely gorgeus and the setting is amazing. Easy 9/10 for me Now is the graphical enhancement worth it? It looks very beautiful compared to the old game, no edges seen, but it isn't exactly todays standards but still nice and it's definitely as I remember it, the only issue I had with this was the menus, some of the layouts weren't that great but the UI is definitely improved, The only issue I have with this compared to the old game was nagivating through the menus, it was a bit of a chore to do, but they seem like they will be fixing that eventually and they are planing to allow more mod making soon (Currently it's just small things).So I do think this game is worth it if you are an RPG fan, it does it's job of entertaining you from start to finish and does contain british humour every once and a while			"

												As a Fable veteran, I can honestly say that this game is great. It takes me back to the days where I was spellbound when it first came out.

A lot of achievements have two ways of getting them too which is nice.Overall, if you played this back in the day and you want an updated version, definitely get this. The combat isn't the best in the world at times but if they updated too much it would've been a different game. If you've new to the series, this is by far the best and is miles better than 3 (2 is pretty good, but is also Xbox 360 exclusive, which is a shame) so don't hesitate in getting it.

The DLC is not needed but it adds to the game.Only problem I have is the modding community is not at all working on mods for this HD remaster of gold			"

												I don't really want to rate this game negatively since I loved Fable 1 and was dying to play the game again with better graphics but unfortunately I had to quit the game after 10 minutes of playtime due to motion sickness (I play on a laptop with keyboard and mouse) and there weren't any options to adjust the camera speed or something.Thumbs up for the graphics and the game overall (at least Fable 1 was good, and this is basically the same game)Thumbs down for lack of camera adjustment possibilites. Motion sickness really is no fun at all :(			"

												Yes this game has it's problems with were some keys are placed, but this game is true to it's word. What I mean by that is that they didnt add new missions witch could have hurt the game. All they really did what re-hual the graphics and audio. The game play is fun and bring back old memories from my child hood though it does suffer from 10 to 15 second screen freezing every now and again. I can say I would recommend sence it's on sale as of the time that I wrote this review.  7/10 Because of a few bug that can be crippling.			"

												Putting this simply, Fable Anniversary is a remake of a game we all loved either from back in the day on the orginal Xbox or pc. Overall it's remembering great memories that will make you buy this game if you've played it before, and if you haven't, a great experience and fun game which at least for me, started the whole be good or be evil choices in rpg games			"

												Finally an HD remake of Fable with the lost chapters dlc, and with a little mod support. What can i say, i fell in love with this game on my old original xbox and the game really does stand the tests of time. Story is still fantastic, graphics are beautiful, gameplay of course is 1000x better then fable 3, which is the only other fable on pc (Please microsoft, put fable 2 on pc). Is it worth $34.99? No. I payed 27.99 on the pre game sale and that was decently fair. Honestly it should be $19.99 and I then I could fully recommend this game.			"

Hardcore mode is insane, and a real challenge, if you were able to fly through the original give it a bash. I highly recommend this game.			"

												Story is simple, kill your family to get uber weapons or work hard to do this not killing your family but killing lots of other things way. No matter what you do, the outcome is the same, you'll get to be the hero even if you have the horns or the angelic stuff hovering over your head. The game doesn't force you to do things even if the story is pretty linear. You can make the combat simple, by mashing buttons and slicing your enemies, or more complex with a little dash of magic. Seriously, spellcasting in this game is one of the best. Or you could just play the game for the nostalgia sake.			"

Posted: September 28, 2014
												This is my first in depth review of a Game here on Steam.I'll divide my review into the typical; Good, Bad, And Ugly.I hope you find my review helpful in more way that one.Good: Graphics overhaul;The graphics were improved drastically since the release of TLC. Lighting was improved, as well as minor details such as foliage, bumpmapping on armour and weapons. The character models recieved smoother animations, along with better voice recognition so the character mouths don't look so rigid or twitchy.  The lighting and shadows were also improved to give the overall look of the game a much greater atomosphere.Sound;If you notice one thing like I have, it's that most, if not all of the original sounds, from combat, ambient sounds, to the sound track, sound exactly the same as they did in the original and TLC. I'm glad they decided to go this route as to keep a sense of nostalgia. No use redoing what you already had done, right? Now don't get me wrong, a lot of the voice acting in the Original Fable along with TLC was attrocious by any means. They could have gone out and tried to rerecord all of the voice acting, but it's been several years since the original voice actors recorded. Also, it wouldn't be much of an ""Anniversary"" Edition with different vocals. I'm glad they decided to keep all of the original voices, because it brings back memories from when we played the original and keeps continuity.Mod Support;Lionhead has gone out of their way and addedgiven us a completely modable version of the game, even though it is quite limited as of right now. Just think of wht people could do. They could add entire new quests, create new weapons, new spells, new environments, and a plethera of other content. I'm waiting to see what the entire community has to offer .Now for the Bad.Keyboard And Mouse Support;When TLC launched for PC back in the day, it had a UI designed for PC users in mind. The in game menus had mull mouse support and you could rebind keys to fit your unique play style. This time around, they developed the game with Console controls solely in mind. Annoying and trivial key presses to navigate the menus, keys rebinding themselves or failing to bind after changing them(in my experience.) It's almost as if they want PC players to go out and buy 360 controllers for their PC's just to play this game. I hope they're able to fully reimplement Mouse Support in the coming updates.Paid Addon DLC;I can't really understand why they are doing this. It seems as if they're taking a page straight from EA's play book when it comes to addon Content. $15 just for some extra weapons/outfits that aren't even better than what you can find already in the base game? I can maybe understaing having maybe a season pass if they were to release some extra story missions, or even to have you play as another person in a paralell story. But that wasn't the case. Last but not least, The Ugly.Reworked facial models;I can understand revamping the textures and models to utilize the newest technology, but they blew it when they completely recreated facial modles for most if not all of the main characters, including The Hero. All of the faces we grew to love and hate were completely scrapped and the one's we were given weren't all that good either.Character Progression;Yes, The same hack and slash/Grinding for Experience mechanic is still there, but there was no deeper involvement than that. The same body types, from Slim through Obese, are still the only options. In some of the preview videos for the skill trees, The Hero can be seen as a person with near body builder proportions. But we don't really see that in the game(at least I haven't, if there's something I'm doing wrong in game, please let me know.)This concludes my in depth review of Fable Anniversary. I would recomend this game to anyone enjoyed the first one who is looking for a visual upgrade, just don't expect anything spectacular. *This review is based soley on my personal perception and experience in playing the game. This review is not based on numers or facts, just opinion.			"

												This is exactly what the players have asked for for so long. A  ""HD"" remake of the fantastic game that was Fable. If you've enjoyed the fable games in the past and want to relive the old adventures of the first fable game (Looking slightly better) Then there's no reason for you not to play this. Yes it has some DLC's but nothing that is needed, if you don't enjoy DLC then don't get it. By all means this is a great game and worthy of sinking lots of hours into, exploring and getting to know the characters, but bear in mind the original game is now getting quite old and therefore might lack in content compared to modern AAA titles.  It has a captivating story and entertaining characters with lots of classic british humor thrown in here and there.			"

												I love the Fable games.  I bought The Lost Chapters (TLC) when it was released on steam out of nastalgia, but never got aroun to playing it.  Since this was an update on that version of the game, I came into this game blind to the changes that TLC made. I was disappointed at how many poor review this game was being given right out of the gate.  I preordered it, and was thuroughly enjoying it on release day.  I believe they did a wonderful job with this game, and were still patching any errors and exploits that were reported a week in.Personally I dissagree with the primary comlaint that was being given in the first week.  That complaint being about poor keyboard an mouse controls.  The original game was designed around a controller, and required significant changes to work intuitively with a keyboard.  They attempted this with a modicum of success, but as with any game that is designed with one control sceme in mind, they do not translate well.  I would never dream of playing this game without a controller, so in my opinion it is a moot point.The addition of a harcore mode was interesting.  It did not add much challenge though.  I almost never use potions, so the lack of resurection phails became the greatest dificulty.Overall I enjoyed this game even more than I remembered from my playthrough of the original.  I would recommend this game, but would also caution those with a tight wallet that there is little difference between this and TLC.			"

												I can't see why people are giving this game suck bad reviews the graphics look wonderful and it doesn't just have a HD retexture the remodels look smoother and clear than the original but keeps the old games look and there is tones of new effects especially when you use magic. I know the price is alittle high but the game is feels new and just feels clean the new UI is great and is much more clearer. Its a good game and has and will still be a classic for years to come and with this new addition it will see new people join the Albion crew :) so I say this game is worth the price and especally to a fan of the games.

												A nice update of Fable: The Lost Chapters. Works great in big picture mode with a controller, though the menu is kind of borked if you want to stick to mouse + keyboard. The first Fable game was an extremely overhyped game that could never live up to the promises Peter Molyneux made for it, but after reflection is was a solid little RPG with tons of heart and cheese. The new graphics kind of make the character models frightening, but the environments look wonderful. PROTIP: Get the color correction mod from Workshop, as the default colors are a bit too bright and clean as opposed to the originals versions fantastic palette.			"

												Seeing a lot of hate towards this game and it kinda bothers me. I was very cautious about buying it due to the complaints of performance issues and other problems that people were mentioning. Since the game went on sale during the summer sale for a very good price I decided to go ahead and buy it since I have always wanted too play it. I will say that in my honest opinion that the game is very fun and enjoyable to play. I have no complaints about it's performance and I am running it on max settings. I am using a Xbox One controler and the controls feel really good, I asked a friend how the keyboard controls were and they said that they are fine once you get used to them. If there were issues before, they seemed to be fixed and the game runs absolutely fine. Its a rebooted game so try not to expect to much, try to have the mindset of playing a game from your childhood.			"

												This game is one step up from the original Fable TLC. Many will hate this game if they prefer using Mouse & Keyboard, but if your like me, were you like both and keep both at hand then this game is an excellent buy. I was going to play this game with a controller just like I did with the Xbox Original and I really loved revisiting everything with an amazing upgrade on graphical power. The great glitches that I abused along time ago; some are there and some are gone. I have found no bugs that have really caught my attention. The game has also been updated non-stop by Lionhead, probably trying to prove that they do want to create the game that all users were hoping for. The game recieved bad reviews because of the lack of mouse support, but I'm sure that with an update with mouse support will turn all those reviews around to a positive. Obviously this game lists it self as Full Controller Support just like other games that have limited keyboard+mouse functionality, but most purchasers that complain about mouse support are ignorant not to realize that. If you are up for a trip back into the past revitalized then this game is perfect for you. Lionhead has put sufficent enough effort into recreating this game, but realize that this is just a remake. Which means no extra content other than small dlcs they released it is only updated graphical wise, so before you buy know that you are buying a copy of a game that is only graphically updated not content wise.

												I've been a Fable fan since the original, the game is one of the best of all time in my opinion the game has high replay value. The only reason anniversary has some negtive reviews is because like any other game on day of release it had some glitches which have been resolved it now runs smooth. I loved this game back then and I love it now.			"

												I dont think people really understand what remastered means. There's not really suppossed to be any updates, just better graphics. Anyone buying this game for new content dont because it doesnt really have any, its not suppossed to, other than DLC of course but not the point im making, its remastered the graphics and maybe some controlls are the only new things in this game.If you disagree then ♥♥♥♥ you, if you think my grammer or spelling is bed then also ♥♥♥♥ you.

												Fable Anniversary is exactly what it says on the tin: it's Fable: The Lost Chapters with a new coat of paint. The game looks good, performs great and, most importantly for me, has great controller support.A lot of the negative feedback for the game is based on the sorry state of its initial release. Most of these issues have been resolved in later builds, including adding mouse support, more logical keyboard inputs, better keymapping and better performance. I personally play the game with a controller and think the implemented support is superb however I can see how M+KB players would have been put off by the game's initial state. There are a few notable changes; Hero Saves are gone and replaced by a Checkpoint system. This has advantages in that it's much easier to pick up a mission where you left off, rather than having to plant yourself once a quest begins and hope nothing pulls you away. Unfortunately, some of the old exploits are now gone as a result of the change -- you can't decrease your age, you can't farm for experience by Hero Saving mid-mission, you can't get both of the ""either-or"" items in the game (Bright/Dark Will User's Hat, Sword of Aeons/Avo's Tear.) Overall, these were exploits so while I miss their inclusion, I don't think it's a straight negative for the game. In addition, the game now has a Fable 2/3 style control scheme. This works rather well, though it's largely not a significant advantage and comes with its own issues. You can't use your Fists since using X or Y (on a controller) automatically unsheathes your Sword or Bow, respectively. More importantly, Will users are significantly less flexible as they can now only use one spell at a time, having to cycle through each individual spell rather than cycling through groups of three and using a button to cast the appropriate spell. It's problematic and for most users, the Traditional is probably the best option. For users who focus almost entirely on Melee/Archery, however, it can be a boon. Overall, the game is faithful to the original and that's what you're buying -- the original game with enhanced graphics and Xinput support. I got the game on sale and think I got my money's worth, given that I'm a massive fan of the Fable franchise and the original is still arguably the best. A chance to replay the game with rose-colored glasses firmly in place is definitely worthwhile for me. P.S. Lipsyncing helps the dialog look a LOT less wooden. Very good move on Lionhead's part.			"

												*UPDATE*The recent updates have fixed most, if not all of m problems with this game, and I can now safely say that this gets a big blue thumbs up from me! It had a bit of a rough start, but they fixed it pretty swiftly. Thank you, lionhead.*OLD REVIEW - ISSUES HAVE BEEN FIXED*I appologize in advance for all of the jimmies I'm about to rustle.♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port.No mouse menus, also the post processing effects that you can't turn off make the game look like a blurry mess.The one and only redeeming factor, in my opinion, is the content packs.I was extremely excited for this, because Fable:TLC is my all time favorite game, but in the end it just feels like a major let down.**Also, Maze is white, what the ♥♥♥♥ is that all about?**EDIT for everyone who keeps telling me maze was always white.

												Since I wrote my original review, there have been patches implimented into Fable Anniversary Edition! The game comes off as more stable, but still has rendering issues in the Arena when it comes to the cut-scenes with the hero, audience, Jack of Blades, and Lady Grey scenes. I also am confused by the system used to assign keys for the D-Pad. I assign them, but cannot seem to use them. Those are my only urks at this moment.Aside from the urks of rendering issues with certain points of the game, Fable feels like the original. The game-play is very smooth with the XBox 360 controller and the Fable 2-3 controls (unless you are assigning to your D pad, as mentioned before). The game matains the feeling I had with the Original Fable and Lost Chapters versions of the games and gives you a nostolgic feel when you play it.If you are a big Fable fan, and can get past the issues of rendering delays, and the D-Pad issues, then I would reccomend the game! Despite the flaws, it is still a lot of fun and a great trip down memory lane for those who once played it on the Xbox. There is much the world of Albion has to offer you, once more!If you cannot stand those problems I listed, I suggest waiting for more patches or look into getting Fable: Lost Chapters instead (You cannot play that version of Fable with a gamepad unless you get a seperate program that allows it. It is a strictly a Keyboard and mouse version of the game). If you are still on the fence, the best I can tell you is to wait for the game to go on sale and take a chance on it.As for the DLC, you do not need it. The DLC only gives you the ability to BUY the items in game, and they items are insanely expensive or hard to find. I was hoping we got the items off the bat once you became an adult, but nope. Unless it goes down to super cheap, I suggest you save your money and play the game as is.			"

I love Fable though, and if you have the system for this game, I absolutely recommend it.			"

First Fable is outstanding, colorful rpg. I fell in love with it in 2006.... But this is not a good remake!Cons:-Low resolution textures (because its easier to make a f@#$%& xbox 360 port)-Ugly AF characters (even in lost chapters they weren't so bad)-Few bugs and crashes-High price and motherf$#@%& dlc-Old animations, old cutscenes-More ugly AF characters-When I heard about Fable remake for the first time I expected locations would be connected... Yeah, right...Pros:+New menu... designed for controllers+Optional higher difficulty... still ez+Achievements... which you can get all of them on first walkthrough+I noticed that Heroes guild, Greatwood and Bowerstone looks better... but thats allGuys, trust me - its better to pay 10$ for Lost chapters, than 35$ for Anniversary (oh wait, game costs 35$ without dlc).

Because they have fix the major issues that made it a pain to play I have changed the review from ""not recommend"" too ""recommend"".Original Review: 13 Sep @ 4:47pmThe menus do NOT have any mouse support! you only use the keyboard for menus, keymapping is very limited. The graphic upgrade is not very good. The textures are not sharp and the changes to the faces are weird . I would recommend just getting ""Fable The Lost Chapters"".			"

												Cette version remasterisée de l'anthologique Fable, premier du nom, mérite toute son attention envers ceux qui n'aurait pas eu le plaisir d'avoir connu sa sortie en 2004. J'invite cependant à ne pas payer cette nouvelle version au prix fort car bien qu'éblouissante ainsi qu'un compatibilité manette confortable, il nécessite encore des corrections ( de textures par exemples). Et sa version vanilla ""Fable The lost Chapter"" coûte moins du double! Ce qui est quelque peu gonflé à mon simple avis. Vous êtes curieux ? Alors, n'hésitez pas, ce jeu est une pépite d'or !This remasterized version needs all attention towards those which won't have heard its first release date in 2004.I would nevertheless advise you not to pay the full price for this new version because, although their beautiful work and the long-awaited xbox joypad compatibility are added, it still requires some corrections (of textures for examples). And the old version “Fable The lost Chapter” costs less double! This is cheeky in my simple opinion.. But if you're curious?! Then, do not hesitate, this game is a gold nugget!			"

												The majority of these bad reviews are when the game first launched; the the devs put in a ton of patches to fix those complaints and those reviews are no longer accurate. That said, did you like Fable TLC? Yeah who didn't. You'll probably like this too since its the exact same game, but with updated graphics, sound, and price. If thats worth the $20+ extra this costs over the original then absolutely pick this up. I have both and this is the superior version, but why wouldn't it be though? You have to pay extra if you want to fly first class.There's a reason this game was remade, and thats because it's an awesome rpg. You have your standard classes, archer, mele, mage; you can mix and match abilities and weapons to cuztomize your battle abilities as well as a bighuge amount of sweet looking gear which is mainly aesthetic. So if you want to run around in a robe and carry a giant axe you wont be gimping yourself too bad. This game isn't exactly difficult anyways so just have fun doing your thing. All in all, I absolutely reccomend this game. If you can't afford it pick up the original. It's only a few bucks on sale and will provide a couple dozen hours of chicken chasing fun.			"

If you play the original on Xbox or PC you will feel like nothing as change and everything that was great then is still so much enjoyable. The fact is that graphics and gameplay has approved a lot and it actualy felt like a game release these years.Tweak the .ini files (check in the forum) and the game would be pretty impressive to look at and everything else is pretty much unchange which for me, is great. Remember habing no trouble to beat the game barely naked? Now the game is more challenging and it is trully a strong point.I'd say....wait for the price to drop a bit and grap this great remaster version of a game that set new standards for the games to come on many points.

												I really enjoyed the original and got very excited to hear that it was being remastered graphically on consoles, and even more so excited when it came out on PC. The only qualm I have about it in it's current state is the new interface and controls are very lacking. With a little bit of keymapping I was able to get the in-game controls to a semi-natural feel, but that still left the menu interface with a lot to be desired. Overall I am having a blast replaying a huge part of my early gaming experiences with updated graphics and at a harder difficulty (Heroic) which was added. This was a purchase I am overall very happy with and would highly recommend to anyone who played Fable and The Lost Chapters on the Xbox (or PC).			"

												If you have played Fable (The Lost Chapters) in the past, and you liked it, this is with no doubt a game to purchase for around €22! If you have not played Fable in the past, you should realize that it is simply a graphical update of the 2005 version. So don't expect evolutionary gameplay for 2014. Fable was a good game back then, and still is. So if you are looking for a light RPG with lots of British humor, great storyline and memorable boss fights. You should pick Fable Anniversay up for €10.			"

												Long Version (Short at the bottom)It's a great remake of the original game with updated graphics and the optional use of an Xbox 360 controller. I'd recommend this to any fan of the Fable series. It's a fun world with interesting lore and decent gameplay, but the nostalgia is what is going to sell this. If you already own Fable TLC it's still worth the purchase because you can use the Xbox controller on PC, not to mention the modding support that has arrived along with the Steam Workshop.I have two complaints about the game and one is the zones being seperated by loading screens. When this game was released it was impressive to have a world this large and it was neccesary to have each zone seperated like this, I was hoping that they would remove some of these. My second complaint about this game is the DLC, especially considering what it is. I enjoy the armor and weapons they've created in these DLC packs and they look great in the revamped graphics, but the amount of money you're asked to pay is ridiculous. 15 dollars for the Heroes and Villains pack seems extreme as well as the ten dollar Scythe content pack - both of these content packs should be reduced by at least 5 USD considering these are all only cosmetic items.Short VersionGood gameplay, graphical update, and remake alltogether. Brought down by the pricey DLC and the constant loading screens.Overall - 7/10			"

												Generic story, generic world, generic characters and very simple, basic gameplay. Press the attack button to win. I was mashing x on my 360 controller the whole time and had no problem with any enemy. And then getting the solus greatsword halfway through the game which is the best weapon in the game and maxing out my slow time ability, my god. They updated the game adding a higher difficulty in response to how easy the game was. The problem is they couldn’t balance it. They added tougher enemies, for example instead of normally fighting wasps in the starting areas you are now fighting against bandits that kill you in three hits instead of eight or so. This would have been fine but the combat mechanics are not built for higher difficulty because of how basic it is. There is only one attack button and there is no way to predict enemy attacks like in dark souls for example so the enemies attack animation hits you in less than a second and takes of half your health bar and blocking and dodging is so clunky it’s not even worth it. So you have to choose either one of the easiest games of all time or really unfair difficulty for the sake of it being difficult. I mainly focused on the main story because I wasn’t into the game much to do much of the side quests. The main story isn’t very long took me 10 hours to beat. I could not get into this game at all I thought everything about it was so bland, basic and dull. 4/10 (Mediocre)			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed Fable and Fable:TLC and this is a great remake of the great game. However, I do agree with the other bad reviews when they say the graphics are choppy. While beautiful, the rendering and optimization is terrible. Once I finally got the graphics tuned to a good option, things got better however the game itself was still choppy. Once this is fixed I do believe it to be a great look back on the classic Fable. As far as the rest of the game is concerned (EXCLUDING the choppy graphics/gameplay) I would recommend it, 4/5			"

												When I was little, my daddy bought me an xbox. Included with lots of games like Halo, Jade Empire, Dead or Alive, Tony Hawk.Later on he gave me a package and in that package was Fable: The lost chapters.I loved the game and played it over and again. I also bought it on pc and started modding, because it kinda bored me after a while.  Then Fable 3 came out on pc and I bought that game as well, loved it. But not a lot of emotion; neither I had that 'feeling' I really had a choice. In Fable TLC I did have that, and I still do.Now today Fable Anniversary came out and I have to admit I love it as well, even though it seems a bit laggy sometimes.Have played for about 2 hours; I would say, if you're a really big fan of Fable in general: GO ON AND BUY IT.But don't expect too much from it; it's only HD and some DLC added (Clothes and weapons.)But don't forget there will also be Steam Workshop for this game which will maybe make it a more enjoyable!

Fable Anniversary ReviewOverviewFable Anniversary is the remake of Fable: The Lost Chapters. With Fable Anniversary, many promising changes are made, and many disappointing issues surface from its predecessor. I recommend this game for these reasons:GraphicsIn comparison to Fable: The Lost Chapters, Fable Anniversary's texture work is massively improved. All the textures from the game, from doors to wall textures have all been reworked. An issue that I've noticed is the AA used in the game; FXAA. FXAA is most likely the worst type of AA avaliable from the numerous other offered AAs, such as SMAA, or MSAA. With FXAA you have a smaller performance hit in comparison to MSAA. FXAA is a fast solution to AA but massively degrades the visuals of the game as it blurs, and washes out the textures of the game. Unfortunatley, you are not given the option to change the type of AA within the options menu. There is, however, mods out there to disable the AA used in  game. Character models is a hit or miss really. Character meshes have been completley reworked to showcase HD textures. However, some of the models are completley off putting, especially the children's. I really did not have an issue with the character models, but it may be for others. Controls I recommend not using a mouse and keyboard for this title. It seems that little effort was put into the binding of the controls in Fable Anniversary, in comparison to Fable: The Last Chapters. Lionhead has consistently updated the game with changes to the control schemes for the game. The menus are now fully controllable with the mouse, and more keybinding options have been unlocked for customization. Even with these changes, it's very awkward to play with KB & M. I highly recommend playing this title with a controller, it is much more predicatable, and fluid.  GameplayThe gameplay is the same from Fable: The Lost Chapters. In Fable Anniversary, a new mode is available called Heroic. It is a bit of a increase of difficulty from the standard difficulty of the game presented in Fable: The Lost Chapters.			"

												This is the first time I've whritten a review. I personally bought this game for the Heroic difficulty. I played the original so much that I almost memorized every little detail, prolouge, etc. But then it just became so boring casue you can be pretty much be immortal spamming the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of magic potions with the phy shield up. So I bought this game, put it on the Heroic, and I just couldn't believe that I actually died like 10 times in an hour. If anything that is the best pro of the new HD relase, of course I hadn't played the game since the 360 came out and I was having a hard time with the controls.I also agree with a lot of the negative, it's annoying how they have released the first game like 4 times already. I really wish for fable 2 to be on the pc. I love the first game but I really like the 2nd one too. The third one is a meh and can go die.			"

												I am pretty surprised at all these negative reviews. I really don't see what the big fuss is. Self-entitled kiddos is my guess... Anyone outside of that should be ashamed of themselves for acting like one.To be honest, I wasn't wanting additional content. I wanted a Fable experience exactly how I recall back in 2004. On those grounds, Anniversary delivered tremendously.Fable was a staple of my young adulthood. I beat the thing 20 times before Anniversary released, and after recently purchasing the original TLC for the PC; I really suffered through not having controller support. I ended up using Xpadder, which really sucked due to limited movement.The added controller support, along with a redesigned UI really addresses the weakpoints of the original game.The game plays on a completely new engine - Unreal 3, which makes it look incredible. That, coupled with the massive effort to retexture the game really gives the graphics a kick to make it competitive with current releases.Fable Anniversary also features an audio overhaul, where some parts have been completely redone. No more out of sync voice overs with the character animations!The majority of people downing this game are ignorant. I've watched people of the community refuse to buy this game for petty reasons like no more silver key glitching with hero saves, or no ability to play as a female. Those are features that were purposely left out because they weren't intended in the original game. These idiots are seriously bashing the game because they fixed bugs from the original...Overall, if you enjoyed the original game, then you are bound to enjoy Anniversary. As a Fable series enthusiast, and longtime fan of the game; I can definitely say that Anniversary's graphical rebuild does the original game justice. The added controller support and UI overhaul really make the game a much smoother experience on the PC!It was just like experiencing the original game for the first time again - and in my opinion, you really can't put a price on such a great feeling of nostalgia.

												The game was ok, graphics were good, but, I wasn't all that impressed. I didn't like that there was no character appearance customization, and the aging mechanic is all screwy. (My chacter was 28yrs old but looked like he was pushing 70, but when he got to 55 he looked like he was 30). Story line was kinda cheesy and the game seemed really short.  The battle sequences were good but the targeting system SUCKS. Lastly, the game was really easy in my opinion, I've played lots of RPGs and this one I didn't really have to try or strategize.  I didn't die once the entire game and my health only got low a few times.  You get tons of exp and I was able to pretty much max out every stat without grinding.			"

I hope there will be more out there and am really hoping for some amazing creations the community will come up with using the modding tool.The modding tool however isn't really working for me, I'm not 100 per cent if it's fully released but says I'm missing the executable when I try to launch it.Again, it's a beautiful, classic game and I hope it will impact the gaming community in the future.

Controls are very consolized, a lot won't work as you'd expect, painful to navigate, terrible to manager your inventory.Basically, they took an old game, gave it a spit shine polish and said ""Pay me for a full priced game.""   If you really, really, really want this game; wait till its on sale for less than $5.			"

												This game is horribly British.But that's ok! In some universe. It's also a console port so get ready to deal with awful menu controls. They patched up most of the issues (oakvale lag, no enter button on menu) and fixed the blury issue. It actually looks pretty good, and the art style will begin to grow on you. By the end of the game, I actually loved it and started taking screenshots.Character growth is nice and the ability to still hit achievements from both evil and good sides of the ball is great. The combat is fun and engaging. Even if you're into only one style of combat (ranged, melee, magic), you'll eventually earn enough XP to flesh each system out enough to make them all useful in different situations.The game is well written. It has some pretty comedic moments, some ""hard choice"" moments, and no matter what you're not stressing about right or wrong you just play it and do. The concept of your player changing by way of decision making is fantastic as there isn't a right or wrong; it's just exactly what it is.The map is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. The menu controls are ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. The auto target is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Vendors are awful. Some quests are bugged. But what do you expect from a 10 year old game? They did a great job rebuilding the world and modernizing its appearance but it still suffers from old world bugs.It was worth playing through the bugs and any action-RPG fan needs to give this a good play through. Waiting for Fable 2 (on PC).Edit: turn off vsync in game, use a forced vsync from your graphics card. You're welcome.			"

												In simple terms this is basically Fable+Everything has been given a shiny new coat of graphics. The game has also been opened up to some workshop support. And the devs have done their best to listen and work with the community in order to make a more challenging mode for the hardcore audience.It's still fable though, and if you like games with a linear zelda style story with beat'em up mechanics then you should be happy with this.

I would really only recommend this if you are a hardcore Fable fan who doesn't mind spending $20+ on this, or if you've never played Fable before. The graphics are fantastic and the Heroic difficulty is a great addition to spice things up. They may have reused some content from the original game but that's definitely not a bad thing. The gameplay is still as fun as I remember it being, it's amazing how well it's held up over the years. If you've never played Fable/TLC, I would highly recommend picking this game up.

												„I like it.“ - This was my original review.Now there i saw 4 people disliking this review I want to edit it and explain why I like the game.Fable was my childhood and will be my favourite game forever. This remake of Fable TLC isn't „bad“ or sth like that.It has better graphics and a new gamemode, which makes the game a lot ♥♥♥♥in' harder, so why are there so many bad reviews you might think.Most of the negative reviews are very old and were written because of the negative sites of the game, which not really exist anymore.For example, when the game came out you couldn't use your mouse in the menu - now you can.The bugs that were complained about are fixed and if you look at the reviews for Xbox360 you can clearly see the game is very good and there are also not as much negative reviews as on PC, which probably is, because they never wanted a cursor based interface.The only thing that I can really understand as a reason to not review this game is the price.The game costs 30 bucks and is exactly the same game as the original Fable TLC, but has better graphics and so on.There you know Fable is my favourite game, it's not really weird that I bought this game on the release day including all DLC's.I finished the game twice ( once easy mode, once hardcore mode ) and all I can do now is to highly recommend it to anyone, because it's just as great as the original.// If I made any mistakes in this text, or you don't agree with my review, feel free to dislike or comment .:)			"

I enjoyed plaing it but it is only marginal that I chose to give this a reccomendation.

												I am not as tech savay as some of the people who left responses, so if that is what you are looking for in a review then this is not the review for you.  I loved playing the orginal Fable when it was first released, and I enjoyed playing this verison as much as I did the first. I loved that they added new quests. I would havw like to seen more added content, but I am happy with the game I just played.			"

												Fable: TLC has been my favorite game for years. After beating Anniversary it makes it right around the 20th time I've played it beginning to end. For people new the series or if you skipped the first one, there's no reason not to get this instead of the original. For those that played TLC and want to know if it's worth upgrading, I'd say only if you're at least some what as obsessed with it as I am.There are a handful of problems with the new game, but it's been made clear Lionhead is doing their best to patch it up as there have already been a few patches since release day for the PC version. So, in terms of general bugs, I'd call it a wash. That said, by the time I finished the game (Sept. 18, 2014), these were the bugs/glitches/annoyances I didn't see mentioned in any patch notes:- chicken kicking competition has really, really fuzzy scoring. Your chicken could be a pixel off the white score label of a square but it still counts as the next point zone. Still doable, but annoyingly when you know you scored 5 50 point kicks to get the top prize but you only get 2nd.- the pub games controls are way, way more sensitive than I remember.- This is really just a complaint from the original game, too, but having to hit the Knothole Glade mayor 50 times to finish the fist fighter's club quest, but he only has to hit you twice, is still my least favorite part of the game.A note about some bad reviews and complaints I've seen: Although the minimum specs are low, to turn things up you'll still need a decent rig. I think a lot of PC players forget that these days the minimum requirements means ""you can run it if you turn it all the way down."" Recommended also doesn't mean you can jack it all the way up, it means ""the best experience STARTS here."" Granted, my system is relatively beastly compared to the average Steam user's system (according to the Software and Hardware Survey), but with my i5-3570k, 16GB RAM, SSD and GTX 770 it ran at a buttery smooth 60+ FPS the entire time I was playing with everything turned all the way up.So, if you're able to ignore all of that general moaning about bugs that are being fixed and people that don't understand that their computer is kind of junk, the only real problems with the game are two fold:1. This is a console port. It's, honestly, one of the best console ports for this kind of game I've played in a while, but there are draw backs to it. You always (at least kind of) feel like you should be playing with a controller, which doesn't bother me but will bother some people. If you bemoan console ports because you feel like you need to feel surperior to console games, you'll be all bristly the entire time you're playing. If you're a reasonable adult that enjoys playing games on PC, you might be mildly annoyed at worst through certain parts. Note: I'm somewhere in the middle. I hate the typical fascist PC gamer, but that doesn't mean I can't be all ""come on kid PC master race gtfo"" sometimes.2. There are needless, dumb achievements. I'd like to believe Lionhead was forced to implement them to begin with because it came out on Xbox 360 first (related to my first problem with the game), where games are essentially, if not outright, required to have them, so they just kept them in for the PC version because the work the was done. It still feels like it dirtied up the game though.I enjoyed it, and I played the original, non-TLC version on the original Xbox 2-3 times, the TLC version on original Xbox about 5 times, and TLC at least 10 times on PC between my retail copy and the Steam copy. I'm perfectly happy having paid for this game a fifth time, apparently.			"

												(Updating due to fix by player Diggler)Apparently the Bright Will, Dark Will and Assassin outfits cause the game to lag horribly. Something to do with the capes. Ever since wearing different armor the freezing and stuttering have stopped entirely. Also recommending the game instead of not recommending as it's not entirely game breaking.(Updated at escorting trader to orchard farms)It's become almost unplayable at this point. Every other bandit I attack the game freezes and audio loops. Must keep going..This is disappointing. I first read from a friend who gave a bad review saying the cutscenes were buggy. I was hoping this was an isolated issue or an issue with her computer. Sadly, it's not isolated. For the first 10 cutscenes or so it will freeze or stop for no reason what so ever. This isn't an issue with my hardware and I'm not the only person to experience this. Whenever I use the Lightning magic on more than 3 enemies the game will freeze and the sound will loop for a good 10-15 seconds then cut back to normal. I'm doing my best to avoid being a parkinsons Senator Palpatine with stuttering issues.Apart from the terrible performance of the game and the sub-par graphics improvements (lol improvements), the game is fun. I'm enjoying it as I've already paid for it. I'm not about to whine over trivial issues and not enjoy the game I've paid for in advance. Lots of nostalgia! :D That being said.. I don't recommend this ""hd remaster"". At least not until they fix the cutscenes and horrible performance of the game. P.S. After getting past the guild introduction quests and venturing into the world all by your lonesome, the cutscene stuttering/freezing isn't as bad.			"

												If you're coming here to get a 'fresh' restart to this fairly old game, you will be disappointed.This is a purely aesthetic remodeling - I find myself excited to see what my favorite characters look like with their remodels. As a result, this is purely a gift to people who enjoyed the first game (Or the franchise, in my case).Just be warned:The movements are still odd. They're identical to before, they just ""look"" better.The controls and leveling system still remain fairly outdated. It's clunky to switch between combat styles, something Fable 2 and 3 remedied later on.This is purely a refurbish. You can make an old chair shiney with some sandpaper and gloss, but it's still just a chair.			"

												If you always wished Fable TLC had controller support, why haven't you bought this already ? Stop reading this and go buy it :D I'm playing with an Xbox controller and happy as larry. If you believe only lowly peasants use a controller, I'd stick to modded TLC because the mouse and keyboard control scheme is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. TB said its a ""bit naff"" but I feel that was quite charitable. I play plenty of games with mouse and keyboard but this was unplayable for me. Graphical update is a matter of taste - I like it much better with SweetFX and Dirty Dan;s ini tweak. There are some other nice looking graphical updates,  I wouldn't presume to say which is best as that's a matter of taste.  "

												The base game is still the game you know ad love, The HD upsacling looks decent - in fact it fdoes a good job of making the game look the way you remember it ""through thoe rose tinted glasses of memory""However it has some serious stability problems. I've tried it on two different modern machines - Win 10/Win 8 and it crashes often enough that I uninstalled before even reaching adulthood. The game has one of those save mechanics that only saves the quest/world state so you end up losing alot of play constantly to application crashes.maybe pick it up for your library if it's super cheap but otherwise this is the same old game with new compatibility problems.

I enjoyed plaing it but it is only marginal that I chose to give this a reccomendation.  I found verry little replay value in this game and a lot of the side quests were mind numbingly boring with highly over powered enemies.  Whats with the final boss any way!Funny and fun to play despite the negatives.			"

												Fable: The Lost Chapters has always been a favourite of mine and has a very special place in my heart. Fable Anniversary is, basically, exactly the same, but with several key differences.Let's start with the obvious: Textures have been massively reworked, giving wonderful eyecandy while preserving a Fable feel. That's the main selling point with Fable Anniversary. It really does look great, although I was a bit iffy about Chicken Chaser's new textures at first, but then I realized that, when he got old, he didn't exactly look old. And that was what I modded out with the original Fable, so that was an issue that I felt had been very well hurdled over (and I'm not the only one who wants their character to appear young for the game). And the not-so-obvious: The developers chose to keep the mouse out of the menu interface. And hey, that's not a bad thing, so long as it's done well. Unfortunately, it's not. With the layout of my computer, it took a fair amount of time to figure out how to properly traverse, and even then I was unable to move left in the prime categories due to the menu deciding I wanted to select instead of move left. Usually, these issues don't annoy me, but when I accidentally make a mistake by moving too quickly in the interface and go one more right than I had intended, so then I have to exit the menu to begin trade all over again, it begins to wear on the patience a little bit. In this case, the original's menu was much better with the layout, and it had the use of a mouse.The characters and environments, however, do look excellent. And while sometimes there can be minor issues in conversations (like mouths moving but no words coming out) and camera focusing for cutscenes, I personally can overlook it because of my love of the original game. I also enjoy hearing the original voices and am glad the developers chose to simply carry them over instead of get new voice actors. Then again, it's hard to replace someone like Maze or Jack of Blades.So, if you've ever played the original, I do suggest this game. The menu can be trying but I find it's worth it. And if you haven't jumped on the Fable bandwagon yet, this is a great game to start, so you can properly appreciate the lore in the sequel. But if you have the original game already and are iffy about purchasing, I'd suggest waiting for a sale. Believe me, you're only missing the pretty colours.			"

												Is this the ""real"" Fable? Yes, yes it sure is. It is the same good old game in a fancy new suit, and that doesn't have to ba a bad thing. I have always liked the fable series and I view the first game as the best in the series. As such, I have been waiting for this tirelessly since I heard that it was coming to pc.Is it a good port then? It is now. It had its fair share of problems at launch and during beta - loss of audio at random places mostly. The mechanics are unchanged since it's the same game in a new engine (if I have understood it correctly) and thats a great thing! You have the option of playing it with the old xbox-controller layout or with a new, And i really recommend playing with a gamepad.Is it a good reskin? I say that it is. It looks great! you can recognize the effects from the original, which I think is important, but still see that it really is made in a modern engine.Something I don't really like is the addition of new items that mainly seem to be for ""fun"" and are essentially microtransactions to buy new costumes. There is a sword that is supposed to react to silver keys, but any guide on the internet make it unnecessary and saves you a few bucks.Over all, would I recommend it? Yes. Absolutely it is still one of the best examples of a good rpg with wonderful voice acting and a great sense of humor. Not to mention that it is very satisfying to pop guards heads of with a bit of chain lightning.			"

												I've loved Fable since I was a kid, I remember playing it for hours on my Xbox and having the best time of my life. When I found out it was being remastered, I was so overjoyed and couldn't wait for the release!I was lucky enough to play the Beta and I loved every second. It plays brilliantly, the controls are as smooth as ever, the graphics are beatifully retouched so you can see how much time and attention was put into them. Its a fantastic remaster, it hasn't overhauled the game which is great because Fable is amazing enough to not need changing and its a nice way to rediscover childhood memories.If you love Fable as much as me, you HAVE to play this and its well worth the money! Its fantastic to replay on PC aswell as Xbox 360. If you haven't played a Fable game, or you love RPGs Fable is a great starting point for anyone. It truly captures what I believe is the definition of an RPG.			"

On one playthrough I'll be a warrior who always does the right thing, next I'll be a rouge who breaks into people's houses at night and murders them, and then I'll be a mage who starts off good and is then corrupted by the world.'Anniversary has breathed new life into an already timeless game.

												Never played Fable? You're in for a classic treat with a wonderfully applied, new coat of paint. Played the original, years ago? You're in for a nostalgic treat with a wonderfully applied, new coat of paint.Welcome to or welcome back to Albion. In either case, Fable Anniversary welcomes you with a wonderous world, filled with quests that are, at times, as crass and humerous as they are fun. New players will feel at home with a solid control scheme, while long-time Fable fans will recall Anniversary's scheme from Fable 2 (which can be switched back to the original Fable's scheme). As you're questing, farting, and chickin kickin', you are bathed in one of gaming's best soundtracks, which will leave you whistling it's tune long after you've turned the game off. And, finally, PC purist, fear not. Fable Anniversary plays as good as it looks (which is pretty damn good). I'll post my specs below, but I haven't discovered any errors since launch and the devs have been quick and reliable with patches and feedback.Whether this is your first time, second time, or whatever time entering or re-entering Albion, you are bound to be pleased. I have been a fan of Fable since it was called ""Project Ego"" (yeah, I'm getting old...), but this long-time fan is very much pleased. It was exciting replaying a long cherished part of my childhood through a new lens. Graphically speaking, I'd say that the acorn that was the original Fable has become the lovely tree that is Fable Anniversary. ;)Specs:AMD 8350 4.0ghzGTX 680 2 gigs of vRam16 gigs RAMWin 7, 64*Played with Xbox One controller*			"

												This game is awesome.It can only be defined by that word.It's true, people complained at the launch for the existence of quite a big amount of bugs, and they kept whining about the ""crappy console port"" thing. But thats besides the point.Lionhead did an EXCELENT job. They fixed all these bugs and glitches (most of them), in the first month of launch, wich is insane. Now, you might be thinking, why'd they launch it before then? They did it for you guys. Let's face it, everyone would be mad if the game got delayed. And even though it came out like this, what counts is the finish, and at the end, the game was amazingly well made.As a previous player of the lost chapters, I can say this game has an astonoshing storyline, filled with many goodies and endgame side quests you can play after the game ended. It has a great deal of minigames and stuff to do, so you'll never get bored. It makes you feel awesome.You can also make your own path, wich makes it even greater, you can decide to be evil, and let the story envelop through your evil acts, or be good, and have the story become the path you want to be. This remains even until after the end of the game :)I have to give this game a big 8.5/10, yes it's true, some content could have been added. But it was a remaster, not a remake, and some things could've been better, but I bet alot of companies couldn't have done better themselves, since this is a huge game, and a legendary title.I was also a proud beta tester, and I can say, yet again, Lionhead is a great company, and has great employees, they read almost every forum post, and every bug report you can say about it, and they will most likely not deceive you.I reccomend this game to anyone who likes these types of games.

												I think this is very fun game.This is first time that I i played fable series and my first impression is this game is very cool and great story but in game sometime the movement of character is so weird and I think if you want to play this game easier is to play with controller.			"

												A brilliant game, great and sometimes hillarious story. Gameplay is slightly lacking (just in combat) however i think it is still fun to fight all the enemies and is especially good concidering how old the game is. As my child-hood favourite, the anniversary is a brilliant nostalgia trip. The game looks very good with its new HD textures and smoother animations for talking etc, Its still the original just looks a lot better, but still worth buying in my books. I deffinetley recommend it to people who have played the original but no longer own it and want a nostalgia trip. And i 100% recommend it to people who have never played it.			"

												Absolutely nostalgic and fantastic. Not the best rpg you'll ever play, but a damn good one. If you had the pleasure of playing the first Fable game or the extended edition Fable: The Lost Chapters, you love this game just as much as you did the first time you played it. While it uses almost the exact same game mechanics as its older form, it doesn't feel that ancient, nor as sluggish and static as the older game feels in this age. The graphics and UI have been updated beautifully, though the UI could have incorporated more/better sorting mechanics. Players of the original Fable will definitely be able to tell that this is pretty much a gorgeous paint job on an old car, but you won't care, it's the same ride that took you wherever you needed to go and you'll love it no matter what. For those new to the franchise, you'll still enjoy this fresh look on an older rpg that still resonates with today's games. Fable Anniversary is far from perfect, but all in all marvelous and just as wonderous as Fable was in its prime.			"

												I had never played Fable before this Anniversary Edition. I'm torn, I think it's a really good RPG in many ways; A good amount of abilities and almost no filler fetch quests. It also has a kind of comical charm about it and is quite funny at times. Other times this same quality can get on your nerves, the voice acting gets irritating and all of the expressions you can use are obnoxiously juvenile or corny. I appreciate that this is an older game and the first in its series, but there are issues here that are grating. If you are using a controller the button options are quite irritating (why can't I have toggle stealth and a range of spell hotkeys/buttons at the same time?), however if you prefer keyboard, the customisation is much better. The menus are just miserable, and in RPGs menus are important, this is bad.However I have fun with this game, despite its flaws, and that's the main thing. Would like to see the sequels on Steam to see if the series has improved.			"

												Fable is my favorite game serie of all time! ""Fable Anniversary"" gives something new to the Fable universe but still not. If you haven't played any ""Fable"" before I highly recommend this one, This game is the first in the series , and it provides a whole new way of thinking about the game-industry. From my own opinion ""Fable 2"" is the best game in the serie and in the world. If you like Adventure, Action and RPG then this game IS for you to play! Pick it up now if you don't want to miss an opportunity, a new history, a new life!			"

												While I can't deny that this game has some issues, such as  the lack of proper mouse support and some framerate issues, in my opinion the enhanced graphics, audio and controller support more than make up for this. Even though I have to run all the graphics settings at their lowest possible setting (due to my crappy pc), the game still looks amazing and feels great to play.Pros: Great graphics and sound, Plays great with a controller, still has the same great story and gameplay it had 10 years agoCons: Not great with mouse and keyboard, had to fiddle with NVIDIA settings to get it to run properly, and when you hit someone with a sword it still sounds like you're slapping them with a wet fish (which, incidently, is now an actual weapon in the game)If you're like me and prefer controllers (I played with a 360 pad), then I recommend this. If you prefer mouse and keyboard, I'd say go and buy The Lost Chapters (this game without the graphical and audio upgrade)			"

												Ok guys , so for a guy who polowed through this game as a kid and simply loved it , I really hate that there isn't any mouse support in menus and all the small bugs that came with the port of the Anniversary edition. But if you consider yourself a fan of the game and franchise , and not nag about anything that you didn't expect to be wrong with the game , go give it a try . If not but you still love the game and want to see 100% everything that it has to offer you can tune in to my twitch channel. Just finnished a Good playthrough with all the unlocks i could get and now with ""Shadow of Mordor"" 12 days away I'm going for a complete Evil playthrough and what it has to offer. I certainly feel like there were a lot of parts that could have been made better but Fable was such an awesome story for me when i was a little kid that this can't ruin even a bit of my experience of the game. So for all us grownups that wouldn't whine about this or that or for spending a few more bucks , like teenagers do , come tune in and have fun at the ""Reaper's perch"" i deffinetly recommand this game or the old Fable : the lost chapters"" to anyone who likes fantasy , decision making , and wanting a lot of playtime out of a game  twitch.tv/shadowgrimmm "

												I am really enjoying this remake of Fable I am also a player of TLC and yes it was easier to do everything in TLC but the remake is also really well done. Another good thing about this is that people want to play fable for the first time and never knew what it was its a good starting point for new players to see how games were done 10 years aog., From what other players have said it is hard to navigate through the menus. It is as first but if your using a controller it just takes a few seconds to learn how to navigate throught he menu and learn how the new contorller 2/3 settings are mapped out other than that this game is a good remake and brings back quite a bit of memories that I have sepnt in TLC. IF you haven't played Fable and would like too this is a good game to get you started I would recommend this game to players who want to relive the original Fable or to new players that are wanting to see what fable was all about back when it came out.

												EDIT: I thought after almost 50 hours I'd add some more detail to my review, for those complaining about keyboard and mouse issues, I can't imagine how this game could be enjoyed without a controller. I do have to say I probably enjoyed it more as I haven't played this Fable before now, only the sequel I can imagine anyone who has played through this a few times like I have now would see improved graphics as not much of a change but you are paying for the rest of thegame too..All I can say is the bad reviews are way too biased.. I don't imagine remastering is some small feat and this has been done rather well with Fable Anniversary. I'm a huge Fable 2 fan, I've wasted many an hour gaining my halo, horns and cool glowing blue lines so I went into this expecting that to have ruined this experience for me, boy was I wrong, for 2004 this game is outstanding, the story is rich and full of twists, the characters have, well, character and the alignement options and side quests allow for hours of extra fun. Yes they are still working out some bugs but what do you expect? Even then you still have no room to complain, it's completely playable. I'd say if you're a fan of the other Fable games and not played this yet then go right ahead, it's worth every penny in my opinion. I know my review is slightly biased but my game experience has been an enjoyable one and I want anyone considering buying this to see what they are missing out on. Your's sincerely, Arseface.			"

												I was very excited when this game was announced, however, I've tried to change settings, and once you're in the 'Advanced Options' menu, there's no way out. The menu says to use the backspace key, but that didn't work. I had to use task manager to quit out of the game. There's been about 3 updates since it's release, as of writing this review, and I think I'll give the game a few more weeks for more bugs to be fixed. Until then, I cannot recommend this game, as it's key mapping is non-existant in some menus. I will rewrite this review once more bugs are fixed.			"

												I can't quite figure out what if the cause is an unstable framerate, a jerky camera or the constant hitching (even in pre-rendered cutscenes, WTF?) but this game is nauseating and has given me a migraine. No amount of settings-tweaking appears to help. On top of this, the spell effects are ugly, the animation is choppy, the character models are completely expressionless when talking and have a habit of staring off into the middle ground when supposedly addressing you, lending them an air of psychopathy. The lip-synching is completely off too. If you'd told me that the developer of this game had never made a game before I'd smile and nod politely.			"

												I've not plaied any of the Fable series before this one, and I must say this game was well made with quite alot effort and precission. It's a classic ARPG game put in a 3d world, where you need to complete certain quests to get along with the storyline. I've got used to gameplay quite fast, either with keyboard or gamepad. At most i've liked beautifull landscape, where you walk arround trees on an adventure, and feel like you are in some kind of a wonderland - just beautifull. Also there's a narrator that often commentates when you need to acquire some items or when you've finnished the quest.There's also several outpost camps with different merchants(traders), where you can buy goods for an exchange of your gold you've collected through the game.Fable Anniversary is definatelly worth buying if you like to play this genre of games. Buy this game as it's definatelly worth it's money.			"

												Being one of the few have actually played this game for more than an hour before judging it, I have to say that I'd definitely suggest it for any fan of the Fable series. Fable: Anniversary is Fable: TLC brought to life again with new colors, animations, and items that still represent the quirky, bright style you've come to expect from the Fable series. In addition, there is a new Hero Mode exclusive to PC, art and animation is fully moddable, and there is a very dedicated developement team that has been working for months to get the game up and running, with the help of beta testers who's feadback has definitely been an influence on the product now present. I have never once had any issues with Anniversary since I downloaded it, and it has definitely brought me many hours of joy.			"

												I'm recommending it on my personal taste. you dont like it. eat me. ok so all in all ive played every fable in existance so i kinda have a small bias towards it. i thought i played well  from the get go. heroic mode is actually pretty awesome cause i thought it was way to easy in the original. i would recommend it full price cause you do have a challenge now and it does look alot prettier. I'm a lil drunk at the moment so ill end up changing some of this to make more since later.			"

												I've played both the original Fable and HD remake on Xbox and honestly, whilst I can see my self playing this game again on PC as it's still a wonderful masterpeace I'm a bit dissapointed that there's only a small change between the 360 HD remake and the PC version. My setup is currently i5 4670k and a GTX 770 and I'm alway above 150fps which is what I usually get when I play the original WitcherI know it's a remake of an old game and it will never have the graphical fidelity of The Witcher III, but there could of atleast been a decent upgrade.With that small thing aside, it's an epic game. It stays true to the original whilst also bringing a fresh look to it with added loot to buy and find within the world.I highly recommend it to any RPG fan.			"

												At the time I'm writing this, I have already refunded Fable Anniversary. I suspect most people won't be bothered by what I did not like about it, but let me tell you about it anyway. I've played the first Fable back in the day and decided to get some nice hours of nostalgia via Fable Anniversary. Some of the visual shaders create a very washed out look, however, making the game look very bland, way less colorful than the original. Disabling these shaders, however, created an image that was way too vibrant. I couldn't enjoy either look properly, hence the refund.			"

												I would not recommend this game over Fable: The Lost Chapters, all it is is a graphical upgrade, no new mechanics, no bug fixes, nothing new that makes it worth the extra $24 you would be wasting on this over TLC. While it does look nice at a glance (and admittedly the glamour shots on the store page), in game it doesn't seem very good. While all the models and areas are remade, it all seems the same as TLC, they didn't even to redo the intro cutscenes, so they are very low-res and compressed while the rest of the game is HD. The animations each character does seem to be mapped to what seems like the TLC models and not the new Anniversary models, making the other cutscenes even worse to look at than Sonic Adventure's terrors. Now it might seem I'm making a big deal on graphics and animations, and you may be like ""What about the gameplay? Why are you just comparing to TLC constantly, can't you judge this as its own game?"". Well to answer your questions, the gameplay is exactly the same as TLC, the graphics and animations are the only thing they ""changed"" in this. Now if I were to judge as its own game, I would maybe say it's pretty ok, except for the weird animations and it will definitely not have aged well in a couple years (heck it doesn't even look that good now). But since this is a remake that is THE EXACT SAME GAME as the original game with a graphical upgrade, A comparison is all you can really review it on. And in comparison, TLC is better, though the graphics don't hold up as well to this, they have aged considerable better than this has in only 2 years, gameplay is the same, bugs are the same, story is the same. These were the reasons I found myself asking for a refund after such a sort playtime, I had seen all I needed to see and it wasn't worth it even if it was on sale. Just take your money and get Fable: The Lost Chapters, you'll be much better off.			"

												This is rediculous... the combat is awful, the camera worse. Sometimes Enemies can be focused on, sometimes not. If you're moving whilst casting a spell your whole movement gets srewed up, making it impossible to dodge enemies or even move slightly past them without getting stuck in the super tight paths.This whole Situation gets only worse by thinking of how restricted one is in the matters of movement itself. ""Oh, wanna dodge an attack splitseconds before it hits, but you're casting a spell? Well f*** you!""Moving through a fight in this game is like trying to fly a solid rock. In matters of controls, this is even worse than playing dark souls with mouse and keyboard.I can live with the crappy graphics, the restricted magic, and even with the bad timing in fights... but to load into a map and watch your character get killed by some freaking bandit because he suddenly just stands there by f***ing chance tops it all, I'm done with this sh*t.For f***s sake, I'm furious.sh*t game.

												Did you love the original Fable? Are you satisfied with a visual and audio upgrade with the improved comat from its successors? This is absolutely the game for you.Where Fable 2 and Fable 3 largely failed is they lost the awe, wonder, and atmosphere that was so vibrant in Fable. Decisions were truly reactive with everybody judging you and your choices truly impacted your image and how you were perceived. Mixed in with an iconic soundtrack, classic British Dark Humor, and plenty of unforgettable moments, this is truly a jewel amongst RPGs.Even if you did not play the original Fable, I strongly urge you to buy Fable Anniversary, especially while it's on sale. It's better than its successors and is an experience everybody should try if they are an RPG fan.I didn't (and still don't) see eye to eye with Peter Molyneux on many things, but this game truly was a masterpiece. Enjoy your journey through Albion. You won't regret it.			"

In some places Fable annicersary is uglier than the original Fable The Lost Chapters, in the players hair, in the players face, in pretty much every character model come to think of it. I would recomment buying Fable: The Lost Chapters instead. This was a bad Anniversary release, which is a shame because the original game was great.			"

												Before being disuaded from buying Fable Anniversary by the countless bad reviews, try comapring the time spent by playing by the people who didn't recommend to the people who did. It's important to remember that this is a remake of a console port. That said, if you buy Fable Anniversary without having played the original and you are expecting a AAA RPG adeventure prepare to be disappointed. Very few things are changed from the original game, aside from the visuals, and aside from the addition of extra weapons and armor from the pre-order bonus, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of rebalancing, save for the addition of the ""Heroic"" difficulty. Most people's gripes with the game seem to be from the controls and lack of mouse support in the menus, my recommendation is to have a gamepad. Believe me it will make life a lot easier on you.Storywise, the game is unchanged from TLC, become a Hero, take on quests, discover the secrets to your bloodline and the power that awaits you. Same old, same old.Visually the game does indeed look better than TLC, except for the face gen they used. Half of the NPCs look like their eyes are trying to escape from their head (lots of derp faces to be seen). The game does look more dark and grim than it did before, where it was more cartoony.Your biggest foe in this game isn't going to be the bosses or the small hordes of enemies, instead you will find youself fighting with control over the camera. If I can say anything bad about this game, it is that the camera controls have not aged well AT ALL! The bad camera controls are especially noticable in locked-on combat and questionable angles while you're gambling.Performance wise, the only real issue I have with the game so far is the occasional audio stuttering, my friend didn't seem to have this issue so it might be isolated to my rig, but it's still something that bugs me.Also if you're an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥, 18 hours of play was all I needed to get 100% of the achievements, so there's that too :P.

												This was always my favourite of the Fable series. I'm so glad they broke away from the Xbox exclusive BS and gave us the aniversary edition too, it looks great!Admittedly it was a bit dodgy on release but it's much more than just a port, there are modding tools and the devs have been hard at work fixing bugs and responding to suggestions from the community which is always great to see. There is also a beta branch for those who want the latest changes and aren't afraid of minor bugs. I use an Xbox 360 controller to play and I've had zero issues with that control scheme, if you don't own one and are insistent on using K/M you might want to watch the forums until those issues are fixed.Hopefully this is a sign Lionhead/Microsoft are trying to mend their relationship with PC gamers after abondoning us for so many years. Not all of us want a locked up peice of slow hardware thats only useful for one thing! Thank you!			"

												I love this game. One of my all time favorites. I was so happy to see this come out on steam and now that I have been playing for awhile I can say this is still a great game. The updated graphics are great. The new Hard mode is great. They said the game is open to modders and will be on Steam Workshop soon enough. I can't wait to use mods for the game and have even more fun. If you are a fan of Fable I would definitely recommend buying this. A lot of people have been complaining about Keyboard and mouse controls, but I have been using an Xbox controller so I don't have that problem.			"

												I have been a huge fan of fable since the day it came out.

												After 41 hours, I can safely say that I absolutely recommend this to any and all classic Fable fans. The developers have been on the ball with patching some of the launch teething issues and now we're left with a wonderful love letter to the original title, that has hugely improved graphical quality whilst not sacrificing any of the classic gameplay or style. The initial issues (such as hard freezing due to physics calculations) have now been fixed and a lot of the keyboard & mouses issues have been remedied too, there's still no mouse-controlled menus - which is really inexcusable given the engine this is running off and the original game it was remade from - but if you're not averse to using a joypad, then you can have a great deal of fun with this.Definitely recommended.

YouTube™ Video: Fable Anniversary PC - Acquiring Avo's Tear 

			Views: 212		

			It's quite simple, really. The only hard part is you must finish the original part of the game first, throw away the Sword of Aeons, and begin The Lost Chapters before you can claim this sword.		

This game has been awesome! I got it for $14 with a coupon, and it was worth every penny. No, it's not optimized so well that it feels like a brand new game, but if you were a fan of the original, you should love this! Apparently, there were some game-breaking bugs when the game was first released on PC, but with my main system, I haven't detected any problems. The game looks much better than the original version, and I ran on max settings at a constant 60 FPS. When trying to play on my Surface Pro 2, the FPS did studder a lot, making it an unenjoyable gaming experience, but the SP2 only has integrated graphics. If you have a dedicated gaming PC, you shouldn't have any problems running this game.I just finished my first playthough of the Anniversary edition, and it was thoroughly enjoyable. The only annoying thing was the load screens, but they were quick, and only interrupted gameplay momentarily. I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs or glitches. The graphics look great, compared to the original game. Compared to modern games... they aren't that great, but they are certainly better than tolerable. The video I posted above was to show how the graphics look.If you're a fan of the original game, this version is a must have! If you're a fan of the series, but never played the original, this is the version you should play it on.			"

												Honestly, I have played the CRAP out of TLC. I've played this game for quite a bit of today and have come to the conclusion that most if not all of what these horrible reviews are saying is not the case. I have a mediocre computer, nothing special... this game has not frozen for me once, it has not demonstrated slow load times or high FPS or ANYTHING of the sort. This remake is more than worth it if you're a big fan of the original.To be completely honest the ONE problem I have with it is the clunkiness of your characters head movement. (Which was always clunky to begin with, but now with the updated graphics it just looks ridiculous at times). I quite frankly love the game already and yes, the menu navigation is a bit ridiculous but at the same time THOSE THINGS ARE NOT ""GAME BREAKING"" like others have tried to tell you.All in all it's still a great game and I would highly reccomend it if you want an updated version of the original, oh... and yes... Maze IS white.Pros:-Beautifully updated environment that actually took me breath away when first walking into Albion.-All the core elements have not been altered to the slightest degree. (Disregarding the menu interface)-Great game with hilarious puns and decent action that has the potential to keep a fan of the genre hooked from start to finish.-No frame rate problems as of yet, -Modding support? Yes please.Cons:-Clunky player character head movement.-Menu controls do frankly -SUCK-.-The main character's face is now ugly as all hell.There you have it, no misplaced hate... or misplaced love... just my honest opinion on what I think of this remake. Still a great game and I look forward to finishing it.			"

Posted: September 6, 2016
												Let take a look at what Fable Anniversary did right and what did it do wrong. I will be reveiwing the game in a pro/ con style where i will try to give as much detail as i can with the game.Pro:   The game has a really nice atmosphere. When playing i felt as if was playing a game like The Legend of Zelda Orcarina of Time. That really was cool to tap in to that sense of how similar in hero stories both are.   If playing on chicken mode, the player can easily take on any challenges without much worry since that mode has many features that are gone on heroic. Such as the ability to get money really easy, revive potions, more hp, and the ability to take more hits.   The achievements can be earned in diffferent ways, not all achievements but a good number can be earnd one way or another way depending on what the player chooses. One example was either winning the archery competition or pulling the sword from the stone nets the player the same achievement. This is awsome since it doesnt necessarily limit the player to do any thing specific that they wouldent necessarily do. Some people are either mainly archery or strength builds.   Lots of content for both a good playthrough and bad playthrough. Note that there isnt much of a major difference but it does have some minor changes between being good and bad or whatever choices you chose in specific moments. They give dialog difference for the most part but can not really do anything majorily different. For an example i could kill wisper in the collesum or just leave her to live and after that nothing different besides dialog is different.Con:   Enemies can easily block attacks and swing really fast. Thats ok if they do that only if i dont get major stun lock.   Major stun lock. Like the point above the game has some major stun lock on the player himself far more than the enemies they fight. The collesum is the worst part especially when fighting the 2 trolls or gollems at the same times since if you get hit once better have your fingers crossed that you dont get stun locked to hell. I got stun locked so bad that i went from max hp to near death 2 times with no ability to change the outcome.   The game at points does not explain things well. This goes for things like how to upgrade the archery skills and magic skills since the game doesnt tell you that 1 you can upgrade those skills in the same upgrade station and 2 the buttons to press to change the skill sets. I know it is simple but it is worth noting since the rest of the game explains things in good detail as to what this does and how to use it...ect   Heroic mode makes getting money hard and causes an entire skill to be useless. I played heroic mode and thought it was ok for a hard mode, especially since it is hard to get money but heres the issue; there is a skill that helps with getting money that even if you upgrade provides no help what so ever. If it does nothing then why not delete the skill for that difficulty, sure it has a stealth ability for that one stealth section but really it doesnt help much at all in that aspect either.   This game isnt metal gear solid so why do i need to stealth? I dont mind the option to stealth given if i want to be that player but it is a mechanic used once and done. It isnt even a good mechanic so why is it here? I know Orcarina of Time had stealth mechanics but that works since it wasnt a one and done thing. Also since i am talking about Zelda and stealth it worked in that game because it was for the most part simple and was not a huge deal since one can do it very easy since we can knock out the guards and pass through will ease. It isnt a big deal for this game but it is just an awkard mechanic to have when it is only used just once.    The inability to abbandon a side quest. Sometimes when your not carful which side quest you choose you might choose a villain side quest which again doesnt mess with your moral very much at all but can really be annoying if you realize that you are going to kill guards or civilians making an area pretty empty later. This causes you to avoid the area like the plague but the problem is sometimes you need to go to the area to go to another area to do a main quest item. Which means the player will need to kill the guards and civilians to be able to travers in and out of the area without having to load a previous save. If the player could return a quest to the guild to abandon the duty then awsome. I wont have to worry about killing innocent people when i am trying to play a strictly good guy.     Players can get villain quests at the guild...a guild full of heros. That is just akward and can cause people to acidently choose the wrong moral quests.      Rpg elements mean pretty much nothing. As a maxed out hero i can be easily killable reguardless of how much damage resistance i have or how much strength i have. Some enemies take alot of hits not counting the big enemies but the normal minions. What is the main way to survive is to focus on weapons and armor. Kinda makes the whole idea of leveling up pointless in some way not counting the accuracy, speed, and all the magic skills pretty pointless.     Wonky hit detection. Sometimes when you play the game you will take damage even though you dodge the arrow or sword swing. It is akward and can lead to some unfair deaths given the situation.     The flopping hero (lol). At times when you take a hit, your character will be locked in place while the enemies move freely. This may be a bug or glitch but it is an annoying issue i ran into many times while playing heroic mode. Since the enemies have free movement they can constantly hit you while you can obviously do nothing. After the game releases your character from being immoblized, he will flop multiple times which looks funny but wastes time and can lead to more damage being taken or being stuck in a stun lock.     Some bosses are just broken. Being broken doesnt mean unbeatable but just a real pain to fight because they have the ability to use magic. I dont mind that if it didnt do so much damage and they were always attacking which makes getting a hit in a real chore. The main one i feel is broken is the final boss since he has this magic ability to suck all the hp from the player. I dont know if this is just strictly heroic only moment or not but it is broken since the hp drops very fast and you die. It is unfair in the sense that you can not dodge it and if you dont have any healing items then your dead. The boss isnt too much of a trouble but that one move can make or break ones experience since it doesnt allow equality in other circumstances where people are low or have no health potions. All the other bosses you have a chance except maybe maze since he has the lightning spell that auto locks on which is again broken since you can not dodge unless your behind and object.   Archors can pre-aim. So if you turn the corner in a hallway and get hit by an archor immediantly passing the corner. That is unfair since the player has no chance of avoiding it unless they dodge roll pass the corner but still there is a chance they will shoot it after the roll animation which will cause a hit. Not just that but enemies can fire arrows at you without looking at you. It looks funny but again can be really broken since if the player doesnt know that this can happen then they will get hit thinking they can rush the enemies to attack with the sword.Conclusions:    Fable is not great of a game. It has really nice set peices but nothing really in terms of entertainment. There are weird bugs and glitches that can lead to some unfair and frustrating deaths depending on the difficulty. There was 2 pretty unfair bosses and other cons i put in the list. I am just too lazy to remention them again. I unfortunantly can not reccommend the game since i didnt really have fun playing the game and had issues with bugs and glitches.			"

												★★☆☆☆This HD remaster needs an HD remaster.  Fable Anniversary is an HD re-release of an old hack'n'slash RPG with simple morality systems, but its not especially HD.  People seem to love Fable 1, and hate Fable 3, but I would recommend the opposite.  + Nice music+ Hire bodyguards+ Good Performance+ Title screen is a book+ Skill line specific exps+ Interesting spell variety+ Decent fast travel system+ Buy property to live in or rent out+- Worldmap makes a decent loading screen+- No coop, but this game is old, so that's excuseable+- The boast system is a somewhat interesting idea, betting bonus objectives on quests, but handled clunkily and not very dynamic- Scars- Can't jump- Stealing isn't marked- Clunky spell selection- Escort quests hijack the game- Camera snaps when you end input- Have to go back home to levelup- Manually advance voiced dialogue- Weapon sockets/gems are permenant- Bodygaurds and escort NPCs can die- Clunky menus with tabs inside of tabs- Lockon to friendly targets on accident- Morality and NPC interactions are... lets just call them simple- The 2ish hour intro/tutorial to this game could be removed entirely- Bad save system, that only saves generic checkpoints, and doesn't even do that accurately- Picking up Exp orbs is a tedious mess, even with the pull, and they often get stuck behind objects- Graphics are pretty awful, for a remake made purely to improve the graphics, they may actually be worse than the original- Official mod support?  There are only a handful of mods, and all of them look terrible.  Supposedly the modding tools don't actually work.  * Controller recommended			"

												This is my second time giving this game a chance, and yet again it has severly failed me. The art style is still terrible, which I didn't expect to be fixed but is still worth noting, it says its running at 60 but I swear to god it feels like 20, it's just jagged, jittery, the controls are stiff, it basically takes the problems of the original and just makes them all worse, I don't understand how anyone has given this game a positive review, it baffles me.

												I could love this game. It's fun, it's amusing, it has all the earmarks of an entertaining experience.It also crashes frequently, characters get glitched in doorways time after time, controls are not nearly as responsive as they should be and when it crashes out, it takes ages to get it sorted out and a whack of messing about in the task manager to shut it down.Lovely gem of a game if you don't mind ripping your hair out in frustration after planning and executing a half hour battle only to see your efforts flushed down the rabbit hole due to a glitch up.Too buggy to be enjoyable.I played for more than three days offline which is why the time does not show up correctly on steam.

												I was kind of hyped for this game, And I have some bad stuff.Bad: -Menu controls are just terriblewell... that's basically it, I have not found anything else that REALLY bugs me, everyone is saying it keeps freezing and dropping FPS, have not happend to me at all. It is the same old Fable TLC, just a bit better graphics. The game also have a modding ability right now where you can mod stuff yourself or play a modded version, this makes it playable even more than TLC. To be honest, I'd play this version over the old one.Even though the menu controls are terrible, some mod might fix that, and if it does not, you will get used to it anyways.To the people having FPS problems/Freezes, have you tried updating your drivers? I don't know if that'll help, I would just recommend trying. Anyways.Yes, it is a console port, so was basically Skyrim for the PC too when it came out, even though it had better PC controls, it didn't really make up for it, so people modded it and well, everything is perfect now, I have hopes the same will happen for this.I will put a recommended on this one. I have enjoyed it so far, and I probably will in the future too.			"

												Okay. So I played 30 mins of Fable Anniversary and surprisingly, considering from the steam reviews I didn't get a single crash or froze. But I did get frame drops from 60fps to 25fps once, until I turned off the game's Vsync. Now I have 60fps to 85fps ingame. I understand that Vsync will produce the smoothest gameplay without any tears, but for this I didn't see that much tears. My graphics card is an EVGA NVIDIA GTX 650 TI SSC 1GB, and my CPU is an AMD FX 6300. My card is (correct if you want) a simply mid-to-high end graphics card that handles older games such as Skyrim, Far Cry 3, and TOMB RAIDER game.So what's the point?... Well, my PC isn't really a high-end computer especially with a cheaper AMD processor and Nvidia Card inside. I don't know why it works for mine but doesn't work for anyone else. Some reviews I read said that they can't even play the game at all.I bought and owned the Fable Lost Chapters PC version when it was on sale, also played the original version on the first Xbox console. My friend bought me Fable Anniversary as a gift so that way I didn't need to waste my money incase of horrible reviews. The game's good for what it is, but you gotta think Microsoft isn't too keen on testing out the game themselves before publishing it on Steam and assuming that the graphics are updated (which they aren't). So basically it's exactly the same Fable Anniversary from the xbox 360 version but ported on PC, same crappy face models, bloomy blur, sharpen textures, and same old audio recordings. Except you have a harder difficulty mode that you can choose and that you're force to use a controller since there's no mouse controls.I would only recommend this game if you don't own a Xbox 360 anymore (mine got the red ring of death) and that you own a 360 wired controller for your PC. Otherwise you're more likely to buy it on the console instead of PC. And also I wouldn't buy this game now, if I was you I would rather buy this when it's on a big sale. Like $15 or less, hopefully. So far I'm liking this remake even though it's crap, and I wonder when or where in the game I can use the DLC items if you already pre-purchase this game.Thanks for reading my review :)			"

Overall, the game plays better than i remember, i would have liked maybe some extra missions, but every remake i've bought this year including windwaker hd really didn't have anything new. I say it's worth it if you're new or a fan of the series.-editWith the updates, the problems that people were experiencing like the dark and light will outfits causing choppiness and the key mapping problems are gone. so the game seems even better than before, even though i think the people complaining about the mouse in the menu problem are still just being babies.

												All I can say is: REFUND ASAP!!!Pointless garbage. I own TLC, Fable 2 and Fable 3. This one is an insult to the original one and even with a discount it was overpriced. It should have been a patch instead.There is nothing good that is not already in TLC so Don't buy it. Buy Fable: The Lost Chapter instead. Don't worry about the mods, there are 10 or 12 of them, but as useless as this game is. There is a reason why Lionhead studio was shutdown.			"

												This game... is amazing. ON CONSOLE ONLY. Yes the pc is more often then not the best for games, but this game is the WORST possible port.Ive only played around 40 minutes of it and all it is is a texture pack over the main game, and that would be FINE if they FIXED THE DAMN BUGS AND MADE THIS GAME WITH MEDIOCRE GRAPHICS AND GAMEPLAY RUN RESONABLY WELL.My pc is... mid range, in short it wont be running witcher 3 on Ultra/Uber, but it can run Witcher 2 on high without ubersampling (Low with ubersampling) and stay at a resonable fps, but Fable Anniversary.. NOPE. not even on the lowest settings can it acheve over 7 fps, and i more than meet the recomended system requrements. I even went as far as overclocking and only obtained 12~ fps.I could forgive that... hmmmm if glitches and crashing where fixed. THE GLITCHES ARE CONSTANT... but sometimes funny so ill let that go. But crashing is unforgiveable, i mean THE INTRO OF TAWLKING TO YOUR DAD PERSON CRASHED SO MANY TIMES THAT THE FIRST 20 MINUTES OF MY SUPPOSID PLAY TIME WAS THAT DAMN CUTSCENE, STARTING QUESTS REQURES ME TO SAVE , TALK TO THE QUEST GIVER, LET THE GAME CRASH, LOAD MY SAVE, AND DO IT ONCE MORE AND HOPE I ACTUALLY GET THE DAMN QUEST. EVEN RIDE TO HELL AND ITS DRYHUMPING GAMEPLAY IS BETTER THAN THIS AT LEAST ITS RELIABLE THAT I GET TO DRYHUMP.... IF you run 4 titans in 4 way SLI have fun, if not Get used to crashes and low fps, oh make sure you have a duel cpu mother board, 4GHz ,12 cores, xeon cpu, and use 64 gigs of ECC ram to take advantage of the xeon cpu.But no, if you can get it to run its awesome... AMAZINGLY GOOD for such an old game. But with all my problems with it im afraid i have to say get it on console it will be much more enjoyable there.			"

												So far, after a couple of hours, I am content with my purchase.  Last time I played Fable was on the original XBox.  I am really enjoying this game.  I am enjoying the touch ups, and I look forward to play the Lost Chapers DLC for the first time.  A lot of complaints seems to be the controls.  I bought this looking forward to using a controller.  I believe that the Lost Chapters didn't support controllers.  So yeah, Fable Anniversary works great with a 360 controller.It is the original Fable with the Lost Chapters content, upgraded graphics, and works great with a controller... For those reasons, I recommend the game.			"

												I never played Fable so this is objective. I like the vibe of the game. The characters are funny  and witty. Graphics and sound are acceptable for 2014 in a sense that they get the job done. Gameplay is fine minus the controls which are taylored for console. Luckily I have a Logitech gamepad. Story seems well put together altough nothing that interesting. Overall a nice game untill Inquisition comes :). 8.6/10			"

The new one's graphics can be discribed with a sound, meh. The new inventory interface is  terrible. Its not friendly in the least. The main character graphics are terrible also.

												Overall I would say its a good and fun version of the game. I will not say there are not issues but moving over to a controller helped me with alot of them. Now saying that the menus are still a pain in the butt. It looks good and at least personally my visuals are not blurry as some have stated they can be. Game is just as fun as I remember with updated and very nice looking models, it is what I was expecting and thats all I can ask for. As to the price well considering what it is and that TLC is still available for less than a third the price I would say unless you really like the game and want to play it again in visual upgraded glory right now I could never blame you for waiting for it to be on sale.

												Performance is dreadfull, another poor optimized port from Xbox 360. Fable 3 runs better on my computer.To enhanced the performance you need to modify the configuration files manualy to disable most of the post-process wich is performance drain, the game is good, but for a remake, a few extra options in the menu would have been welcome, the worst part is that it's actuallty easy to implement.And you can modify key bindings except that is in another menu, that you need to activate.

												Fable is a wonderful game.from the beginning of your childhood its your choice of commiting evil deeds or be a nice boy.be good or bad, your choice will be soon or later visible on your hero. will it be a halo for the rightful and good player, or maybe horns and evil red fog for the chaotic evil persons? your choice.Little downside, you should play with a gamepad.its ok with mouse+keyboard but the real beautiy is unleashed if you use a gamepad (like PS3) and combo your fightingskills and/or spells.

												Fable 1 has been, and will always be, one of my favorite RPG ever released (along with Kotor and other amazing games) and this game does it justice. It looks great, plays great, and sounds great. It's exactly the game I wanted it to be....ALMOST. The only reason I'm recommending this game is because of how great the storyline and characters are, and how they managed to keep it exactly the same, while improving the graphics. But one major flaw, could've kept me from buying it...THE USER INTERFACE (UI) IS TERRIBLE! You can easily tell this is a game (much like ones we've seen in the past) that had almost no effort put into the PC version. This feels like it was stripped from console, added the ability to use a keyboard and mouse (barely) then released on PC for $35. Only buy this game if you have a controller to play it with, which completely defeats the purpose of buying it on PC. So I recommend this game to die hard fans of Fable (like me) but to NO ONE else until the terrible PC UI is fixed.			"

The bugs and glitches, along with stuttering and freezing issues seem to be PC based, I have had no issues at all with anything. If you're a die hard Fable fan like myself, then this is worth a shot. If you want to play it safe, check the reviews every week or so to see if there are any fixes etc out.			"

												I can't figure out why everyone is crying. Game looks fine, plays fine, I've had zero lag, my fps is fine, and the porting over to PC is alright. It is a game that requires a controller, but 99% of ports do in my opinion. The only thing I dislike is the new UI which I find overly cumbersome and annoying - but I'm used to it already. Graphics look better and still maintained their particular design style which is cartoonish to some. Overall I'm pleased with my purchase. It has given me a crisp experience without me having to dust off my old console.			"

												This remake runs identical to the original but with substantially better visuals. It's a joy to return to albion in HD. Keyboard and Mouse support is acceptable but could use some work. Similar to Fable: TLC, you start off your destiny as a young lad in the town of oakvale. It's from this beginning that you mold your hero in your liking, good or evil. You face many challenges that you must use your judgement to decide what is best, again, affecting your hero for good or evil. The story is great, and isn't lacking in combat. You could be a strong hero weilding greatswords, a swift archery killing with precision from a distance, or a master of the will, controlling the arcane arts. Fable isn't the perfect RPG, while you are for the most part free, the story is to some extent on rails and a little open ended. Also, don't expect a massive, expansive world like those in The Elder Scrolls because there is none. Fable is solely ""area"" based, where you travel from one end of a location to another between loading screens. All-in-All if you are a beloved long time fan of Fable, this is truly a welcomed site. The editor is an oustanding addition, and I can't wait to see the additions the fans of Fable will come to create. 84/100			"

												(REVISION)(9/16/14)The game has been fixed. All of my issues were addressed and rectified. No more game studdering MORE kbm support and haven't had any crashing issues.If you like the fable you will like this game!(release day)I want to start by saying I love this game, I played the original edition through multiple times so naturally I had to buy the anniversary edition. With that being said I am having HUGE issues running this game!My major issue is all the game studdering! I am 10 minutes into the game and this entire while I've been noticing all out lag at ALL different video settings. I know it's not on my side because I have a pretty powerful rig and this game (even with the new texturing) has super low system demands.With that being said I am stoked to finish playing through the game just wanted to give you all a heads up that if  something like game studder is a deal breaker for you that you may want to consider plugging in your old xbox rather than buying this game at the current time (atleast till issues are resolved)			"

												First off, while I am recommending this product, I will definitely say it lacks quite a bit of polish that it desperately needs.While I do miss the more cartoony style of Fable: The Lost Chapters, Fable: Anniversary does well in the way of bringing us the hit-and-miss Fable 2 graphical style.I can't speak for keyboard users, as I use a PS3 controller with ScarletCrush and while the menus have gotten a bit more confusing, controller navigation is a breeze.Really, my only complaint with this game is the fact that it randomly stutters after an hour or so of play. Then it'll clear up for a while after about 15 minutes of choppiness. Then happen again later. I really hope they can and will fix that, as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimization is inexcusable in this day and age. Especially for something so recent.In short; Would recommend, but maybe wait a while before buying. And god help you if you're using a keyboard.EDIT #1: After some tweaking of graphics options, I find the stuttering to be much less of a problem. If you want to minimize performance impact, sent Anisotropic Filtering to Medium, and all LOD options to low, then restart your game. I found this to be extremely helpful, and it still looks better and has exceptionally better draw distance than The Lost Chapters.			"

												Whilst I do love the game, and it is a very enjoyable game for me, this remake was somewhat disappointing. My biggest gripe with it was the lack of any new content. I also disliked that the textures/models were updated but the animations weren't. This led to some conflicts with the animations and models not coinciding and looking like they matched up correctly. A great game but in all honesty I uninstalled it as soon as I got all the achievements and decided to just stick with TLC as its the exact same game and takes less HDD space. I'd honestly recommend that over this.			"

												Great game, just like it always has been. However there seems to be some issues with the game such as fps drops, sound issues and random freezes these issues can be fixed if you spend your time to find the solution in the fourms. For me after looking it up i was able to fix it and it also seems to be isolated to the introduction village so it isnt that much of a problem. To sum up its a great game worth the money, future patches will make it more optimised and fix the tweeks (the devs have already said some sugestions in the fourms for fixes)  but they can be fixed if you spend some time on it .7.5/10 because of the few problems however 10/10 for the when it's fixed. I'm recommending this because it's a great game and the bugs are annoying but easily fixed and will be patched in future. "

												I have never played a Fable game in my life and it is my first time playing it. I think a person who had played the game in their childhood would greatly appreciate the remake, which is not my case.Gameplay wise, the controls are really clunky. I have tried both the keyboard and mouse combo and the Xbox 360 controller. The lock-on system is really frustating as it does not target the foe the camera is facing. When using the Xbox controller, there are too many emotes and spells to cycle through, which may be annoying during combat. I have only played a few hours, so maybe I have not become accustomed to the controls. Nonetheless, as a first time player, it is not enjoyable.Story wise, I cannot tell much about as I have not completed the game. From what I can tell, it is a rather simple story: *Spoilers* you control an orphaned kid throughout his journey to avenge the death of his parents. There are decisions to be made that will affect how people see you, either as a hero or a villain. That's pretty much what I understood from the few hours of gameplay.I can see why people like this game and I would have loved to finish it. But I really hate the controls. This is only my personal experience with the game and I am sure that many people had a much enjoyable experience.			"

Like if someone took a Ps2 game, ported it to 360, then to Mac, then to PS3, then onto a SNES cartridge, then finally made it playable on PC, that game would be this one. While the story is good, the gameplay is bad, the audio is bad, the graphics are bad. Most things about this game are bad. They could have updated the original game to meet today's standards, but instead they just repackaged it and sold it for 30 bucks. Don't waste money on this broken game from years ago.			"

												So I bought this game thinking it would look great and would blow me away with its visuals and new player models. Boy was I mistaken! So I booted up the game and I get to see all those old logos which was nice little bit of nostalgia but then the main menu shows up, and it's a book that opens up, everytime you launch the game. So you have to wait just a little but longer to even get into the menus/game. It's just tedious watching this damn book open everytime, just take me to the main menu please!Now the game looks a bit better to be honest. But it lacks the feeling of even being Fable at all. The characters all look weird now and don't have that charm they had from the previous version. All these old animations being used on newer looking models makes everyone just look awkward. But then there's you. You look like a train wreck! Someone ran over the heros face and now he looks like this weird, being of some sort that doesn't even look like he belongs in Fable. I couldn't get past it either. The Hero and The Guild Master just throw me off.Now the menus are just awful to navigate. It used to be you pressed pause and it would take you to a little menu that you could easily navigate through. It was simple and easy to get around in. Maybe a bit clunky but I had no problems with it. These new menus are trying to look all fancy and ""current gen"" but they somehow managed to make it complicated to figure out what's where. I got into my inventory and I was just so confused I couldn't tell what I was doing, and all I wanted was to equip my new weapon. Everything about this remaster of the classic is just too much if you ask me.The combat felt alright. I had no issues and infact felt like they had improved the AI some. Gameplay and all felt the same though and really felt alright. I was able to easily move around and do the side quests without any trouble. Don't take my review the wrong way it might not be all that bad but the visuals drove me away from this remake. Everything abouts new style really threw me off and not because I'm some nostalgia freak, but because it feels extremely unnatural, you can tell the quality in the cutscenes are lacking and the audio quality is a bit off (You can hear it clear as day if you compared the games) I don't recommend this game but instead, recommend you play the older one (Lost Chapters). However each is to their own so if this is the one you prefer then have at it! But I highly recommend you play the original!			"

												For all those people that complain about the game, why are you even playing it on a keyboard and mouse? Grab a controller and plug it to your PC. My experience has been great so far, yes there are some FPS drops, but my isn't freezing up or anything. The ony problem I've seen so far in the game is that when preview your suit, it combines other clothes in. For example, if you are missing a chestplate and boots in let's say a leather suit, and you were just previewing your guild suit, the guild shirt and boots will be shown in the preview of the incomplete leather suit.

												This is about as good as it gets as far as re-skins are concerned. Don't expect the stuttering/repeating npc dialog, invisible walls in doorways and assorted other glitches we all remember to be patched though as this is NOT a reboot or overhaul, It is just a re-release with an all new graphics engine and it was never stated to be anything other than that, So the self righteous idiots whining about lion head not re-coding the entire game to fix minor non game breaking bugs just need to grow up and stop their ignorant whining because they never said they were going to in the first place. -This game works perfectly fine on my laptop so it's probably not the GAME that isn't working, I and many other laptop users are experiencing NO problems with this game so it may just be a glitch in the software or maybe even with steam that only affects towers.- What you see is what you get, The original fable digitally remastered with new HD graphics and textures and some new albeit minor in game content, The gameplay mechanics are the same and the controls are for the most part original in setup and the game runs very smoothly. FORTUNATELY Lionhead had the decency to make this game open source so Fable SHOULD recieve the patches that it needs before too long! This game is well worth a purchase if it's on sale.			"

												I bought this for like 15 dollars on sale and I got to say, its worth 15 dollars but NOT worth 35. I beat fable 1 three times, the game itself is definitely worth the buy, but save your money and just get Fable the Lost Chapters. You are paying an extra 25 dollars for graphics that look like a refurbished ps2. THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A PS3/XBOX 360 LEVEL GRAPHIC GAME. The graphics are still terrible, you still see floating feet, weird head bopping, no facial expressions, they put absolutely no effort into refurbishing these graphics.If you want a well made refurbished game, get something like Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD or Final Fantasy 7 HD. This one was done half azzed. (Stupid mature language filter.)Of course, this is Lions Gate we are talking about, their entire series was done half azzed. Even on console. That's why Microsoft expunged them. Don't get me wrong, 10 bucks for Fable the Lost Chapters is worth it and they make a very good story. They just dont bother fixing many of their glitches and tend to half azz it once the story is done.IN A SHORT VERSION: Save your money and only buy this for 15 dollars max. This is not a very well refurbished game, go buy Fable the Lost Chapters instead.PS: Don't let the play time fool you, I've beaten Fable 1, 2, and 3, and the only thing new was the graphics. Which was very sad. You can see several graphical glitches left behind that were common in old games very clearly. (Floating feet, blotchy noises, sunken eyes, etc.) Games like Final Fantasy Series made in HD,  Halo Master Chief Edition, Resident Evil Remakes, and practically every other remastered game fixed most of these graphical glitches, this is the only one i've played that hasn't bothered even trying, and looks like all they did was squench the pixels together. Which you can do yourself with Nvida Control Panel or whatever software thats equiped with your graphics card. Extremely disappointing. How this got so many good reviews, I dont even know. People truly are stupid. They dont realize they can just buy Fable the Lost Chapters and manually refurbish the graphics themselves.			"

												I'm sorry for the little time I invested in this, but the game was just unplayable... period. THIS REVIEW HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY. I'm basing this on how I found the gameplay mechanics. There was A LOT of lag just in the introductory story. It took me a good couple of minutes to move from one house to another. Honestly, moving was the most awkward thing. I took a step, paused, took another step, paused. And maybe it was just me. I tried looking online to see what was wrong, but apparently it isn't me. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK IT UP! And there doesn't seem to be a solution to it or there might be but it requires you to do some complicated work apparently, which frankly, I do not have time for. Audio also didn't seem to match up with the CG cutscenes, and they too, were awkward. In one cutscene, I'm watching my character agonize over the death of their father but I'm also hearing gagging sounds and fighting noises in the background and it just doesn't match up whatsoever. I don't know.... couldn't kill to get a voice actor for your character as well to fill in the awkwardness? Idk... my character is freaking crying and I hear not a single sob. All I hear is, ""Grrr! Gawww! Swish!"" Like wth? xD Sorry but I just couldn't. I didn't care much for the graphics. Honestly, graphics looked terrible before I even bought this game but I do love story rich rpg games and it looked interesting so I got it anyway, which is why I was SO disappointed. I bet the game itself is splendid, but at this point, I'd rather watch a gameplay than actually play it. If you read reviews that say playing with a mouse and keyboard is terrible, they aren't lying. And playing with a controller doesn't make the gameplay better. Just saying. I've tried both methods. I know some ppl will judge me based on the time I spent, but it was hard to fully invest a lot of time in the game when I was having issues just doing basic functions. This review is simply what I experienced and possible a warning of what you might face because I am not the only one apparently who has had this issue. If you find your game working fine, I'm honestly really jealous. Lmao.			"

												The only issue at the moment (Launch) is the fact that you cant use your mouse when navigating the menu. Other than that it plays great and looks great. Higher FPS than the 360 version naturally. Even looks better too. Im not having any issues with it running or frame drops or the game not launching or random freezes so i dont know whats going on there. Im sure Lionhead will patch things up later if people are having issues.(EDIT: Also the keyboard controlls are abit arwkard to use at first but you get used to it)			"

												The game has too many glitches to be playable. I stopped playing when i was fighting someone and he teleported into a house i couldn't get into. The graphics are bad. The animation is bad. It's a fun game if you can get past the game breaking glitches and pretty much everything else			"

												This is a remake of a previous Fable game.   Orignally designed by Peter Molyneux each playthrough can be different because people can do good or bad things.  Lots of awesome improvements from full controller support to an entirely new mode called ""heroic mode"".  Oddly keyboard and mouse support is missing, while it works in game they dont work in menus.  The classic God Game style of right or wrong is here, but no punishment for either, choose your path adventurer!  Lots of replay value since people can play the game through different ways, some classics never die.Classic style and graphics means nothing is lost.  This feels like the game they always wanted to make.  Voice acting is AMAZING, not many games made like this its a must for any fan of adventuring.Heroic mode tip from GarouxBloodline:  When playing in Heroic Mode, there is a way to continually get health potions.  In front of the Heroes Guild is a statue when it spins around facing the picnic area the health items respawn in the area, but only while the statue is facing the picnic area. First mission is the most important, probably pivotal to the core of the entire game which involves finding a bear to give your sister.  Devs are very active in the community which is nice because its easy to report a bug or anything else. (Though cheaper than a new full priced game, there is so much story that the value is higher than the store price.)Controller users:Rating:  9/10  Value:  $39.99Mouse/Keyboard Users: (Playable but lack of menu functionality makes it tough to navigate things.)Rating:  5/10  Value:  $9.99			"

												8.5/10A great remake of an awesome game. Not only that the models and textures got improved (some faces look pretty silly, though), it also has better lighting and full controller support.Everything else (the story, the soundtrack, the voices) remained the same and that's GOOD, otherwise it'd feel weird to play through this once again (if you ever played the original that is).Still, the all-new Heroic Mode makes this even more enjoyable: Tougher enemies, new enemy spawns (e.g. a Troll spawns at the Greatwood Lake right at the beginning of the game) and NO RESURRECTION PHIALS!The achievements are a neat little addition as well and add to the game's replay value (at least 2 are kind of missable, one being the Silver Key one, one depending on your playstyle).________________________________________________________________The sad thing is, this game's community is full of ungrateful brats who keep thinking that patches don't exist and who prefer to insult the developers instead of just telling what their problems are.A few bugs on launch day (Skyrim, Age of Empires II HD and a whole lot of other games had those, too) were enough for people to call this game a ""dumb port"", ""huge failure"" and ""freaking disgrace"".They even turned the full controller support (which they wanted for the old game) into a bad thing, just for the sake of complaining.Still, the devs keep providing updates and bug fixes (even unofficial ones).But don't say that in this game's Community Discussion or else you're called a troll or even ""a member of the devs"", because some people still pretend that nothing is getting fixed, that this game sucks and that the devs should ""get cancer and die"".Check some of the negative reviews for ease of reference.________________________________________________________________This doesn't influence my rating above, though. I enjoyed playing through this game again (and even twice, a good character in normal mode, an evil character in heroic mode).			"

Gameplay feels like moon walking, every action is so slow and I really have no patience to open the equipment section everytime to eat certain fattening foods nor the need to hotkey foods.                All the game and menu lag cannot beat the nostalgia and pride you get after watching the story unfold and realize how this game has inspired games like Elder Scrolls: Skyrim and Dragon Age: origins in certain aspects. I for one think that DOA had directly stolen the entire opening plot from Fable 1.                 All in all great storyline, you can relive Fable: Lost Chapters through Youtube other than this bloated Pile of junk.			"

												Yep, it's Fable: The Lost Chapter with updated Xbox 360 graphics.... I wonder if we can still get those super-hidden wood-cutting axes that were hidden in the game' files... (well, at least, I remember that, and I'm remind people of that, and also teaching people of that.)...I tried playing the game from work, with an Xbox One controller., on my work PC... I can hardly run the game without fearing the CPU to melt. Lagging, sound drags... It's ""playable"", but not recommended... So I'll have to play it at home.The resolution options are pretty restricted. You wont get anything under ""1000x[...]"", and even with every settings set at Low the game still looks very pretty....Did anyone noticed that the moment the game became unlocked, on the game page, the Heroes and Vilains Content Pack DLC had a discount set at 100%?... The final price of the DLC was locked at 0.01$.			"

												I was really looking forward to Fable anniversary, and intial playing of it was great, I like the idea of following a hero from childhood.  However |  then reached the quest where you have to help a person get to  a farm using ""follow and wait"" comands. No problem have done that  in assasins creed - or so i thought. I amplaying with an xbosx control as a lot of thses games are easier with a controller, not this one. You have to use the dpad to issue the commands, whbich would be ok if there were 3 or 4 - but no most of the expresions you need are on the dpad, ie: you set it up with the ones yopu need, or you try to.  I started getting problems, and thought I wil;l check the manual - absulotely no help. Ok next step google, OMG hundreds of pleqas fro help doing this. Well after struggling  for several days (well it feels like it - in reality 5/6 hours) I have given up - I could have put up witht auto saves but not the ""dpad"" Why do game manufacturers do this, if thet are fgoing to put in a fairly complicated key  EXPLAIN how it works. Once again what could be a great game spoiled by silly controls.  Why dont they learn from one another, after all Assasins credd controls are ok (apart from climbing a wall when run when chasinf a person - I can live with that!I really do not recomend this game ""unless you have the patience of jove"".By the way i don't usually review games, but fable has got right under my collar.

However, the thing that stopped me from continuing with the game was the controls. Using the controller became really annoying for me. Just doing simple things became the most infuriating chores. I've never played the original version but from what I understand, it's not that different and uses keyboard+mouse. You'll probably have more luck buying that instead.			"

												For the most part it's a great game. There are some concerns about binding controls to the keyborad. For example. I could not take off the bandit helm after placing it on me, half the game people thought I was a villian. Some of the controls don't match over greatly with keyborad, leaving you unable to do certain things for the most part. It's a great game. That reminded me why I fell in love with the fable series. Still, you would think after ten years they would have ironed out these bugs to the PC. They have not.			"

												Unbalanced nonsensical piece of garbage.3 Whole strenght based skill. Strenght (mediocre, pulled down by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ melee system), Armor (useless), Health(at least worth something).3 Whole dexterity based skill. Guile=Charisma/Stealth (useless), speed (next to useless) accuracy (actually useful)A bunch of magical skills. Timeslow, Multistrike, Heal and Mana is useful. The rest are useless.All of them are from 1-7 except spells, which go from 1-4.There are two melee attacks, a regular, and a charged attack, which can only be executed at certain times. Ranged attacks have to be charged. Some spells like Fireball can be supercharged, which will make them more powerful.Ther are four XP types. General, Melee, Skill, Magic. Each XP can only be spent on its own skills, except General, which can be spent on anything. Melee XP comes from hitting stuff in melee, Skill XP comes from trading and shooting stuff with bows and crossbows, magic XP comes from casting spells (any spell, as long as it hits a valid target. Like Fireball anyone, Healing always gives xp, since you are a valid target). General XP only received on killing the target, or at certain quest reward points. All XP rewards subject to the combat multiplier, except for the quest rewards.Story (so far) bandits ransack your village, killing everyone, except you, your mother and sister. Apparently you are part of some sort of ancient bloodline, who can do stuff because reasons. Then each time you finish the quest, you get a DEUS EX FAKLOGIC level help to continue your epic quest to save your family. Then you get captured, and tortured, and you have to play this part because the developers are sociopaths. I mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly attempt to create emotional vestment which they miserably failed just like in the previous ten or so hours. I mean... okay, I give up, there is literally no reason to play through your own torture. This is where I stopped.Overall, mediocre mechanics, FAKLOGIC level story, which actually pulls down this game into the ""don't. just don't. Burn your disc. It's not even worth to be under your beerglass."" category.			"

												This game is amazing! So much fun. I never really finished the original Fable game, I spent my time killing random people and what not, but that was a long time ago. I played this a good while, and I love it! The remake is noticeably different than the original, HD graphics and a smoother engine. The dev's poured their heart and souls into this remake. This game is an easy 9/10.			"

												This is a remaster, a GOOD remaster of a game I have seen in a while. It improves on the gameplay mechanics, while still not ruining some of the moments from the original Fable on the original Xbox. Overall, I think it looks great. There are some few creepy faces here and there, but overall it is a very good remastered version of the original game. Every choice matters. Your character undergoes some changes as you progress along the story whether good or bad, depending on what you do in game. Overall, Fable Anniversary is an example of a good remastered game done right in my opinion. And yes, I have played the original Fable on the Xbox. I have also played Fable II and III.			"

												Fable is an old classic RPG game for me. <3I simply love the way the hero gets to make choices between evil and good acts, and the deeper he walks into that path, the more it's shown on himself.You can also go around kicking chickens, or buy all the houses and have villagers reside in them, giving you a little cash over the days.It has a simple Trading system (tho with sorta a bug that allows you to get infinite gold, not sure if it was fixed on this version. I think not).Anyway, this game is a must try.If you love RPG games, just play this, it's one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												So It's hard to rate this game honestly because today's standards for RPGs are so much greater than they were back when fable first came out, but I am going to rate it honestly by today's standards. I have also played the original and is probably one of my more favorite games for the xbox.Story:  5/10While the game is funny with a multitude of different side characters and side quests the game is overall short and does not immerse you well enough in to the world of fable. Since the story is short,  it makes everything seem to fly by, leaving  no real build up of characters and backstories, even though you can hear them briefly at the end of the game. The story does have it's twists, but at least to me, aren't super shocking and mind blowing.Gameplay/Combat: 4/5I do however enjoy the action combat. Nearly full control over what you can do, with no one type of combat (power,skill,will) feeling way overpowered, until maybe the last act of the game. The makers did very well in creating will powers that complement power and skill (personal favorite combo = slow time + multistrike + melee) making you not want to be purely a mage or warrior. This is an old game so sometimes targeting can be sketchy but overall a fun combat system.Replayability/Postgame:  0.5/2When you beat the game, you may have some sidequests leftover, but overall nothing extra once you are done. There is a little pull to create a new character and play the game in order to be the opposite of what you were the first time (good/evil) but its not really worth it.Graphics: 1.5/3This is an HD remake of the original so it the environment and characters do look nicer than it did in the original. However, it is not breaking any records and does not impress me to give it more than an average score.Music  0.5/2 - Not many tracks, Not really any standout tracks. Unique boss music? nope. Pretty much the music is there and the music fits the area you are in.Misc/Unique extras:  1.5/3Customization wise, I like that armor changes your appearance but the overall selection seems kind of small. There is no real benefit to wear cool or funny gear that you get because the armor values are much lower than the warrior plate armor, while at the same time the plate armor does not dull your mage abilities. The game being funny is definitely a bonus. I still like Fable's unique experience system (general/skill/will/power) where basically you get general experience and then bonus experience for whatever fighting style you did that battle. The new ""hard mode"" is another new pull that can get the hardcore gamers a little more challenge.Overall 13/25The problem really is the story has not held up over the years, and this is an rpg meaning the game score should be heavily weighted towards the story and that's what I did.  Gameplay is still solid by today's standards and should not be overlooked. based on the score  this game hardly gets a thumbs up but I' would give it a thumbs up because it is a game worth playing especially for nostalgia purposes. This game also played a big role in RPGs, helping lead the way to more decision based RPG games.			"

												Playing this game brought back so many old memories. After playing the original game for years and years it was nice to see this remastered and experience it in a HD world. The graphics are a change from the original and look nice but all gameplay stays the same which is good, including that pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Knothole Glade bug where one of the traders decides to not exist. It was great to get this and then put my fable TLC knowledge to work and 100% this again worth getting 10/10			"

												There's a lot of negative reviews for this game, and rightly so from when it first launched.  I wanted to share my experience with the game as of 2016/02/23.  Windows 10, 32GB, nVidia GTX 970, drivers v361.91.In short:  through 51 hours of playtime I suffered one crash.  There were no UI or usability issues except for one.  There was an issue with shadow textures but I had been ALT-TABbing significantly and the game had been running continuously for about 30 hours; a restart removed the issue.  It's a great revamp of the original TLC and caused me to lug out my XBox 360 and Fable II and III so I could play through them again as well.No game is bug free and I'm sure this one has its fair sure and that I was lucky to not run into them, but I didn't.  I enjoyed the game tremendously.If you enjoy Fable I recommend this game to you. "

												Wished that Fables 2 because, with a game as good as Fable Anniversary, players like me will want MORE Fable! Fable 3 was out, but Valve apparently took it down years back. A shame! That's all in the past now. On to the Pros and Cons we go![Pros]*Texture is 8/10. Have not played the original Fable, or Fable: The Lost Chapters, but I must say that the rich textures put this game on par with Fable 3. Well done, Lionhead Studios!*Storyline is 4/5! Chicken difficulty is kinda misleading. As you level up, the enemies get tougher. So, it is no shame to play on Chicken difficulty. Heck, I'm currently playing on that difficulty, and I'm loving it!*Though I have not yet finished the game, the length of the game so far is, to say the least, reasonable. I'd recommend to those new to Fable games to play at their own pace, and not rush!*Kudos to the members of Lionhead Studios who added in famous KFC line ""Finger-lickin' good""; that was both brilliant and hilarious!*Tip to making easy coin when not doing a quest (be it a gold, silver, or bronze quest), are the Game Masters. Black Jack is my favorite, because it is not timed! Save after each win, though, because a loss can be quite aweful if ever you choose to double the bet.[Cons]*Unlike Fable 3, your character and his wifey cannot have a child! What about adopting? Negatory on that. It's like the prince of Fable 3 is not related to the Hero of Fable Anniversary! Earth to Lionhead Studios; Hero x Woman + Sex = Next Hero!*Fable Anniversary? Sounds like a bundle for the Fable games. Why, oh Lionhead, did you not make Fable 2 and 3 compatible with PC? Fable Anniversary could've been used as a label for a bundle containing Fables 1-3! Oh well!Is this game worth the price? On sale? It's worth it either way, but I must recommend getting it when it goes on sale! Who knows? There may be another awesome game on Steam! Anyways. I hope this review helps you in deciding on whether you want this game or not! Peace out, y'all!			"

												There has only ever been two games in existence that I have stated are ""the best game of all time"" and the original Fable held the title for years. With that being said, quite obviously, seeing the ""HD"" remake finally come to PC deserved more than my attention.I understood that no mere remake would ever come close to the experience I had when playing the original, nor did I expect this anniversary edition to be held to such a high standard. What I did expect however was to go on a glorified nostalgia trip and bellow in the good times of yonder and upon release, I did not think this game could offer that due to the sheer amount of bugs and crashes that occured, jest I forget the bloody awful blur that was everywhere, but a few patches later, it is absolutely worthy of merit. There are however, some gripes which still have not been ""fixed"".A PC game should use a mouse and keyboard apppropriately in whichever way makes it easier for the user. Good PC ports understand this simple concept and use both inputs as intended, however, poor ports which have clearly been rushed out and unpolished do not and often retain keyboard controls where they should not be. Sadly, Fable Anniversary is the latter. No mouse controls in menus whatsoever is frustrating beyond comprehension and should never occur. It still makes me wonder how when the game was originally released, it can pass quality control, not only by Lionheads testers, but by this distrubution service. It should not be legal to advertise and sell a product as a polished fully-working release when this is quite clearly not that. It is truly sadenning to see how poorly Lionhead Studios performs since Molyneux's depart and the fact this thing was released in such a state shows an utter lack of respect for the PC audience as a whole. Of course, as previously mentioned, the majority of gripes have been fixed now, but the release sure was off-putting.Graphically, it does overall look quite pleasing. The environments are relatable to the original and look most grand. The models however, espescially the hero, look laughable and plastic.The ""Heroic Mode"", which was advertised as an extremely hard mode, was really not noticable. Apart from the lack of resserection phails (lives), the game was overall quite forgiving in both combat and items. I never truly felt challenged and I believe I only died once overall, which, considering I'm so bad at games in general, should say it all. I had a lot of fun with the achievements, even if one of them was bugged and I had to do the whole bloody thing all over again (silver keys are so unrad). Overall, it's quite easy no matter which mode you're on, now the bugs have been patched, it's quite a nice nostalgia trip to the original and I would recommend it to not only original Fable fans, but to people who never got around to playing the original and want to give it a shot in HD glory.

												Fable Anniversary enhances the original with better graphics and visuals. As a fan of the original Fable back in 2005, this version of the game still holds it's charm. It's difficult to write a review without nostalgia getting in the way but, in my own opinions heres what I have to say about this game.If you have never played a Fable game before, there is no better game to start the series off with than by playing the first one. If you enjoy decision making elements in rpgs than this is your game. The story and music is excellent as well as has a good sense of humor. You will be solving riddles and completing side quests that build your characters alignment (good or evil). Fighting all sorts of humans and creatures on the way using mele, range, or magic. Depending on what paths to take is all up to you.Don't keep standing there like a lemon and buy this game already! :P			"

												EXTREAMLY OVER RATED!But still a good game. Its decent, you start off as a boy watching your childhood burn and transform into adulthood where you can be good or evil. Its got some irritating features like the fact that enemys can block almost all your mele attacks unless you do the stupid florish which i can only get to work half the time. Then theres the fact that the game itself gets very repeditive with its sidequests and if you wana play as an evil character forget it. Every enemy you kill gives you good karma so every town you visit you better make sure you kill at least a dozen people to keep those horns. The story itself is argueably the best in the fable series and the main villian actually looks like a VILLIAN so thats good. Wider variety of spells  and mele weapons is nice but only two types of ranged weapons. All in all its another one of those games that needs a thumb going sideways.P.S. Buy on sale.P.S.S. The DLC is extreamly short.			"

												This was a horrible port. I have had mutiple problems with this game when i first preorder it. First of all when i started the game the first thing i noticed was the frame rate dropping dramatically so i tried setting the graphics to low hoping it would improve but it didn't work. Another thing that was annoying was that the game was constantly freezing up every 15-20 seconds it's also worst in combat, sometimes the game will crash randomly for no reason at all, the controls are pretty bad when i used a keyboard and mouse but it works great with a controller, and another thing that happen was when you lock onto an enemy it will somethings lock onto a friendly target instead accidently hitting them.Until Lionhead fixes these problems i would recommend you play the lost chapters instead.Edit1: It looks like they fixed the issues that i've stated in my review so now i would like to change this review and say that i would recommend this to anyone that's a fan of fable or is new to the series.

												I remember when this first came out there were Mixed reviews and I was heartbroken to see that Fable Anniversary wasnt  the port everyone wanted it to be. Fast forward one year, I have purchased the game on sale and I can gladly say, the port works amazingly. I will say that by default, the graphics and color palette are bland. I strongly recommend you look up Sweet Fx presets so that you can really feel that Fable 'Fantasy' mood again. Once you have that installed, it felt so compelling to play the game once more. The textures are a nice facelift and it feels even better to play a simple RPG since nowadays in 2015 all the RPG's are insansely huge. If you are a hardcore Fable fan, I would recommend you look into the Sweet FX visual presets and you should feel right at home with this 2005 classic as it plays just as good with some minor annoyances.

												I feel like, after having played Fable on Xbox as a child, and now the Anniversary edition on PC, I am good to leave a short review. Please keep in mind I played the game using an Xbox 360 controller, which makes things such as the UI and all the menus relatively easy for me to use and I have therefore had no trouble with the PC porting.The first thing I noticed when I started the game was the graphics overhaul. While the characters in game where not the prettiest in the old Fable, the overhauled characters topped the being ugly by far. It's great they tried making the faces look more ""real"", but the people look more like trolls than people to me. I love how the difficulty of Fable is rather low, so even idiots like me can play and finish the game, even without dying once. The addition of the Heroic difficulty is a nice addition for players that pack more of a punch than I do. Luckily, there is plenty of possibility to grind, if you have the patience.I have personally not noticed any bugs and glitches that bothered me during the game, except for one exploit which I used to obtain an otherwise unobtainable silver key. During my play-through, the game only crashed once, which is acceptable, considering some of the games in my library crash every 25 minutes.Overall, for those of your playing with a controller, this game should be no trouble at all to play. For those using their mouses and keyboards, if you can manage to look through the bad porting, well, you may enjoy it as much as I have.			"

The only downfall is there are some minor glitches in this PC version that need fixing. Aside from bugs and glitches... perfect remake of the original Fable I love so much.			"

												This game is still in an unfinished state. The 8GB mod pack you have to download just to use any mod is ridiculous and was supposed to be a temporary thing. Also, the upload tool doesn't even work correctly as far as I'm aware and it only lets you change art and animation. That's probably why there's so few mods on the Workshop. There should be hundreds! More graphics options need to be added like FXAA toggle, depth of field toggle, etc. We shouldn't have to download mods to have these options. There are also still menu bugs that I've noticed. This is really disgraceful on Lionhead's part.			"

Not quite what I anticipated.Fable is a wonderful game, and is one of my favorite games as a child. I played through it several times, clocking in many hours of this game. I love this game, I really do.That being said, it breaks my heart that Fable Anniversary is a poorly done port of the original. The only real improvement in this game was the visuals. However those visuals weren't as dolled up as I had previously hoped; the only real improvements to Fable Anniversary is that it has a new coat of paint.That is seriously it; a fresh, albeit sloppy, paint job. No new movement animation for cutscenes, fights, gameplay, or anything. While I'm not saying this is a bad thing, I'm really upset how they didn't bother improving anything else; because Fable was kind of ugly. They had so much room for improvements, but they barely did a damn thing.The menus are rediculously hard to maneuver through, and honestly look worse than in the original Fable. The new UI is.. okay; nothing really exciting, but everything is where it was before..I love this game, and I will not stop playing it; just because I was dissapointed severly with Fable Anniversary.I would not recommend anyone buy this remake at full price. Ever. I bought it on sale; so I would tell you to do the same.Or you could always buy the original Fable: The Lost Chapter for a third of Anniversary's pricetag. Unless, that is, you care for Achievements and muh Trading Cards.			"

												I love Fable. The 2nd and 3rd one not so much.Fable anniversary is the Lost Chapters but with the graphics updated. All the old exploits are still their, ( Except on heroic the shop theft is harder to pull off since each bar only sells about3-5 beer per each restock)I have had no issues with bugs except when using the fable 2 and 3 style controls with a controller I found the A button would be unresponsive.  However I switched to teh Classic controls of Fable and had no issue of any kind and still haven't since.The only negative thing I have to say is that the dlc armor is kinda meh. I used a couple of teh new sets and some of the arm pieces have issues with no clipping if you use a bow.All in all its the Fable we all enjoyed but with better graphics.			"

												FABLE just by itself is a fun game to play, but the lost chapters made it batter adding on to the story BUT!, the fable anniversary gives you the best of both worlds, you get a high quality remake with better graphics, the lost chapters are included, more weapons n costumes in  the anniversary, and acheivements, i mean they arent that important but in my opinion the achievments add to the gameplay, this version is just an upgraded version of fabel the lost chapters, really dam fun.

												If you liked Fable on the xbox, get this one; not the Lost Chapters PC port. There are some new things added to this version that don't seem to be in the way; nothing offensive that I've seen so far. I really like this update, everything about it. It's good old fable with new graphics, the gameplay holds up.What would be cool is if expanded campaigns were added to this game, like maybe a Whisper campaign? Or maybe a sandbox version... multiplayer; please don't stop developing this.			"

												Full disclosure: I didn’t play the original Fable when it first came out, so I can’t compare the two.Fable Anniversary is a solid third-person RPG; not a great game by any means but not a bad one either. The controls are a little clunky and the story is fairly uninspired. That being said, this game will certainly keep you entertained for close to twenty hours, longer if you make a real attempt to find all the secrets. Worth picking up if you’re looking for a basic RPG experience.			"

The game now has a hard mode for those that want to try a more challenging version than the original and want to see the updated graphics and are afraid it will be to repetitive.Pro: -Great remake with all the classic features -Some bonus content with dlc if you want new weapons and armor that don't break game Con: -It has all the classic features including some of the original annoying bugs and glitches. -The new dlc doesn't change the game in a major way to make it worth it unless on sale and you still have to buy dlc items in the ingame shop there isn't a way to get them instantly.

												HOT, BUTTERY BITTER-SWEET NOSTALGIAWhat can any of us ay about a game that has impacted countless games after it?I doubt very much, but here I shall try....Fable Anniversary takes the iconic classic first entry in the brilliant Fable series and glosses it up in high-res sugary anthrax. What do I mean by that? That the game still does so very much right (great story, decent depth, and a combat system that won't leave you throwing the controller too often), but it falls short when compared to the many titles that have built upon its great foundation.That being said, I higly recommend this game to anyone that hasn't ever played it, and even a good bit of those who did, and loved it, hated it, and couldn't put it down....

												Fable Anniversary is a game that was marketed to be the best thing since Fable: The Lost Chapters. The game itsself is indeed a remake of the original but it seems as though they focused more on making it look up to date instead of fixing the painful small bugs that existed in the original and TLC.I bought this game instead of the original because this one has controller support - and as someone who played the original on the Xbox, this is a must.Pros: Controller support Higher resolution textures than original NostalgiaCons: They really butchered the menu Some bugs are still present from the original The main menu takes ages to open the damn book (really, why!?) The cutscenes still look like 1980All in all, I would not recomend this game to people who liked the original Fable and intend to buy this for nostalgia (unless the nostalgia is strong enough to weigh two points against the cons list). New players to Fable should get this one though. It has better quality textures and the story is exactly the same.6/10 would probably recommend depending on nostalgia levels.			"

												I like this remake! Twin Blades looks odd but he kinda always did all long arms and short legs. I would pay full price if I could afford it and then just play it maybe once a month when ever the Fable fever would hit me. I used to play Fable 3 but for the most part that game sucks, however for a brain dead drunk person it can be good.I want to see Fable 2 remade and intergrated with this one. There was always talk of raising a family then dying of old age only to take control of the child you had raised! I want to see that but make Fable 1 the starting point since Fable 2 is very similar to the map of Fable 1.			"

												Maybe this is a good game. However for me, it is not playable.There're 2 reasons which drive me away from Fable Anniversary:First, playing this game with keyboard and mouse felt uncomfortable. Clunkier than I thought it would be.So, I plugged in my controller and tried it again. However it only made my experience worse. Here's the second reason:Everytime I pulled or pushed my left stick to order my character to do a 180 degree turn, the camera shaked for 1.5 second. And this kind of camera shaking was something that I had never seen before. It shaked in a strange frequency and made me feel really dizzy. After just one minute game play with the controller, I had to quit the game because if I didn't do that, I would have a bad headache, literally. I don't know if anyone else has the same problem. However to me, this game is not playable with either keyboard & mouse, or a controller.So, yeah, I have to give it a thumb-down.PS: I know some people may argue, but turning back means turning 180 degree, not 360 degree. Turning 360 degree means making a circle and your eyes will still be looking at the same direction. If you have a mechanical clock just look at its arms and imagine they are representing the direction of your line of sight, and you will understand.			"

												If only there was a more middle of the road button. D:Anyway, I'll say this much-- I haven't run into all the same glitches everyone else has reported yet, and some of them are quite the same as what Fable had prior to remodeling. It's an overrated version of the original, which is why I only bought it when on sale. I give credit where credit is due; it does look somewhat nicer than it was (Read: They cut corners), but I guess I'm a bit harsh when it comes to game aesthetics. Also let's be realistic here; the game itself is still good content-wise. If the glitches happen to hinder your ability to play it, then go back to the original copy if you've got one floating around. The only bad bug I encountered so far is that the voices tend to cut out randomly. With subtitles, I can live with that.Bottom line is, its still Fable. Its still buggy-yet-easy as ever, it's still basically the game so many know and love. Could it have been redone better? Absolutely. But evidently, this is what we're getting. Here's to hoping they decide to clean it up a bit more.Meanwhile, I'll continue playing it on and off until more glitches annoy the living hell out of me. :3 "

												This game is one of my all time favorite games and probably my favorite RPG game.Fable is so immersive and sucks you in with its charm and vast dialogue, personally I think this is the pinnacle of a solo RPG game and the best of the Fable franchise.I could write alot about this game but to try keep it short; if you enjoy fantasy games and want a indulgent campaign to play through it is a must buy, it is one of few games that I have genuinly been dissapointed to have finished everything on and have no more reason to play.I would suggest playing it through on the harder difficulty (introduced by the Anniversary edition) and also take your time with the story and complete all the side quests along the way to make sure you get your times worth as there is unfortunatley little end game content.But overall this game for me is pure enjoyment although that may be partly to blame on the nostalgia from my first play through on Xbox Classic.

												This is far from a remake. Whilst playing the visuals were far less pleasing than what I expected. Anything far away is blurred beyond recognition and my screen tore what I was seeing unless I turned V-sync on which limits you to 60fps. And don’t get me started on the horrible UI in the menu. I would reccomend 'Fable: The Lost Chapters' over this version. However if you are not to fussy about the things I've mentioned it is quite playable with a controller. And it may be worth mentioning that controller support is somthing that 'The Lost Chapters' does not haveGame itself (The Lost Chapters) 10/10PC functionality (this port): 3/10Controller highly recommendedEdit: The addition of the Sweet FX mod gets rid of the blur and also enhances alot of other graphical features.

												A worthy update of one of my favourite games of all time. The hero's face is, however, incredibly ugly and weord-looking compared to the original, but chuck a helmet over his ugly mug and you'll hardly notice it as you murder townsfolk and buy their property to rent to the next batch of cattle. Or do good deeds but... Gotta pay the bills somehow.			"

												A nice facelift for an all time classic. Decide wether to be the hero or the villain, help the people or torment them, kick the chicken....or kick it harder! If you own the original it may not be the best decision to do the upgrade but if you want to get into the game for the first time, shoot for this nice graphic update.Pros :- Interesting Story- Good RPG Elements- Freedom of Choice- Good Soundtrack- A lot of replayabilityCons :- Upgrades not sooo noticable to buy the game full price- Some parts/Quests are very tediousOverall :Thumps up, you gotta try it, people!Cheers			"

												For any of those wondering. This game will bring back all the nostalgia feels of fable: the lost chapters. I myself played the hell out of the first one and thought it was the best one by far as compared to the others. This games storyline is so basis to set you up and not drag you in so hard where you feel this sense of constant repetitivness. The games story really drags you in a very appropriate manor being that there is alot of humor and things you can relate to in the game. Not a free world RPG but it doesn't need to be because it's fable. Seriously this games awesome and the remake makes is 10x better. Nothing new except some new spells and graphic visuals and funny looking people. 15/10 any given day.			"

												Like a bunch of other people reviewing this, I loved it when I was a kid. Despite my love I had not played it since though, and in this day of better looking, controlling, and more fleshed out games, i went back and put 30 hours in. Something about Fable draws me into the world of Albion and I get swept away. While I have countless other games I have paid for and never played, I don't regret spending time on this classic again.			"

												Full disclosure: I didn’t play the original Fable when it first came out, so I can’t compare the two.Fable Anniversary is a solid third-person RPG; not a great game by any means but not a bad one either. The controls are a little clunky and the story is fairly uninspired. That being said, this game will certainly keep you entertained for close to twenty hours, longer if you make a real attempt to find all the secrets. Worth picking up if you’re looking for a basic RPG experience.			"

The game now has a hard mode for those that want to try a more challenging version than the original and want to see the updated graphics and are afraid it will be to repetitive.Pro: -Great remake with all the classic features -Some bonus content with dlc if you want new weapons and armor that don't break game Con: -It has all the classic features including some of the original annoying bugs and glitches. -The new dlc doesn't change the game in a major way to make it worth it unless on sale and you still have to buy dlc items in the ingame shop there isn't a way to get them instantly.

												Fable Anniversary is a game that was marketed to be the best thing since Fable: The Lost Chapters. The game itsself is indeed a remake of the original but it seems as though they focused more on making it look up to date instead of fixing the painful small bugs that existed in the original and TLC.I bought this game instead of the original because this one has controller support - and as someone who played the original on the Xbox, this is a must.Pros: Controller support Higher resolution textures than original NostalgiaCons: They really butchered the menu Some bugs are still present from the original The main menu takes ages to open the damn book (really, why!?) The cutscenes still look like 1980All in all, I would not recomend this game to people who liked the original Fable and intend to buy this for nostalgia (unless the nostalgia is strong enough to weigh two points against the cons list). New players to Fable should get this one though. It has better quality textures and the story is exactly the same.6/10 would probably recommend depending on nostalgia levels.			"

												Fable was one of my favourite RPG games on PC when it was first released in 2004. The story is gripping, the graphics is certianly much more polished and the sound effect is for sure much better compared to 2004 version. Fable has aged well, partly because some of its best ideas have since become action-RPG staples - things like real-time combat, good-evil alignment and a world that reacts to your actions. Fable didn’t invent any of these things, but it does them well and uniquely enough that it’s still fun to play today.Fable has aged well, partly because some of its best ideas have since become action-RPG staples - things like real-time combat, good-evil alignment and a world that reacts to your actions. Fable didn’t invent any of these things, but it does them well and uniquely enough that it’s still fun to play today. It’s easy to feel at home in this fantastical version of England’s green and pleasant land, where the countryside goes on forever and nobody is from inside the M25, and you’re greeted by cheers and applauding admirers whenever you step into the village pub for a pint. The place feels alive.Fable is a simple and recognisable heroic tale at heart - you go from young boy to storied warrior, leaving your mark on the land of Albion, and eventually avenging your family - but the setting and sense of humour make it much more endearing than the usual po-faced videogame fantasy. The strange thing about Fable is that for all the choice it offers, there’s very little consequence. You can get married, but after that you can run off for literally years and leave your wife or husband alone and they don’t seem to mind. You can murder shopkeepers, but everyone soon forgets about it. Its morality is very simplistic and unsubtle by modern standards. This makes it feel rather shallow, but it also enables you to be playful with its morality, if the mood takes you.Fable Anniversary hasn't added much to the original just save achievements and a harder 'Heroic Mode'. Updated graphics, improved controls, and a new save system.If you enjoyed Fable, you will sure like this version			"

												So It's hard to rate this game honestly because today's standards for RPGs are so much greater than they were back when fable first came out, but I am going to rate it honestly by today's standards. I have also played the original and is probably one of my more favorite games for the xbox.Story:  5/10While the game is funny with a multitude of different side characters and side quests the game is overall short and does not immerse you well enough in to the world of fable. Since the story is short,  it makes everything seem to fly by, leaving  no real build up of characters and backstories, even though you can hear them briefly at the end of the game. The story does have it's twists, but at least to me, aren't super shocking and mind blowing.Gameplay/Combat: 4/5I do however enjoy the action combat. Nearly full control over what you can do, with no one type of combat (power,skill,will) feeling way overpowered, until maybe the last act of the game. The makers did very well in creating will powers that complement power and skill (personal favorite combo = slow time + multistrike + melee) making you not want to be purely a mage or warrior. This is an old game so sometimes targeting can be sketchy but overall a fun combat system.Replayability/Postgame:  0.5/2When you beat the game, you may have some sidequests leftover, but overall nothing extra once you are done. There is a little pull to create a new character and play the game in order to be the opposite of what you were the first time (good/evil) but its not really worth it.Graphics: 1.5/3This is an HD remake of the original so it the environment and characters do look nicer than it did in the original. However, it is not breaking any records and does not impress me to give it more than an average score.Music  0.5/2 - Not many tracks, Not really any standout tracks. Unique boss music? nope. Pretty much the music is there and the music fits the area you are in.Misc/Unique extras:  1.5/3Customization wise, I like that armor changes your appearance but the overall selection seems kind of small. There is no real benefit to wear cool or funny gear that you get because the armor values are much lower than the warrior plate armor, while at the same time the plate armor does not dull your mage abilities. The game being funny is definitely a bonus. I still like Fable's unique experience system (general/skill/will/power) where basically you get general experience and then bonus experience for whatever fighting style you did that battle. The new ""hard mode"" is another new pull that can get the hardcore gamers a little more challenge.Overall 13/25The problem really is the story has not held up over the years, and this is an rpg meaning the game score should be heavily weighted towards the story and that's what I did.  Gameplay is still solid by today's standards and should not be overlooked. based on the score  this game hardly gets a thumbs up but I' would give it a thumbs up because it is a game worth playing especially for nostalgia purposes. This game also played a big role in RPGs, helping lead the way to more decision based RPG games.			"

The game comes with hard mode6/10 Do not buy if you own the Last Chapters or if you want to buy it for the controller support and hard mode buy it on sale or buy it from {LINK REMOVED}.

												I can't tell you how this game was when it was first made due to the fact I only bought the game yesterday from the time I posted this review. I played about 13hrs had a total blast, and wish they added 2 and 3, but what I have seen is that 2 was made only for Xbox and I can't stand Xbox, and 3 is no where to be found due to it's ""bad ratings"". Howerver if I was to find these two games for PC that would be great. Lionhead possibly have concerns about lossing money for I dont not know what the fees are to establish a game on steam if there is one, but I do know if they do put it on the PC I will definetly like to continue the story without being forced to buy an Xbox of any sorts.

Great game returns in a new guise, but with the old content.You will find yourself in a Kingdom called Albion and will go from a young boy with a heart full of revenge to the great Hero (with a capital letter). On your way to face many dangers, for which you were trained from an early age. I think many people played the original Fable and know what it's about.This HD re-release also includes the addition of ""Lost Chapter"". In the game interface and graphics are much improved. Clumsy release control with the X-box can still be felt, but fortunately, everything can be customized to your choice. Colour is good. however, the only thing that gets in the way is a huge number of downloads of locations with extremely small area. The linearity of these locations is attached. And so, it's the same good old Fable.The game can be purchased for the sake of the ability to kick chickens =)In General, the game is wonderful. There's a storyline with twists and additional tasks with complications. And humor is present.10 peasants frightened by the beard of the player from 10. "

												Alrighty,Here is my fully honest review of this game. I have played the original Fable.. well, a lot, I've beat the game several times.The first thing I will say, is that this game is almost if not, Exactly the same. The biggest difference is the graphics. The menu system is different/better-ish. I got this really cheap from King. I wouldn't suggest full price. You can buy Lost Chapters on steam for only $10 if you don't mind the older graphics. Its the same game.This is a great game. It started my love for RPG games, so long ago. I'm glad they remastered this game. I understand that some people want the newer game machanics, but if they did that, they might have changed the game too much, and then it wouldn't be the same game anymore. Just like the newer Fable games, 2, 3... I never got deep into playing those games.			"

												It's been nearly 10 years since I played the Xbox original, and recently my wife and I played through Fable 2 and 3, giving me the strength to pick this game up as soon as it went on sale.I forgot how good this game was! Definitely the best of the trilogy as it's the most solid and consistent when it comes to any aspect of the game. The story is light-hearted with some attempts at being dark, but it keeps the game going and that's good enough. Quests are plentiful and varied (well there aren't THAT many to do, but they're all worth doing and can make for some memorable gaming moments.I guess the charm of Fable is how simple it all is; the combat, story, world... it's just compact and neat, and makes for a nice little game that's worth at least a playthrough. No need to worry about armor stats, level/class restrictions, weaknesses and effective attacks; just play the game and have fun.There's some choice-making in the game (to do with the story line) but it's not the most connsequential system and, for the people with a lot of time on their hands, a good excuse to replay the game a few more times.Anyway, it's a simple RPG from England and possibly the studio's best piece of work. Looks gorgeous today, especially in 4K, and is just plain and simple fun.			"
