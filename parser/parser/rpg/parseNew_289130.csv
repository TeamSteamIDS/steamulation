												Pros:1.  Beautiful, intriguing world.  Not generic fantasy.  Tons of inventive lore infused throughout the game.  Even descriptions of the odd map ""anomalies"" are interesting.2.  Emphasis on effective empire management (vs. constant warfare, as in AOW, Warlock, etc.).  City-building, economy balancing, and researching the tech-circles are immensely satisfying.3.  Combat is done nicely and wars aren't a slog.  Tactical battles can be fun to play out, or you can auto-resolve without worrying too much.  Unit upgrading is fun but not too time-consuming.4.  Different races that actually play quite differently.  Choose the Vaulters to race for a scientific victory, or the Necrophage to dominant your enemies.5.  Some innovative features that haven't been seen in 4x genre.  For example:  race-specific quest lines that actually serve as a unique victory condition, seasonal effects (summer/winter), the concept of regions limiting city placement, reinforcements, how heroes are handled (as generals or governors), etc., etc.  Cons:1.  Still crashes periodically, esp. after I've been playing for a while (UPDATE:  this was fixed in later patches).2.  A.I. is deficient.  This is the game's greatest threat to long-term success. But it is possibly improving with each patch, and I wonder how the modding community's efforts will help. (UPDATE:  this is still the game's major flaw - you need to play on higher difficulty to experience a challenge, and then you're just giving the AI huge bonuses).3.  Some of the more nuanced aspects of the game are not obvious and require digging for info on forums, etc. Summary:I love turn-based strategy games, and I love this game.   Absolutely gorgeous and relaxing to play.  Nothing better than coming home from a long day at work and watching toddler, locking myself in my office, and playing Endless Legend till 1AM.  Plays quicker and smoother than Civ V.  Yes, the AI needs improvement, but that's every strategy game since the beginning of time.  If the developers support it like they did Endless Space, I think this is going to stay installed on my HD for a long time.			"

												""...an excellent game in a sea of mediocrity...""Are you looking for a Civ-a-like to play? Don't buy this. Go buy GalCiv 3 instead. Are you looking for a fresh, new look at 4X entirely? You just found it. Before I get into my personal thoughts [the review, essentially] I want to explain why I say this and why I feel how I do about my review, found further below the following four paragraphs.To say Endless Legend is like Civ just because its a 4X game is like saying a cheesecake is a cake simply because it has the word 'cake' in it, or a pie because its formed like one. Endless Legend may be labeled as a 4X, but neither does it fit into the traditional mold of a 4X nor does it conform to those of its predecessors, the most notable being Civ.One of the key principal differences, for instance, is that the land is divided into regions. In each region, there may only be one city. That's it. Choose wisely where you place it; finding out later on there are better resources to be had from founding elsewhere will hurt you in the long run. This is particularly notable just starting out. Rush placement for the early settlement lead, or explore a bit for a chance at longer term returns on prosperity in your capital?Another key notable feature that I like is that each of the major factions not only has a different play style, but has their own major quest as well. Completion of said quest before the final turn results in an automatic win for that faction. [AI opponents do not pursue quests, major or minor] Is it easy? NO. Do you get rewards along the way? Certainly. Are the rewards worthwhile? Most definitely. One of the final overhauls I want to mention is the combat system. Rather than Civ's straight out 'this is my unit strength, this is yours, let's do this' system, your units are grouped [as you see fit] into armies. When you engage another army, a small battle map opens and each unit is controlled manually by you, via a directive of three basic commands; attack, defend, hold. Pretty self explanatory. On top of that, there are faction specific and unit based abilities you can use in battle which greatly diversify the depth of combat, instead of just 'surround city with siege units, bombard, invade with one unit when done' as in Civ.Review:A/V:  First off this game is gorgeous. I don't generally place stock on judging a game based on graphics, but it *really* adds to the atmosphere here. The level of detail is incredible. To supplement that, the ambient sound effects and music are just as amazing and deserve an equal amount of praise. The graphics get a small demarkation for having to re-draw everytime you tab out of the fullscreen interface, however. I am hoping this is addressed, but if not its not a major detractor.Mechanics: As stated above, this game is a fresh look at a genre that, in my opinion, deperately needed new life. Endless Legend is that life, I feel. This game has introduced things in a way no one would likely have ever thought, and the best part is that the community continues to remain a large part of the process the entire way. If you do purchase this [or are on the fence] head over to the Amplitude forums and check out what we have all accomplished. Several dozen features and additions to this and their other two games have been ones suggested by or designed almost completely by the community. I digress, though. All of these mechanics may sound like a steep learning curve, and the first game through it is. After that one game, however, it flows much more logically and you'll likely end up asking yourself how such an amalgalm of crazy ideas never happened before this.Miscallenous: There are still some bugs and flaws being ironed out, but Amplitude is very studious and responsive about addressing these issues promptly and responding to user feedback on how to resolve these problems until patches are released. There's even a feature in the game to create your own faction with your own selectable traits, including a couple that aren't assigned to a preset faction by default. Amplitude wants this game to be something for *you*, so if none of what I've written grabs you by all means don't feel pressured. If, however, you feel like Civ used to be enjoyable but has seen its days and you need something new, or if you just love fantasy and deep lore based worlds; this is your game. Overall: I'm not a fan of numbered/aggregate ratings, so I'll just close with this; if you're on the fence after having read what I wrote, buy it. It will not disappoint. Its an excellent game in a sea of mediocrity that more than deserves a chance to shine.Editors note: Updating this to reflect that at the time of review, the expansions were not yet released. I am going to leave the review as is, as the review was not intended to be an in depth guide on the mechanics of the game/expansions. The purpose is to cover the base mechanics as a means for comparison. Thank you! [Updated 11-24-2016]			"

Early Access Review
								This is less of a review and more of a preview of what you can expect from this game. I know that steam says I barely played EL - that's because I've been playtesting this game for several months before release. As such, I'm also inherently biased so take that into account.Why should you buy this game? The short answer is - if you have any doubts, don't buy it. Wait for the full release and then do your research and see if it's the kind of game that you will enjoy :)Personally though, I think that EL stands strong among other 4X games. It feels fresh and unique in many areas where 4X were starting to get stale. There's a lot to talk about so I'll just go over some of the bigger features:Firstly, the city management aspect. Like in most 4Xs once you make a city you can grow it, make improvements, train troops, gather food, industry, science, dust/gold and influence (FIDSI in short). But population works differently - you assign your workers (you population) to specific areas like food generation or influence generation. The amount of population working on that is multiplied by various bonuses (but it's at least *3) and then other various other bonuses are also added to the amount of FIDSI you can generate. This gives you a lot of control over what your city does (more so then in civ where you're much more dependent on the tiles around your city).Secondly, empire management. Every 20 turns you (and all other players) choose your ""empire plan"" which will define how you play for the next 20 turns. You need influence to invest into your empire plan - the more influence you invest, the better. You also have more options in empire plan as you enter new eras.Another use for influence is in diplomacy - all diplomatic actions (closing borders, declaring war,  etc) require some influence. You can also spend influence to improve your influence with AIs. Right now however, this aspect of the game only has basic functionality because there's no multi (yet) and the AI is fairly dumb (for now).Additionally, the tech is non-linear, meaning that you have free control over which tech you want to go for next. There are no prerequisites to anything. However, you have to choose what you research wisely as technology gets progressively more expensive. The only limitation are the eras. Basically, in order to unlock tech from next era, you need at least 10 tech from previous era.Thirdly, army management. There are 5 main unit types in the game: infantry, ranged units, support units, cavalry and flying units. Each faction has access to 3 unit templates (+the settlers) which you can then customize to decent extend. For example, you can equip your infantry with weapons that will help you fight cavalry - which normally is a good counter to infantry.Because each race can only use 3 basic templates (in as many versions as they want of course, I'm just talking about the infantry/support/etc kind of templates), you also have to rely on assimilating minor factions into your empire. Minor factions will grant you an empire bonus and give access to their unique unit templates. This allows you to make up for the fact that you don't natively have access to certain unit type. For example, the Wild Walkers faction has no access to flyers so they can assimilate Khazanji minor faction to gain access to Demons - a new flying unit template. There are of course limitations to how many races you can assimilate.Fourthly, the battles. They're quite unique since they're played on world map (like in civ) but are little skirmishes by themselves (like in AoW3 but you have less control). Each battle starts with a deployment phase and planning phase (during which you give your units orders). Then, the battle kicks in and you watch how your units duke it out. After a while you get the opportunity to change your orders around if you so choose. You also have to remember that there's elevation in this game - attacking from high ground will give you a decisive advantage while using cliffs can lead to some Hot Gates scenarios. The battles still have ways to go, true, but they're quite enjoyable already, even in alpha state.Lastly, the world. Auriga (the planet you play on) looks gorgeous and I wouldn't hesitate saying that it's one of the best looking 4X games (if not the best). Aside from great visuals, there are numerous things to discover on Auriga - there are many anomalies (special tiles that are usually very good), ruins to explore (they are persistent btw), minor faciton villages,  and a huge amount of various biomes. Plus the standard - resource deposits and so on.Also, let's not forget about quests. Each faction has a storyline expressed via a quest system. Every player is given a set of quests that they can complete for rewards (completing all of them will win you the game but that's not implemented yet). Aside from these main quests, you can also gain various side quests from minor factions, ruins and so on. The quests are quite interesting and make the game feel more alive, they also let you discover the lore of the game.In general, I do recommend this game but encourage you to do some more research first. Especially if you plan buying it in its alpha state.Also, this review is mostly a quote from a wall of text I wrote on the forums once. Just FYI ;)			"

												An excellent 4X turn-based strategy, set in pre-apocalyptic fantasy (or is it fantasy..?) world. Your planet, Auriga is dying, with winters steadily getting longer and harsher, and threatening to kill all life on the planet. But relics left by the ancient race, the Endless may hold key to saving Auriga, or some other means to survive the coming cataclysm. But other factions have their own plans on how to survive the disaster – and some just happily fight for territory heedless of approaching doom, so you may have to conquer the world in order to save it.Gameplay-wise, Endless Legend is 4X turn-based strategy with tactical battles and some RPG elements. The main focus is strategy, particularly expanding your empire and developing your cities. As the cities control the whole regions they are built in, and as expansion is limited in early game (partially due to increasing disapproval among your citizens if you expand too much, and partially due to high for early game settler cost), you have to plan which regions to colonize first. And as your cities’ population grows, you can build up your cities, visibly expanding them from small settlements into megapolises that cover entire regions they are in.Tactical combat isn’t as good as in some other games that focus more on it, but still decent enough. Interesting aspect of it is that while units act in turn in combat, all orders are given in the beginning of each combat turn, without knowing how enemies will act, which can make combat unpredictable. Whether it is a good or bad thing depends on whether you enjoy an extra challenge or get frustrated by randomness of battles. If you don’t want to engage in tactical battle, the game allows automatic resolution for all battles, often with quite satisfactory results.And finally, as for RPG elements, Endless Legend allows you to recruit heroes from a very large list that can either serve as cities’ governors or command armies (and in addition to granting bonuses to an army, fighting in combat themselves as well). As might be expected, the heroes level up as they fight or govern cities, increasing not only their combat stats but allowing you to choose their level-up bonuses, with each faction’s heroes having unique set of skills to choose from.I fully recommend Endless Legend to anyone who likes 4X turn-based strategies or want to give this genre a try, especially if they want to enjoy a pretty good story to go with the game.

												Endless Legend is a fantasy 4X game, floating in the ocean of grand strategy games that have been released in 2014. Cities are built, wars are declared, worlds are conquered - but Amplitude has created has something that stands out; a game that is gorgeous with a world that begs to be explored. It is fat with novel ideas, from its peculiar tactical combat, to its fascinating factions.I have been a warmonger, a being of pure energy trapped inside a suit of armour, watching my armies sweep across the face of the world like a merciless machine. I have been a peacemaker, a measured dragon, bringing the races together to create something better. And I have been an insectoid monster, feasting on the corpses of my foes and inspiring fear and hatred. I’ve been a busy boy. 3 years ago, Amplitude launched its space 4X game, Endless Space. It was laden with potential, but it was held back by a messy research system, a sterile universe and its slow pace. With Endless Legend, it’s clear that Amplitude has grown as a developer. It takes the potential of the previous game, placing it in a strange sci-fi fantasy world - one that exists within the Endless Space universe - and improves on almost every aspect. This is immediately apparent when starting up a game for the first time. Endless Legend is stunning - a beautiful, hex-based game with a distinct art style that merges sci-fi and fantasy comfortably. It’s minimalist and clean, strangely evocative of art deco, particularly when it comes to the Broken Lord faction. Factions are a high point overall. Where Endless Space’s races lacked any real personality, its successor is not so hampered.Each of the nine factions has a hook that drives games forward.Each race makes a strong impression, though, thanks to their lore and themes being tied to actual mechanics. The Roving Clans are a nomadic people, so they can move their cities to new locations within provinces they’ve settled, and their strength is in trade, not war. Indeed, they can’t even declare wars. On the other end of the spectrum are the hideous Necrophages. Insectoid beasties that are hated by everyone, they can’t form alliances and are destined to be at war or on the cusp of war with everyone.  Rounding out the denizens of Auriga, the world of Endless Legend, are the minor factions. These tribes sit somewhere between Civilization V’s barbarians and city states. Initially, they are hostile, with small armies of creatures that are analogous to traditional fantasy races like dwarves and demons - all with a spin that makes them feel appropriate for the game’s fiction - wandering around, fighting the larger factions and occasionally besieging cities. They have villages, too, which become the focus of most interactions with these little groups. These villages can be bribed, conquered or placated through quests. The end result is always the same, though: they join the empire. An assimilated minor faction provides bonuses to its new masters, including additional units. Quests make up a big part of the game. They range from small missions given by minor factions like “kill our enemies” or “give us X amount of Y resource”. These ones do tend to be on the bland side, but offer diversions and direction. Each objective is accompanied by a story arc, fleshing out the already intriguing empires even more. Research goals are split into eras. Each era adds more buildings, resources and tools, introducing game concepts at a relaxed pace. There are a lot of raw materials that can be dug out of the earth and used to create new weapons or earn money, but the number starts off small, so an empire can be focused. Similarly, trading doesn’t begin straight away. By the time the appropriate knowledge has been unlocked, the chances are that many empires will have already met and developed relationships, making it easier to start trading. Interactions between the big factions are what you’d expect from a 4X game. Treaties can be made, alliances brokered, trade agreements put forward - it’s mostly notable due to there being a cost involved. Influence must be spent to make deals, but that’s an important resource. Empire-wide boons cost a ridiculous amount of influence and can give factions a serious edge, but maintaining diplomatic relationships is equally important.The AI is quite reactive, but not very aggressive. It will become terrified if another faction has a bigger army, jealous if they are more powerful, dismissive if they are weaker - but it takes a lot to push them into declaring war. Wars will inevitably kick off at some point, though, and when they do, Endless Legend’s curious combat is put on display. It’s turn-based and tactical, with each battle split up into a maximum of six combat phases, where customisable soldiers and extra-powerful heroes duke it out.The planning phase is where units are directed to attack a specific enemy or move to a specific tile. But that doesn’t mean the unit will be able to fulfil those orders. Another unit might get in the way, or the enemy might die before it can be reached. It’s a little hands-off, but that does build this feeling that you’re a general, organising and ordering troops, rather than some omnipotent god dictating their every move. Having all of these options, this diversity, does play havoc with the balance. And there are many ways to quickly increase in power and devastate enemies without breaking a sweat. I don’t think balance should be the ultimate goal of every strategy game, though. I’m not certain that there’s a comfortable middle ground, here. Endless Legend combines fantastic fiction with compelling strategy. Underpinning it all is a strong design philosophy that connects the tenets of the 4X genre together seamlessly, while providing a plethora of options without being overwhelming. Even during a time when we’re seeing a lot of 4X offerings, it sets itself apart, promising something different from its contemporaries.			"

												So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the ""Real world"" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. 2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of ""This deposit has 8 iron"", it says ""This deposit has titanium"", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked. 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. 6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you. 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...13) The marketplace system is one I like. ""Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me"" Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.tl;dr: It's a good game.Get it.

												This is the most surprisingly great game I've ever seen on Steam.Surprising because considering the small price, and considering I'm a fan of the Civilization saga since the first one, I was expecting a nice game inspired by Civilization but certainly not as good.Well I was wrong. This game is at least as good as Civilization and may be even slightly better because :- it has way better graphics (including a real 3D map with elevations : on the contrary to Civ you can 'climb' hills to reach a plateau for example to shoot arrows from above... and of course this gives you bonus) and a very cool and modern User interface- it has RPG elements (quests but also a good heroes management in which you can customize the equipement and also chose specilizations like you do in any RPG)- it has turn based battles (which I love... but you still can use automatic battle resolution if you prefer)- it has seasons with real effects on the game- it has an interesting units customization feature (in Civ the upgrade system is more basic here you can equip you units with new shield, armor, weapons but also items that give some extra points... it's very RPG inspired)- it has a very usefull and well made training.So, it is a good combo of TRPG and 4X games. Exactly what, personnaly, I was looking for for a long time !!!			"

Early Access Review
								Civ 5, Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby together and that baby grew up and had a baby with Endless Space and this baby has now grown up and it is glorious in every level.Incredibly polished, incredibly neat, incredibly addictive and a game that stands out from the rest. If you like Empire-builders, this game is for you!Ignore the ""Early access"". This game is ready to be sold. I have only experienced one single bug in this game and the MP works like a clockwork. It's highly optimised, full of features and pretty to look at. I wish more Devs would make their games this way, it warms my heart!			"

												Take Civ V, remove the limitation of one unit per hex, add in actual terrain elevation, make the different factions play differently, remove the million-city strategy by enforcing separated regions, change battle from ""my number is bigger"" to small tactical engagements, and give individual military units more significance than ""rifleman #14"", at the cost of a shallower tech tree and a debatable ""winter"" mechanic that cripples any empire not ready for it by turn 200+. This is what a sequel to Civ V should have been. Given the choice between this or Beyond Earth, buy this twice.			"

Posted: November 16, 2014
												This is a 4X game with some interesting new mechanics, which mostly work well. For me it's basically the Sword of the Stars (1, not 2) of land-based 4X. The things that I enjoy most are the city management system and that you don't have to go wide to win, though there certainly are advantages to rapid expansion. I beat the game on the hardest difficulty with the one-city-only faction.If I was giving it a score I'd probably say 8. It isn't as polished and well-rounded as Civ V, but I find it to be more fun and interesting.- Looks much prettier than Beyond Earth.- Lots of people praise the music. I wouldn't say it's the greatest, but it is solid.- All the factions are interesting and different. Each has a gimmick, though they don't all suit the playstyles that the developers intended.- The hero system can be annoying at times, since some heroes are just completely better than others, and it is random chance which ones you'll be given access to (though starting heroes are always the same).- As with many 4X games, it suffers from the fact that the victory conditions can be pretty meaningless. Literally the fastest way to win a diplomacy victory is to continually break your alliances and reform them each turn. Also, once you start winning, you may as well just kill everyone else immediately rather than waiting to get a science victory or whatever.- Combat can be very tedious; I recommend increasing the combat animation speed immediately. Also, do not underestimate the importance of initiative in combat. Each unit only gets one attack/counterattack, and the default counterattack overrides all except one of the special attacks.- You have to work out a lot of the mechanics for yourself. This game does not hold your hand. Reading a guide on city leveling/building is almost mandatory.- Harder difficulties are legit challenging.- Quests system is robust enough, but some of them are fairly stupid and/or impossible.- Strategic and luxury resources all have meaningful differences and advantages.Some basic info so you can work out if it is the game for you:Hex-based movement. Out of combat movement is in army stacks with movement of slowest unit, but combat is in a 6-turn battle/encounter where the units split into one-unit-per-tile. This encourages you to build armies which complement each other out of different unit types.Cities work differently to most other games of the genre. The population is essentially all ""specialists"", to use the Civ term, where each unit of population can be used to create (base) 4food/4industry/4science/4dust/2influence depending on your priorities that turn. Food, industry, etc. on terrain adjacent to the city is automatically collected, and you can expand the city by building districts in adjacent hexes to increase the area being passively collected from.The world is divided into regions, and you can only have one city per region. This makes city placement be really important, and leads to important decisions as to city expansion.Units are upgradeable with equipment. Each faction has three unique base units, and you can assimilate up to three minor factions to get a faction-unique buff and their factions unit. eg. assimilate the Haunts to get 5% to science per Haunt village in your territory, and build ""Ended"" which are flying ghosts with a chain lightning attack.

												I looked through a lot of reviews before writing this and I find myself in a quandry. I can understand both the positive and negative reviews I read, they are mostly coherent and true. I have played most of the 4x games(historical, fantasy and sci-fi) that have ever been published so I think I can reasonably say I am speaking from experience. PositivesI have played over 1400 hours including all the expansions. With that said I obviously like the game and I don't think I have anything new to say that you can't already read in other reviews.NegativesThere are still some things that bug me about the game even after several expansions and updates and I think they deserve mentioning. I have noticed that people that like this game are almost defensive about it and refuse to admit it's weaknesses.Documentation, rules, tutorials - These are all pretty bad especially for a game that many people would find complex. I really enjoy games with depth to them, that is not what I am talking about. Even after 1400 hours their are technical elements of the game I do not understand and rules I am surprised by. That shouldn't happen (especially with an experienced gamer). Much of the useful documentation has been published by players. I find it frustrating to dig through home made guides that may or may not answer my questions. The discussion group can be equally opaque. Hoping you can guess the right key word that will take you to a comment applicable  to your issue is equally frustrating. Just as a prime example, the game has several races you can play. There was 1 race in particular that I just wasn't understanding fully despite a variety of searches. At one point someone suggested a tutorial on YouTube. I clicked the link, it was just under an hour long!? And, no I did not even try to watch it.Combat - In a way this goes with my previous comment. Despite my research I still don't think I fully understand the manual combat. You give your units some generalized commands(order matters) and hope they do what you asked of them. Some of the behavior the units perform is thoroughly bewildering, i.e. you tell a unit to 'Defend' and it charges forward? Regardless, it is a long game and between that and the peculiarities of combat I simply use autocombat barring some unusual circumstances. Personally I enjoy empire building over tactics, but that is just a matter of taste.Bugs - despite how long it's been out there are still several bugs. Are they game stoppers, generally no, that doesn't mean that I enjoy them. The developers have offered many updates and you are welcome to post bugs on their site as long as you have a save file to go with it. Not all bugs can be demonstrated with a save file.In the end, do I recommend the game, absolutely, but it has it's flaws.			"

Early Access Review
								New to Amplitdue's games and looking for some Pros and Cons on buying Early Access? Well heres some for you.*** Updated as of Beta v 0.5.18 S3 ***Pros-An incredible amount of visual polish for an Early access game, and its only going to get better. You can zoom in far out or insanely close. Up close the details are stunning. And zooming far out gives you a ancient looking map with all the details you need.-It's a Completely unique game. Coming from someone who enjoys the Civ series thouroughly, this game feels totally different and adds yet another delicious 4X flavor to my palate. Some things that make it different: High Ground advantadge, Adaptively Progressive Tech trees, The Market, Minor faction integration, and much more.-Unique factions: I've played all of the major factions in complete games. This much I can tell you: If you play two factions with the same strategy it will not end well for you. Their uniqueness adds allot of immersion to the game.Cons: (Will be updated as game progresses)-The GUI is set up in such a way that you can easily make a mis-click with units and suffer consequences you never intended. There is a high chance this will be polished up before release.-The economics of the game feel flat. The dissaproval systems are pretty linear and leave a little to be wanted, however there is more economic depth planned and even more will most likely be added before Early Access ends.[This game contained many cons at EA release but these are since gone]Endless Space problems not found in Endless Legend:-Steamrolling combat. Endless Space suffured from this, however combat is deep and thought provoking in Endless Legend even in early access. Also, there is much less of a ""Rock Paper Scissor"" feel to the game-Endless Space had a lack of Diversity. Endless Legend on the other hand is teeming with diversity.-Immersion. From seeing heroes fight on screen, to a richly stylized GUI, to incredible artwork, Endless Legend pulls you into the game's universe and keeps you there.Overall, this game is an incredible EA game, and a steal with the release sales. And to speak of bugs, beyond a minor one here and there, they are practically non existent.So looking for Endless entertaiment? This is it.			"

												As a huge fan of the Civilization series since its inception, I was skeptical at first trying out Endless Legend. I had a bit of trouble understanding how the game mechanics work, but once everything clicked into place, it was quite a revelation. I am now thoroughly hooked. What I love: The vibrant colors and sharp graphics (Civ actually looks dull compared to this) The huge amount of original, detailed and superbly animated landscape features The world of Auriga, winter and summer cycles The radically different playstyles between factions The faction main quests and sidequests, well written and challenging The turn speed, even on large maps with lots going on The minor factions, original and strategically menaningful Designing your unitsWhat I found annoying: The fights. I prefer just doing these on automatic. The city micromanagement in the later game (although that's shared with all 4X games) No hero auto-level up (I'm nitpicking here)I would recommend this to everyone who likes 4X games.			"

												Lets start with the bad one :- Bad AI, if you are veteran in Civ games, then start your difficulty above normal, although this is your first campaign- No need to fight in manual mode, just play in auto, save your time. Unless you fight another human player- Need more polished animationNow the good one :- Fresh gameplay, not another typical Civ games. Although seem weird for the first time, but you will enjoy it later.- Different faction, different strategy. And you have faction quest. Its awesome! Finish the quest to unravel the story.- Unlimited replaybility.- Great artwork, beatifull, love it. That season change is amazing!- Good soundtrack, need more creepy music though.This game has more potential, need more scenario, need more faction, need more magical wonder, or super badass monster who can wipe all faction alone. There will be DLC no doubt. So if you fans of Fall from Heaven Mod in Civ 4 like me. Then this game is for you. Cheers~Rate 8/10			"

												It's literally Heroes of Might and Magic mixed with Sid Meier's Civilization.What more do you want?Just don't play the tutorial. It's awful and dosen't explain much. The UI is simple, but takes getting used too, after a quick warm-up round you'll be good to go if you explore it some. Hell, you will get a basic idea of what to do if you take a moment and read through the factions triats. The combat feels uninvolved at first glance, but it's more on how you tell your troops to do things. You can tell them what to do, to the letter if you learn to use the unit tactics, as they tend to do their own thing unless you tell them not too. I played some multiplayer, and it definetly showed the difference it makes to interact with your troops compared to just telling them who to attack as you can better control the field and force them into narrow areas in the terrain, or into some troops you have on the high ground. In other words, it was a massacre, not a battle. I'm so sorry to that Broken Lords Player, whoever you were. Should of accepted the peace treaty, bruh. Overall, good stuff.  I'll play this over Civ anyday.			"

Posted: December 27, 2015
												Welcome to Endless Legend. Take a seat and listen, as I unravel to you one of the best 4X games of the past few years.First of all, there are some things to bear in mind when considering this game, and for some people, these might be off-putting at first, especially if approached in a mainstream or Civilization-like manner. The first thing to consider about Endless Legend is that it encourages experimentation and kindly invites you to leave dogmas and balance at the front door before you enter its universe.So, onwards we go.If you've played Amplitude's former 4X Sci-fi space game, you'll immediately feel familiar with some of the concepts here. Endless Legend is actually set in the same universe, but rather on a single planet, named Auriga. Gameplay itself and the UI is very similar to Civilization V and fans of this game will immediately feel at home. However, there are a few subtle differences.Auriga's first impressions are breathtaking. The landscapes are beautiful to watch and behold, making the most of the fantasy theme which has been provided. Also, Auriga features 2 seasons. Games start at the beginning of Summer, and every once in a while, a short Winter will set in. However, this isn't just a cosmetic feature. Winters affect most aspects of gameplay, including military and economic aspects, and some quests can only be completed during a certain season. Winter itself is a pivotal mechanic to the storyline, as Winters will become longer and harsher as time goes by, and you must find a way to ""fix"" this or risk complete obliteration of Auriga.Speaking of quests, they make a pretty big part of Endless Legend. While the main quest will eventually lead a civilization to victory, there are dozens of side-quests to be found across your journies, varying from mundane tasks (such as kill X creature, provide Y resources) to more compex ones, such as forming an alliance or capturing a town. Most quests actually have follow-ups and context, so they're not completely forgettable.Auriga is also a very lively place. You will encounter roaming creatures and also native tribes. These tribes are akin to Civ5 city-states and can be persuaded through various means to join an empire and provide unique bonuses or units. And speaking of tenants, you share the world with the other civilizations. Amplitude made full use of the fantasy setting and created a set of wonderful civilizations, each different and with their own personality, charm and mechanics. While in Civ, all civilizations were technically the same, bar some variety in buildings and units, in Endless Legend, each civilization is completely different. For example, the Roving Clans are trade oriented nomads, able to move around their cities. They're so trade-oriented that they can't even declare wars, and must push through trade, diplomacy and alliances. The Necrophages, on the other hand, are on the opposite side of the spectrum, being an all-evil warmongering insectoid race which consumes everything and is constantly at war, not being able to ally with anyone. No matter who you choose to play with, the level of detail and artwork will surely surprise you.Progress is done via eras and a tech tree. While not as excentric and confusing as the Endless Space tech web, the tech tree of Endless Legend is also not as bland as the one in Civ5, for example. What Endless Legend wants you to do is to encourage experimentation. Forget about linear tech progression or ""must-have"" technologies. You can go that path, of course, but you will not only be very slow in progression, but you will also feel that the tech tree is there just for the sake of being. Instead, it invites you to try a more daring approach. You dont' *have* to unlock everything, from hero recruitment, to all the resource extractors, to all armor and weapon upgrades. Doing so is the obvious but also the blandest way. I found out that experimenting with lesser-mainstream approaches can lead to interesting results. For example, in a game, I skipped completely through a set of resource extractors in order to focus on more combat-oriented techs (like weapons+armor) without having to linger too much in early eras. I ended up reaching the fourth era first and having OP military which then resulted in a fairly easy late-game. Surprisingly, the other civs were pretty easy-going on trading the resources I was lacking, so I didn't really feel handicapped by skipping those extractors.Also, I've also won with just one hero by skipping most militaristic tech and piling up economic and trading techs. I was the laughing stock of the game when i came to military, but funny enough, I didn't have to deal with any wars, as the other Civs were appeased by my edge in trading and economic ""gifts"", allowing me to spearhead through the main questline and win the game.This, of course, would never be possible without a proper diplomacy system. Endless Legend's diplomacy system, fortunately, is one of the best I've seen. Trading of resources and tech is done by using a special resource called ""Influence"". Alliances and conflicts are also brokered the same way, which means that players who focus on Influence tech and buildings can easily become rulers of the world. The AI is also very well-done in this regard, with leaders having proper attitudes and reactions to diplomatic events.Of course, when diplomacy fails, the swords do the talking. As all 4X games, Endless Legend features a combat system. As with the rest of things, its combat system is far from mainstream. Instead of using a simple die roll, each combat is resolved on a tactical battlefield, similar to ones in Heroes of Might and Magic games. However, there are very different mechanics.While the battlefield itself is merely a ""zoomed-in"" version of the actual terrain, units are not exactly in direct control of the player. Each battle goes through seveal ""phases"", and the player can only issue pseudo-orders to units, in the way of ""try to move here"" or ""try to attack that unit"". However, during the resolve phase, units attempt to carry those orders but there is no guarantee that the action will succeed. This may happen due to the units being out of range or the path becoming blocked. While this can be frustrating for people who like total control of the battlefield, it is actually a more realistic approach to the battlefield, by making the player feel more of a general in command, rather than a God dictating each and every move of its underlings at any given point in time. The only problem arising is that sometimes, units' pathfinding might be awkward and inconsistent with the player's expectations. Fortunately, for such people, an automatic battle system is available, which is more than decent in resolving conflicts.Overall, I would recommend this game to every 4X fan out there. However, I would like to stress again that this is not your average game which lets you comfortably settle into a comfort zone. Getting the best out of Endless Legend will mean having to avoid that comfort zone, experimenting a lot and thinking out of the box. Almost all aspects and challenges in the game can be resolved in more than one way and sometimes the optimal way to do it is not necessarily the most obvious one. This game rewards those people who dare go outside the comfort zone and that's what sets it apart from the rest. If you expect a game which emphasises balance, precise combat and a sandbox for you to expand your empire in, you will be disappointed.			"

												I had given a negative review to this game in 2014 mainly due to lack of understanding of the game mechanics and frequent crashes. Now with a modern 64 bit system it runs amazingly well and I realized how wrong I was and how great this game really is and why it got so many positive reviews.It is an exceptionally well-made 4x fantasy turn-based-strategy that is quite addicting once you understand how to play.Since I initially found it difficult to understand gameplay concepts and strategies I wrote a Steam guide: '' A simple Endless Legend guide for beginners''.

			When I started playing this game I had a hard time at first because the tutorial is lame and there is no ingame encyclopedia and I needed to google a lot of questions and watch a lot of very long videos...		


Playing this game requires lots of thought and reflexion. It is not for the crowd that plays games on phones and tablets.  Also not for scatterbrained  people unable to focus on one thought for more than a few seconds.But it is soooo deep and rich and addicting that I plan to play it for many years to come.Please upvote my Steam guide if you find it useful and upvote my review so more people can know about my guide and learn to love this game.

Early Access Review
								**Updated 4/26/14** All Future Updates will be found in chronological order as you continue to read.First Day Launch Review. Will update as updates come (to the best of my ability).For those who decide to look and say TL;DR - Great game, Worth the Price, Alpha = Better than any Alpha I have played, Missing Some features and directions, but will be fixed over patches as is known to happen with Amplified Studios.Let me start by saying, this is EASILY the best Early Access game I have seen come to Steam. It is already VERY polished for a game still in Alpha. The graphics are actually more impressive than I expected from an Alpha version. Glitches? Kept to a minimum so far, in fact, I don't think I have really seen anything that was more then a moment's annoyance.A previous review I read said, it takes too many clicks for a unit to make an action, compared to Civ. I disagree. I select the unit, tell it to walk to the tile i want, once its there, it pops up and says ""Do this action?"" And I can say Yes or no. Quite simple. Attacking another unit? Select your unit and click the other one. Very simple, not tedious, not a pain, and considering how much this game LACKS in direction at its current stage, its refreshing to be given instructions to understand.The game plays like a combination of Age of Wonders (I,II,II), Civ (Any), Fallen Enchantress and Endless Space. It takes the best part of each game, and mixes them together. Want an easy way to build you cities and manage your workers? Done. Want to have a little more control over battle but still have it streamlined so it doesn't bog down your game? Done.The Tech tree is similar to the Endless Space Tech Tree with a few differences. Right now, you can only research the Tech of the ""Age"" you are in. You gain levels in ""Age"" by researching so many of the previous ""Age's"" technologies. For example, you start at the First Age and can not advance to the Second until you have researched 10 technologies. The only catch on this is, you do not need to research certain technologies to unlock more advanced ones. For example, if you do not research Age One Weapons, you can still research Age Two Weapons. I am sure this is something that will be addressed in a later patch.I have so much more to say, but I just want to play! More updates and information to come!**Update 4/26/14**So now that I have some more time to expand upon things I wrote earlier, I am going to do my best to do so.So as I have said, this game plays like a combination of a few games. Most notably it feels like Fallen Enchantress and Civilization games. Allow the following to help explain what I mean by this.Fallen Enchantress - The biggest similarities come from how the units stack. You stack armies onto a single tile. You are also limited to how many units can be in a single stack. This is based upon your hero and your tech tree. There are roaming bands of armies (mostly made up of creatures) as well as the other empire's armies. When you initiate battle, you will also notice that it has a similar system that shows you how balanced the fight will be. It differitiates slightly from here though. You pick if you want your armies to play offensively, defensively or stay put. Then, your battle takes place on the actual hexagons of the campaign map, but it is limited to a small area. It does not go to a difference screen where the single hexagon turns out to be some huge 12x12 area inside of that single tile. This means that you can potentially start a battle in a part of the world map, knowing that they have to come through a bottleneck because of a mountain range with only one entrance. Once you start your battle, you have the opportunity to place your units in the desired hexagons prior to the fight starting. this allows you to protect your ranged by playing them behind mountains or cliffs and adds a nice level of strategy into the battle, while not becoming so tedious that you spend hours in a single battle (for example a Total War game where you might spend 10+ minutes arranging your armies perfectly). After you have placed your units, you get to choose what units target which enemy units. Then once the round starts, the action is streamlined and you are along for the ride. This helps streamline battle, but it does have rounds where you can re-adjust your strategy to ensure your victory. *A quick note I will need to add more to later, they also allow you to upgrade/change gear on your armies just like in Fallen Enchantress. I will need to expand on this more later.Civilation - It is similar mostly through building and placing cities. You also have control over what your population works on in each city (i.e. FIDSI - Food, Industry, Dust, Science and Influence . You build expansions on your city, utilize resources in your region and basically control your settlements expansions.A couple quick notes I want to make here.* You can only create one settlement in each region. Choose wisely. You *can* still use any resource in that region, even if you are not settled next to it. This mainly makes you choose wisely when it comes to the resources available in the tiles near you.*Influence and Empire Direction - You use influence to choose the direction of your empire every 20 turns. I made the mistake (due to lack of instructions) of thinking this feature was not implemented. You do not just click the direction you wish to go, you must click and DRAG it to the marker line. I spent my first 60 turns before I realized this.*There is no tutorial. This is not a game to learn 4x strategy on. It is still being developed. There are truly no directions and you will make mistakes or wrongful assumptions. It may frustrate you when you do so. Save often, you will appreciate when you can go back 20+ turns because you didn't fully understand the consequences of an action you took so long ago, thinking it wouldn't effect you the way it did. I am sure a tutorial will be available upon release if not sooner. If you have any questions, you may also feel free to add me and I will answer them to the best of my ability.MORE UPDATES TO COME!! Check Back often please! Feel free to comment! If you find something lacking, please let me know so I can help you make more informed decisions!			"

												I refrained from writing a review on this game until I had a better grasp of the mechanics and content available -- and there's a hell of a lot.For those that are too lazy to read a somewhat cautious approach to review this game, tl;dr -Sick graphics, Great Design, Mindblowingly good music (i'm talking supergiant quality) A lot of hours holding on for the next turn. Some boggy mechanics but nothing completely quality breaking. Multiplayer is dun goof'd, save us amplitude.Other reviews have already outlined the various 4x features that they like, there is a general consensus on the graphical aesthetics of the game being phenomenal and the outstanding music. These are well deseved and there is little I have to say about either.As far as 4X games go, this is far from being ground breaking, a lot of its features are ubiquitous. However what the game does do well is polish these features combining complicated designs with simplified presentation. For example, the concept of citybuilding is simple at first glance, any player can create a relatively stable state by implimenting all the upgrades available, and for the most part this will work for beginners as the game is designed in such a way that the improvements benefit off and balance one another. However, at higher tiers of play, more experienced players are able to selectively design a city around a handful of upgrades and achieve very impressive specialisations and ""minmaxing"" as RPG players would describe it. Whilst minimal in its impact at first glance, this definitely sets apart players as I've witnessed in multiplayer games. Multiplayer as of release has been relatively buggy, often desynchronising (a problem also inherant in the original launch of endless space). The developers have recognised this since their previous game and have implimented a resync feature which whilst not optimal is at least a fair attempt at multiplayer stability. I hope they bring further development into this specific problem as players are currently not residing in multiplayer as much as anticipated. It would certainly detract from the game's value if things remain this way. Technical problems aside, Endless Legend is a game taking after Endless Space; the game is very lore rich, even moreso than Endless Space in my opinion. Each faction is unique and interesting, which whilst subjective to each person's perception of what constitutes ""fresh"" is at the very least very different from the tolkien lore archetypes. Don't get me wrong, there are still ogres or elves as one may be led to believe, but what is different is the way these factions and nations are portrayed and how their lore is intertwined with their playstyle within the game. This game is effective at combining lore and gameplay mechanics which reinforce the depth of the world and its immersion. For every generic ""orc & elves"" faction (which are at least less stereotypical in this game) there are factions such as the Cultists that convert villages to fight for their single fortress state and its queen, Dust Lords who do not consume food but instead will stop at nothing for dust, the energy and currency to expand or Vaulters who bear an uncanny resemblence to what would be medieval space muhreens and fight for glorious science - coincidence or not, this is cool. There are more, my favourite being necrophages will burst into poisonous clouds on death and spawn more crawling bug-things from the corpses of their enemies and more. This leads onto the world itself, each randomly generated or generated by user seed input, it is always interesting. I found myself almost mechanical in my routine when playing Civ. The start of a game would always involve checking for the closest luxury or strategic resource and setting up camp. Endless Legend however, sets itself apart. The combination of interesting anomalies (of which I was more than happy to read its descriptions for further lore) and the implimentation of a height system in the terrain meant that locating a city now meant much more than a simple viewpoint of resources. The world appears vibrant always and the alternation between winter and summer seasons further draw a need for players to consider the environment in which they set up a city. Cities themselves are also unique. I found that many 4X games were often too promoting of brainless expansion, Civ and Endless Space were shocking exemplars in this regard. But with Legend, since cities can only exist lone in a single region, the need for strategic location, expansion and management are further incentivised. This same depth however, is not applied to combat, where gameplay boils down to simply selecting units to either target or move. Advanced combat does improve things somewhat, restricting users to only being permitted selection every two turns but this doesn't remedy the lackluster depth here. I especially hope to see more emphasis on heroes and their role in combat.However all of this is also stumped by the fact that the game is rather lacking in certain important areas of play. Custom faction creation appears to be quite a good idea at first glance, case in point Endless Space, which was phenomenal in the various options you could create a playstyle through your own faction. However, in Endless Legend, the very limiting restrictions of having to choose an archetype based upon the existing factions is doubled with the limiting number of options you have for the faction's traits. Compared to Endless Space, there are less categories, less negative traits and less traits overall. Furthermore, many of these traits are distinctly and very obviously geared towards the playstyles of the existing factions which further make the creation of one's own faction that much less free and satisfying.Additionally, the customization of units and heroes within the game are frankly terrible. I can understand where Amplitude got the idea-- many games have the problem of overbearing numbers of units and technological trees. To counteract this norm, Endless Legend has been designed by nature to rely upon 3 units (and the settler, bar Cultists) for a single faction, each with a distinct playstyle. This was to be supplemented by the use of mercernaries and assimilated factions. Customization and variety would come in the form of unit design and customization within the game, choosing their armours based upon various strategic resources and accessories. This was an impressive idea in concept, however it was poorly executed. Units appearances do not change if you swap their armour (this includes heroes) and the variety of equipment mostly came down to very clear cut and distinct differences in statistics, one will have less attack than another or one will be better against ranged units than another. Yes, this does indeed promote playstyles, having a platoon of archer killers with a line of infantrymen in the front is often optimal. But it also sets players into a very rigid selection of play for combat, killing any innovative ideas one could have procured. I hope Amplitude expands this region further as this was certainly one of my biggest complaints regarding this release.Endless Legend is certainly a fantastic game, well worth its retail price nevermind sales or discounts. We hope that amplitude does what amplitude does best and develops its released games further, I have seen few studios that have managed their community better, through the use of games2gether which is a lot more than a witty coorperate front. Players can vote on game content to be implimented and provide input that is often responded to by the developers granted enough momentum and correct timing. For what is there alone, regardless of future updates and patches, I would recommend to any fan of turn based strategy games. Buy this game and exterminate the invalid species of Auriga.			"

												Don't mind me, just throwing my hat over here to counterbalance a bit the misguided chinese critics bashing the game because the devs had a translation mod linking to a pirate site deleted. The modder whined on a chinese site that the devs were mean with chinese people, and they came to bash the game without having any clue of what was going on. That's internet for you.Haven't had time to play it in depth yet, but it's gorgeous and very intriguing, a 4x with sort of a fantasy/sci-fi storyline mixed in, with original mechanics. It looks very interesting.			"

Pros:-Several balanced factions each with unique gameplay-Deep, rewarding gameplay-Beautiful graphics-Beautiful soundtrack-Activatable/Deactivatable DLC-Customizeable units-Custom faction creation-Surprisingly deep storyline for a 4x game-Soild tutorialCons:-AI before hard is moronic-Learning curve-Mezari are just a reskin of Vaulters, with a shared storyline and everythingOverall: This is a 4x game.  If you're at all into 4x games, Endless Legend introduces several new and cool aspects to the genre while keeping things balanced.  There are several victory types, some of which can be accomplished simply by finishing the main plotline.  And the main questline of each faction gives rewards that help your civilization and make them worthwhile, even if you don't intend to win a quest victory.The factions are numerous and vastly different, and there is a lot to learn.  If you haven't had much experience with 4x games, it can be a bit daunting.  However, the tutorial does a good job of introducing the core concepts and giving a runthrough of the new material, such as customizing your units and giving them equipment for the job.  There is a lot here that I could rant about, such as minor factions and the intelligently laid out science tree and diplomacy screen, and the marketplace options.  There's so much to do just in the base game, and the expansions all add something of value.Definitely worth buying, and it regularly goes on sale if you can't afford the full $40.Bottom Line: Easy Recommend			"

Early Access Review
								From the creators of Endless Space comes a hybrid sci-fi/fantasy strategy game set on one world.  So far it's still in early access and it blows me away how good this game is.  Very polished for the stage it is in.  It continues to evolve the combat system from Endless Space where you don't micromanage each unit, but give broad orders to your army.  Some of the game concepts aren't clear when you first begin playing; for instance how far you should place cities to maximize land use, or how terrain affects the borders of your cities.  Not all is lost, however, as you have the option of razing your cities to effectively move the city, though this slows down your empire's progress.  Some of the unit actions seem a bit more complicated than they need to be.  In Civ you're used to right clicking on a goody hut and everything is taken care of.  In Endless Legend you place your army next to the ""goody hut"" and then click on the action you wish your army to do, and then click again on the ""goody hut"".  This makes the task take three times as many clicks as needed and gets cumbersome after a short while.The tech tree is interesting, though a bit light imo.  It follows the path system set by Endless Space with a few changes.  You are not limited to which tech you wish to research except by which phase of the game you're in, which they call ""Age"".  There are 6 seperate Tech Trees, one for each Age.  There are no paths between the techs currently, though I hope they change that, and it is not quite clear how to advance to the next age.  It just sort of happens as you play.The units do not feel complete or unique yet.  They have different animations and icons, but I have yet to see a reason to bring along a support type unit with an army instead of all infantry or ranged, besides terrain.  Which leads to the next thing I'd like to talk about.  When you initiate combat the camera pans out a bit and uses the terrain of the world map as the battle field, with both height and types of terrain that affect how units move about the fight.  You can place the units initially, but after the fight starts you have no more control.  This makes ranged units very powerful, as you can place one on a cliff and it will plink away at a melee unit while it travels around the hexagon to reach the ranged unit.Overall I do reccomend the game for fans of Endless Space and Civilization type games.  If micromanaging units is a must, stay away.			"

												I'm going to tell you why this game currently has a mixed review instead of its past positive review. The author of an unofficial Chinese-translation mod didn't respond back to the developers about his or her mod, and it was promptly removed somehow, which I don't even know how as I'm guessing they patched it where you can't change the game's text; I don't know. I know this doesn't exactly sound very much sense, since mods are made and used, at times, against the wishes of its creators. But rumor has it that the mod had a link that led anyone who used the mod to a Chinese pirating site, and this reference to a pirating website broke Steam's terms-of-service. The sudden removal of this mod angered the Chinese speaking community, and they protested the developer's action by bombarding the game with recent negative reviews. So, unless you're Chinese who can't read any of the game's supported languages, don't take the recent reviews to heart. If you are Chinese and who can read this; well, you gotta do what you gotta do. You can either support your fellow countrymen and bully the developers about the removal of the mod, or ignore it and play the game in English. You're responsible for your own actions so carry on.

Strategy games have always been my preferred poison, all the way through my years of gaming. In fact, the first PC game I ever played was a little-known RTS by the name of Command & Conquer Red Alert, way back in 1996, and ever since then the genre has stuck with me – or I with it. At some point however, the RTS genre and its macro-focused gameplay died out in favour of more micro-focused strategy games like Total War or Company of Heroes.  Fast forward a few years, to circa 2008-2010, when my beloved RTS games were starting to re-emerge with the release of Red Alert 3 and Starcraft 2. As one might have assumed, I was thrilled. Finally I was going to get to build bases, and armies, and navies, and collect resources, oh all the lovely resources, all over again. Except the magic wasn't there anymore. My obsession with the genre had seemingly vanished. Having spent the last few years replaying old favourites, like C&C Generals and AoE2, these newer games just didn't bring enough ""new"" to the genre, and it didn't relight any old fires.  But my thirst for military strategy wasn't gone, just because these new games didn't live up to my own hype. So I began looking outside of the RTS genre – and lo and behold, wouldn't you know, my own personal strategy-Jesus had been hiding under my nose all these years in the shape of the 4X-genre. I stumbled into Civilization 5 by happenstance, and I never looked back.  Which takes us to present day, Endless Legend, and the drug that is ""Just one more turn"". While Civilization held my attention for a long time, and still does to this day, my interest in the game started to wane when I realized there was only so much variation to be had. The most fun came from multiplayer, with human players, where their actions aren't always predictable. The computer follows a certain set of rules, while a human will not. And in the case of Civ5, these rules were set to change based on a very limited amount of variables. This is where I really being to drool over Endless Legend, and why it's such a great game, so bare with me. The rules the computer follows are, just as in Civ, based on variables. But the amount of variables are greater, much thanks to the game's unique neutral factions and elements that act independent of other players. While Civ5 has its City-states to be bribed, or its barbarians that need to be dealt with by force, Endless Legend has dozens of minor factions that can be both friend or foe, through combat, bribery, or quests. These can act as both a hindrance to your enemy, or a benefit to your empire, by suppling you with workers, gold (known as Dust), and sometimes special rewards for your various heroes, such as unique weapons or trinkets. Yes, heroes. Endless Legend features heroic units which are stronger than normal units and often have special abilities to be used in combat. The hero can be levelled up in an RPG-esque fashion, where you're given skill points to spend in a skill tree, which can benefit your heroes combat abilities, your armies strength, or a city's FIDSI (Food, Industry, Dust, Science, Influence) output if you assign them as a city's governor.  Endless Legend is riddled with RPG-influences, and that's nothing but great. In fact, I would argue, that the game's many RPG-aspects should be something to aspire to for other 4X game studios. Every single unit in EL can be personally outfitted by the player, from what kind of weapon they carry, to the boots they wear. And every piece of equipment directly impacts the unit's damage, speed, health, production time, production cost, and so on.  When you're out exploring, seeking treasure, slaying monsters to level your units and heroes, or just looking for new turf to expand your empire, you're constantly faced with choices to make, or actions to take. This keeps the game from ever reaching a lull, where you're just pressing ""next turn"", waiting for something to happen. You'll be wandering about, following through on quests that can take you all across the planet, sometimes to search for a troll's lost pet, and sometimes to besiege a city. Perhaps the Centaurs will want you to make a sizable donation in the form of 50 boxes of wine, or maybe the Orcs demand you avenge a kidnapping by an opposing clan in a bordering region. But Endless Legend is still a 4X game, not an RPG, and as far as I can tell, it's the king of them all. Here's a game, a 4X game, that has taken a genre that has gone without much change for a long time, and turned it on its head. By fusing sci-fi with fantasy, strategy with role-playing, Endless Legend has taken the four X's of exploration, expansion, exploitation, and extermination, and made something truly memorable and unique.  The fact that you fight over regions instead of city placements in comparison to Civ5 means the game revolves less around the amount of cities you have (or where you have them), and instead around how influential a region can be. Is it more beneficial to go for the warmer regions with lots of food, or the colder regions with lots of science? Maybe you should try to colonize the coastal regions before your enemies, to hinder their access to land or sea. Combine this with the different factions that are all unique, and provide different playstyles and different end goals, and seldom will any game turn out the same. Perhaps you, as the Wild Walkers – an elven-like people who favour the woods, and would like nothing more than a peaceful existence – end up an unfortunate neighbour of the Necrophages – an insect-like people, who are quick to expand and whose sole desire is to feed the hive – forcing you into a war against an enemy you weren't prepared for. You'll have to put aside your vision of a great wonder that would bring you to victory, and instead produce armies capable of withstanding the rapidly multiplying Necrophages. All the while, across an ocean, the Roving Clans, a people with only Dust on their mind, are nearing the ultimate economic victory. Will you seek a truce with the monsters, even if it might cost you dearly in the end, in order to quell a new threat in foreign lands, or will you fight the evil at your door, and hope someone else can quiet the Dust empire across the ocean? Whichever route you choose, the game might not play out as you hoped. It could fall in your favour, or it could favour the enemy. Either way, each game – as long as you allow it – will be a different experience. Empires will rise, armies will march, cities will be sieged, and heroes will sway the tides of battle. Ultimately, this is a great game. Not just in its genre, but overall. I recommend this game both to newcomers and veterans of 4X games. It's a learn-by-playing kind of game, and I think everyone who gives it a fair chance will love it.			"

												Everyone throws massive showers of praise on this game, they love the factions, they love the rpg elements, they especiallly love all it's new twists on the 4X stategy genre. And I enjoy these things, the RPG elements with regiments and heroes is really cool, the battles are an interesting twist from the norm, the quests are cool and the factions are all very disinct in look, play and lore. However, I must stress caution with this game, don't expect a masterpice, becasue it isn't, the increadible amount of praise on this doesn't take into account all of this games problems, which is what i'm going to stress here. I first played this game when my friend brought it over on his laptop, I would play a few quick, short games and they where so much fun, and indeed the start of the game is a lot of fun. But once I had the game and started longer playthroughs, I began to get bored really quickly. The game is great when you start it up, but as you get further in, it becomes a drag. This is largely the fault of a terrible AI, which isn't a good thing to have in a game for a genre that is heavily reliant on single player.The Ai just doesn't know how to play this game, it will always build the same armies over and over again, in one playthrough it will build full stacks of Dragonlings, and only that, then next playthrough it will build 6 wyverns and two ancients per army, and thats it, it will take a stack and only build that stack, and this makes battles in one playthrough increadibly repetitie and boring. It's play style will never suit the scenario, andf it will almost never declare war on you. It's increadibly easy to beat as well, and this means that games become a drag to play through till the end.The quest system, while initially pretty cool, has multiple problems, for one it won't often make sense what it demands of you, for instance it may tell you to conquer a city from someone you've signed an alliance with when there is someone else much closer who isn't your ally. Biggest problem however is that they can become uncompletable very easily. You can get a quest asking you to do something that you've alrady done, and as a result the quest becomes incompletable. I remember with horror when in one of my campaigns I got a quest to increase the population of one of my cities to a certain level, and found that the population was already at that level, and then the quest became incompletable! And this was a faction quest, the kind nessisairy to continue the storyline!The winter system too, while initially cool (no pun intended), helps this drag as it bcomes more and more frequent the further you go into the game, and this helps add to the drag that you start to feel the further in you go.There are some other problems, but most of them are really negligable, the biggest dissapointment is that these issues could all be fixed with a better AI, and so it is with a heavy heart that must say i can't recomend this game, despite all the effort in the art style, the lore and all the unique mechanics, the poor AI just makes this game soo boring. So I say don't buy this game, at least not yet, if they fix the AI then it'll have my full recomendation, but until that stage, I just have to say no.			"

												Endless Legend, like its sister game, Endless Space, is a well-crafted and interesting game with first-rate art assets. Unfortunately, also like its sister game, it is shackled to logic-defying gameplay decisions. Most notably, the combat AI and the presentation of information will trip you up repeatedly simply because they are often more in the way than helpful.The game world is very detailed and replete with good environmental assets that affect gameplay. Forests will increase a unit's defense, for example, attacking uphill will reduce attack, and there are even topological obstructions like cliffs that cannot be normally scaled and so create easily defensible positions. On the downside, though, because the land is so lush, you often cannot see the topology. Nor can you rotate the camera. The net result is that it is often very difficult to tell how to approach a certain spot, and even whether if it can be attacked by units in an adjacent space. If you are going to have topology affect gameplay then Rule #1 is that you must provide a means to assess what that topology is. Unfortunately, Endless Legend is indifferent to that rule and you are left to peer at the battlefield and guess. Often wrongly I might add. Even outside of combat you will still fall prey to being directed around cliffs you don't see.Note that the flying units don't have this problem as they can easily fly over obstructions and can attack from the base of cliffs. Ranged attackers can equally access enemies regardless of obstruction, but while ranged attackers can fire over water, flying units find water impassible and are forced to navigate over the land instead. An odd and troublesome choice, given that combat maps use the actual locale, and water often creates small and narrow spaces.The combat uses hex squares and as noted, can be affected by the terrain. There are probabilities for a normal hit, for missing and for critical hits depending on the unit's attack and the defender's defense. Different units have different attributes and those values can be affected by equipment, of which there are six tiers, each associated with a technological era. Leaders can also get special, quest-related equipment as well. So far, this is very nice. Where the game fails is in terms of the AI.The AI's biggest problem is in its obsession with getting units as far in as possible. Clearly, this avoids blocking the front of enemies and so allows other friendly units to engage the enemy as well. Unfortunately, it also tends to get units isolated and surrounded, and leads to units avoiding nearby enemies in favor of those far away, even if they can't reach them. It will leave your range attackers completely undefended, and cause crazy things like units moving away from combat because other friendly units temporarily block their path. You can override this behavior by giving initial commands to units. Unfortunately, if the enemy you told a unit to attack is killed, the suicidal AI again takes control, and you will likely spend the next move undoing what it just did. In its defense, the AI works sensibly most times and attacks adjacent enemies or those in range, but you will be forever overriding its initial assessment of what to do next.[Addendum: Note that you can have the unit defend rather than let the AI take over if a unit's target is killed, but this is a poor work-around because what you want is the AI to properly respond to the new situation rather than just disable it because otherwise it will do stupid things.]These issues aside, the last failing of the gameplay that I will note is with regards to engaging enemy units in the open game world, simply because you are sometimes not allowed to. That is, you cannot *force* even the weakest enemy into combat for it can choose to 'retreat,' where 'retreat' leaves them exactly where they were and once the initial half hit points is lost, very little damage is done. The net effect is that they can continually 'retreat' again and again and again by parrying your attacks and you will *never* take them down, even with armies over 5:1 in size and strength. This is a maddening, gross gameplay error that is tiresome in the extreme, as you will waste a lot of time trying to remove an enemy that cannot be removed. Why anyone would design combat with a guaranteed evasion move is incomprehensible, but Endless Legend thinks it's just fine.[Addendum: 'Groo the one' has pointed out that army stacks cannot retreat a second time in one turn so if you if you attack a retreating enemy with another army it will be forced into combat. This is a viable work-around to this problem, however, having a second army available of the appropriate strength and in the appropriate spot is more luck than planning, and is not something that you can rely upon. Nor is splitting your army a sensible thing to do in many situations. That means that you will still fall prey to this absurd design decision more often than not.]Despite these problems and deficiencies, though, Endless Legend is a very good game. It will drive you crazy every so often as a string of stupidities will follow one after the other, but, by in large, it is well worth your time.[Note: addendums added 11/18/16 to address two issues.]			"

												Just here to balance out the review score. Endless Legend should by no means rates a 47%. And something like ""Don't recommend because no Chinese version."" What is this arrogant farce?The overall aesthetics of EL is definitely amazing to say the least. The futuristic fantasy style design fits so well with the setting. The graphics have a very shrewd and modern fashion, if you are not a retro sucker then you should be absolutely satisfied with them. Hell, this game looks way better to me than the preview screenshots of Civ 6. The music is among the best game soundtracks I have ever listened to. The composer Fly By No really melded different styles of music into it, every time I open the game, the main menu track ""Song of Auriga"" always gives me goosebumps. Good music adds depth to a game, and for EL this is definitely the case.The gameplay is pretty good imo. The factions are very distinct, each favoring one or two specific victory condition. The exploration and exploitation parts resemble Civ very similiarly. For the expansion EL features an organic city growing system, which is adopted by Civ 6 now. City districts and extractors need to be put on the map directly, they can be destroyed or raided, which adds more to the strategic layer. The extermination, or the combat, of EL is probably my least favorite part. Instead of doing combat on the map like Civ, battles are resolved in a seperate tactical map. The problem is the combat isn't as diversed and interesting like say, AOW 3. So eventually I would just auto-resolve most of the fights.Overall, EL is a solid 8/10 for me. If the devs can deliver the rumored ""last expansion"" about naval thingy plus glitch fixing, I'd gladly raise it to 9.			"

												This game is very much Civ-inspired. Civ V: BnW+GnK, not Vanilla. It's hard not to compare the two because they share so much in common. But that's not a bad thing. It takes what works, and it adds some very nuanced depth to the mechanics.Faction selection is at the moment 8 choices. They cover most gamestyles you'd expect to find, for the most part they are fairly balanced between each other, with only one faction seen far and away as being UP, and none in particular as being OP. If you don't like any of the factions you're free to take one of the factions as a template, and make a custom faction, with different bonuses costing a set amount of creation points. You can also take some disadvantages to allow you more points to spend on bonuses.You start the game with a meager military, a hero, and a settler. You can't settle wherever you want, as there are a finite number of regions, and there  can only settle one city per region. Each region has its own host of strategic and luxury resources, who's exploitation is handled with city improvements. This is in addition to minor faction villages, which when pacified and settled, provide you different bonuses depending on which faction it is, and how many of their villages you own.Heroes are units that can either lead a military stack, or lead a city, providing bonuses to one or the other. For the most part they are slightly stronger than regular unit, but as they level up and acquire skills through a skill tree, they can become quite powerful, but also much more expensive. After researching a certain technology you're free to pick up as money heroes from the mercenary market as your wallet will afford you. You're also free to pick up other faction's heroes at the same time, if you so choose.Your city planning is handled with city improvements, most of which cost dust (money) to maintain. There are no ""workers"" in this game so most of your tile improvement is handled with city improvements. You can expand your city with borough expansions, which extends the urban sprawl of your city while adding the surrounding tiles as usable. However this comes at the price of happiness (which can be mitigated as your urban tiles level up by building surrounding urban areas, wiping out the happiness deficit of that particular tile).Citizen management is a large overhaul from Civ as well, it isn't something that is mostly used to fuel great people or beakers. Citizens can provide any of the basics of a city (food, money, production, research, culture, etc) at any time. Late game especially improvements can allow workers to provide more income than most tiles. Micromanagement of them allows for high level efficiency, but can get tedious towards the end of a game when your empire has a lot of workers, and a lot of cities.Periodically during gameplay, you'll break from normal weather to undergo winter. Winter for the most part, halves movement, decreases combat effectiveness and vision ranges, and plummits your city growth, production, and income for the (several turns) duration of winter. Most heroes, once leveled high enough, can learn a skill to mitigate or eliminate the effects of winter, on stacks of units, or cities. This becomes essential later in the game when the map becomes permament winter.Military is handled rather well, but could be expanded upon somewhat with more diversity in selection. Each faction gets 3 military units ranging from cavalry, infantry, archers, flying, and support. Each faction maintains a flavor for their selection of units, and these can later be upgraded and diversified with an rpg-style equipment system, most units carry a selection of at least 2 weapons selections which can change their role significantly, as well as a host of armors and accessories. However none of these change the appearance (save the weapons) of the unit. These 3 units are augmented with whatever units your minor factions can be recruited from. These too can be upgraded.Combat is handled much differently from Civ. It is not handled with dice rolls (although you are allowed that option). Every engagement is zoomed in on the map and played out in a Fantasy Tactics-type of minigame. You (or you can let the computer manage for you) fight the enemy's stack on the map as is, terrain and all. If the enemy AI was more detailed it would be more enjoyable, but they for the most part tend to attack the first thing they run into. Which (in my experience) means most of my stacks are developed as hordes of archers with 1 or 2 high defense tanks to block the enemy.As far as diplomacy goes, it's very rudimentary, you start off in cold war, for most factions, which means you're allowed to do anything to them short of outright taking their cities. You can negotiate peace, alliance, and trade settlements, or attack them. They will do the same.Questing is a big mechanic within the game. Each faction has its own quest lines, which pile your usual quest fair of kill this, and search this location, with more factional specific missions that try to guide you towards playing on the  strengths of your race. Expect conversion and building from the Cultists, trade and money from the trader oriented Roving Clans, etc. These are nice little distractions which keep interest in the game when you aren't actively at war or preparing for war.AI in general, is very unchallenging it seems, but so was Civ's. If you are fairly experienced with turn-based 4x games, you will most likely find Normal difficulty useful only to be introduced to mechanics or factions. The difficulty factor primarily seems to be from increases on the AI's starting roster, and their increases to research speed, production, and income. They don't seem to handle oceans or seas rather well either, in aggression or in peaceful expansion. So expect to perform better, with more water seperating you from the AI.Graphics, are stupendous. For a 4x game. The artstyle surrounding the game is also quite good, and maintains a very fantasy/sci-fi vibe. Units have a fair bit of detail to them, along with your cities, and the general tile layouts of the map. It's not hang up on your wall beautiful, but it looks good, doesn't get boring to look at for extended periods of time, and doesn't tax a moderately built computer's resources too much. However it does make initial map seeding take a fair longer than what I'd like, but once the game's loaded it runs without many hiccups.I have no experience with the multiplayer, but I haven't heard anything bad about it. No news is good news right?All things said, if you've enjoyed Civ V, EL brings enough new things around that it'll be interesting enough for several games. If you enjoy 4x games in general, it has some rough trimmings about it, but it is already a fairly solid game, with some fairly interesting mechanics bundled with it to make it one to give a shot.

												Tried the 1 hour CIV:BE demo. Too much of the same. So some people were recommending Endless Legend from the creators of Endless Space. I didn't like Endless space at all but this game is different.It's very much like Civ5 in a fantasy setting and lots of extra stuff added and annoyances removed.You can choose from 8 totally different factions or build your own one, based on an existing one.You get side quest, faction questlines, wars that feel reasonable paced, customization for your heroes.The present AI feels challenging and is exploiting your weaknesses. The autosaves for the last 5 turns may not be enough to save the day.There are some things I didn't like.In the late game the performance wasn't that great. Some infrequent crashes here and there plus balancing issues that can make the game much more hard/easy if played wrong/right.The information overflow or the lack thereof by hiding crucial information, because you didn't know it existed, takes some time to get used to.Overall if you're looking for an alternative for your typical 4X game, give this game a try. 8/10 "

												Really great 4X stratagy game.A lot of the mechanics are very similiar to their earlier title, Endless Space. The game has a lot of depth to it, and a large amount of very different races, which all have their own, unique mechanics.While most of the playable races are based and inspired by your stereotypical fantasy races (Elves, Humans, Dragons etc.), the lore and art design behind them always seems to have a creative and diverse flavore to them.As mentioned, the mechanics and depth of stratagy are both very solid and the game ends up being incredibly addictive.It really has that classic ""just one more turn"" feel, highly recommendet if you have many hours to waste!

												One of the most original and innovative 4x games to come out in years. Eight wildly varied factions (each with their own unique, expansive plotlines), a host of really interesting, unique mechanics (only one city per district, no tech tree). Most of the mechanics are very intuitive, but offer some pretty significant depth.This came out at the same time as Beyond Earth, but it's been much better received, and the reason for that is simple- it has personality. Playing with each of the factions is like starting a different singleplayer game, and the faction creator is very flexible. Like its predecessor, Endless Space, the game also has fantastic, understated art and music. The only problems are that some of the more advanced faction-specific mechanics are poorly explained, and that the AI can sometimes be poor at defending their cities. Amplitude have patched this, but some more work remains to be done.Overall, the most fun I've had with a 4x since Alpha Centauri.			"

												Really great 4x game with a wonderful fusion of Science and Fantasy. Lovely graphical design, and nothing feels out of place despite the peculiarities of the setting. I personally am very pleased I picked it up in Early Access, it was a wonderful adventure to see the game mature like it did. Difficulties ramp up very quickly, even on just normal setting (newbie +3) it's very easy to fall behind and not be able to catch back up if something goes wrong.			"

												I thought I'd write a quick review for this as some people might be looking at the deal on the Grand Master collection wondering if the game is worth it.  In short, I paid more than that for the game a year ago and got a lot less stuff and I have no regrets.The game does have some flaws but overall it is a really beautiful and innovative addition to a genre that doesn't often see much innovation.  Not all of the mechanics work brilliantly - but most do and over and over again while playing this title I found myself thinking 'this is something that really should have been in the new Civ games'...Much like Endless Space (which I also enjoyed, although not as much as this) I especially liked the thought that had gone into the different playable factions.  Rather than just having a few bonuses and penalties to separate them they often have quite drastically different mechanics - and in this title also interesting quest lines.  Along with lots of different victory types, events, minor factions, anomalies, etc there is plenty of replayability in this game.My main cautions are that the game has a steep learning curve and can even be confusing at first.  There isn't much of a tutorial although everything turns out to be surprisingly intuitive if you can stick with it.  Games can also be quite time consuming compared to similar titles, which isn't helped by the fact that the game can be slow and laggy on systems towards the minimum requirements.  It's very pretty but it's at a cost - expect larger maps to be borderline unplayable unless you are well into recommended requirements territory...			"

												Under the heading above titled: 'User reviews' please ignore 'Recent'.Recent examples: There are Chinese guys who aren't good at English and manifestly angry about it (because this game is obviously localized for a hot market like China) and another guy thought this was a HoMM clone. Still others thought it 'boring', 'sterile' and many found it 'confusing'... So I conclude that those who aren't Chinese and know what kind of game this is ought to be the right person to consider buying this title. Those with short attention spans and questionable intelligence, should in theory not enjoy this game. The rest of you not falling into the abovementioned categories may read the very many positive reviews that dwarf the negative ones entirely and rest securely in the knowledge that you would be buying a well-designed 4X title with plenty of content to justify its cost.Also don't play it in a hospital for the experience might turn out to be 'sterile'.

												Came to store page to buy DLC after a multi-month break and saw Recent Reviews 'Mixed'!! Honestly, that is unconscionable. This game is amazing.  I have spent 150 (oh god) hours playing this in single and multi player.  It does appear inpenetrable and shallow at first, but the depth on this game in incredible.  It is somewhat like Civilization, but with wildly different goals, land preferences, empire expansion styles, and units per civilization (not including the civs you can custom build).  This is easily the best 4x game since Civ IV and I don't think it is going to get unseated any time soon.On harder levels of difficulty you must actually understand the game and units really well, and actually manually perform battles.  You cannot steamroll the game with a complete lack of knowledge - this is a good thing.2 things to all those that say it is too hard: 1) do not scout like mad in the first 10 turns, like in Civ - this causes everything to aggro on you and wipe you out. 2) the LEVELS of your units matter much more than anything else, until late late game - keeping units from dying is imperative.

												I love the combat system. You move armies around the map like normal units, but when a battle starts you move into a sort of battlefied-level strategic interface that lets you arrange the units of the army and move them individually. This allows all sorts of strategy from flanking to stalling to wait for reinforcements to arrive. At the same time, while you can do some work to acquire a few additional base units, most unit upgrades in the game come in the form of you re-outfitting a base unit with new technologies and resources. That means that you essentially customize the design of each unit type in the game over time which is also a huge strategic factor. Overall, it makes the Civilization series combat/military seem like child's play.However, at the same time, I found the complexity sometimes getting in the way. The game uses a lot of invented words/culture which makes for an initial learning curve to know what is what (e.g. money is ""dust"" and all of the strategic resources are things I've never heard of). In a game that has a lot of concepts, I didn't seem to be able to find any in-game help that explains how everything works. I did play the tutorial and the tooltips are pretty well populated, but, for example, I had to go online twice to learn how unit healing works. The first time, nothing seemed to happen so I went online and found a lot of vague responses that said essentially that you heal automatically over time based on various metrics. Cool. Then I played another game and found that my units weren't healing and apparently the civiliztion perk ""can buy citizens with dust"" (which is money remember) implied that units of that civilization can only heal by using dust. But don't do that for all army units because your army will likely be mixed with minor faction units that heal on their own like usual. ... See how this starts to get pretty complicated? Better in game help would go a long way toward understanding these things in the first place, but in some cases it just seems needlessly complex even after you get to know it.The interface is mixed. I love the consistency of the pop-ups/windows (you can minimize or dismiss anything and right clicking on the background always takes you back). Allocating workers in a city has clever little interface as do some other areas. But then there are some annoying issues. The interface overall feels too ""busy"". I find a lot of times I'll overlook a unit on the map because of how busy/detailed the graphics are. There is no way to rotate your view which means sometimes you're looking at inconvenient angles. The actual battle controls seem to require a lot of extra clicking when I'm trying to micromanage. So, the interface is definitely good and bad, frustrating at times.Despite all its complexity, there are a few areas the game takes a simpler approach than many others. The world make is kind of like the game Risk in that its divided into predefined region settling/taking a city anywhere in that region gives you total control of that region. This eliminates a lot of the sense of the strategy of defining and growing your border or varying city density. Another area where it seems sadly simple is the navy. As far as I can tell there is no naval combat (nor air combat) which is a bit disappointing given how rich so much of the rest of the game is.Overall, I recommend this game and I'll be putting in more time to learn it and enjoy it. It's certainly not perfect, but overall it does some interesting things and is fun and strategic.			"

												The first time I heard about this new project from Amplitude, I got very excited. VERY VERY EXCITED. I loved Endless Space (even with it's shortcomings). I knew what I wanted to be there, and from the feature list and reading on the forums, I knew that EL would have almost all of it, with the potential for all of it with Amplitudes propensity to give free add-ons and support. The game is absolutely beautiful. It has all of the common fantasy tropes (a good thing) but each has a twist (even better). City spam? GONE. Unique tech? present. Fun factions? there in spades. Tactical combat? Indeed (and getting better). Lots of resources?.. I'm in heaven. Naval combat? coming soon. Minor factions? oh yea!!! I'm sold. The A.I. is getting better in both combat and city/unit management (very important). As a community, we the players suggest, and Amplitude is still istening and making changes. We even got a faction added to the game. By the community, for the community. Amplitude really is working with us. Now, to the game. I love the winter mechanic because it acts like an enemy (Winter is coming after all). The planet has a volatile nature and it moves from the carrot to the stick at the drop of a hat. One moment summer is there and your economy is in full swing, then winter hits, and you are wondering if you'll be the same after it passes. Auriga (the planet we're on) is dying, and it's time to leave. Many different ways of doing that. The usual victory conditions: Domination, science, military and more. It has a robust quest system that will get more depth as the devs continue to add components to the game (co-op quests perhaps). Hero leveling that actually has meaning. Meaningful (still getting balanced) unit and weapon design. No two regions are the same because of the location of the crucial resources. You get to plan it out as you decide how to grow your empire. One of the factions, Roving Clans, even gives you a do-over if you find a better settlement options because your scarab cities can move. How cool is that!!! As you pacify the minor factions, you get to chose a couple to join your ranks. But wait, you wanted that other one... you know.. the one that your enemy controls!!!!!  No problem, just buy it on the market place and make it a privateer. Now you can wage war, without waging war....  Nice!!! I can keep going, but why spoil all the surprises. Oh yea, I love the changes to the UI that they implemented since ES. LOVE THEM!!!That was the good.  Now the bad. The game is a graphics hog, and it can be slow between turns and during combat. Make sure you have a fast machine with a good graphics card, or play on lower settings. The A.I. can be rather obtuse sometimes, but then again, when have you played a 4x game with a strong and well rounded A.I. from the get go? me? never. The tool tips could be better because there is soooo much going on.  They need a more in depth tutorial that isn't so boring. I was bored, I couldn't finish it. Naval combat and aquatic resources are mostly missing, but we're told that is their next major thing, as well as espionage.  Nice!!!I am sure there is something I'm leaving out, but I hit all the main points.Updated December 6th, 2015: I would give Endless Legend at it's current state 9.25/10. All the patching and additions have realy brought up the score. This game is fantastic. I highly recommend it. Go out and get it.. go go go!!!Update #1: March 28th, 2015 - Three free add-ons have added much requested features and extended the gameplay. The AI has improved and the bugs are all but disappeared. I can honestly say that the game is a 8.9 or almost a 9. So close.  If you are still hesitating, don't.Update #2: April 29th, 2015 - The release of the Guardians DLC really improves on the early and mid game. Your choices now have meaning that carries through the late game. Titan units with co-op quests and legendary buildings? Where do I sign up. Oh yea, right here. I can't wait to see what else comes from AMPLITUDE Studios.Update #3: October 1st, 2015 - The Shadows DLC is amazing. It finally brings us the espionage mechanic all the while introducing an espionage focused faction called the Forgotten. The single player game has improved, but the multiplayer game is where it's att. Continued support and incorporation of community feedback has made EL one of the best 4X MP experiences out there. The espionage mechanic makes consider some really important choices. Use heroes to command your armies, as city administrators or foreign spies. You can now pillage and loot. YOu have invisible armies on the field. So much to do... Update #4: Demeber 6th, 2015 - Echoes of Auriga and the Lost tales are two mini DLC (paid) that add additional quests, events and new music by FlyByNo. Amplitude knows how to keep you engaged with compelling lore and music. Both of these tiny DLC are worth every penny.Another part of this update is the FREE-DLC called Forges of Creation. Within it, Amplitude has put in some serious effort into updating the A.I., which by the way is getting much better. It also has a solid balancing pass from SP/MP gameplay. But, the reason it's named thus has to do with moding and Steam workshop support. This one has both. Finally!!!Update #5: April 21st, 2016 - The Shifters DLC blew me away. The Allayi faction with their multiple personality disorder, winter affinity and tall empire growth really makes them fun. The new re-worked winter mechanic with the Pearls of Auriga and the Alter of Auriga to eXploit them is spot on too. The new tracks from FlyByNo just make it that much better. Update #6: October 26th, 2016 - The Tempest is here. I thought the Shifters eXpansion was amazing, but compared to the Tempest, it was not bad. Tempest brings us a new faction, the Morgawr, a new minor, the Fomori and a new mechanic, the ocean. With the new weather effects and oceanic citadels, the oceans have become important. The Morgawr are amazing, and the new added quest lines really flesh out Auriga further. Do not hesitate and pick up this amazing content. Endless Legend is better than ever.Was there a small AI update too? Yes.Another balance pass? Yes.Bug fixes? Yes.Keep up the great work Amplitude Studios and please keep the DLC coming. Such high quality stuff indeed.Go check out eXplorminate.net and see what they have to say about. 4X Game of the year for 2014.			"

												This is what Elemental could have - and SHOULD have - been.Best description for this game from me is that Endless Legend is a 'post-cataclysmic-event science fantasy genre blend of Civilization and Age of Wonders'. If you enjoy either of these games I strongly recommend snapping it up; the combat options are excellent, the cities requiring less micromanagement than most 4x type games, and the game storyline and history that you unravel through each of the races is not only unique but incredibly detailed.There are a few quirks with the game (trade, diplomacy, city placement), so I do suggest that the tutorial game be played through, even by the more experienced 4x gamers, just to familiarise yourself with them. The only real beef I have with the game is that there are a couple of race options that require some serious rebalancing; in the game's current state they'll kick you to the curb if you have a human player running them properly no matter what you do... except ganging up on them, which is never fun...So all in all, I give this game a 8.5/10. I haven't played it in a while now and there have been some DLC expansions released in the meantime, so I may re-evaluate my score further down the track :)			"

												A visible improvement from Endless Space. Thing that impressed me the most is the UI. It really feels like it flows nicely, with beautiful art that will make browsing through data feel really natural and not at all painful. Its easy to navigate, and acess anything you need without being cluttered. - Heroes and Units now have a fantasy setting gear you can equip them with and improve it through tech and resources.- Random factions and armies that roam the regions are challenging and will go against players, similar to barbarian behaviour in CiV.- Overall art and visual effects are quite impressive, even featuring little things - like separate intro movie in MP depending on which faction you play - that to me at least really mean a lot.It is a lot different then Endless space. It is a good hexagonal RTS , which I would really recommend if you find yourself liking games like Civilization, Warlock and alike.			"

												Big fan of Civ IV and unhappy with Civ 5/6? Play Endless Legend. It has that old school feel with modern mechanics, awesome graphics, and a lite version of the Unit Design Workshop from SMAC. This is what you wanted Civ V to be, but with a fantasy/sci-fi flair.Think Civ V is a great 4X/TBS game? Play Endless Legend. Prepare to be blown away. Competent AI that isn't crippled by 1 Unit Per Tile. Civs that are actually different from each other in appearance, gameplay and mechanics. No generic warriors or spearmen, or a reskin with a generic +1. Ability to customize your armies, Great Generals that actually lead armies and fight, or other Great Leaders that stay at home boosting the capabilities of the city they are based in. Minor Civs that instead of just sitting there waiting be conquered, offer quests with potential gameplay changing rewards, new units that you can then build, and more. A thoroughly useful and well designed UI.I just finished my forth game of EL, and I doubt I'll ever waste ""just one more turn"" on a Civilization game again.			"

												Endless Legends is a beautifully crafted game that rates at the top of the 4x genre.  The game pace is somewhat slower but the quality of the game and the story lines built in to the game make it worth playing over and over,  For gameplay and asthetics I prefer Endless Legends over the new Civ BE which I also have.  Both are great games but BE is really another Civ with some nice new features and additions where Endless Legends is a new game with a complimentary story line that takes place in the pre Endless Legends universe.If you buy it you will not be sorry. As a new game there are still some tech glitches and AI issues to be worked on but I have played for well over a month with no errors or crashes so it is well on the way to be another classic.			"

												Why on earth are the recent reviews mixed? On any other game, that would set off red flags for me as a potential buyer, and that's terrible.Endless Legend is a beautiful 4x strategy game, making terrific use of procedural generation for its terrain and ensuring a fairly unique experience for each game. The writing and ""story"" of the game are fantastic and I find myself drawn far into the Endless lore. It also gives plenty of customization and modding support, which is practically a must-have for indies nowadays. Even in the vanilla game, you can tweak values in the map generator and turn off/on victory conditions if you aren't fond of some. You can also create your own faction, with its own traits, in case you aren't fond of the original ones.Amplitude seems to care a lot for updating the game's content. I hear there's an expansion coming out soon that will - finally - add naval warfare to the game, which is one of the few things Endless Legend lacks.Honestly, if you're into 4x strategies and like detailed, pretty world-building, this game is a must-have.

												(Review for version #[1.0.24]  #2014/12/11)Endless Legend is a 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate; Sid Meier's Civilization is an important example of the 4X-era) turn-based fantasy game.It's really difficult - for an old strategist like me - to find something wrong within the game. +The visuals are stunning, +the soundtrack is harmonic and match the turn-based gameplay, +the combat system is simple, yet interesting,+a modern transparent UI,+Customizable race and units and +Mod support.(Also the lore is quite fascinating)But! - like every pro - there is critic:-Like in other strategy-games, there's a lack of AI-performance. If you turn up the difficulty, it will just provide higher buffs (like more money, more science etc.) for the AI. It could simulate a challenge for someone, but for others it's just cheating and unfair. (I will deny my own opinion in this regard)Overall, good stuff. Not bad for an Indie-game. This game tried some new ideas and implemented those successful.8.5/10			"

												Came into this game expecting something akin to Civ 5, and was pleaseantly suprised to find that I enjoy it much more.The AI is a bit more challenging for early and mid-game, the factions all seem to have their unique niche/gameplay mechanics, the map has a cool elevation system and active weather, and the RPG-like elements have a cool feel to them as you customize your units and work through the faction stories.I find myself losing track of time as I play. Nice job Amplitude!			"

 TL;DR  -  9/10, worth buying at full price if you like deep strategy games. Would be a strong 10/10 if endgame were successfully rebalanced.Endless Legend is a deep, complex 4x game with a great selection of unique factions and a ton of strategy. Of the many 4x games I've played, this is the only one that holds up to the Civ series, and actually exceeds it in many respects. Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone who loves strategy. It is fun and extremely addicting.The game has a long learning curve - hundreds of hours in, I'm still improving. I absolutely love this about the game, though some may find it overwhelming. Every turn presents choices, and every choice feels important. Mistakes are punished harshly, and can make or break your early game. To play well, you must pay close attention to every detail. You must be aggressive but careful at the same time, and most of all, you must be thorough.Manual combat is very difficult, and can be frustrating. Checking each unit's initiative and minding the terrain are essential. Even then, things will not go as planned. That being said, I don't see this as a weakness - just a challenge. Keep in mind, most 4x games do not feature anything close to this. And if you don't like it, you can just use auto-combat (which works quite well). THE PROBLEM Once you learn the ins and outs, you realize that Endless Legend has one major weakness: Endgame. The problem is with pacing, scaling, AI, and the lack of an effective ""limiter"".The pace of the game accelarates as certain empires start to dominate the map, and the numbers get out of control. The victory conditions are reached too quickly, and feel anticlimactic. By the time you reach the final tier of technologies and get the best gear, the game is pretty much over and you don't get to use any of it. This is extremely disappointing after a very long game of building up to that point.Additionally, the AI does not function well in endgame. They don't upgrade their equipment all the way, and you can crush them easily in every fight. Even on higher difficulty settings, they just pump out lots of weak armies.Basically, endgame needs a serious rebalancing, and it needs something that slows the game down (especially victory conditions) and limits the exponential growth of empires. Approval rating (the equivalent to happiness in Civ) should be the limiting factor, but it is too easily overcome.If the devs pulled off a serious endgame overhaul, I can say confidently that Endless Legend would be the greatest 4x game ever made. As it stands today, it's still a great game, but the disappointing endgame is a real buzz-kill.			"

												So, you see your classmates play 4X games whileawaiting the teacher to arrive, these classmatesof yours with pallid, pale skin and suffer from being nasal, socially-awkward virgins writing terriblestories about nuclear weapons and Shadowmen.Enter the hot Goth chick who walks in with hercherry red laptop and her confident stride, abovethe lowly peons where she sits and broods out ofthe window as she awaits her laptop to boot up.The teacher calls in sick, and it has become a freeperiod of relaxation. Your nerdy classmates revelin their hollow victory. The girl simply groans. Everyone is seen on Steam on their laptops, playingCivilization V and Civilization: Beyond Earth.You wade through the list of classmates online whensomething catches your eye. _Summer-Rain_ is nowlogged in, playing a strange game that you've never even heard of before this day.Endless Legend.You glance at your Gothic princess, whom you catchlooking at you from behind her cherry red laptop.She averts her eyes, _Summer-Rain_ having beenexposed stealing glances at you. Your heart flutters, and you gulp down, thinking this may be your chance for _Summer-Rain_...You are soon $35.00 poorer as you hope and prayto whatever dark deity your Gothic princess worshipsthat the school's pathetic internet connection willdownload the game in time before class ends, and itis as if the demonic forces grant you a full installation.You enter Endless Legend and quickly scan throughthe factions, eight in total:Wild Walkers (Elves)Broken Lords (Cool-looking ghost-mummies)Necrophages (Undead insects)Ardent Mages (Goths obsessed with self-harm)Drakken (Dragons)Cultists (Overzealous, religious cyborgs)Roving Clans (Arab-Jew Hybrids)and the Vaulters (The only sane-looking people)You play it safe and pick the Vaulters. Even the game tells you they're the best factionto learn. You have your faction and you join theopen game that _Summer-Rain_ is currently in.The hexagon tiles rise up and the world loadsbefore your eyes. You are bombarded with anever-ending series of information windows andfunny-looking symbols which denote what youwill learn later are the resources of the game, which are:Dust (Gold or money of Endless Legend)Science (Used for research purposes)Industry (To make your units and upgrade cities)Food (pretty self-explanatory)along with a slew of Luxury Resources which areused for advanced weapons and technologies.Endless Legend is turn-based, meaning everythingdone on a player's turn is crucial. Researching thewrong technology over a period of turns and notpaying attention to the one you needed would bedisastrous, in addition to not being able to manageone's economy effectively would lead to the player'sempire to implode upon itself.After the first 10 turns _Summer-Rain_ appears, using the Ardent Mages, to no one's surprise.She hammers upon your fledgling city with an armyusing combined-arms tactics, but you are wise tohave fielded a smaller second army and crush herwould-be invasion force.As you divide and conquer your forces to have onearmy go after _Summer-Rain_'s Capital and anotherarmy complete the randomly-generated, scriptedquests which inhabit the world to pursue your QuestVictory condition, _Summer-Rain_ was hard at workthrowing everything she had into research and beganthe construction of a Wonder.The tides turned with her on the defensive but havingan advantage in building a Wonder this early, you howl and wail with a succession of armies you continue to field, even diverting your Questing army to break through _Summer-Rain_'s territory and assail the city where her Wonder is being built. But you are unsure of the exact location and which city the Wonder is being built at, and before long your defeat is heralded when your screen is replaced with the beautifully-illustrated image of an Ardent Mage standing proudly with the Wonder in the distance.You slam your fist into your table and your nerdyclassmates glance worriedly before going back totheir futile game of colonizing a small moon as youhang your head down in shame.The free period over, everyone packs up and wants to leave for the next class. You are about to foldaway your laptop when _Summer-Rain_ approachesyou, looking radiant and beautiful. She smiles and tells you that for a beginner youweren’t all that bad and that she was going easy on you. You manage a smile in response, fighting back your nerves as you tell her that you were intrigued by Endless Legend and that you swear you didn't read the on-the-fly descriptions of how to play the game._Summer-Rain_ walks past you toward the door and tells you that she would love to talk to you all about Endless Legend and the newly-released Guardians expansion for the game over lunch after school. Her scent interrupts your logic, her eyestease you and her lips smile sincerely.

												For ♥♥♥♥'s sake man,I sat down with a friend to try to convince him to buy the game (I had only 2 hours of gameplay at the time, basically just done the tutorial and started a game which I messed up on, whatever, learning is hard). So I'm showing him the basics, and 7 hours later we realize it's 1:30am and we're adults - we have to work in the morning.  We're on turn 67, and we're expanding our empire, like the Romans that we are.So, my review of the game is thus:10/10 for losing your girlfriend. Who has time to manage that when you've gotta queue up industry.0/10 for getting enough sleep.  I can already tell this is going to ruin me. RIP my career.  Thank god I work from home and don't need to wear pants to work. "

												It is actually difficult to find something wrong with this game. The visuals are stunning, the soundtrack fits the world and events perfectly, the combat is fun and well put together and the lore is phenomenal. Not to mention the multiplayer, which is equal parts intense and satisfying.  This game tried some new ideas, and somehow nailed every one of them. By the way, THIS IS AN INDIE GAME. The fact that an indie game can go up against a major game series like Civ and still succeed is a testament to the stellar game design and tireless effort that obviously went into the making Endless Legend.Summary: This is an instant classic.

												Wow, that is all I can say after playing Endless.  I didn't think I could get sucked into a game where I would say ""just one more turn"" and that one more turn would turn into 100 turns.Due to the various factions I think I could play this game over and over again without feeling it is repetitive.CIV was great when it first came out but Endless took it to a whole new level.

Endless Legend is similar to classic 4X games like Civ but adds many new mechanics and elements that make the game refreshing and unique. Each run feels different and fresh thanks to the 8 playable factions - all with their own unique specialties, traits, units, heroes, and mechanics; there's also over 15 minor factions that you could assimilate to bolster your faction's strength or cover a weakness. If that is not enough variety for you, then you could also make your own custom factions! You can also customize your heroes and units with weapons and equipment you unlock via research or from quests. For instance, the Vaulter's archer unit - the Marine - can be equipped with long bows that are strong against flying units or a 1handed crossbow and shield for more defense and extra firepower in short-ranged combat. Armor and accessories can be mixed and matched to customize your heroes and units even further.The game also features politics and trading like your standard 4X fare but adds a new twist due to the introduction of influence as a resource needed to engage in such. Influence is not only used to for politics and trades, but also for assimilating minor factions and passing empire plans that give buffs to your empire.The game might seem daunting and intimidating at first due to the many complex mechanics and vast amounts of customization available to new players - but they're actually easy to learn and engage with thanks to the smooth and intuitive interface as well as the empire screen and army screen which shows a summary of everything in your empire like your cities, resource production, construction queue, heroes and armies, etc etc. All it takes is just 2 clicks to find anything you might have lost track of in the map.Atmosphere-wise, the game us top-notch - with gorgeous visuals and art style, backed by an amazing soundtrack, and fascinating fantasy/sci-fi story and lore.My only complaints is that the AI can be quite dumb; and slow-down may happen when a game gets ridiculously long like turn 300+.Overall: Highly recommended for newcomers and hardcore fans of the 4X genre.

												For the first 20 hours of gameplay, I thought I had found a new 4X game to add to my favorites along with Civ and AoW. Unfortunately that feeling did not last. Amplitude did a lot of things right but in the end failed to make the game engaging enough for ""endless"" replays.  Gameplay features that made me come to this conclusion around the 40-hour mark are as follows:1.	Winter is a game breaking borefest. If it appeared randomly after 30 to 50 turns and lasted between 5 to 10 turns, it would be an interesting feature… but the way it is implement (where winter occurs more and more often, lasts longer and longer and leads to endless winter by turn 200), it is simply a chore and the opposite of fun. The AI does nothing during winter, productivity comes to a screeching stop, and movement and offensive military action are severely hampered. This equates to a clickfest on the “next turn” button. Few skills and techs help with winter’s onslaught, and even if Amplitude added some, it would affect replay. Good 4X games let you implement your winning strategies, they don’t dictate which techs should be researched in order to compensate for devastating scripted events. This reminds me of Medieval Total War, where after building up your empire, you knew that everything would be laid to waste by the scripted Black Plague and the back-to-back Mongol and Timurid invasions. 2.	City invasions are too easy. Considering that empire building is really engaging in Endless Legend, you end up holding off your armies and then unleashing them in the game’s last ""decent length"" summer, before the endless winter comes, or otherwise you lose on points. Again, Amplitude is dictating gameplay with their lore. I don’t care for lore in a 4X game, it affects replay.3.	The Quests are ill-conceived and do not provide enough reward. Almost all of them will ask for some resource only available in the next era, to visit a location in a region controlled by another faction that would require you to declare war just to get to it, or to develop one of your city with Level 2 districts and city centers that would take at least 50 to 100 turns to complete. Same thing applies for assimilating Minor Factions: their requests can either not be fulfilled anytime soon, force your hand into war (which you don’t want to do considering the poor return you get from assimilating Minor Factions) or make you turn to the marketplace to purchase the requested items only to realize that it would be twice as cheap to just bribe them into submission.Putting aside those issues, I love everything else about this game. AI, combat and diplomacy all need to be improved, but it is not game breaking for me. If they can make winter optional or configurable, perfect city invasions so it is better balanced and change the questing and Minor Factions assimilation features to make them more enjoyable and worthwhile, they will greatly improve the replayability factor. As it is now, I was fun playing through a game, but I doubt I will revisit Endless Legend often. "

Review Updated 6-15-2015Reason: To address comments, and remove negative feedback that has been addressed since the original post.I have mixed feelings on this game.From a more short term point of view, the game is awesome. What i mean by this is someone who wants to get the game, and play a couple matches, there is enough new and exciting content to make it worth it.But if you are looking for that game to match or rival Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri (that you still play after years), then this isnt it.In my opinion this game could be awesome. But the amount of bugs, glitches, broken and missing systems outweigh the positives, and that is why im giving it a negative review. Its like a computers game version of a 'tease'. ""Here is all this awesome stuff...that i will fail to deliver."" The AI makes single-player play only a short term option.Breakdown:Positives:+ Each Faction has unique technologies and unique playstyle+ Each Faction has unique units (changing factions forces you to change combat style)+ Each Faction actually feels distinct and plays differently+ Beautiful world design with unique concepts+ Detailed Civilization Statistics easily accessed during the game.+ Customizable Races and Units+ Customizable MapsNeutral:+- Unique map system that is cool but doesnt allow you to see the whole world at any one time+- Quest system, while a positive at first glance, is poorly done and alot of quests 'break' easily, quest count is low which leads to lots of repitition+- Unique 'Winter' system, while a positive at first glance, effects everyone the same and only slows the game down+- No naval system for people that like water maps. I just turn water levels way down.Negatives:- No Key Rebinding and limited shortcuts- Lack of documentation. Tutorial/Wiki only give the broad information on how to play the game. Indepth game mechanics are not explained. There is no internal game library (like Civ) to explain these details either.- Bugs are addressed each patch. However there are still a few annoying ones that havnt been addressed since January.- The diplomacy system is better. Flavor text makes sense most of the time. Trade values are still iffy which leads to easy exploitation.- While each faction has a backstory, it is harder to work through some factions then others. Others can ruin your play if you try to follow them (as Drakken, try to take that one city all the way across the map, of the Ally you have been friends with since the start of the game)- The battle system IS unique. But in a negative way. Lack of unit control and poor programing lead to frustration. You give commands at the start of each battle round. Issues occur when your units cant follow your orders (which is often). The AI takes control of your units and sends them places which dont make tactical sense. (HINT: Make all of your units ""Stand Ground"" to avoid the crappy AI moves)- A full unit stack (6-9 units) can kill (literally hundreds) of weaker units and take tons of cities without taking major damage. There is no 'fighting your way back' in this game.- Taking cities is waaaayy to easy. You can easily take a close neighbors city within the first 20 turns.Major Negatives: ***AI is still pretty terrible.- It cant fight in battles. Once you get the hang of the battle system its easy to trick.- Makes no diplomatic sense. Never fights empires that are threats. Easily bribed.- It cant build 'strong' armies. It doesnt upgrade units early/often enough.- AI technology selection doesnt make sense (Dust based civilization skips 3 dust boosting techs). They also routinely skip ""unskippable"" techs.- Kinda stops playing if they lose majority of empire. Never see more armies from them or any switch from horizontal to vertical gameplay.- Doesnt play to victory type. Playing conquest victory? Every AI empire is fine playing an economy based game as one empire slowly takes out empires one by one.Final Statement:The game is in much better shape then when i started playing in November. I last played during th beta release of the expansion pack. AI still needs work.			"

												This game has been out a while and this review may never reach anyone but whatever.I really liked Civ. The 4x genre appealed to me and Civ was a damn good game to get into at the time. That said, I'm not a big solo game type of player. I don't really enjoy playing vs AI. I've got a solid group of friends and multiplayer is where we set our hearts on. Time and time again Civ would crash, freeze up and just corrupt. Hours and hours of multiplayer games wasted and ended before the fun could really start. Endless Legend WORKS. It just ♥♥♥♥ing works. I want to really push that point home. If you were disappointed with Civ's♥♥♥♥♥♥multiplayer, Endless Legend could be a real option. Any time steam would go down or there was a DC, we instantly could go back to lobby, load up that turn or 1-2 turns prior and continue. Every. Single. Time. If you have a group of friends that are looking for a 4x game, I highly recommend this game. We played easily 60-80 hours before we noticed any imbalances in the game. We are able to turn on and off different content in the main menu. A REALLY nice feature. We've opted to disable the Guardians content because it's heavily RNG based. For example, I as the Broken Lords was easily able to accumulate 4,000 dust. I was rewarded with 200 of a very powerful strategic resource which allowed me to in a matter of 10 turns, dwarf my friends and crush them 1v2. Guardians has fun additions for single player but for multiplayer, we've had a much better + more balanced time since we turned Guardians off.150 hours in and I just want MORE. I think a large part of it is that while the game is fun, I've many friends to play with consistently. If I only had the ingame AI, I'd probably have only played 50 hours or so. Going beyond Serious difficulty, the AI doesn't get smarter, they just get more free stuff which is pretty lame. Playing with friends, the politics, the diplomacy and back stabs are ♥♥♥♥ing epic!I'm glad I got this game. If you have friends that want to try a 4x, I heavily recommend this one. If you get into it, try disabling Guardians and see if that resolves any frustrations with the RNG aspect of Legendary Deeds. If you just want to play vs the AI, you'll probably get bored after 30 hours or so - still really good value if its on sale. "

												Endless Legend is one of those happy cases where the good impressions have resulted in an excellent game. Not among those that penalize the most complex products because they are not suitable for the mass audience, we can not help but reward him, pointing out a couple of problems that still exist, and which do not allow him to achieve excellence: the AI is little aggressive, even in the higher difficulty levels, making it unpredictable at times, too much other; random generation of maps and the need to amass troops suffered the first assaults, can create an initial disadvantage that makes it advisable to start the game in search of better luck. For the rest I suggest Endless Legend unconditionally, especially if you love the genre 4X, buying it because you will get hundreds of hours of excellent turn-based strategy. "

												Beautiful game. I came in as a Civilization 6 refugee and haven't stopped 145 hours of playing time ago. I really can't think of a weakness that comes to mind.  The AI makes seemingly rational decisions during diplomatic interactions and can fight a war.  The UI and graphics can seem a bit cluttered when you first start playing the game.  But, after some experience (and customization of the notification pop-ups), it's becomes much more manageable.  The graphics are fantastic.   The factions are all unique and interesting.  This game has a lot of replayablility (it's a word, damn it) value.Bottom line: this game is really enjoyable. Get it!			"

Posted: March 17, 2015
												Im so sorry Civ 5, Endless Legend is just better. Thats not easy for me to say, as i love Civ 5 more than any other game ive ever played. For years ive come back for one more turn, endlessly, never tiring of the game. Untill i bought Endless Legend after seeing it win 2014 game of the year on Rock Paper Shotgun. I bought it, and stumbled through the first few turns of a Drakken playthrough, and realized in those few turns that i was suddenly tired of Civ 5. I have said, ""man i wish that feature was in here"" or ""they should but this and that in Civ BE (which they didnt) or ""this needs to change in Civ 6"" a million times. And all those changes i ever wanted were already there in endless legend. Entire armies of only unique units. Truly fully cusumizable units. Cities can expand in physical size on the map and encompass more tiles, till the planet looks like Coruscant. Truly unique factions, not just a weak bonus and one unique unit, i mean the factions are unreacognizable from each other. I mean one faction can even MOVE its cities somewhere else. Or this other one can literaly trick other players into siging and agreement that they dont want. another action quite literary feeds on the flesh of the other factions for growth. They are all truly disticnt, unlike civ 5 and BE's stale factions and units. If you were whatching a game were you couldnt see the name of a factions cities and could not see there factions color on civ 5, you probly couldnt tell two factions arpart, untill one of them builds there only unique unit. That will never be a problem in EL. Not only is every unit unique, but the city art is so lovingly crafted, a glance at a city and you know what faction owns it. Each faction has radically diferent architechture from the others. But enough on the aesthetic part of the game. The gameplay is something to behold. Because gameplay is different for all factions, ill just cover the basics. There are regions. Only one city cam be built in a region, and that city is named after the region its constructed in. Once a cities constructed, a farm or any other tile improvement (called exploitations) are automatically built on the tiles surrounding a city. As your population grows, you gain workers. Workers dont roam the map, but instead are assigned in cities to work a specific type of tile, not an individual tile. Cities expand to new tiles by building districts, which expands  the size of the city by adding a new bock. Coin is replaced by dust, which is money, and has magical purposes as well. Luxary resoursces are used to create empire boost, which cost a amount of resource, so having large quanities of the smae luxary is very beneficial. Ifluence is used to make deals, and assimilate villages, which are a mix of barbarians and city states. There are so many diferent systems in this game i cant possilby cover them all. Just buy the game and play it.			"

												A fascinating take on 4x games that's too poorly documented and fiddly to recommend.--Pros--Some of the most specialized factions I've ever seen in a 4X game. They each get unique units (different classes of units, not just stat modifications) and have dramatic civilization modifiers, such as the roving clans faction that get significant economic benefits but cannot declare war.Cities are limited to 1 per (fairly large)province, which prevents overcrowding while still giving a lot of freedom in city placement.On top the usual forest/grassland/river tiles you would expect, there are also a plethora of ""anomaly"" tiles, which give powerful and unique bonuses. Each province usually has 1-3, which coupled with terrain + resources contributes to each province having its own flavor.Interesting and varied quests.Almost all heroes and units can be customized.You can integrate a wide variety of minor factions (each which their own bonus and unique unit) into your empire. However, you can only do this with 1-3 minor factions, so this choice is nice way to further customize your faction.--Cons--Extremely poor tutorial and in-game documentation. Unlike the Civilization games, there's no help menu or in game tips. You're just kinda thrown in to flail.Finding and reading the 60-page manual (an online pdf) helps, but lots of important mechanical details (especial faction-specific) are still not explained and need to be uncovered by coincidence / trial and error.Examples: The cost of a technology scales based on the amount of technologies you have, INCLUDING those acquired from quests or trade, meaning you can accidentally sabotage all your future research by completely a quest for a technology you didn't need (PS: It's impossible to cancel quests.)Even though cultists only have one main city, they get 10% of the strategic/luxury resources from a province where they have a converted village IF they have the appropriate mining technology (technology which you would never research unless you knew this rule).As an additional frustration, this game was in early access for a while and it can be hard to tell which wikis or forum posts have outdated information about how the game's systems work.The battle system is really bad. It's hex based like HoMM or King's Bounty, but instead of specifying moves, you specify intent. However, after 40+ godd*mn hours, I'm still not sure how to get my archers to just attack something convenient without suicidally charging into the fray. Additionally, when attacked, a unit must counterattack, consuming it's action. It's an interesting way to make initiative matter, but now you have imprecise commands which are ignored half the time anyway, and the combat frequently feels like a comedy of errors.Additionally, combat takes place on the geography of the world map (but with cities and uninvolved units removed). Even leaving aside coastal battles (where you might not even be able to deploy most of your army because you had a sea at your back) the geography complications can play havoc with your units' AI.There's a bunch of other minor inconveniences, like being unable to see a unit's abilities at various points where that information's important. Or being given a settler when razing a city, and being unable to sell him (meaning you just pay upkeep the rest of the game, unless you want to expand or suicide him.)--Conclusion--For all the cool ideas the game brings, I was too frequently frustrated with the lack of information or the fiddly mechanics. That said, if you're a very patient person who's interested in the unique elements of this game, I could see you having fun with it.			"

												Even after 90 hours of playtime I am still discovering new mechanics and things to try out. The game feels like a piece of art, both in terms of visuals and soundtrack. What sets this game apart from other 4X games is the fact that almost all the factions have a  vastly different playstyle. The closest you will get to the usual factions in other 4X games are The Wild Walkers and The Vaulters, and even they have some unique features. While the base game is good, I strongly recommend getting the DLCs for this game. I cannot imagine playing without them. They add amazing units ( the guardians), 2 of my favourite factions (Allayi and Forgotten) aswell as the espionage and pearl collection minigame.			"

												tl;dr: Chinese reviewbombing still can't shake the ""Very Positive"" ratingThe current ""Mixed"" reviews is because a Chinese language Workshop mod had a link to pirate an older version of this game in its description. The modder was given two contacts from Amplitude, an audience on the forums, and ample time to address the issue, but he outright refused to cooperate. So instead of possibly having his work officially integrated into the game, there is no Chinese language support, period. If none of this matters to you, congratulations! You're a sensible human being who understands localization requires time and money, and that Steam is a legal game distribution site. I binged this game when I got it on sale (ironically, from the Chinese New Year sale) and enjoyed it so much that I got seven extra copies to play with friends. If the art of the game and the concept of a 4X-RPG-TBS intrigues you, pick it up on a sale! You won't regret it.			"

												Looking for the story elements that Firaxis forgot in Beyond Earth?  They're right here.  The varied factions lead to tons of replyability.  Each faction plays differently.  There are some balance issues, but this is well forth playing .  Firaxis need to step their game, Amplitude dunked them here.			"

												Endless Legend is Amplitudes second 4X game. This time it's fantasy instead of space, but it still has the ""Amplitude Spirit"". By that I mean that the game looks neat, isn't too heavy on your rig, has a clean and easily accessible interface but does stuff differently than you probably would expect. While Endless Space was relatively true to the 4X space standards, Dungeon of the Endless deviated from the typical rogue-like noticeably, and now, with Endless Legend they take it even a little bit further.Overview At first glance Endless Legend looks like your typical hex based fantasy 4X; or it looks like it will turn into one once it is finished. You start the game with a small army on a randomly generated map and the ability to found a city. As with most other fantasy 4X games where you build your first city is important. Each city generates resources based on the hex it is build on and the 6 hexes surrounding it, which resources you want depends on the faction you play. From there on you start to explore the map with your starting army, looking for ruins to loot, roaming mobs to fight and villages to burn until you meant your first AI faction and start the typical dance of diplomacy and war.There are also heroes in Endless Legend which can either be assigned to a city or an army. Either way they gain experience and offer boni based on their skills. An army accompanied by a hero is much stronger than one without and a city with the right hero can be pretty effective. Like most new 4X fantasy games Endless Legend has quests, but it does it a little bit differently. Quest are not just simple ""fetch x kill y"" missions, they also tell a story - at least the main quest which is different for each faction - and don't just give items or dust as a reward but can also give you access to technologies you can't get otherwise. So, searching ruins for quests is something you really want to do. Regions, Cities and Empire Management Once you start exploring the map you instantly notice that there is something different: The map is divided into regions.Regions come in different sizes and shapes but they always have a least one minor faction village and some special resources, which you can only harvest if you have a city in that region. But the most important thing about them is that there can always only be one city in each region. This doesn't only mean that whoever has a city in a region basically controls it, it also makes you really think about where you want to build your city.Over the course of the game cities can expand. You can build boroughs in hexes adjacent to a city centre or other boroughs and thereby gain access to resources that previously where out of reach. Combat System Endless Legend utilizes a turn based tactical combat system but doesn't give you full control over your units. At first, it is kinda weird but it has its charm and give the game a unique touch.Each battle starts with a deployment phase where you can place your units. After that you have multiple order and action phases. During the order phase you give you units orders which they than try to fulfil during the action phase. If they can't fulfil their order, e.g. cos the tile you want the to move to is already occupied by another unit or the unit you want them is already dead or out of reach, the AI will take over and let the unit do what it thinks is best. Another neat thing about tactical battle is that they take place on the strategic map. When two opposing armies meet a battlefield is staked out around them which means that the area where you fight actually matters. This is especially true since elevation actually matters in Endless Legend and stuff like cliffs can block your movement paths. You should think twice before you move an army next to a cliff where you opponent could attack them from above but they have no chance of reaching them.Customization Endless Legend doesn't allow you to fully customize your units and heroes but you can give them equipment such as weapons, shields, armour and trinkets. In addition to items heroes have a skill tree that consist of 3 different line that are connected to each other. Which skills a hero has access to depends on its type (infantry, ranged, cavalry or flyer) and the faction you play.Each faction only has 3 units that will always do specific things and look a certain way. Equipment won't affect their appearance much nor will it allow you to change a units role. However, there are also quite a few minor faction units which you can recruit once you assimilated a village of their faction. This allows you to add troops to your army your faction otherwise wouldn't have access to. Influence and Diplomacy When it comes to diplomacy, which is also not fully implemented yet, Amplitude goes for a strange new but nonetheless interesting concept. They have a resource called influence which is needed for every diplomatic act, may it be offering peace, declaring war or assimilating a minor faction. Every 20 turns you can also use influence to change your Empire Plan, which gives you different buffs based on what you pick. A neat little idea that helps you to adapt your global strategy a little bit.Major FactionsThere are 8 major factions in Endless Legend, some of them are pretty standard fantasy stuff others are rather unique and offer you a different approach to the game.The Vaulters are you typical science guys with a dwarfish love for crossbows. The Wild Walkers are wood elves that left the woods to start a civilisation, they are you builders. The Broken Lords are basically Dust vampires that have to purchase population.The Necrophases are warmongering insects that can't be at peace, ever.The Arden Mages are masochistic mages that grow stronger the more you hurt them.The Roving Clans are nomad traders that can't deny you access to the market place.The Drakken try to play world police, they like diplomacy and can force treaties.The Cultists only have one city but can convert pacified minor faction villages.Minor FactionsEach region in Endless Legend has 1-3 villages of a minor faction in it. Unless pacified, which can either be done by bribing the, attacking the village or doing a quest, these villages will grow and spawn armies that will roam the map and cause havoc. Once you have a city in a region with a pacified minor faction you can assimilate that minor faction which will add population to your city, give you some small bonuses and allow you to recruit a special unit.Winter is coming There are two seasons in Endless Legend: Summer and winter. In summer everything is fine, your people are happy, your cities produce resources and your units can actually move. During winter however things are different. Suddenly you produce less food and dust, your people might get a little grumpy and your units can't move as far any more. When winter is coming and how long it lasts is somewhat random. You know vaguely when to expect it, but you can't really be sure. And the longer you play the harsher the winter. This adds another interesting layer to the game. While Endless Legend plays like a typical 4X during summer, winter changes the rules. Suddenly it becomes a survival game, if you haven't stockpiled enough food your people might starve and if you are low on dust your might have to destroy city improvements or disband armies cos you no longer can afford them. Warfare is also quit different during winter. Units need way more time to reach their destinations, so it's probably not a good idea to send all your armies searching ruins when winter is coming.MultiplayerWell, Endless Legend has multiplayer. That's pretty much all I can say about it cos I never tried it. In my book, 4X games are meant to be played solo, on your own clock.			"

												So much to say about this game. I may not have that much time so far (15 hours at time of writing), but I can already tell it is much better than Civilization. Since Civ is such a giant in the 4X genre, I'd like to compare Endless Legend to Civilization VI in this review. Despite the fact that Endless Legend is now 2.5 years old, it's far superior to Civ VI.Unit Stacking - Seriously, why doesn't Civ have this? War is one of the most tense parts of these kinds of games, and in Civ VI you must take what seems like hours to move your army across the map to attack a city. In Endless Legend, you simply stack your armies and move them swiftly across the board.Movement - Most units have at least 4 movement points, meaning they can cross 4 tiles in a turn. In Civ, you get 3 tiles per turn at most, and much of the time your movement is hindered by hills and forests, such that your units rarely get to move even 3 tiles per turn. Yawn. Artifical Intelligence and Diplomacy - Damn does it feel good when diplomacy actually works! There are more items to trade (and that are indeed worth trading) in this game than Civ, and there is more information to trade (trading map knowledge, mutually increasing currency from international trade routes, etc). One AI will not start a war with you, leaving you to defend yourself, only for the other civilizations to call YOU the warmonger (if you don't know, this actually happens frequently in Civ VI, great AI coding Firaxis). As far as I can tell from Youtube comments and forum posts, this kind of silly AI behavior used to happen in 2014-2015, but since then the devs seem to have fixed this issue. Conversely with Civ VI, we're now 5 months out of the gate and have yet to see any AI improvement.Strategic Resources - It's not terribly hard to get the resources you need, and if you can't get access to land with them, you can access the neutral market and purchase them. In Civ VI you would have to trade with another civilization in order to get them (if you don't have access yourself), and that's hard to do when the AI seems to hate the player by default as is the case in Civ 6. History/Lore - In the Civilization franchise, a lot of the interest comes from history and the humanities which is built into the game. I love that stuff too, and initially when I tried Endless Legend I wished that it was also a historically-based game. But since I've gotten into it, I came to appreciate the lore of Endless Legend. It's well written, and every item and Anomaly (non-generic tiles that give bonuses) have interesting lore. There's also a backstory for each faction you play.Technology - This game's tech seems to be a lot more flexible than Civilization; whereas Civilization uses a linear tech tree, forcing you to get techs that you don't need or won't ever use, Endless Legend allows the player to choose exactly which tech he needs. The only requirement for progress to the next Technology Era is that you have 10 techs per era, which isn't an issue because each tech in the game is useful - some are still better than others, but at least you won't be actually wasting any techs. Graphics - For probably the first 3-4 hours of my time with the game, I really didn't love the graphics. To me the map wasn't very readable. But once I understood what I was looking at, I really enjoyed the graphics and general aesthetic. The game blends a nice mix of computer generated graphics with what seems to be (beautiful) hand-painted pictures for diplomacy. Nobody really plays 4X games for graphics, but nonetheless this is a beautiful game. Factions - Factions in Endless Legend feel very different from one another. Different civilizations in Civ don't feel very different or authentic. Sure, you get a unique building or upgrade, but overall it just doesn't feel super different. In Endless, there are significantly less factions, but each one feels unique to the rest and each come with significant gameplay considerations. So that's my review. No I don't hate Civilization; I really like it, but I wish it was made better. Endless Legend is a game with much more thought put into it. 9/10			"

												I wanted so badly for this to be good. I'm dying for a good 4x that provides a real challenge in the form of good AI rather than simply giving a dumb AI more resources. Heres my take:The Good:-Graphics are great (Subjective)-Most files are in XML form so many facets of the game can be modded/edited to your delight.-Expansive tech tree varied by race/faction-Each race has specialized roles and perksThe Bad:-Poor conveyance. Meaning you will have to do some forum hunting to figure out certain elements of the game.-Having good FIDSA where you place your capital can make/break your game.-Painfully easy (subjective)          -The AI is SHARED by different factions. This means that what one race will say to you, and the tactics they use   against you, are the same as any other AI race. The only difference in tactics are their use (albeit poor use) of the given faction's unique abilities. There are TWO AI paths: Minor Faction and Major Faction, thats it!          -The AI is dumb. They will lay seige to undefended cities instead of taking them. They will STAND STILL while being fired upon if they cannot reach you within 1 turn (sometimes but still). In a scenario where I set every faction to be aggressive and incapable of diplomacy, the AI simply wanders about aimlessly in a semi-confused manner while you build up to a point where you're already unstoppable.I really like the concept of it all but the ability to faceroll ""impossible"" enemies simply isn't fun for me. I don't like the feeling of ""holding back"" just to give the AI a chance. Thus I regretfully give this a thumbs down.			"

												More empire building focused than AoW, faster paced than civ and takes all the best mechanics from Endless Space. If you're familiar with the Endless lore, there will be lots of 'Ahhhhhhhh' moments as you realise which factions are like the Endless Space factions (there is continuity). Overall it's a pretty strong 4x game - there's a lot of victory conditions (including a main quest), and every faction plays differently. The factions are designed well and while I couldn't debate balance with you, all of the factions are fun to play (♥♥♥♥ the cultists though - my minor faction towns are MINE GO AWAY). Some of the factions are actually designed by community users, too; pretty sure that's the cultists again.Score: Dank/10, would get backstabbed by the Cultists in the depths of winter again.			"

												I bought in during early access and clocked quite a few games in both single and multi-player as well as put in a fair bit of time ont he forums.  The progress has been great and the Devs worked with people pretty well on finding and fixing issues -- On top fo that the Cultist faction was completely community built, another neat addition.As far as a 4x game goes this one is right up there with any of the big-names that you may or may not have played in terms of fun and I can't recommend it enough if you are a fan of games like Civ though don't go in expecting a reskin of one of their games -- The Devs put a great spin on some classic systems while still keeping some good core gameplay.Definitely check it out ^_^			"

												Endless Legend is a unique 4x turn based fantasy game. The map has regions, and to own a region means owning all of the reources in that region. Regions are gained by building or conquering cities. There are nice unit customizations, and it is possible to acquire minor faction units as well.The game has decent graphics. Exploring the map is fun. Ruins give payouts or quests. There are neat quests in the game.The AI is not he toughest. I usually auto fight my battles, but the AI puts up more of a challenge in tactical combat. Range of units is a little low, and manuevering is vital to win.Endless Legend is a fun game to play.			"

												Sinking so many hours into this game. Convinced 3 people to buy it so far, as it's much more fun to play against humans instead of AI. I'd describe it as a fantasy civ, with more appealling art and no nuke-friendly Ghandi. If you're strat games, I'd give this ago.One of the biggest put-offs is the price, (I was given this as a full-priced gift, and it was worth every penny) and so I thought it'd be worth mentioning that this game has sold for roughly £8 or so in some deals here and there and if you can grab it in a deal then it'll be so worth it!

												Endless Legend is my first 4X game, my closest experience being Starcraft. I always thought that these games were long, complex and slow. The tutorial teaches you a bit about the mecanics but I felt unprepared to play the game. However, I didn't let that stop me and it shouldn't stop you either. Endless Legend is great, Endless Legend is huge and you should pay for it.I swallowed my pride and started a game on the easiest setting (Newbie). I felt clumsy and stupid at first but it didn't take long before I knew what I was doing and felt powerful. The game makes you feel smart because you learn as you play. You want to win a war? You need to learn how to micromanage your units. The AI is too strong? You need diplomacy. Winter is coming? Well... good luck with that.The factions are distinct, so you will most likely learn about the game every time you try a different one. They also have their own interesting story. Every game is unique and the difficulty scaling is good, so i wasn't afraid to try something new while raising the difficulty. What started as an intimidating game turned out to be a very rewarding experience. Now I can't stop playing.P.S.: You may live powerful moments like that time I had to declare war for no reason on a city I couldn't touch just to boost my trade profit with my neighbour. As a Canadian, that was a little too real.			"

Early Access Review
								I just started playing, and I love it.It is still lacking some 4x Basics like real diplomacy but it's an early access, so I just wait till it's added.You could compare it to Civ just in a Fantasy setting, and with Hero Units.For any 4x Fan, this is a buy.Update:There is  200 Turns limit for now(I hope it will be removed). This is somewhat annoying.The AI is a little bit too aggressive, 2 Turns after meeting them, the AI declared war and attacked my Cities. This happened in each session I played. So in fact I just need to focus on a strong army in the beginning or I won't even reach the turn limit :(What is pretty awesome that there are neutral factions (minor factions) which consist only of small cities. If you destroy and rebuild their city or complete a quest for them you can assimilate this faction and benefit from some small boost and a new unit which is unique for this faction.I still like the fact that there are random quests where you can find new gear or ressources, this keeps each play fresh.

												People sometimes overlook games because they seem to convey an impression of ""Been there, done that."" In other words, concepts, ideas, mechanics, etc that have been used or done before. At first glance, Endless Legend does indeed have those traits. But, when settling in to give the game a chance, there's a feeling of refresh by the way it presents itself.The graphics and style of the game are beautiful and help give a lovely sense of immersion and personality. The music score of the game is especially a treat and only help accentuate on these features. Gameplay is refined yet still deep enough to be somewhere in the intermediate of complexity. No, it's not the most deep of strategy 4X experiences one could have, but that's certainly not a bad thing. Rather, the way it plays out allows one to still use their mind and strategize, but not be overwhelmed to the point where it takes hours and lots of reading to make heads or tails of how the game plays out.The factions in the game all have their own background, theme, traits, and their own thing going for them. And I have to say, some of them are downright intriguing. And in some cases, even unnerving--but in a good way! What's nice about these factions is they all play quite different from one another and even have their own quests to follow. As such, one could play through the game and have a distinctive experience each time. Though, this is all also thanks to the many customization options one can do for the world generation, changing anything from size, terrain types, general land formation, world difficulty, victory conditions, and more. For those bold or wanting to mix things up, you can even make a custom faction based on one of the existing ones as a template.Combat is turn based with light tactical considerations. It's not as deep as some other 4X games, but there are some I have played where it's even more simplistic than how Endless Legend presents it. As mentioned before, Amplitude seems to aim to make games that have a happy medium with their approach to complexity, nothing too complex, but not too simple. They also like to make a nice clean, accessible, and slick interface to help make navigating and display information in a pleasant fashion that helps make a person feel comfortable using it more than intimidated.I do like the direction Amplitude has been going with their games and certainly would love to see future developments from them. Their work is pretty solid from day 1 release. Though, there are bugs to be had and their track record with patches has been quite good with Endless Space. As such, their support is quite good and they're willing to do what they can to make their fans happy, even if given some time.Bottom line, if you like 4X strategy games and enjoy ones of a fantasy nature that doesn't take itself too serious, but not too lackluster, I think you'll be at home with Endless Legend. It's a happy medium that makes it hard not to like for those that aren't looking for something too complex or casual.			"

Posted: September 23, 2014
												It's a 4X fantasy(?) game set on a world called Auriga. You play as one of the major factions on the planet - one of the species who has risen up and is sufficiently advanced enough to be a dominant force. Also scattered throughout the planet are minor factions. These are all kinds of other species who will try to raid your cities but can be stomped or made a part of your empire.A lot of the different factions are based on tried-and-true fantasy creatures. The Wildwalkers are elfish (bearing a resemblance to the walking plant elves of Glorantha), the Broken Lords are a kind of undead/necromancer faction, and there's minor factions like the Delvers and Urces (dwarves and ogres, respectively). However their look and feel is often twisted a bit and really cool. Dwarves wear skull masks and have skulls braided into their beards, for instance. And each faction feels very different.That's one of my big Things for sci-fi or fantasy 4Xes these days. If you're going to have different species of creatures, I want them to feel different, play different, and have different goals. The developer totally nailed it here. While there's some core gameplay that's similar, the different factions spin off in different directions. The Broken Lords are powered by Dust, the game's magical currency and power source, and it is the only thing that lets their populations grow and the only thing that heals their armies. To begin you must be very cautious but once you get your dust engine going you become terrifying. The Necrophages are people-eating insect creatures, and diplomatic options are forbidden to them because everyone else is food. Additionally, defeating enemy armies gives you bonus food. Yum.If you've played the developer's other 4X, Endless Space, you'll recognize dust, and probably a lot of the other game's resources. There's a smart reason for that, and that's because I feel like the setting of this fantasy world is built on Clarke's law - ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" I won't dig into the setting stuff too much, but the game blurs fantasy and sci-fi, and I'm pretty convinced it actually takes place in the same universe as Endless Space.Other neat things:- You can make minor factions a part of your empire, giving you a bonus and a special unit from that faction. The Hurnas aka Orcs in this game give you orc archers and give all your units throughout your empire a bonus to damage, while the Delvers give you an economic bonus and skull-wearing axe warriors called dredges.- Each faction has a storyline quest that either guides you to victory or a serious empire buff that generally seals your victory, and lets you learn more about the faction and their history and future. This is probably one of my favorite bits, and is the reason why I'm playing and replaying and replaying.- A lot of people compliment the UI so it's worth mentioning. Managing your empire is pretty easy and doesn't require a lot of clicks. It's the first game where I've found worker management to NOT be a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ All the information you need is pretty easy to come by too.- There's a season cycle! Summer has an abundance of resources, and units move farther. In winter your resources get significantly reduced and armies move at a crawl. It creates a really interesting cycle where you're growing and building in summer, and conserving and trying to keep things together in the winter.- I feel like both Endless Legend and Endless Space make the choices to build and expand really significant rather than no brainers. A lot of the time playing conservatively is a really good move, and having your cities sitting there, doing nothing, is the best move you can possibly make. Similarly, settling a new territory or conquering a neighbor might have a ripple effect of consequences that messes up your whole empire. I appreciate that, and I think it's pretty rare in 4X games.The game has been fun enough to motivate me to ramp up the difficulty and fiddle with all the different knobs and levers of game creation to try different things. I think I've finally nailed Normal difficulty with my current playthrough as the Necrophages, after my last playthrough as the Vaulters was a failure. However, that game taught me some lessons about worker management. It was also probably due to me selecting a Hard world at game creation which led to fewer resources and more aggressive minor factions. Halfway through the game minotaurs burned down my capital city.It does have some flaws though:- Game crashes. I've had a few of these. Luckily the game autosaves every turn, and you often even have a chance to save after the game crashes and a reload fixes it (rather than just shut down the game stays open and gives you an error message that you can copy and paste and send to the developer).- AI has some problems. There's been a few times where I've fought some melee units, and had them just stand there and do nothing while my ranged units plugged them. At first I thought it was some kind of feature of the faction I was fighting as they were giant rock people, but I had it happen against a few other factions when they were defending with melee only units.- This probably only bothers me but right clicking is how you exit out of screens. However, if I try to exit out of the city screen and there's garrisoned units it makes the garrisoned units go for a walk. It's the only instance of this, and I wish they'd get rid of it since ungarrisoning units usually means going to the city and select New Army. I'm sure this is supposed to be a convenient time saver but it's more of a pain in my♥♥♥♥♥than anything else.Overall, though, I'm hooked. I'm really amped for them to create some new factions, and maybe add some art assets for all the different armor you can customize your units with. I'm not sure if they're going to do the same thing with it they did with Endless Legend, but what they would do was plot out three different features and let the community vote on which one would be in the next patch. What a great idea!			"

 4X done right! For the TL;DR Its a great game. Hits so many great titles out there, but adding its own fresh curve balls. I do not regret my purchases. I would recommend this game to anyone. 10/10  This is by far, one of the best 4x I have played in a very long time. If you are a Civ fan you need to give this game some thought. It has everything the civ fans enjoyed over the years, but at the same time also gives new and refreshing ideas. It has the 4X feel to it that we all know and love. So it wont take long to start understanding the way this one plays but at the same time also throws some curve balls your way making you go ""whoa, that is awesome""   Scrolling out the map never felt so good. in other games you scroll out. Get an under standing and scroll back in. This, you scroll out and admire everything you have done seeing all that you control from a more masters look. Feeling like your on that iron throne and pushing around your wood pieces.  Combat gives a whole new meaning to the 4X genera. Iv played allot of these style games. I love the combat to this, So far this game has dabbled in my childhood more then I thought it would from playing Civ 1-5 and Heroes of might and magic.  If your a heroes of might and magic fan being able to tell each unit who to attack and where to run instead of click, right click. and a fight broke out. You get so much more control over what each unit does. AS well as your hero.   Units, being able to gear up your units with more armor and weapons, rings and necklace. For how indepth this game goes. Its got me comin back for more and more each time.  Heroes. Each hero has a skill tree as well as gains xp. Adding new armor, trinkets, weapons. Skill points. Want a bad ♥♥♥ that leads your troops to hell and back, you got it. Want one that sits in your city and just helps run that ♥♥♥♥. You got that to. I love just exactly how much control i have over what everyone does.   On to that last part over control. Your citys go a little different in the route of how things are done instead of making workers. plowing fields building this, and telling them to do this. Instead you have workers, but apart of the city. Want to pop out more gold(in this case Dust) Move one, two or all of the workers over to dust. Need to make this troop faster for that war. Move all your workers over to industry. Some may say that might make it easier but it doesn't just makes it more convenient. Workers are still taken away each time you make a settler so there is a downfall to all happy ups.   The other thing that I love about this is the races to choose from, each with there own back story and quest line. There own play style. Really throwing more in to the ring. Not only this, its the fantasy theme, if your a fantasy lover, 4X player, and a Heroes of might and magic playing Civ 5 person. Give this game more then just thought, go ahead and put it in that cart. You will not regret it.			"

												I'm a HUGE Civ fan and this is strong compition for that.If you've played the crap out of Civ and are looking for something new, this is your go to.Don't expect it to be as addicting as civ, I wish it were, but it isn't. That does't mean you won't find youself blowing through an hour or two without noticing... It just means that once you DO notice you've wasted your whole day, you can get yourself to stop.This game captures me through its AMAZING soundtrack and the art style.Combat, while different and certainly fun in many cases... doesn't always win me over. Sometimes it's too much to go through and when I set it to ""auto"" I feel the enemy has the upper hand and I lose more units that way, thus, I feel like have HAVE to play the battle out.For the record, the games is totally worth the 30 bucks they devs are asking, BUT I also recommend getting JUST the game, you don't need all those expansions until you've played a full game and decide you want more. Me personally, I really enjoy this game and have the emporor edition, no way in hell will I be getting the rest of the expansions untill I see a good sale on them though.			"

												This is one of those games I desperately want to love, but every time I go back to play another campaign I find that it just really isn't that fun.  Every game seems to turn into a dull march, a chore of grinding spreadsheet management.  Not exactly sure why, but it seems that somehow the game mechanics are tuned such that you are forced into having to play every game as a min-max rush for expansion/war, even though they have a number of other possible victory conditions. (I should note that I have only played single-player vs. AI, so I cannot comment on multiplayer)There are a lot of cool aspects to the game, most notably the visual style and graphics, and they do add a few interesting new mechanics to the 4x genre.  The overall look and feel of the UI is generally pretty nice too, when you compare to older titles such as Civ V. So, anyway, I am giving this a reluctant thumbs down.  If Steam had a thumbs sideways, I would have chosen that instead.			"

												This is one of those games where you expect one thing and get something completely different, and this is really something good different. Yes it does have some similarities with most games of its style, gather resources, build upgrades, research tech, fight wars etc. I’ll run through the positives then negatives…The Good; Fairly good AI, with a working diplomacy, this game is not tweaked by cheating but by actually trying to beat you by playing the game with the same rules as you. Excellent factions, each with a unique feel and style, making it worth playing a few times with each new faction/race. Some brilliant mini game mechanics such as winter effects and side quests. Nice battle strategy mechanics with some pleasant character animations, tons of units, and lots of different strategies to try. Army and character customization is excellent and based on resource acquisition. The Bad; The games can be long not a big completely negative considering the style of game but can mean you take a huge break and when you do finish you are left with lasting end story or cut scene but a simple score scene. This is sad considering how detailed each faction and race is with such a detailed backstory.Overall excellent game with very little wrong, thumbs up!			"

												If you enjoy a well crafted 4X game and don't mind what is currently a generally weak and inconsistent AI (particularly militarily) then Endless Legend is highly recommended.  If your 4X play style is solely military this game may seem too easy at the moment.  However, hopefully Amplitude will improve the AI in coming patches with some changes made already and a track record of good community engagement.I've found the game immersive enough to play for 80 hours already using different factions with different styles of play, units and quests.  I'm completely hooked at the moment!  There are still a few factions left to play, so while longevity will be limited until the AI is improved, the game represents a good investment.  The professionalism of the games development stands out in many ways.  The user interface is easy to use, the music is terrific, the graphics are beautiful for a 4X game and the tactical combat is vastly improved over Endless Space. I've had no crashes or seen any bugs with a material impact.Amplitude have developed a really good 4X game.  I only hope that they deliver AI Improvements in patches and also give the AI far more focus before their next release.			"

												After about a dozen Early Access disasters, Endless legend is probably the first game that I bought at release and WISH that I had bought in Early Access. This game has it all. A real in-depth strategical engine, factions that actually change the way that the game is played for once, and a compelling story (in a 4X game no less!).And the ART! Every time I see a new painting in a faction quest, I've got a new desktop background. Sometimes, in the mid-to-late-game, I take a break and just zoom in and look at all of the cities and terrain in my empire... its gorgeous! When Steam announced their Music service, this was the first soundtrack that I thought of... and I'm not a soundtrack guy at all.This game was originally purchased to ""hold me over"" until Civ: Beyond Earth came out. Now, I can't even remember CBE's release date. If you're on the fence on whether you want a challenging fantasy 4X game that does everything right, then I strongly encourage you to guzzle the kool-aid from a firehose.			"

												This is one of the finest, if not my favourite game of all time.This is a very solid 4X strategy game. IMO it suffers from no flaws other than those systemic in the genre, such as the snowball effect and the tedium of click based combat after a while. It's lore is simply fantastic. No other game has so quickly engrossed me in the worldbuilding and storytelling quite like this game. It looks incredible. It sounds incredible.Honestly, its the uniqueness of the factions, the variety in their playstyles, the storytelling of the world of Aurigaa and just the feeling of uniqueness that is the game's greatest strength for me.Can't reccomend enough. Beautiful, and very fun.			"

												You should - if you love your RTS games - really think about getting this game. The only reason it has dropped in reviews is that some chinese brats decided to do negative review bombs due to a problem with a 3rd person chinese translation mod. While in the shop side it clearly says chinese isnt a supported languege.Here are some points that make this game a unique (and brilliant) experience for every strategy-fan:1) Factions actually play differentlyYou have like... what... 9 to pick from? And each race has a difference in traits and therefor makes it easier/harder to reach specific wins. You can even create your own race with the traits you love the most.2) CombatI admit I havent really looked into this point yet. It gives you an option to personalyse how your troops fight, but even if you roll with the auto function you arent left of screwed.3) Tech hubsOnly you decide how you advance in research. Want to focus on ressources? Or on defense/offense? Your choice alone. And for the freaks out there, that love to unlock new stuff: You can score a win just by beeing over the top in research, leaving your enemies behind.4) Different ways to beat your enemyThere are more ways to win the game than I actually remember. You can win by having the most dust (which is more or less gold ingame) scoring an industrial win. You can win by having the most overall points, or by killing every other enemy on the board. As mentioned above research also scores an unique win. An other option is a victory through missions similar to a campaign, which I havent done before cuz Im lazy. You can even score a diplomatic win, simply by beeing too powerful in that point category. I think I forgot 1-2 but you get my point. It has an amazing potential to adapt to whichever playstyle you prefer. 5) Setting up gamesOf cause it offers a campaign and all, but it also gives you several options for endless games.- Speed: The faster you gain ressources, the less control you have as you get less turns overall.- World size / Number of enemies- Difficulty of world itself and the enemy- World itself: how big is it, how many rivers / forests / mountains, where does each faction start, how big is the ocean, how many islands is the world itself6) DiplomacyIf you are smart, then you prepare yourself in research and strength before you start a war. But if you are too busy scoring your prefered non military win, then you better make sure that the other factions don't start a war becuz theyre getting jelous.You can trade ressources, research, make other factions fight each other, or even demmand a town from your enemy for peace after you beat them in war.

Early Access Review
								While there are still some improvements needed, it is exactly what I wanted from a game.The best comparison is like a more war based version of Catan.I have enjoyed the game immensely because it brings together several aspects that I always desired from strategic games;1. Centered around economy and constantly building up all of your cities (as opposed to simply trying to destroy your opponents, though you can also take over other people's things).2. Despite being heavilly driven by economy, you can build armies and conquer other people through force as well.3. Advantages of peace, with trading and sharing of technologies.4. Choice in technologies (now all of them are fairly good, and eventually you can choose all, but sometimes you have to make a few sacrifices to get to the higher ones first :) )5. Multiple Interesting Races (6 so far, 8 coming) each with different strategies.6. A constantly changing environment (the game creates an entirely random setting each time you make a new game, which is lovely <3 ) and perfect for replaying and multi-player gaming with friends.7. Ruins, minor factions, and ocean travel for the explorer in you.8. Turns instead of all at once (now while I can see why the alternative some people would like, I think it takes away from the strategic of it and would make things too much 'who can click the fastest' type of game, luckilly this isn't that.. you can spend an hour if you want in a non-timed game turn, there isn't a constant rush.9. Endless time, even though it does announce a winner at turn 200, you can keep on playing, keep getting different resources, keep building up massive cities, learning new technologies, and exploring the very far corners of the world if you haven't. (this is unlike wherein warcraft resources are limited, or in battles of middle earth where it all becomes the same).10. Cities can be expanded to near limitless dimentions (atleast till they take up an entire region, which probably wouldn't happen unless you really tried)This is my favorite strategic game of all time, and I look forward to whatever they do to expand it :) (( Come on Cultists and a water race.. we're waiting :3 )			"

												I have played a lot of 4X games in my time. And while I enjoy the genre, there have been gripes I have had with it that never seemed to be address. But having grown used to them, I just never really realized how irritating they actually where.Enter Endless Legend. While there are many who argue that it doesn't add much to the genre, I'd have to argue strongly against that. Besides the different factions that are actually different, forcing you to adjust you playstyle based on who your playing and not just getting some slightly more powerful units and a few uniques traits and builds but largely playing the same ala Civ 5 or really most other 4X games.The simultaneous nature of multi-player takes away a lot of the tedium of waiting for your turn. While some games allowed limited interaction such as Shogun 2's multiplayer campaiaign, they still lock half or more fucntions that you'd like to be doing while your buddy is trying to figure out his turn.Along those same lines, being able to control your units in battle makes army composition and strategic placement very real concepts instead of just an enhanced paper-rock-scissors model like similar games. Another nice feature is it allows you full access to everything even after you hit that turn button. So unlike many others, you have a chance to fix ♥♥♥♥-ups or change strategies even if you tapped that prematurely. It also keeps you from getting too bored or annoyed on those occasions when you buddies turn drags. A surprisingly rare occurence once everyone knows what their doing.That's just the start. Hero units that give it more of a Warcraft 3 vibe but they can do so much more than lead armies. And being able to gear up your normal units in different ways often leads to pet armies instead of just leagues of faceless jack holes. The map is seperated into regions and cities control whole regions as opposed to having that really nice resource sitting right on the edge of your city with no hope of ever attaining it. I mean seriously, who would never mine the obvious unclaimed vein of ore right outside the town limits? What? Afraid the barbarians are gonna get you?Anyway, that's just the tip oif the iceburg. Once you start throwing the dlc in there, things really get interesting as they add to the game and don't really feel like cheap tack-ons for money grabbing purposes.And speaking of dlc, the absolute best thing about that is everybody doesn't need it to play with you. Whatever the host has, the other players get to use too. That's right! Your friends can get classic and play with all that lovely dlc that you spent your cash on! Rather then being forced to save it for those lonely nights when all you got is your computer and a bowl of soup to cry in.So that's my general take. If you like turn-based 4X, then get it. The base game is cheap and you can always get the dlc you want later if you like it. If your not into 4X, again it's cheap and I think a great introduction. It has a touch of complexity that keeps it from getting stale like Civ 5 has a tendecy of doing but isn't so over the top it will take you hours to understand it.			"

												Firstly, I would like to thank the 4X-enthusiast group eXplorminate for giving away this game.  I typically don't pay much attention to giveaways, but I actually won something that time.  And that something happened to be a game that seemed somewhat fascinating to me at the time.As of now, Endless Legend is a whole lot more than ""mildly fascinating,"" and I am shocked I did not know about it sooner.  This is one of the few games that I wish so many more people did know about.  My opinion of this game is from the perspective of a[nother] person stepping into it from Civilization V.  I also have some Total War to be comparing it to, so I have that to reference as well.  That said....Endless Legend is a beautiful game.  There are few other words that can describe it so aptly.  The presentation of Auriga (the gameworld) from the map anomalies to the tile improvements that match the civilization's stylistic impressions to the special effects during winter to the GUI, everything about the game is beautiful.  The UI deserves a special shout-out, because everything is placed so intuitively, and it's simple, clean, and elegant.  There is no other game that matches the polish of Endless Legend's UI (although vanilla Civ and G+K were both very meticulous through the menus and what-not).  As a turn-based strategy, the gameplay is sufficiently balanced, and the overall war mechanic is somewhat more sophisticated than what you'd find in Civilization, using Total War's army-building model.  The quest functionality provides a lot of deep lore, and it really is amazing how intricate Amplitude's universe is - they have clearly committed a lot of energy to just... being creative here - so I have to mention it even though I really don't care for it much in my playthroughs.  I don't have to, though.  It's there if you want it, but I'm just not an RPG person.  My biggest gripe about the game is how much ALL CAPS ARE USED IN ITEM DESCRIPTIONS. I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF ANNOYING TO READ.All in all, it's a fantasy version of Civ that is very, very polished, endlessly replayable (see what I did there?), full of character, surprisingly strong on the war/conflict front, and I am recommending it now solely because I want more people to know about it.  I encourage you to pick it up, or at least look into it a little deeper.			"

												I really like this game. I'm like a fanatical casual for 4X games: I love the idea of them... but they hardly stick. Mainly because I find them to be a chore after awhile. And after working, I feel the need to not keep on taxing my brain.Endless Legend has stuck with me though. You could tell: this game has been put together very conciously. The artwork and lore behind the factions is intriging. And I love the idea that many, if not all, factions play a bit differently. The soundtrack is beautiful. And the game just LOOKS so cool.It's a bit overwhelming to jump in, so I've done a lot of research. Definitely some good guides on Steam and on YouTube. Once you get it figured out, you really start noticing how well the UI tells you what's going on in a glance. Very smartly put together. Recommended!			"

												Good turn based fantasy strategy game without the standard fantasy fare. Unique takes on most things make it visually entertaining. Less of a Civ clone than you might think, but you can see influences. Minor races instead of city states for example, but you end up recruiting them into your nation instead of interacting with them in other ways. It borrows some mechanics such as heroes and resources from Endless Space, which isn't a bad thing.One of the best turn based fantasy strategy games of the Civ-clone ilk I've played, though the AI was somewhat lame on the average difficult levels. They played well except the peaceful ones had next to no military. I waltzed through their lands with nary a concern.			"

												Upon first purchasing this game during one of its sales, I was unsure what it would bring or how it would be. So I sat down, booted it up and jumped in. For a day or two it seemed a little confusing, despite having played the Civilization games in the past, as well as many different RTS games, I was completely blown away by how much more in-depth this game is. After a good bit of practice, it has become one of my top favorite games of all time. Easily something you can play for days and weeks without end and not get bored with. The faction system is truly unique, with each faction holding enough diversity that you would have to play them just to get a solid grasp as to their abilities. The rank system is superb, making losing a unit you've been cultivating for a long time all the more painful. Quest systems make this so that you are never bored or reaching a point where nothing seems interesting anymore. The diplomacy is something like I haven't seen before. You have to actually work to ally up with friends in multiplayer, and it actually costs you to do things. So you aren't just able to group up with no risk and alliances as well as betrayal are truly investments in this game. The map system and winter are also an amazing part to this game, as the maps are very unique in their generation and the winter system is something that, depending on how well prepared you are, can be a prosperus event or a truly harrowing disaster to your empire.TL;DR This game is highly reccomended, replayability is through the roof and it easily rivals if not beats most other turn based strategy games. 100 out of 10.

												Wow. This is really something. Its in a completely different league from Civ or any of those space games, and not (just) because its super polished, bug free, and has awesome replayability. It has a story that drives the gameplay and factions that are unique in ways that go beyond ""+5% construction bonus"" and ""+10 army morale bonus"". The AI is really good. Like, really good. You will be able to win on normal, but it won't be because you're roflstomping the AI into doing stupid things like sending its armies into baitstacks and declaring wars it can't win. And the difference between when you first play and when you know what you're doing will be day and night. The bonuses in this game stack in a positive feedback kind of way--if you have enough money to buy that extra resource, you will more than make your money back, allowing you to buy that other resource to increase diplo point production so you can get that more advanced empire plan and have more money.....etc.1. Each faction really plays differently. Especially the cultists. You could win almost any kind of victory with almost any faction, but you definitely have tools available to you to make one way much easier than others. This is all draped in some really good lore that you're rewarded with by completing quests.2. The winter mechanic really drives home the whole ""end of times is coming"" theme.3. Battles are amazing. There is a lot of awesome character animations, tons of units, and lots of different strategies to try. Why? Because battles don't just take place on one hex, they take place on a unique battlefield every time that is drawn from the terrain of the surrounding squares. You can look up on youtube what that means, but in gameplay terms it means your units getting caught in a narrow bottleneck, archers firing down death from cliffs, armies being hemmed in so tight they can't reinforce, and flying units getting into your rear to wreck your archers are all things that can happen.Battles are also on a timer, so a smaller high quality force can definitely give a larger army some trouble. Said larger army can also then counterattack on their turn and wipe them out if they're not careful. 4. Army customization is awesome and based on resource acquisition. Proper planning to get said resources, research appropriate techs, and balance costs/benefits of more expensive units are much more important than in other games. You could try to just make an army of all juggernaut titans, but it may not be the best thing to do, as they may be too slow to destroy any units in battle. Bad Things:A. The endings are pretty hollow. Its like the ending of a paradox game, there's a screen that says you won and then a score screen, and thats it. I'd like at least a recap screen like civ had where it shows you how the game went over all the turns or some kind of reward, like additional lore being revealed depending on how you win. Something like WH: Dark Crusade, for example.B. The UI is good, but not excellent. Not really a bad thing, but its definitely not the smoothest interface I've ever seen.C. Thats it! I can't think of anything else bad about this game.			"

DLC is a great addition to the game and adds factions/quests, and fun research stuff. Cons:No one plays/hosts multiplayer games. No reason too. Multiplayer lobby list is literally EMPTY. Past the infuriating bugs the game *still* has, I definitely recommend playing. It's a very very fun game, and it's just as satisfying playing single-player matches. This game had so much potential for multiplayer, it's a real shame.			"

												Oh, my goodness what a game!pros:  * great control over units and graphics  * addition of heroes in the armies that can level up makes for a lot of customizing.  * tactical battle managment keeps the randomness down.  * graphics are fun and interesting.  * Factions are noticably different and have completely different feels and styles.Cons:  * a very long game with lots to do.  * The endgame takes forever for each turn (common to 4x games)  * Single city per territory limits growth opportunities a lot.This game is great.  It really feels like combining the Heroes series with Civ.  Other hybrids exist, but I think this one does it best.  I can play this for hours and just keep coming back.			"

												Review time: I've played many games and bought many games over the past few years but none of them have really 'clicked' for me. I'd buy them and then play them for a few hours and probably never touch them again.This was the case with Endless Legend when I bought it shortly after it first came out. I played half the tutorial and didn't touch it again. Jump to 2016 and I thought - ""You know what? I feel like getting into that Endless Legend game I've had for a while now."" and oh boy am I glad I gave it another shot. I'm enjoying it a lot more than CIV 5. The key features I like about it are as follows:  The Races - Roving Clans and Broken Lords are my top favs. Each one is amazingly unique. The Roving Clans are a nomadic trader faction that can't declare war at all but they can ban people from using the in-game market system and are really good at making money. The Broken Lords don't need food. They live off Dust (in game gold) and I actually mean 'live off it'. Each faction has it's own aesthetic beauty which really shines through in their cities and units. The Music - You've got all types. Nomadic type music for the RC faction, medieval/spooky for the BL etc. The music really fits this world and helps immerse you in it. The World - Now I really like the lore in this game. It may not be much in comparison to Middle-earth or League of Legends' lore (League has lore???), but it has a good enough lore for me.  The Climates - You have your generic desert, forest, snowy tundras etc. but they look beautiful. Each match makes the world look breath taking and that's brilliant for a 4x game. (When you build districts near water, you get a little port going on and it looks so nice). :3 It's just wooden boats and wooden walkways but it's still nice. I hope the next expansion is a naval/aquatic one which actually adds REAL ports into it and naval warfare and a naval faction that can build on water.Not really a review, but I'm loving this game and I can't stop playing it. This is the first game to do this to me in a very long time. I want to know more about the Endless world, but sadly after Endless Legends, it expands to space (Endless Space) and all the factions except for The Vaulters die out. That's not a spoiler. You'd know this if you played Endless Space (I haven't but I have read up on it) and the planet EL is set on, Auriga, is dead and barren during the events of Endless Space which is set AFTER Endless Legends. There's another game called Dungeon of the Endless which is set before Endless Legends.The timeline goes:Dungeon of the Endless - Endless Legends - Endless Space - (and maybe Endless Space 2 which comes out this year).Overall, I rate this game a Roving Clans Best Faction/10.

												Endless Legend is a solid fantasy 4X that has gone in some interesting directions with style. It seems like a game that would be best played again human opponents (not that I have had the chance), but the AI on harder difficulties still pose a challenge. It doesn't bring anything terribly new to the 4X genre, but neither does it fail terribly in any respect. I'd seriously reccomend getting it on sale, and if you're a 4X fan, I'd tentatively reccomend it at full price.What I like:Tech tree seems well rounded, and contains enough content on a standard-sized map, facing the default amount of enemies (5), on the standard game speed, that I wont come close to exhausting research options. The need for completing X number of techs of one tier before accessing the next finds a nice balance between depth and breadth in research.Similarly, there is enough ""map content"" that I'm still coming across new resources, minor factions, and anomolies fairly late into a standard length.I like the region system, where the world map is broken up into pre-defined, randomly-shaped regions. Each region can host a number of different terrain and features, but only one city, so city placement within a region has an impact on empire development (though this fades with time, as modifiers from buildings and population begin to overshadow those of the terrain).Ridges add some depth to both exploring and combat.Factions play fairly differently, with many of them operating under different mechanics.Summer/Winter mechanic makes for some interesting scenarios.Being able to customize the weapons, armour, and accessories of standard units, as well as upgrading these on existing units helps keep most units from becomming obsolete as the game progresses, and allows you to invest significant resources into specific units, should you desire.Some things I don't like:The game needs another pass of bug testing. It's not unusual to encounter crashes and hangs, and I have encountered the odd game-play bug.The AI is inconsistant, and varies is competence from one game to the next, within the same difficulty setting. One game an AI may be a clear threat, other games the AI barely seems to handle the basics.There are some equipment combinations that are clearly superior, leading to less variation than the number of options would suggest.The learning curve is steeper than it should be, thanks mostly in part to a lack of in-game documentation and tool-tips, and mechanics which are not adequately explained. A number of mechanics will make sense once you've realized how they work, but getting to that point is more difficult than it needs to be.Tactical combat doesn't have a lot of depth, and becomes tedious. At the same time, auto-resolution tends to kill off too many of your units. This is the worst situation a 4X game can force you into: choosing between bland combat or taking unnecessary losses.Summer/Winter mechanic can be downright annoying. Some quests are turn-limited, and the untimely arrival of winter will make them impossible to complete.			"

												This is one of those games that I saw a huge amount of potential in, but falls short in ways that make it difficult for me to recommend. The designer had some creative approaches to the issues that come up in 4X games - quest victory, minor factions, 1-city-per-region, and the Influence system. The amount of care that went into designing each factions' quest lines, unit art, and the overall story is quite impressive, and it brought me into the game with some level of excitement.But in a game of this scope, the weakest link stands out like a sore thumb - or in this case, sore thumbs. The battle system starts off promising, with a small section of the actual world map playing host to the somewhat small-scale battles that constitute army-on-army warfare. In practice, the battles are honestly a nightmare. They usually play out like this: the two highest-initiative units get to act as they please. If these two are on opposing sides, they'll form sort of a central conflict, around which the rest of the battle swirls. Except swirling makes it sound intense & interesting - the swirling comes from the out-of-date unit orders, trying in vain to get to an available side of the single enemy they were allowed to target in this round. It can actually be a relief at times for one of your obstinate, lackwit units dies, because it opens up room for a fresh unit, which had been flailing about at the outskirts of your battlefield, to charge over to the site of that unit's corpse and actually accomplish something. I don't know how much time was spent working on the battlefield AI, but it seems to consist of simple pathfinding, and quite possibly nothing else.The tech tier system is an interesting system, but I kind of have to scratch my head at some of the decisions. For example, there's a tech available in tier 1 that unlocks the Heroes & Mercenaries section of the Marketplace, allowing you to spend Dust/currency on hiring either of these kinds of units. If you don't unlock this tech, you will have 1 hero for the duration of the game (barring any that might come from your faction of choice's quest line). What's odd is that some of the hero skills unlock incredibly valuable upgrades - for the Broken Lords faction, which is extremely reliant on Dust income, you might unlock a 15% increase in the Dust income of a city, if the hero in question is set to govern it. What this means is that the Heroes & Mercenaries tech is absurdly valuable. There are techs each for the tier 1 strategic resource extractors, and the tier 1 luxury resource extractors, as well. If you don't unlock those, you may be missing out on an enormous set of features of the game. Compare that to the Aquapulvistics tech, which unlocks a couple of city improvements that generate 2 or 3 dust per turn on a tile that has a river, or a lake respectively. And only in summer (something like 3/4 of a game's turns, by my rough guesstimate). Anyways, the idea is that the balance between tech decisions is pretty lacking.So those are my complaints #1 and #2, out of what is a much longer list (of which I'll spare you the rest). Really, the reason why I bother to write this isn't because I hate the game! But rather that it's promising enough that I wanted/want to like it, but the flaws are so irritating that it drives me to put it away. I hope that another game can come in and take the effective and interesting gameplay elements & features, and make a better game. Or at least one I can tolerate playing a whole game through without wanting to claw my eyes out in frustration.			"

												4X game with impressive depth. The factions really play differently from each other, giving a large boost to replay value. If you like micromanagement of every aspect this game is for you. Sci Fi world and lore is really cool. Honestly, I bounced off this game a bit when I first played it, but once you have a firm grasp on the mechanics and what everything does/means it really unfolds into something very impressive. Also you can customize your military units down to whether they use a sword, axe, two handed weapon etc. If you like Civ but find it a little simplistic (especially combat) this game is for you!			"

												Take Civ, add some servicable innovations to its basic model, set it in a high fantasy / magitech world, and then have the game map try to kill you with Winter. That's Endless Legend. If you have a 4X itch to scratch, this might just be what you're looking for. It hasn't capitvated me in the same way as Civ has, but I appreciated the new things they tried with this game. I especially like the interesting setting, which breaks the standard fantasy mold and gives you a truly engaging world to play with.			"

												Been playing this game for a long time period, it's one of those games I go back to, start a game and find it hard to stop until I finish it. Then I will leave it sitting for a while and do it all again.That isn't a bad reflection on the game at all, it keeps drawing me in time and again. (might be a bad reflection on my games stock :/ lol)Now as to the game, honestly it's hard to explain and can be daunting starting off. There are some features that aren't explained in the tutorial but after a game or two you will pick it up.Each faction operates differently in the way their 'economy' works. Each city produces  -food, production, science, dust, influence. Some of these aren't used by some of the factions(One nation has to buy their technologies for example, one doesn't use food etc etc)Then you have global strategic resources, and 'luxury' resources. All heroes and units can be equipped with better weapons (like armour/weapons/helm/boots/accessories) once the suitable research has been completed or an item is obtained through one of the many mini-quests.Range of victory types, similar to other games in the genre, but race has a unique 'quest' victory condition which follows the strength of that race. I've personally found that the expansions for the game have always added nice new interesting content, though the base game was always really solid so if you want to try it out you don't NEED the expansions.Combat is carried out in an auto or mini-battle screen where you don't directly have control over your units as such, more just give them orders and watch it play out.Comparisons to other titles of this genre? Well Civ is going to be the obvious one, I've played so many hours of every civ game and I don't regret whenever I play Endless Legend, it is different enough and it always hooks me when I turn it on until that final turn. I think it's worth full price, but if in doubt wait till a sale. They happen often enough. I would recommend this to a friend, and have happily brought it for a friend knowing it wouldn't disappoint.Peace :)			"

Early Access Review
								First and foremost:  This game is for fans of Civilization 1-5, Fallen Enchantress (and its standalone, Legendary Heroes), Master of Magic, Age of Wonders 1-3, and any other 4X game. It's like Amplitude took the best parts of Civilization, Master of Magic, Legendary Heroes, their own Endless Space and a few other good 4X games and spun it their own way. The strategic layer of managing your economy, build queue, expansion and empire plans are all well done and what you'd expect of a good 4X. The factions are all varied and play uniquely and creatively, each having their own strengths and weaknesses and very distinct looks, both cities and units. The battles are quick, but full of true tactical choices and even strategic choices, as they require knowledge of the terrain and the elevation bonuses to take full advantage of. They're also quick enough to not become the focus of the game, unlike another recent ""4X"" game with a long history....What I'm trying to say is that if you like 4X and you want a polished, pretty, and deep game, look no further. The game is, most importantly, fun, even in its BETA state. The AI is competent, though in need of some love (they have time), the balance is getting better with every build and the flow of the game is becoming extremely solid. So what are you waiting for? Help support an awesome indie company that is making some excellent games and that costs nearly HALF of what the other ""leading"" 4X developers are charging.			"

												I'll keep it short and simple.No, I am not a master 4X player.  No, I am not even a strategy game player.  In fact, I very much despise most strategy games and haven't touched Civ games before either.  But Endless Legends has kept me invested for almost a full day of gameplay time since I bought it almost 4 days ago.  It has great art, great music, and wonderfully engaging (if sometimes tedious because of simply how MUCH there is) gameplay, with some nice lore fluff to go along with it.Multiplayer can work fine, but it can be a touch finnicky sometimes.  Just make sure you have a good host and all will be fine.  Personally I dislike multiplayer in these games because turns take literally forever.  Singleplayer however is still great fun.  On sale, EL can easily have the most hours played per dollar spent compared to very, very many games.  It's great value and I highly recommend it to those interested in 4X games.  It seems complicated, but if you're already interested, you'll figure out how to play how you want with little more than a tutorial.   "

												Beautiful graphics, a fantasy setting, and 4X. If you like those three things, then that is what you will get with this game.  Is it the best 4X game?  No.  But is it a good game?  Yes, yes it is.  And in my opinion a very fun game.I'm not going to wax lyrical about pros and cons as there are already much better examples posted and with far more eloquence.  That being said, I will offer this advice:  If you wish to get the most out of this game, then take advantage of the different races and victory paths by playing as many of them as you want however and whenever you want.  What I mean by this, is don't get locked into one playthrough long past the point when it has become redundant.The strength of this game is not in its endgame.  It is in its variety and richness of races and play styles.  I stopped hating this game the moment I realized that and started having fun.With that in mind, I also recommend buying this game on sale.  You really won't have to wait long with as frequent as the Steam sales typically are.  And if you buy it on sale, you are much less likely to become frustrated in those tedious end stages I just mentioned.If you are a hardcore 4x player, this game may not be for you.  But if you're like me, and it's as much the fantasy aspect as the strategy part of the game that calls to you the most, then I say have at it!			"

												Pretty damn good game.  It has a medium learning curve because you can build and use your empire how you want to.Unlike most 4x games its not as much about expanding your empire as it is building it up. You are not confined to a tech line and they really made this game  open ended and customizable for the player.  The closest this game can be discribed is imagine civ and heros of might&magic had child; this would be the result. There is so much that could be said about this game but ill narrow it down in four words. Deep Fun innovative and sandboxy like a 4x should be.Each faction is totally diffrent and does not have the cookie cutter races that only differ slightly from eachother. One faction can only build one city. Another faction can move there citys becouse they are nomatic. Another faction doesnt eat food but consumes a diffrent resource. Another faction eats well,, other factions citizens!! Its great!The Heros are amazing and have the MOO2 govener feel to them. Did I mention all the side quests in the game? Yes there are those too. I can go on and on about all the neat things you can do in this game that are just ingenous but all I have to say is; This game is simply a fresh take and a instant classic. I have no regret buying it.Only down side is there are a few small bugs to get squashed yet.			"

Early Access Review
								To put it simply, this game is one of the best, if not the best, 4x games I've ever played. And it's still in testing. First of all, this game looks gorgeous: from landscapes to unit design. The world can be aesthetically changed and physically changed through pre-game options, meaning that random seeds just got more random. Units actually change how they look depending on armor (to be implemented in the future, review written as of Alpha Test on 6/3/14) equipped and weapons equipped (already implemented), meaning I can have some wierd bug guys with claws, or wierd bug guys with spears. While not at all necessary in a 4x, it really adds a sense of personality (which is something that Amplitude usually lacks in their games) and a feeling that what you do is actually impacting your empire. Secondly, the game's speed is perfect. It feels faster than most 4x games (I can play a 5-man game on a small map and win through elimination in under 200 turns, and I'm a complete noob at this point), but it's by no means limiting strategy or creating pressure. Thirdly, every faction ingame so far (Wild Walkers, Vaulters, Necrophages, Broken Lords, and soon the Cultists of the Endless) is very unique. They have both positive and negative traits, which usually work to somewhat even eachother out. For example, Necrophages have decreased food gain, but they can turn corpses into stockpiles of food; Broken Lords use Dust to heal instead of food, and in turn gain increased Dust production.      On another hand, combat in this game is no AoW3, and it is somewhat repetetive, however, the ability to manually adjust your battle formation is something really cool. First of all, it allows you to better organize your units for either an increased success rate or survival rate or both. Secondly, it makes the game more challenging if you don't know what you're doing or if you don't know what type of enemy you're facing or the type you're good against. In multiplayer when it's released, two people customizing layouts will be doubly intriguing as they'll have to both predict what the enemy does and what they should do to counter it. On top of that, simply, it adds more graphic options. In auto battling you'll miss your giant demon unfurling his wings, jumping onto the foe, and slamming his giant axe into some poor flying unit's face. Another reason I find this manual adjustment cool is that, similar to armor and weapon changes, it lets you feel like you're in more control of the game. I mean, you are the battle leader right? So you should be able to, let's say... actually lead the battle, right? In Endless Legend, you can.      I'd like to edit this review in order to post about some concerns I've been reading about. Some people are very unsatisfied with how diplomacy currently is (posted as of 6/15/14) and are trying to use this as a major factor in order to downplay how good this game is. The game is currently in Alpha testing and as such does not feature everything it will have upon release. The AI will be sure to improve (for anybody who seems unable to find this information, based on my experiences, the AI are overall a little bit silly. The first game or two you might get demolished when you just meet two people and they both declare war on you, but not eachother, however, once you see how the bots use an entirely militaristic route with mediocre strategies, you'll be fine against them.). Another complaint is the difficulty of the AI, there is currently only one AI setting, Alpha, and this will of course evolve into more and more difficulties when the developers want to focus on that instead of the founddation of the game. Also, this game is intended to be a multiplayer game, and people are (usually) more strategic than bots, which will immensely ramp up the difficulty of the game. Another concern, in the form of a question, I've been hearing is about how long turns are. As I mentioned, this is a fairly fast-paced 4x, and to go with how fast you might go, the AI are not slow at calculating what they'll do this turn and next. I can't give an exact time for how long they plan, but it felt shorter than Civ 5 to me. If anybody has concerns or questions feel free to ask me below and if Steam gives me that notification, I'll be sure to respond.     Overall, I'd give this game so far an 8/10, and unless the developers do something stupid, it'll be a 9 at least upon release. The developers are working with the community to make the game better (in fact right now they just concluded a player-made Faction contest, go Cultists!) and they seem to be listening to the player's feedback, complaints and all. If you're into 4x games, I would say you should give this game a chance. Or two. Maybe three, third time's a charm. Though 4th is no less fun. Etc. :P			"

												Endless legend does alot of things right, and a few things wrong. The overall experience is however masterfull and a joy to behold.Firstly the things it does wrong:-The game has a tutorial that goes as far as explaining the tried and tested tropes of the genre. It fails to explain the intricacies of what Endless Legend offers beyond this. Adding layers of complexity where little external resource exists to fill you in. The steam copy of the manual is actually usefull for once, but Learning to play a modern day game especially one that innovates in so many ways, shouldn't involve reading a 70 page pdf.-The difficulty and overall balancing is out of wack. This only time will heal, and it will, knowing amplitudes excellent track record with supporting their tittles post launch. The best way to play this game at release is with other human beings who are as fallable and new to the experience as you.-The combat system removes power from the player in an attempt to streamline what is often the most tedious part of the genre, player agency is important in all game genres and unless I as the player have explicitly surrendered it, it should never be taken away.-The quest system feels pinned on to the experience the game already offers, and doesn't stand up as it's own thing, You can tell the potential and desire to enhance it was there by the devs but to date it's been squandered.Now quickly the things that it does right:-A slick, clean, effective, forward thinking and wholly PC interface. No big picture or touch screen nonsense here tyvm.-Asymetrical faction design. Making each and every one of the different faction play in a unique and different way. This adds to the multiplayer joy, a 30 hour trade war mirror game where the players can't declare war on each other? priceless. An expansion faction versus a tall single city empire? totaly legit. The options are there and out of the hands of the AI totaly viable.-It's beautifull. I've never liked blur in video games before, but whoever designed the art style of this game knew all the right things about lens shifting and lighting. And a niche love of papercrafts maybe?-Combat. Yes it in part removes player agency forcing you to fight for control but other innovations make up for this. The combat the most arduos part of this genre is hastened by spontanious (or double spontanious) turns and a 6 turn turn limit. Combat never feels obtrusive and is actualy worth investing time in thanks to these design decisions.-Tile exploitation and cities. This one is probably preference and others may disagree with me, but the way cities expand and exploit the FIDS resource system is very rewarding, feels organic and empowers the player. You'll learn to love triangles and spiral patterns in a weird way I swear.-Soundtrack and art. The word eargasm doesn't exist. But it should for this very reason. The ost captures the hybrid fantasy lowtech sci-fi setting brilliantly as does the art.Is it worth buying? I judge a games worth if I enjoy playing it over it's price in £ converted into hours. I got my copy cheap as part of a subscription service to IGN, but it retails at around £30. Check my hour count and you'll see that I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. ~Litany			"

Early Access Review
								Absolutely wonder strategy game with a suprising amount fo content for an Early Access Game. Endless Legend plays off an randomy generated  map world a la Civilization. Currently there's 4 different factions inside the game. So far I've only played the Vaulters, a techological race focoused upon research. It would seem as though all the factions start off with 1 major and 1 minor perk along with a few pre-researched techs and a few basic units. Ofcouse, all of this is different for each of the 4 factions currently present. The game play map is fully relealized filled with interesting zones that influnce your city building ways. I see that many of the elements from the Endless space game appears, namely a wonder GUI, meaningful quests and city govenors. Combat inside the game plays out half like an RPG and half in a form similar to Age of Wonders III and The might and magic series. Amplitude has applied some of the elements from endless space. Battles are started by units on the strategy map and are fought like small turn based battles like say fire emblie or advanced wars.

												One of my favorite 4x games in a long, long time. What the Endless series does well, it does really well.This game is fairly easy to master and provides a lot of flexibility in a few of its systems. I have to say I prefer it over any other game of a similar vein released in the past ten years or so. It has a lot of the fairly standard 4x mechanics. You have gold, industry, food, science. Research techs and expand. What it does differently than most 4x games is allowing you to customize different types of soldiers. You can turn your footsoldiers into armorless cannonfodder there just for numbers, or give them all the best equipment you can and have fewer. There are hero units which you can choose to lead your armies, or stuff into cities to give boosts. They have levels, abilities, and special equipment which can all be used to further boost whatever they are attached to.Each faction feels unique, at least compared to most others. There is some overlap generally, but none feel quite the same to play. The world, the setting, the music. These are all very well executed and interesting enough for people that care about lore/world building to feel right at home. Considering this is an afterthought in almost all 4x games, I found it wonderful that they put so much care into it. There are quests, faction quests and random quests found through various world explorations. They are very much worth doing for the rewards involved and can add a lot more early game interaction between factions.The AI is pretty laughable, so up until very hard difficulty one can play how they like without much fear of actually losing against it. Even on the harder difficulties it isn't very hard if you're not afraid to abuse game mechanics. At the same time I'd say the default difficulty is perfect for newcomers of 4x games to dip their toes in.The game is a solid purchase for any price. Likely to provide a great dollar to hour spent ratio. The extensive and ease of moddability will likely add many more on top of that for people that really enjoy it.			"

Early Access Review
								Overview:Endless Legend beat all all my expectations in a game, even at Alpha Stage it has more to it than some 4x games. In a nutshell as a comparison the game is a great mix of Fallen Enchantress, and Endless Space. If you liked both You'll love Endless Legend most likely, even if you didn't like Fallen Enchantress, the mix of Endless Space makes it great. The game-play will feel right at home for Endless Space players, and other 4x games like Fallen Enchantress with some unique spins as well. Game-play: Cities:The map is split up into pre randomized territories. When you build a city in a territory you capture that entire territory. As you build your city expands tiles. Your city uses all of the main tiles its on + the surrounding ones for resources, gold, industry, and science. The towns can also be governed by Heroes just like planets in Endless Space, which will give a nice boost depending on how you level up your hero. Armies: Armies work much like Fleets do in Endless Space.  You have a max number of squads you can have, until you research more. Armies can be lead by Heroes which will give the army nice amounts of boosts depending again how you level them up. Heroes:Heroes in general are a bit different than in Endless Space. Though they can govern towns and armies, they also have armor/weapons and accessories you can equip them with like in Fallen Enchantress. As you research more, and get more resources, you unlock more powerful and different kinds of weapons/armors for your Heroes to equip. Regular units cannot be equiped with different armors, but they do get a boost depending on which tech era you're in, and as they gain levels through battles they get stat boosts. Battles: Battles play out like they would in Fallen Enchantress, but with a few slight differences. It goes in phases much like battles in Endless Space, with the setup, telling each unit to be aggressive, defensive, or not to move at all. Next phase is selecting who they focus. Then its go. They'll move if need be to get in range of who you wanted them to target, and they'll take turns attacking. Their initiative determines who goes first. After 2 turns, you get to re adjust your army, if you want some units to fall back, or re adjust who they focus. The battles also take place on the tiles around the map itself. As a battle starts the battlefield will consist of a large portion of the tiles that actually exist on the game map itself, allowing you to use the terrain to your advantage. The Map: The map is split up into tiles, and on these tiles, and plays just like you'd expect a 4x game like this. However, there are also ruins which you can find, and if explored by an army with a hero may generate a random quest to go on, or give you gold(dust). The map is very beautifully done, and looks amazing, and changes depending on if its summer or winter.  Minor Factions: Minor Factions are randomly put around on the map. You cannot trade with them, and at the start they are neutral. You can attack or negotiate with them to add them to your faction. Each Minor Faction has a faction wide boost for immulating them into your faction, and you get to train their troops along with your normal ones. Conclusion: Already in Alpha this game has nearly more than Fallen Enchantress and other 4x games that have gone through in the past. You know a game will be well worth it if you can get your money's worth in Alpha.  However, it being Alpha does mean there are things still not implemented, and balancing that needs to happen, but is well worth the money in my opinion, and will be something worth investing in early that you won't be disappointed in.

												Enless Legend is the first ""Endless"" game I have ever played, so from a gameplay standpoint it feels a lot like the Civ series. You develop your civilization through a tech tree, update your cities with buildings, and build armies for exploration and extermination. Armies in this case are more hero and item driven than Civ. Similar to say, Fallen Enchantress, you develop heroes and units with weapons, armor, and trinkets, which can be found in the world, aqcuired through quests, or created in a city. This all feels good, but it's not what keeps me playing Endless Legend.I find the world building in Enless Legend to be supurb. Here's why:Every faction is unique. Each one of them has it's own back story, and purpose for being on this world. Each unit has back story which explains why it has the abilities it has, and often why it looks the way it does. A campaign has been built for each faction to provide a steady drip of objectives and story to go with it. Also, each faction plays quite differently from the next by having different strengths and resource needs.The look of the game is striking. It's the type of game you could buy based on the sole belief that it is an interactive and evolving piece of visual art. The color pallet, unit and city design, and way the topography of the map is depicted is beautiful.The soundtrack is quite nice. Again, the factions have a unique feel and tone articulated in the ambient music. This does a great job of pulling you into the world.Finally the UI. It may be the best I have ever used in a turn based strategy game. The overall design is greyscale and filled with very clear icons. Color is used to great effect to represent resources, factions, regions of the screen, and actions which can be done with the mouse pointer on specific objects. Everything is meticulously and clearly described through tool tips, and the UI can be collapsed and expanded in several ways. The tech tree, which is more like tech pools, where you research so many from Age 1 to move on to Age 2 is a great addition to the genre. The diplomacy screen is split into a semi-circle, which radiates outward. Depending on your standing with an opponent they will physically be closer or further away from you, and spaced relatively to their own allies or enemies.There are a couple places I could see improvement in this game, and it would be easy to do in an expandion. The first is the combat. The way ""combat mode"" is integrated with the living world is great, but I wish I had a little more control over my individual units. Some uniqe skills which I can choose from and actively use would draw me into the world even more. They do a great job integrating every unit into the world and a few unique skills and art to go with it would be great. There is always the option to automate or spectate the battle, and I often feel like manually controlling a battle, and spectating it is about the same thing.The next is a small hickup in usability and it only stands out because everything else is so fluid. Adding a created unit to a nearby army stack. It appears you have to put the new unit into an army to leave the city, and then walk it to the stack. Sometimes this can be done by selecting the unit, and right clicking the stack. Othertimes it doesn't work. I have wasted many movement turns trying to get this accomplished.If you are looking for a great turn based strategy game set in a fantasy/sci-fi world I would highly recommend Endless Legend.			"

												For me the bottom line is this:  if you loved the Civ franchise, you will likely love this too.  Personally, I think this is better than Civ due to the combat mechanics, quest system, and integratable native villages...plus you can improve your heroes, troops and even equip armor etc.  If you like an active life and don't want a game to suck you in and devour all your spare time, perhaps stay away.   ;) There IS a learning curve, certainly, but with detailed (and beautiful!) tooltips, most of it is pretty self explanatory.  The tutorial does a decent job of teaching the basics and poking around and actually reading the hover tooltips can take care of most of the rest.  The game is gorgeous (I play this particular game on my imac with retina screen, not my windows machine so perhaps that is part of it), but it really is a vibrant and gorgeous looking game. The music is beautiful also.   I'll be playing this one a LONG time and even at full price the game is a STEAL.   I can't help but recommend it if you are a fan of the 4X turn based strategy games....or even simply a fantasy fan and want to try something different for a change.  Buy it.			"

												After sinking hundreds (maybe even thousands) of hours into Civ games, I find this to be a welcome step up.It has everything that the Civilization series has been lauded for, with an added layer of complexity to every possible action or decision. The end result is a deeply complex system which is surprisingly intuitive, given the potential depth of micro-management.Basically, if you want something a bit more detailed than Civ, but a bit more user-friendly than Europa Universalis, then this is an excellent pick.

												I think major titles such as Civilization could learn a thing or two from Endless Legend. When I first learned this was an indie game I was blown away. It is better than most AAA I have seen. It's graphics are simply beautiful! It's gameplay is addicting on the same level as Civ! It's lore is compelling! Everything about this game will pull you in and before you know it, you are hooked! ""How does this compared to Civilization though?"" I hear you ask, ""It looks like a copy cat to me!"" I hear you cry. But that simply isn't so! Here's a quick comparison.Civlization V:1 unit per tileExpanding borders worked by citizens and improved by workersTwo diplomatic stances; war and peaceSpecial units that quickly go obsoleteForced to get all technologys, even ones you probably won't use, just to progressEndless Legend:1 party per tile. Under normal circumstances, 4-8 units in a single partyStatic borders and can only work tiles surrounding your city. Citizens act as multipliers. Can extend city's reach within borders.Four diplomatic stances; war, cold war, peace, and aliance.Units don't go obsolete. Instead you can give them better equipment.Tech web that doesn't force you to get all the techs. Only x amount to reach the next era. Meaning it's very possible to only get the one's you will actually use.All and all, I am not saying Civilization is a bad game. I infact, still play it time to time and enjoy it's historical setting. However, I think it could learn a lot from this game. Endless Legend does it's own thing. Worth every penny you spend.There is most deffinitly room for improvement. I think the game could highly benifet from extending naval aspects of the game. And like most games, there are bugs. My final verdict, I give it a 9/10. A must own for fans of the genre!			"

												If you miss the fantasy mods for Civ 4 (Fall From Heaven, particularly), then this game will scratch that itch like nothing else so far has. If you've played Civ 5, then this game should be very intuitive. The combat is pretty different though, and may take some time to learn the ropes for. You can't always throw bigger armies at your opponent to win like you usually can in Civ5.			"

												Update after full launch:7/10This game has officially failed to become a good 4X game.  It has some outstanding ideas, notably the heroes, the weapon systems, and the quest system.  It has some quirky ideas that don't quite meet their full potential, such the incredibly unique and varied races and the tactical battles.  Then it's got some neat ideas that just don't work, like the province system.  At the end of the day, this is a great try and injects some life into the 4X genre, but it's missing the mechanics of other greats that prevent it from being fully recommended.    *CAVEAT: I should actually say that I am a peace-loving hippie; this game may very well cater towards you warmongers...  Pros:- Downrigth gorgeous, with stellar art and graphics- Excellent strategic pre-battle planning for your units and heros- Fun quests, especially since each race has their own unique storyline- Great race selection, albiet with flaws (see below)- It really is a servicable 4X game, and is fun enough in its own rightQuirky idea shout-out:- I loved the tech where you can make all-merc armies neutral, then have them wollop on you friends without them knowing it is you.  Good tries:- Tactical combat- Racial abilities don't always work as anticipated, or are not as useful as the developer's thought- Complex trade and diplomatic systems; the problem here seems to be AI, not the system.  Excellent ideas.Big Issue that was never fixed:- There are still missing explanations for game mechanics, which is nigh unforgivable in such a complex game. Cons:- Province/district system really shoehorns your expansion and negates any real need for protection of non-city areas. - Utter lack of customization of districts or landscape; incredibly dissapointing given the fascinating take in Endless Space.- Because of the above two problems, the mid-game is incredibly dry if you don't want to fight everyone; you simply set up a build and research cue, then hit end turn (as opposed to micromanage tiles, planets, etc.)- Further, expanding your city is not that fun since you take huge hits in happiness every time you do (which, if you think about it, is bass ackward).     - FIDS system, or rather the DS (dust and science) part of it, make unique cities unnecessary and pointless; each city can easily produce everything.- Laying seige to a town is odd; it is completely necessary, but is so easy it feels as though it is not. - Playing with an emphasis on ranged combat gives you a huge advantage with just a minor understanding of tactics.- No sea or air combat, and very limited sea exploration/exploitationOriginal EA review:To start, this game has tons of potential.  The base buliding is fantastic, it exudes character (for example, each race has a unique quest/storyline with rewards), and the combat is a unique take on 4X games.  Also, I love the way they are approaching diplomacy (it depends a little on its own resource, which makes it easier when playing with the AI).   Of course, this is early access. Now, normally I am 100% against early access games.  They lack polish, they are buggy as hell, etc.  The same is true of Endless Legend.  The biggest problem: the utter and complete lack of explanation of anything.  So, why a thumbs up for this one?  Because Amplitude did it right and is giving a 25% discount!  Hot damn people, we've got good marketing and benefits for all!  I'll update when I've played more, but for now, this already awesome looking game is being offered at a significant discount and is enjoyable enough right to sink a few hours here and there.  Definitely the best EA game on the market right now.			"

												This is it. This is the game to beat Civilization. I've put only a decent amount of time into Civ V and am by no means excellent at the game, but have extensive experience with it. This game simply trumps Civ V in almost every category I can think of. The two biggest improvement are the minor factions compared to barbarians and the combat system. Both are much more in-depth and have nice interactions. In Civ V for barbarians you simply stack units and win, but Endless Legend, while has that option, you can conduct diplomacy, bribe them, or attack them. The combat system is by far the biggest advantage over Civ V. You don't simply stack units. You have to strategically and constantly reposition your units. You have to customize your units to beat specific enemies. If you are a lover of 4X games, this game is a must.			"

												Endless Legend (EL) is a very ambitious simultaneously turn based new 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) strategy game in a fantasy setting by Amplitude studios (Endless Legend, Dungeon of the Endless). The general setting is unusual, as you're stranded on the planet Auriga that has been a favoured laboratory of a powerful precursor race, the Endless, until they erased themselves from existence in a large civil war.Now, you take control of one out of 8 standard factions or any custom faction you create in an editor, using the basic gameplay of one of the 8 with some modifiers. Your goal is to survive as Auriga is slowly drifting towards an everlasting winter that will snuff out all life left on its surface. There are several victory conditions you can fulfill, ranging from ""bucket""-type conditions like gathering enough currency or being the highest in score at a configurable turn limit to fulfilling a quest and building an expensive wonder, exterminating all concurrents or researching yourself to victory. Not all of these victory conditions are equally fun to reach as ""filling a bucket"" can be quite tedious, but the different factions are also specialised at reaching different victory conditions.And this is where EL is ambitious in the sense that its 8 factions are very asymmetrically designed:- The Wild Walkers are the not so usual Elves of the game, using woods to boost their industrial proficiency. They get to be the production powerhouse of the game.- The Vaulters are the survivors of the Dungeon of the Endless game, stranded on the planet. Hightech-dwarfs of a sort with heavy armor and the best science output.- The Rowing Clans are supposed to be the traders of the planet. They cannot declare war, are better than the NSA at finding out who's selling or buying what to a common marketplace you can get access to by research, and can actually even trade-ban people, bleeding them dry, economically.- The Drakken are the peacekeepers, a draconid race interested in achieving diplomatic victory by using their influence to force whole empires into peace or alliance with them.- The Ardent Mages can use spells on the map and in combat. Given enough currency, a weak army of them can still beat a superior foe with enough magic support fire.- The Necrophage do not do anything but feed, war and reproduce. Peace is not an option, as is not conquering. The Zergs of the planet, indeed.- The Broken Lords are living armors thinking of themselves as paladins and leeching life like vampires. Lorewise, one of my favourites, their gameplay is centered on currency to buy population with.- The Cultists of the Eternal End have only one city and expand by converting minor faction villages across the planet to generate troops for them and to harvest resources for them.In general, this asymmetry is what makes the game nice, but it is also its vulnerability. As each faction plays differently, the AI also has to account for that. During the Early Access phase, the AI made huge jumps and has become a threat to the unwary at higher difficulty levels, now, but still fails in the endgame. It doesn't recognize that, given it is close to winning, the human player in the game will go to lengths to eradicate them. On the other hand, in the beginning, different AI personalities shine through. Around the Ardent Mages, there's always a lot of scorched earth destroyed minor faction villages, while Wild Walkers spread and pacify, instead. I'm quite confident that this will improve, further, but I rate what's present, now.Therefore I downright recommend to play this game in multiplayer. The simultaneous turns allow for fast games, compared to other titles. You can set turn timers and therefore force people to be fast, or give each and everyone as much time as they want, but a long game would last 4 hours, at most, on fast speed settings.Even there, though, the asymmetry of the game design has its dangers. You can equip your units with better and better equipment through the ages, having to use strategic resources on the map to get the very best, but there's a clear preference for some attributes being far better than others. Some units you gain by assimilating minor factions (you can then build their units and get some bonus per controlled village of that faction) are better than standard units and certainly better than most other units on the planet. I'm thinking of e.g. Kazanjii demons or Haunts of the Ended here, both having a chain hit special ability.One thing I have to add about the techtree: It is not linear, there's no clear progression. In each ""era"", you have to choose at least x technologies, then you progress to the next era. Each time you research something, the cost for the next research increases, no matter the era its out of.Overall, the game has a lot of depth for someone who favours empire management over combat. There's still lots of balancing and AI-tuning to do, but the game is fun and I recommend it.			"

												I purchased Endless Legend when it first released, played it for 40 hours then put EL to the side and waited for things to smooth out. It's time for a review.I would like to start by saying that AMPLITUDE Studios is the best. I have chatted with the devs and other EL players with great response.With the backing of a great team emerges a fantastic game, Endless Legend.This 4X turn-based fantasy strategy is the best of it's kind. EL has set the water mark standard.From the 11 factions that have fantasic stories behind them. To the rich music, sharp graphics, beautiful intros and deep skill tree. EL is the best!Any Gripes?Yeah, minor gripes....First off, you cannot rotate the camera to look at the land. The camera will only allow a ""Pan to the left"" and ""Pan to the right"" There is no looking at the situation freely and it does cause a gripe. I just wish they would fix that!Winter is coming. This is a gripe the devs intentionally placed in the game and it's the change of seasons. When winter hits.... IT HITS! Everything slows down. Production, movement and the price of things go up. Food and profit drop. Population will starve and die. It really makes one dread winter. So should the devs change this? Heck no! It adds character to the game because it will cause a player to really play your moves right on minimal resources and movement. (Don't leave your troops to far away from shelter)CHOOSE YOUR DESTINY. okay fight. The battles scenes are kinda weak and leave much to desire. Like the camera limitation, I just wish there was more to the battles and even throw in a troop cheer at the end of a victory. After all the planning, after all the building, thats the outcome when they battle? Again, a minor gripe.Wow the clock is slow man.....Yeah like any 4x strategy game it is slow going so be aware. If you are unable to deal with thinking games, go play GTA or something to hold your attention.None of these gripes put the game down enough to not recommend. YES, I do recommend Endless Legend and YES get all the DLC's and YES goto AMPLITUDE Studios web site to be in touch with the devs.Don't forget Dungeon of the Endless made by the same people! Another great game!			"

												I am positively flashed by this game. I had fun with Warlock: Master of the Arcane and stumbled with Heroes of Might and Magic. I was appealed but bored by Age of Wonders III, but this Endless Legend...I went straight in without going into the tutorial first. Exploring this wonderfully complex ressource and economics system that is untypical for this genre of Fantasy 4X allows a play style for everyone - which leads to war being the faster and in early difficulties the more viable solution. However, war is not always the same. While each factions is pretty much unique and has access to their very own units, minor factions and tribes can be indoctrinated to fill the roles you need. Which is awesome. Endless Legend gives freedom to the player and I commend this game for this bold, but very well executed move.Endless Legend does a lot of stuff right. It has its minor mistakes, for example: You can have multiple AoW-styled battles going at the same time, but you can't properly move two armies the same path. Moving units out of cities required one button click too much - and sometimes they leave by accident. But these minor complaints from my side cannot possibly compare to the gorgeous experience, lore and mashup Endless Legends provides. I mean, Dragonpeople fight against Fallout-Style Vaultpeople, Magicians and the Scourge.			"

												Oh man, Endless Legend is like if Vlaada Chvatil designed Civilization set in Smallworlds.Now that I've said the board-gaming-nerdiest thing in my life, I mean that it takes that 4X style game, makes some clever and major changes to the systems, makes every system important to the whole play experience, and then makes every choice feel way more important (and, occasionally, bone-wrenchingly painful decisions). And if you try to play it like Civ, you'll fail spectacularly, like I did. You can't just ignore subsystems you don't normally focus on - you'll have to become familiar with the diplomacy system and upgrade your units manually and consider each of these choices in detail. So if you're used to relying on a automated manager system for some of those mechanics, you'll be in for a rude awakening -- because there either isn't one, or the AI isn't very good -- but one that'll make you a better player even as you're having fun failing.if you want a fantasy-setting 4X game that's a little leaner and a lot sharper, pick it up. Just be careful, as you'll be one-more-turn-ing long into the night.			"

												After a great deal of time in the world i learn all the mechanics of the game, but only through trial and error. The brutality this game can show on the higher setting refects more of a dark souls style game where you are forced to react fast or be wiped out. Overall i think this is an amazing title in the endless series and if you are a fan of 4x you will feel right at home, but if you are new to this style of game do not expect the game to hold your hand . There will be death but there will be life.			"

												This is a fantastic 4X game. As someone who played plenty of Civilization V, this was the perfect thing to come to when I got bored of it. It's a really complex and fun game, but one warning I will give is that it takes a long time to understand the whole game. Honestly it was like 25 hours in that I finally got it properly, but it is worth it. Everything in game makes logicial sense and it is set up to (once you understand it) make everything you need to do simple and not at all time-consuming. The word I would use is 'satisfying.' Exploring and finding ruins: satisfyingFinding and exploiting luxury and strategic resources: satisfyingBattles: extremely satisfyingQuests: satsifyingThat is one thing that makes a great change from Civ, you get quests to do, set depending on what faction you are or given to you by minor factions (equivelant of Civ's 'city-states) or found in anicent ruins. Doing the quests give you rewards, keep the game ticking along and they also give the game a 'story-like' feel, which I really enjoy. Good points:You can stack your units! Each faction has its own personality and play-style, each game with a different faction is completely differentVery satisfying and enjoyable battle sytstem (probably the best i've encountered in a 4X game)Every unit can be customized and changed with loads of different weapons and armourEnemy AI is reasonably goodEverything in game makes sense and works properly (once you get the hang of it)Exploration is fun and satisfyingThe tech tree is massive and full of goodiesThe citizen system is fantastic and makes it really easy to concentrate on one area of empire buildingBad points: Takes a really long time to understand everything in gameHas the same problem as Civ, the beginning of the game is a lot more fun than the end-gameTutorial probably teaches you about 5% of what you actually need to do in gameSome factions are a bit OP Overall I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Civilization V. It's the Jesus and Mary Chain of 4X games; hard to get into initially, but then so much to explore.			"

												Fun fact: If you never knew why they're called 4X games it stands for explore, expand, exploit, exterminate.Endless Legend does an incredible job of innovating the 3rd ""X""; exploit.  Your faction colonizes territories and immediately you begin exploiting the area around you.  Harmlessly at first.  Then you realize you can assimilate minor factions in your provice in a number of ways.  Who doesn't love getting a little bonus and then pacifying and gaining the ability to recruit some creepy looking worm people, two headed dog warriors, or a flying demon that looks straight out of Diablo?Beyond that you start exploiting different naturally occuring deposits as your research makes them available.  As you and the other inhabitants of the world exploit more and more, the winters get longer and longer.  ""Maybe this is bad for the planet?"" you may ask, but then you get distracted by shiny pearls that are just ASKING to be harvested.  Let's face it, you NEED them to help build structures that negate winter's affect on your exploitations.  Plus you can make pearl armor, weapons, and chic trinkets to accessorize your heroes with.  My archer lady looks great in pearls.To get to the point, you can really get lost in this title.  I've found the normal difficulty is great for the standard 4X player (aka me).  The game doesn't feel like it's cheating against you as I've felt with other games in the same genre.  The one major city per province mechanic allows city building to feel less like a race and more like a reflection of the progression of your empire.The quests can give you plenty to do, the roaming minor faction armies make you keep pace with your military, and I've rarely gotten to the point in a game where an AI opponent rolls in three armies just cause they can and wipes me out.  The diplomatic measures are balanced, the factions are unique, the setting is eye candy, and you can spend hours and hours of your life hitting that 3rd X super hard and building the empire that you never could in those other games.The game works great with the Steam Controller.My only negative: Running this on a Mac OS leads to the occasional crash about every 25-50 turnsBeautiful, challanging, innovative, and rewarding.9/10 Two headed dog warriors would be exploited again.

												Endless Legend is a fantasy turn-based strategy game. It is comparable to Civ in some senses but the differences are what makes this game worth it.The graphics are amazing and the varying visuals for each faction gives the feel you would want from a fantasy game. There are less factions than there are in Civ, but each one changes the gameplay so much that it makes the race to victory different every time you play. For example one faction gains less food but makes up for it by being able to earn stockpiles (worth ~100 food) by killing enemies. Another faction can only build 1 city but can recruit minor factions to work for them. There are many paths to a victory and it can range fom 150 turn games to 300 turn games or even more. Each faction has their own quests in addition to the general quest that everyone recieves, and there are even group quests that all factions can take part in or sometimes race over.You can also choose wether you want to control the fights or if it is a clear win you can automate the fight. A learning curve as it is a very complex game. A point system shows how far each team is in their development, but do not fear if you fall behind a few points as there will be chances to catch up by paying attention to the strong points of your faction and work with that. There are also regions that you settle in, and once that region is taken it is owned by the person who owns that settlement. That is until another faction takes over so making sure to have units defending the base is essential, since if they attack and you only have the militia to defend then there goes a while city of income.

												Great game - with caveats.It's times like this I wish Steam had a more granular recommendation option, because there really is a lot to like about this game. It's gorgeous, the art design is amazing, the playable factions are unique and interesting and the music is also great. The beginning game is a lot of fun (if somewhat daunting for newbies), but the game starts to bog down in the late game. The problem is that the challenges don't scale as you level up, so combat becomes inconsequential, and the game goes from being a fun turn based strategy game into an excruciatingly boring ""resource management"" chore.Master of Magic struck the right balance, with high level enemies and challenges to keep the player engaged. Once you've reached a high enough level in Endless Legend, there is little reason to move your armies around the map, and the game devolves into just allocating your city populations between resource priorities.Still a very good game, if you love spreadsheets.

												Excellent game! As someone who loves strategy and 4X games both, I find this to be very enjoyable. I'm on turn 210 of my first game and still playing obsessively, having only taken a break once to shower, once to eat and once to sleep. :P While there are some things that could certainly be improved upon, as is true with any game, it strikes a very good balance between management, exploration and strategy and is quite good fun as it is.If you enjoyed Endless Space, or if you've enjoyed games like Civilization or Age of Wonders, you're almost sure to enjoy this. It has shades of both Civ V and Age of Wonders, but enough unique features (and more than enough uniqueness in factions) to stand apart from them, and I definitely wouldn't call it a ""clone"" of either. And some features, like diplomacy, are done similarly to both games but, in my opinion, a bit better than either.Short story: If you enjoy 4X games, don't overlook this as a ""me too"" copy sort of game. This is definitely a game you should give a chance; I'll bet you won't be sorry you did.			"

Early Access Review
								Amazing! This is a gem in the making, it has become one of my favorites in my library.I have played a full session of Endless Legend. The game is pretty far ahead for its early access tag (wish others would follow their example). The game is still buggy here and there, but most issues can be corrected by reloading when they happen. I have played only the Broken Lords faction, but fought against all others in the same session (4 out of 8 available for now), went epic with a large scale map. I enjoyed the mission structure in this game, it can be ignored, but if you dive into it you will earn serious rewards (main quests in particular) and learn a little more of the lore. The story of my character for the Broken lords is actually well written, I wished there would be a little more to it as it caught my attention and imagination as it is mostly original which is rare now days.Gameplay is fun and has a dinamic feel to it despite its turn based structure. Army deployment for each battle gives a nice touch as pieces of the board spread to fill the section of the battlefield, battles play out as expected but are more tactical (which in my opinion is great), leaving strategy to the empire portion of the game.There is a summer and winter season. During winter your troops and empire struggle until the next summer season, making managing resources important as they are more limited. Fraquinly this creates some elaborate strategies as you need to prepare for winter and try to advance during summer when troops can see and walk farther per turn, you can push thru during winter, but it can be challenging getting back to defend a point if needed. Minor factions can be assimilated and there are a lot of them already (there seems to be more coming, hopefully a lot  more as I got spoiled by them and need more!), they add a lot of flavor to a session and are very different one from another (lore/looks wise, unique units will fall into infantry, cavalry, support, ranged or flying). Loved this concept and is the first time I see minor factions in a game like this one working the way they do, they are more than just background, some territoies need to be taken from them by force and they do put up a nice fight or you can negotiate peace and solve issues via quest or the good old captalism bribe, dealing with them in battle can sometimes be difficult, which is awesome for the small challenge they present aside from the main empires (its possible to completely crush your opposition if you are like me, playing to become ""ultimate"", but its a lot of turns and by then nobody will mess with you!).Diplomacy does not seem to be working well yet (seems not to respond most times aside from declaration of war and close/open borders), which is a pitty, but again the game is barely out and we already got some decent patches to address some problems, my guess is that diplomacy fix will follow soon.  The experience was so good that I decided that they have earned my time and a positive review from me, in all honesty I did not expect such a great game. If you have played Endless Space, I must say I enjoyed Endless Legend a lot more, a lot more indeed.I will give a few days for next patch and try another session, the game is really addicting to me under the one more turn syndrome.If you have the time and want to try / create an incentive for something different, then by all means give this one a chance, it still needs a lot of things which are not available yet, so keep this in mind. Still its amazing how far along this game is.			"

Posted: September 23, 2014
												Good lord, where to start with this game… Oh I know, this game is crack and singlehandedly ruining my PhD so I’m uninstalling it >: (If this is a genre you’re familiar with then this game should hold serious appeal. It has taken everything the developers did right with their previous attempt, Endless Space and mixed with the best parts of Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic. While the game isn’t perfect, there’s very few things that can’t be fixed with patches and what is there now is absolutely amazing (and super addictive). There is one small exception that might turn a lot of people off so I’ll get that out of the way first:“Spreadsheeting” Large aspects of the game does in many ways rely on you looking at various numbers and trying to make the right numbers bigger. This is a turn off to a lot of people but I think it works well particularly as which number you are trying to make bigger can change drastically from each play through based on current circumstance and race selection (more on this later). But, you can’t deny the fact that the glitz and glamour of the graphics and the great flavour of the game simply hide a form of database management. FYI, that is totally, leaning towards unjustifiably harsh phrasing but a good summary of what you’ll be doing from mid-game onwards. But, you still love every moment of it.Why? 1)	Fantastic FlavourThe story, the art, the settings and the music all come together in a fantastic way to make Endless Legend have a world that is both interesting to explore and “live in”. In particular, each of the factions have extremely distinct visual styles, units and play styles that really make you want to experience the game through each of their eyes. Add to that a reasonably interesting quest chain unique to each faction, and you have a lot to grab your attention for the first many playthroughs.2)	Great GameplayQuips about spreadsheet simulation aside, the game dresses up the numbers enough so you won’t feel it unless you really hate numbers in your games. Otherwise, you’ll be quite happily:- swapping people through the five different production (Food, Industry, Dust/aka Wealth, Science, Influence) types and managing construction queues trying to optimise each cities outputs to match your current objectives;-	Producing enough Influence (while still trying to maximise other outputs) so you have enough to buy bonuses when you have a chance to change your 20-year empire plan; -	While also using that same resource to bargain for peace and technology from enemies; -	Fiddling with the equipment load-outs of your heroes and infantry units making sure you have the optimal balance of damage, skill, speed and defense;-	While also making sure you’re not sacrificing better special abilities in favour of better stats; -	Trying to figure out  which minor AI faction would be optimal to incorporate into your empire for the best passive bonuses vs which factions give you better mercenary units; -	Working out how to get elevation bonus during the actual battles and trying to get your hero in range for the point blank bonus without coping a poisoned hit from a –GAH, THIS GAME!!3)	Compelling CampaignsA follow up from point 1 is the play styles of the playable faction. As mentioned before, most of them play significantly differently so the game always stays fresh. There’s a faction that doesn’t produce food but instead consumes wealth to grow and heal. There’s another where you flat out can’t declare war but you can ban people from using the global market restricting them from buying/selling resources or recruiting heroes. There’s another which is the only one that allows you to cast spells on the global map while another will only allow you to have ONE city the entire game. Though these seem like the extremes, even the ‘somewhat’ more normal factions such Vaulters or Necrophages have strange and interesting quirks (holy resource vs corpse consumption) that make small but interesting and important changes to their gameplay. But this game is still far from perfect. On top of the spreadsheeting problem mentioned earlier, this game still has a very steep learning curve and a tutorial that explains very little beyond the basics of gameplay. For example, only during my third of fourth play through during the early access period did I figure out how to trade with other empires. Another example is the aforementioned Vaulters with their holy resource. I had to google what that implied as nowhere in the game was I clearly told what it was, what it did and why I was an idiot for trying to play the campaign without selecting a holy resource (and how to do that!). The game also crashed at least 1-2x each play through but this as well as some of the problems I mentioned can and hopefully will be patched over time. All in all, this game is fun, flavourful and addictive as all hell and I very highly encourage fans of the 4x/”grand strategy” to check it out. Just make sure you don’t have anything important to do anytime soon… "

												I want to start off by saying, I was not impressed by Endless Space. So going into this game I was highly skeptical and I felt that Age of Wonders 3 was going to be a superior game in all aspects. Also, if you'd rather watch my review rather than read it, well, here you go:


YouTube™ Video: Endless Legend Review (CommissarBRO Show) 

			Views: 970		

			The Commissar reviews the new game, Endless Legend by Amplitude Studios. Get ready for this short and sweet episode of the CommissarBRO Show!		

Thankfully, I was horribly wrong. Endless Legend is a refreshing 4X Fantasy Turn-based Strategy game that has a beautiful aesthetic, simply beautiful music and an incredibly immersive world. Artistically, you can see where Amplitude was trying to create it's own world rather than copy and paste the Civ Map and formula with it's interesting terrain design, huge assortment of resources and even its graphical style. Exploration in this game is an absolute treat and you will find yourself scouting out the various corners of the world with glee; meeting new races, looting abandoned ruins, and solving the mysteries of this ancient world. Amplitude continues to flex is development muscle with it's intricate Unit Customization tools which are incredibly simplistic yet allow for all sorts of loadout variants for your troops and heroes. What's wrong with the game you ask?The worst thing (which isn't even that bad) is the combat system. From the time I have put into it, it really seems like it plays itself, just like Endless Space. Essentially, I spend far more time autoresolving the battles rather than playing them. The tutorial is also not incredibly effective at explaining a lot of the economic portions of the game or even explaining the finer points of the battle system.All in all, this game is freaking awesome and has proved to be one of the best modern 4x games to date! Hats off to Amplitude, you've made a fan out of me. "

												Amazing 4x strategy game with some fresh wind in its sails. The factions are really unique, especially considering every one of them has it's own story through the normal game. Options to equip your troops with researched equipments add a lot of variabilities to your army and strategic options for the fights. The option to build your own factions out of all the available boni and mali make sure, you can play as whatever faction you want.The graphical aspects are spot on and the game overall seems pretty polished. If you have played civilization and endless space, you know what awaits you anyways: an almost perfect fusion.9/10 easily, with the right decisions in an expansion even the 10 would be reachable!

												If you loved Civ, but are looking for something different enough to be intriguing while retaining its addictiveness, Endless Legend is the game for you.I expected Endless Legend to be something of a Civilization clone, and that was fine by me. It is far more than that, however. The game mechanics can at first seem a little daunting to get into, and the first time I tried it I uninstalled the game not long after starting because there really isn't much of a tutorial to speak of (at least there wasn't back then). A few hours in, however, and I was completely hooked.Each faction plays the game in a very different fashion, making replaying the game several times pretty much a necessity. The storylines of each faction are just okay, and the sudden 'jump' to the endgame missions (which are the same across the board) is a bit sudden. Nonetheless, the special abilities and units of the factions in addition to the victories which most suit them make up for the shortcomings.The combat system is also pretty interesting, allowing you to win difficult battles on skill and positioning, while at the same time not making you suffer through whitewashes if you don't want to. A fantastic game overall, and I can't wait to try out the expansions I've just purchased to explore the new aspects of the game.			"

												This is a marked improvement to the formula that was established in Endless Space. There are plenty of new concepts and idiosyncrasies not quite seen in other games and it's usually a pleasure to learn them. There are meaningful choices in nearly every turn and viable victory conditions that keep you engaged. Not everything works perfectly smoothly or crystal clearly and there isn't yet the depth equivalent of the twice expanded Civ5, but Endless Legend is deep with gameplay character and a very attractive take on grand 4X games. A must own.			"

												So I've only had the game one weekend, But I did finish a campaign.  And since this is a turn-based 4x strategy game with a fantasy theme, I'm going to compare to others like Age of Wonders and Elemental.  Endless Legend gives a lot of variety in choices for progression and andvancing your faction.  I really like that city expansion is a planned purposeful event.  Not, I crossed the influence threshold and POOF my city is twice as good as it was before.  Research is not as linear as Civ.  You have to research about half of a lower tier before the next higher tier opens, but you don't have to research them all.  There are only a few unit designs available, infantry, ranged, cavalry, support,  buy you can change up there gear and they get much more powerful.  I haven't decided if I like combat yet.  The game is not as combat focused as AoW so you don't have complete control.  Each turn you give your units a plan and the AI executes.  I haven't played any other games like this so I'm still ambiguous on this piece.  But they did a nice job balancing granular control with avoiding tedious end-game management.  You can que up your production and movement and research and then just keep an eye on it.  The game give good alerting and you can use the alerts to access the management panels you need.  Which is good, because there are a lot of them.  If you like the 4x Turn games you will want to give this one a try.  Its different enough that you won't feel you've played it before.  If you are more the fast-paced RTS strat gamer, you won't like this.  Hope this helps!			"

												My absolute favorite 4X strategy game to date! Unbeatable, this game truly masters each step the 4X strategy games are known for! Science Trees arent expansive, but they arent small! Each step taken with Science feels huge, requiring you to use your populace to build, research, grow, appeal, or gather dust! If you have to choose between Civilization V\VI and Endless Legend, choose Endless Legend! Its much more unique, fun, the combat isnt boring nor a chore, people wont declare war for you simply setting foot on their land, Quests that add to the already immense atmosphere and story, a soundtrack to die for, each major faction you play as feel entirely different (Say for the Vaulters and Mezari) my final argument is this. I could spend 5 dollars on the Babylon DLC for Civilization V and it would add Nebuchadnezzar II Babylon to play as in game. In Civilization, you shall play different depending on your civilization, however, it doesnt feel different! This is the fatal flaw. 5 dollars for DLC, yea thats an okay price, 12 bucks? ♥♥♥♥, they better have content, and they sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥do! for 12 dollars you can buy the Tempest DLC, Shifters DLC, or Forgotten DLC, 2 dollars less and you can purchase The Guardians DLC, 3 dollars the amazing soundtrack AND the expanded version. The Forgotten, Tempest, and Shifters DLC do FAR more than just add Factions, no, Tempest allows expansion of your rule to the Seas! YES! YOU CAN RULE THE SEAS! AND The story for the Mogawr is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing! Yes this adds music to the soundtrack too! I cant even list the other two other than the Shifters having Orbs, the likes of which you use to create altars to the goddess/land Auriga that adds huge bonuses! The Forgotten is where Espionage comes into play! The Shifter adds The Alayi, arguably the coolest looking faction, The Forgotten add the, well, Forgotten, with a tale of vengence!All in all 10\10!! Best 4X strategy game ive ever played, I love it to death!			"

												I recently picked up Beyond Earth and actually enjoyed it quite a bit, despite the well worn complaints already voiced in other reviews.  It's a good game, whose worst offense is being the next (perhaps overly streamlined) game in the revered Civilization franchise. For me, perhaps the best thing about Beyond Earth is that it led me to discover Endless Legend.  I am finding this to be a better game than Beyond Earth for some of the following reasons:- The 8 major factions in the game are all very distinct and feel quite different from each other- There are 8 victory conditions vs. 5 in Beyond Earth (3 of which felt very similar)- Hero units that level up and equip items!- Quests that are more interesting, including unique quest lines for each faction - There is a market place where you can buy and/or sell resources, units and more heroes!- The UI contains a lot more information and there are tooltips on everything- Winter...brrrrrrr- $15 cheaper- And much, much more!!!If I could travel back in time and was forced to choose between Beyond Earth and Endless Legend knowing what I do now, I would go with Endless Legend hands down.  If you only have room in your life for one new 4X game this year, this is the way to go!			"

												1. The art is beutiful.2. The mechanics are easily understood...3. ...still complex enough to keep things interesting.4. It is a 4x game with a working diplomacy system.5. Each faction feels unique.6. The elevation system on the map is well executed and adds to the strategy component.7. Round-based fighting system.8. An interesting story line within the Endless universe.9. Even though it is a Civ V clone, it has its own uniqueness with the empire, region and minor faction mechanic.10. It has quests....and most importantly, it is a ton of fun!Update 2014/09/29There is one subjective downside for me: When the game ends, there is no nicely narrated and illustrated epilogue, just one graphic. Its a small detail, but if that would be added it would round the game up pretty nicely.			"

Excellent graphics, unique gameplay features that really make it different than Civ5 or CivBE and other games in the genre.  The quest system is great.  Character development with skills and gear is really well done.  In my opinion this game is much better than CivBE.			"

Early Access Review
								The first thing you'll notice about Endless Legend is that it is beautiful. There is so much detail in every aspect of this game that it doesn't matter if you're looking at the map, a city overview menu or staring at a loading screen, you will have something beautiful to gaze at.The game play is a fantastic blend of strategy games like the Civilization series and Lords of the Realm series. The map is laid out with hex-grid tiles filled with amazing beauty and detail. All having different qualities, terrain type, resources, anomalies and FIDS output (Food, Industry, Dust (money) and Science). Then the map is fractured into regions which, when settling a city, the player takes control of including any resources and Minor Factions that fall inside the regions borders. The Minor Factions are neutral creatures that, if left unchecked, will gain in strength and launch attacks on anyone near by. These factions can be attacked, bought out or parlayed with in order to pacify them. The player can then assimilate the faction of that region to gain useful bonuses to their empire.Combat goes beyond the Civilization unit verses unit battles. Combat is played out in a hex-grid turn based mini game inside the actual game itself. Allowing for far greater strategy involved in the battles, as a weaker army may lure a stronger army into terrain that will be an advantage for them.There are other aspects and features in Endless Legend that are pretty much on par with other games of this nature, building structures in cities needs little explaination, as does researching new technologies. Though one very interesting feature is the way cities 'grow'. The player is able to chose where to build expansions to their cities by building a certain structure. The area gained by the completion adding to the cities over all FIDS output.Then you have the different Races. If you have at all played Amplitude Studios other great strategy Endless Space, you will undoubtably know they have a knack for creating fantastic and interesting Races, with different strengths, weaknesses, play styles and stories. Endless Legend goes a step further, with some Races having entirely unique playstyles to others. For example, one such faction has no food output what so ever, instead Dust (or money) is used to 'buy' population for their cities. Slow at first, but an economic player will find that they can quickly become very industrious. Then there is a Race that CANNOT be at peace with anyone. They can remain in the 'cold-war' state OR go to war with everyone they meet because their units gain strength and power the more players you are at war with. Needless to say, i was amazed with Endless Legend. For the price you can not go wrong, assuming you are into turn based strategy games. It is beautiful. It is different and feels unique. It is easily worth every single cent it's modestly asking for.Endless Legend. Legendary...			"

Early Access Review
								EL was worth playing since its initial passage in early access, nowwith all the improvements made, I think it might be useful to review it and explain why, if you like 4X, you will be in for a treat with this game.Warning : long read ahead.While EL is set in the fantasy world of Auriga, players of Endless Space won’t feel too disorientated. You start out with military units, a settler, and explore your surroundings to find if it is suitable for the cornerstorne of your future empire.Like Civilization, if it is not to your taste, you might want to start over. One minor complaint here : there is no “regenerate world” feature.Unlike Civilization though,  you won’t battle for borders. Why so ?Because here you own one region (the map is divided in a number of regions depending on its size) of the map by having a sole city in it.The catch is that you can only have one city in a region. A nice tweak, inducing interesting aspects :- You don't need tons of cities, an empire with four regions is already considerable, wich makes the game more streamlined, but not less rich in possibilities.- More than ever, you need to colonize fast and carefully. Sometimes, it will be be better just to leave alone a region. - Cities can grow. At the beginning, they only take the six hexes surrounding them, but you can build districts on one hex to exploit up to three more hexes. So it can be a decent tradeoff to colonize a barely average spot in order to grow to better but “badly” placed spots. You will find a wide array of anomalies, grantind diverse bonuses.The base ressources are the same as in Endless Space : FIDS (Food, Industry, Dust, Science) where the dust is like gold, only with mystical properties. In Civilization, you use your units of population to exploit tiles or to become specialists.Here, the system is different and, in my humble opinion, more interesting : you can allocate any number of population to one of the FIDS, in order to boost its output.Of course, various buildings will enhance the FIDS production, giving greater bonuses. It allows you to perfectly balance the production for the current needs, on a macro or micro scaleWhen you start, you will be interested in a quick population growth, if you’re at war, boosting the industry might be needed, if one of your cities becomes idle for a lack of interesting things to produce, why not allocating most of the citizens to produce dust, or influence ?The thing is that influence can't exactly be harvested and only be gained via buildings and some quests. Influence dictates what you can do in two ways : diplomacy and empire plans.Every diplomatic action (treaties, technologies exchange, trading...) requires influence points to be done. So no nasty stuff like capturing a city very early game, you must have enough influence to declare war. And if you feel like accepting a truce just to viciously attack again, know that the cost in influence will go up the roof !So, you need to think carefully about spending your precious influence, wich is not as easilygained as FIDS, but not less precious. What about the empire plan ? It is a bonus, that can be decided every 20 turns (on a normal speed game) in one to four disctint areas. For example, the first bonus in the economic area grants +3 dust for each population unit. Of course, the more advanced the bonus and the more bonuses you choose, the more influence points you have to spend. It’s not permanent- you can change each time, and might have to because the cost goes up and must paid again if you want to keep the boosts. It allows a nice flexibility (having +4 movements obviously helps in time of war !), wich makes up for the absence of an Ideology feature.Endless Legend also shows its fantasy side with the quests. It is a nice touch, each faction having its own main quest, with background and rewards each time you complete a step. The different factions are nicely differenciated, be it “RP” and “GP : the Broken Lords are souls living on in suits of armor, vying to find a more noble purpose than to feed on mortals, they do not need normal food anc produce more dust than others (the only way to make their population grow is to spend dust), the Wildwalkers are  tribes united in organic-like cities, able to sense any ennemy in their regions, the Roving Clans cannot declare war, but have trading buffs and can use privateers to attack others, unbeknownst to them, etc.The custom faction feature is not implemented yet, but the seven factions available are enjoyable.For now, I would just say the Necrophages may be weaker thant the rest (-1 food on every hex doesn’t help) and the Drakken are a bit overpowered, with an easy way to the Diplomatic victory.While I’m at it, the victory conditions are the usual ones - wonder, science, conquest, domination, economical. In addition to main quests, you can discover sidequests by exploring ruins on the map, with various benefits, like luxury ressources (spending a certain number of it gives a temporary boost to your whole empire), dust, equipment.The heroes are back, and most useful to lead armies. No gigantic battles : you cannot design units, each faction has no more than 4 unit types, and the maximum number of units in one army is 8- and you can only achieve that late game !So, early on, two armies of four units each is a serious threat. I found the battle long and boring, the autoresolve works fine most of the time. Just be wary not to engage a battle in a difficult spot, like down a cliff... Heroes can also  beappointed as governors, wichever you choose, they will gain XP, levels and abilities to make them better warleader or city managers (bonus for units’ defense, boost in industry production...). Pacifists  will strive to keep a decent army : roving armies are loose, threatening cities. As bribing minor faction villages becomes costy, one solution is to just raze them, then rebuild to get +1 population, and if you assimilate them (through influence points), you will get their unique unit and a special bonus. Each region can have between one and three minor faction villages, and it’s useful to deal with the ones just outside your borders, the longer they stay unchecked, the more dangereous they are.One last “big” thing in EL is seasons. Summer is the “normal” season, while during winter, food and dust production are crippled, industry is slightly paralyzed, people are less happy, movement and vision on the map are greatly reduced. You only have a rough indication as to when the season switch will happen, but this must befactored in : if you’re planning a war, doing so in winter will be rather... Unpleasant.Well, I think that covers most of it. You can see the lacking parts (two technological eras are lacking) but you have the main meat.Of course, there are problems. Early game, you can only have few influence points. Luxury ressources aren’t such a big deal. Mayhap too many technologies are devoted to gear (4 for each era) knowing that their impact is far less noticeable than, for example, having +2 slots in your armies. For now, my main gripe would be with the AI. I know it’s in development, but after seeing ES' AI in action I am a bit worried. On normal difficulty you stomp your foes, and even on hard the AI is fairly incompetent : slow to colonize, quite behind technology-wise, having troubles fending off the roving armies in its regions, most of the time unable to muster serious forces... Plus, witnessing cities placed in a corner of a region  or in mediocre spots is a bit jarring.Well ! I have to thank  you if you kept reading till this point, if you are still on the fence, I do not know what to write. EL, albeit not totally complete as of now, is a very solid 4X with some really interesting twists for the genre. I would say it is superior to ES, wich I find enjoyable but bland compared to Galactic Civilizations II.			"

												Possibly the best fantasy 4x strategy game out there right now. I look forward to any additional content that makes it into this game. More races would be a blast. True depth adds to the replayability. Rather than 30 units that are all approximately analogous to those of another player, each race has 3 distinct units that can be kitted out to fill a variety of specialty niches. The aesthetic is warm, smooth, and a sight for sore eyes when it comes to the 4x genre. The art is there. If you like turn based games at all, strategy, tactical, or even rpg, Endless Legend will give you hours of quality entertainment.			"

There are tons of things to read, to learn, to explore the world, and you want to do it because the game engrosses you with its music and history and visuals.This is a game to play on a Sunday evening while it is raining outside, with your cup of tea or coffee next to you, and simply relax.

												The game is very well made, one can se the deveoper have made his best to create a great game, however, even though this is a very nice game indeed, I feel things could have been better, one thing I think could have been much better is the battle system, I feel this is dumbed down, and there isn't much tactics in it from the players point of view, you can chose from defencive, offencive stance and thats about it, then the computer carries out the strategy against the enemy and all you do is aiming, this really takes away the tactical strategy from the player, it does not allow him to think for him self and attack in different angles, attack flanks etc, so in that sense it is dumbed down, after some time doing that over and over again, you will get boored, I would have loved it a lot better if there where a simular battle system to the one ages of wonder 3 have, further, I think the graphics of this game is over rated, it is played on a hexagon map with very rough edges, the montains don't look like montains at all, more like a more modern version of Minecraft, other than that, it hava a good dept to city building and research. overall I do recommend this game, it could have been better but I guess you can't have everything.

								I like where this is going.A mash up of Heroes of Might & Magic (exploring with events and minor factions to subdue/bribe/help, your heroes are in the battles, they have an inventory, skills...Units also have skills and spells), Civilization (hex movements for exploration and battles, resource production values depending on the tile you're on...) and Endless Space (tech tree divided on 4 categories, allowing you to do heavy specialization, the possibility to choose the way you'll gear your units, to deal more damage, get more defense, change the initiative score...).OST is already pretty good.If you want to buy it at the time of writing, be careful, there's no tutorial yet. So don't be afraid to do one or two games to learn and experiment.			"

								On its way to take over the Throne of 4x genra since MoO2 and Falls from Heaven.Early access is very clean although it lacks content (only 4 factions from the 8 announced). If you're 4x addict, I suppose it would not hurt if you buy to support devs.If you liked Falls from Heaven, I can hardly picture how you can be disapointed with this game.What you will not see in EL are Wonders; as of yet, there is no great calamities befalling the world.What is new with this 4x?Tactical fights.If you dreamt of a very solid and deep 4x with really distinctive races featuring tactical combat: this is the game.Tactical combats are not as good as, say, Age of Wonders tactical combats; but they are still very satisfying with a lot of active capacities (heal, stun, aoe, poison, debuffs, buffs...) and passive (block, charge, swiftness...)What is missing?I already mentioned it, and it is the biggest con of the game for me right now: no Wonders and no calamities.

First I have to say it's the best 4x game I ever played ! !Second I have to say sorry about my comments to people that are in other opinion about Endless Legend. I'm absolutely sure they never did get it, to understand the game mechanics...That leads me toThird The ingame explanations (tooltips) are not as informative they should be. It's absolutely necessary to get additional informations from gameguides. Me myself played many months Endless Legend, but I'm far away from ""pro-gaming"".Fourth If you want to play single player only, the AI is not a kind of challenge in late game. But you can make it much more difficult by changing difficulty level and map settings before starting map. I have to admit, that the AI was improved in many ways after last patches. I'm sure there will be more patches (but not as soon, because the developers are concentrating their ressources on ""Endless Space II"" at the moment). If you want to have a challenge, play multiplayer (with experienced players...) instead of single player. It's like in very game, humen are the real challenge. I see single player as ""training"" for multiplayer, to get an idea of the basic game mechanics.Fifth You should visit the official Endless Legend Forum and post every question about game (technical, gameplay, etc.) there. The community is very nice and really helps fast and professional. The admins answer very soon (not the weekend...), what I can't say from most forums...link is here: https://www.games2gether.com/endless-legend/forum/8-helpSixthThe game is not a kind of: ""I play for two hours and finish it !"" It's 4xgame...Seventh If you want to have an idea of the gameplay-dimensions from Endless Legend, you must have a look at the game guide from ""Jojo_Fr"". He's a ""pro-gamer"" (crazy guy^^) that wrote a gameguide which is really impressive:link: 


Advanced mechanics and Competitive multiplayer (Any expansions including Tempest) 
A Guide for Endless Legend
By: Jojo_Fr

			Update : The expansions Shifters (Allayis) and Tempest (Morgawrs) are not included. The guide does not include Shifters and Tempest expansions features.		


Conclusion:Pro:* random maps* multiplayer (up to 8 players)* many different factions (in basic game 8) what leads to very specialized and absolutely different gameplay from game to game (one more faction from ""Shadows""-DLC and one more faction with next DLC ""Shifters""). Look here: http://endlesslegend.gamepedia.com/Endless_Legend_Wiki* lovely fantasy setting/-graphics* really good support and communication from devs and engaged community* different tech trees from different factions* different diplomacy options, depending on chosen faction* really good fighting system (if you know what you are doing...)* weapon and armor upgrades, pushing items for city-governors* ""missions"" you can get from ruins on map* you can specialize heroes to city-governor and/or to general* heroes got special skill trees* you decide, if you want to pacify or fight the minor factions (unless you are allowed to parley/pacify... by tech research and/or chosen faction)- strategical and other ressourcesetc.Contra:* you need time to play Endless Legend (especially in multiplayer)* your partner/family could leave your life... (did not happen to me^^)* the ingame tooltips/instructions explain max. about 20% you should know about gameplay... it's necessary to get informations from gameguides and/or official forum* later in game (playing larger maps with about 6+ players) the game tends to disconnect sometimes (online game). Reload autosaves (often two or three rounds before) does help (and very useful is to have a look at official game forum about technical game optimization)* fantasy game setting (if you don't like fantasy)* no linux version (but possible to play on linux, by using additional programs, look official forum for info about)* if you play multiplayer game, containing ""pro-gamers"", you realize you know nothing about game, even after months of excessive gaming^^ this can be very frustrating...I hope the people that wrote bad reviews about game will find back to Endless Legend, by ""studying"" the links above. It's worthy, but in parts really work...Hope we will see one day in Endless Legend multiplayer, as long as I have time for...For people thinking about to buy the game, use google, bing or whatever to find best price for...P.S. Edited the link to new game forum			"

Posted: February 5, 2015
												After the disappointment for me thta was Endless Space, I picked up Endless Legend with a  bit of trepidation: I had picked up a lot of fantasy 4x games recently (Eador, Age of Wonders 3, Warlock 1 and 2, there's been a lot lately...), but I'd heard great things about Endless Legend. Plus it was on sale.Glad I picked it up. It's easily been the bes tof the lot for me, and a lot of my issues with Endless Space are either not present or solved here.Endless Legend is a fantasy 4x game where you play as one of 8 distinctly different playing races, trying to complete one of many victory styles (Score, Economic, Diplomatic, Science, Supremacy, Elimination, Expansion, Wonder). Each race has its own array of traits and units, and you can also make Custom Races based on the foundation of one of the main races, creating something you'd enjoy playing the most. The races range from diplomatic Drakken (dragon people who can enforce diplomatic treatises), to fast expanding Zerg style bug-men (unable to use diplomacy, Cold War is the best you cna hope for), to Broken Lords (who dont't use food, instead using Dust [Gold] to create new population and heal units!), to the Cultists of the Eternal End (who are a ""Single City Challenge"" civ, unable to settle new cities, but can convert minor civs [city-states, for civ 5 players] to their cause, creating more worked tiles and free units.)The game plays out like most 4x games, on an overworld map, where you deal with thing slike happiness, luxury and strategic resources, making new towns, researching tech, exploring, etc. Endless Legend adds heroes to the mix, which do the usual things you'd expect. They can be made governors of cities, or generals of armies, and will level upa and learn skills to make them better at these things. Endless Legend also uses ""Regions"" to compartmentalize the map and show where you can place cities. Since only one city can be in a region, you find yourself competing for distinct places on the map, rather than a nebulous ""this area by the iron and 2 diamonds"". It lends theme to the game. Cities also develop interestingly: Rather than a simple influence array that increases, you build physical additions to your city, Boroughs, that will expand the circle of worked tiles. A larger city actually takes up half a dozen tiles or more on the map, which give sit a pysical presence, both out of combat and in combat (more on this in a bit). Building tightly packed cities also levels up your districts, making your cities happier and even more efficient. You cna also find special ruins around the mpas thta will give you quests to perform, giving direction to your expansion actions, and rewarding you for completing them. Minor civs also give quests as one way to pacify them, the other methods being bribing with money, ror simply defeating them.Combat in the game plays out like a middle ground of Age of Wonders/HoMM and Civ. Your armies enter battle, you cna give commands, but your units will perform the command sthemselves, moving and positioning how they please and then firing. Their AI takes over via a player-set stance (Aggressive, Defensive, Hold Ground) if your desired action can't be performed.  The AI is competent in this, and generally tries to keep ranged units in cover and uphill, and flanks and surrounds with melee units, buffing with support units. A human can generally do better, of course, but the AI is good enough to where you never feel like you need to really worry, which is nice. Auto-resolve is also there, of course. A neat thing I enjoyed aobut the combat is that the battlemap is actually the overworld map itself, overlaid into a combat grid, meaning a chokepoint or defensible area on the overworldmap is actually a chokepoint in battle.Talking about combat leads into units... Eahc civilization has three units, but each unit can be equpped with several types of weapon, armor, and accessories, allowing you to customize counter units as needed. Strategic resources are used to create extra-powerful, specialized weapons and armor at the cost of consuming these resources for your elite units.  Minor Civs (city states) can be assimilated into your empire to allow you to create their unit as well, like axe weilding minotaurs, spear using centaurs, chain lightning blasting Haunts, and massive skeletal demons. You can also purchase mercenaries from the marketplace from other civs: Any unit you disband or sell actually oes to the market, where it can be bought by any other player in the game. Unfortunately the marketplace is EXTREMELY expensive for units and heroes, and I found that unless I was playing the trade focused Roving Clans or the money-loving Broken Lords, I mostly ignored the market.Victory Conditions are hit or miss for me. Most of the non-combat ones feel ""boring"". -Score is score. Highest wins. -Diplomacy simply relies on an invisible ""diplomacy points"" counter, where you get extra points for being at peace or an alliance. There's no United Nations, no Apostolic Palace, no civs to influence. It falls a bit short. -Economic victory is much the same - once a player passes a threashhold for total dust gathered across the entire game, they win. Nothing to do with trade routes or global markets or resources.-Science victory relies on researching 5 of the 6 ""super techs"" in the game. To be fair, not much else you can do with a science victory, especially when your ""space race"" victory style is tied up in...-Wonder victories. This is the hallmark victory of the game. Every race has a unique 8 part questline that,as you complete, gives you special race specific techs, unique buildings, hero items, and in some caes heroes themselves. When you complete the questline, you are able to build a unique Wonder that, when completed, gives you victory. Some questlines seem inherently easier to complete than others, and some come off as contradictory: For example, the Roving Clans, a race thta actually cannot declare war themselves (only defend) must conquer another city, often far away and already held by an opponent. You must then passive aggressively annoy the other civ into finally declaring war on you first. The Drakken, a race of peaceful lorekeepers, must also do the same, although here you cna at leats declare war yourself. These are a few small places where the lore of the game and the mechanics don't quite seem to mesh, and it's a shame, because a LOT of work clearly went into this victory.-Expansion victories rely on you colonizing a certain percentage of the entire map. I cannot possibly fathom doing this on even the middle sized maps, or rather: Cannot comprehend doing it without already having wiped out the entire rest of the game militarily. Your happiness would plummet so low it hardly seems worth it to expand that much.-The military victories are the usual lot. Supremacy is being the last civ with a Capital City, and Elimination is the complete destruction of all others.Things the game does not do well: Aside from the victories above, this game maintains a few of the Endless Space oddities that I dislike. Many diplomatic actions are tied up in the tech tree, taking up valuable science from researching thing slike, say, science boosts, or food, or dust, or strategic resource extractors. The market, both resource and unit (thye are separate techs) are also techs, and I find myself ignoring the market in almost eveyr game that I don't start with it as a free tech. It's a shame, really. I also do not often find myself researching the unique strategic resource weapons and armor techs unless I'm the Vaulters, a race that gets bonuses both to their collection, and for units using the Resource Weapons.I would, even with these minor complaints, recommend picking up the game for any fan of th 4x genre.

												The first impression of the game is amazing. The art style is truely beautiful, the map remind me of the title footage of HBO's Game of Thrones, all unit designs are unique. The sound track is also epic and emotional. Overall, the first moments of this game is truely magical.However, after the first few hours the flaws of this game began to show. First of all the AI is totally passive, after two or three hours of gameplay you don't see them interact with you in any way or try to invade you even if cities are completely undefended. There are a few ruins for you to explore but all I get is some meh money or nothing at all, that makes the game extremely dull. Finally I got bored and decided to invade the AI instead, and they are complete a push-over that makes me wonder what exactly they've been doing in all along? I've played many 4x games and this is definitely the dullest of them all. I'd recommend Civ series or Age of Wonders instead.You can wait a few more months and give it try when they patch up the AI enough, but until then I can't truely recommend this game.			"

												Honestly, the best 4X game I've ever played.  You don't get sucked down by complicated rules and the game has such variety that it allows you to play many different ways.  With the recent bug fixes, the game is very polished.  The art is beautiful and the quests/stories are interesting.  Playing with the AI can become a decent pasttime, but if you can get several friends into this, it is hugely entertaining.The assymetrical balance of the factions really provides a meaningful playstyle but certainly does not limit you on your goals.  The combat CAN appear a bit dated, but where it lacks in execution, it makes up for in alternatives.  There are several other features that I find unique to EL that have not been done in 4X before but I will leave spoilers out for the sake of new players.I first saw this game on the store page earlier in the year and it caught my interest.  The only game I was exposed to at the time from Amplitude was Dungeon of the Endless and I appreciated the classic dungeon-style gameplay.  At some point, I decided to take a chance with the purchase and was left astonished at what an accomplishment this game was.Please take the time to play this game!  There is surely one or two appealing things I'm sure will keep bringing you back to this game should you choose to buy it.			"

												Of course if you do NOT like 4x strategy games don't listen to me telling you that you should be playing this game.Although it is a game that will definitely MAKE you  love 4x strategy games. It's colourful, arty world, filled with awesome creatures, beautifully rendered and immersive gameplay. Yeah: research, but this time you really know why you would want to research something instead of just clicking something that will probably be ok, but god knows if it would be  the right choice for this very moment. And yeah: conquering, but the fight system is refreshing and well thought out, high on tactics, as it should be.  And yeah: managing: This game has THE single most comprehensive management system I've seen in a long, long (eh.... Heroes of might and magic 3???) time. In other words: Endless legend has it all:  Choices that have an impact the way you thought it out, fights that are really interesting, a world full of loveable and intense creatures, tactical choices all around to keep you busy, but the info needed to make those choices is readily availlable and comprehensive.  So if you don't like 4x strategy games you could be forgiven for not playing this, but you would be a fool nevertheless.			"

Posted: September 5, 2016
												This is one of those situations where the a-typical steam system of ""Thumbs up or thumbs down"" doesn't really work. This game isn't made badly, and I would recommend it to some people. But overall, this game was vastly overblown and overrated, at least from a strategic point of view.1. Graphics were ok, but not great. I did really like the artwork and the way the world looked, but it has a lot of tearing and graphical issues. Nothing so sevre it will ruin the game, but enough to note.2. Music was actually pretty cool. It's always nice to hear a new soundtrack instead of hearing songs I know I heard on my PS2 games. This was easily the best part of the game.3. Story for the game, while well written, is delivered poorly. It's 2016; time to actually record voice tracks and make cut scenes, not just constantly throw text boxes at us. This is a common complaint in multiple genres, and it outright confuses me why this games community is so forgiving. The bland delivery prevents any of the stories from feeling different.4. Gameplay is a strange thing to me. I WANTED to enjoy it. I put effort into learning this game and really tried to see the joy, but every campaign ultimate leads to the same place. Difficulty settings have huge curves between them. Easy is boring, normal is unforgiving. After hours of research, I found that most who are good at this game A. Copied someone elses strategy and B. Save scummed to hell. The difficulty is not provided by clever AI who utilize the rules of this game and world, but rather they get military and economic buffs.I ran two campaigns that had a 6th faction (I was playing against 5 comps) screw everything. The game was actually fun for the bulk of the campaign. I had cool wars, overcame adversity, and when I was almost crushed outright, I managed to claw my way back and win. It was a blast... until I encountered the bug faction. They had not warred with anyone, yet had higher level troops. They had NONE of the higher end resources (not even tier 1), so how they controlled so much and could have so many while producing so little was beyond me. By the end of the campaign, he overran us with much larger armies (this faction got 14 per army to all the rest of us having 8) and crushed the campaign. It wasn't fun or interesting, it was aggitating. I don't mind losing to a strong opponent. But this is supposed to be a strategy game, how does having no resources or battles result in better armies? This is evidence that tactics and actual strategy do not come into play here. Resource domination and harassment is a very common tactic in games and even IRL, so why it is almost meaningless in this game is beyond me.5. Combat is TERRIBLE. The battle system is a bad minigame by any other games standards. If you have ever played Sid Meir's Pirates and invaded a city, you experienced a better battle system. Most mobile games are better. The strategies are all based on bad mechanics, and the AI will exploit these bad mechanics to force troops to follow them in a mosh pit style circle. Almost anything would have been better than this.Honestly? I did have some fun with this game. But the last third of every campaign I played turned an otherwise enjoyable game for me into a burden or a chore. I WANT to like this, and I want to recommend it. That's ultimately what frustrated me so bad about this game. My desire to enjoy it was smothered by bad campaign structure.And I would actually recommend this to people of a certain taste. I have friends who love games that are extremely time consuming and daunting, and I'm sure they would enjoy it. But for gamers of my taste and desire, this game is not going to provide you the tactical planning and strategic objectives you're looking for.In closing, I know this review will be receiving a 0% helpfulness rating. For some strange reason, the X4 genre can produce pure garbage (not nessicarily this game, but I'm referring to others) and never receive an ounce of criticism. It's a strange enigma, that's for sure.I wrote this review as best I could to avoid complaining and simply try to warn gamers of my taste not to buy it because it will not provide an experience they will enjoy. Right now, I'm sure there's someone like me who's more about tactics > micromanagement looking at purchasing this game, and the reviews for this game are extremely misleading in this regard. Do yourself a favor if you're looking at this game, do more research than you would for the average video game, because this game isn't a clear cut case of universal appeal.In the end I will resist rating this by Good/Bad or by 1-10/10. It's not that simple. It's actually a good game that's well constructed, I just think it's being marketed to a vast number of people who are just not going to like it. I'd like to help those individuals spend their money on something they will actually enjoy.			"

												This game has potential and has a lot going for it... but I can't recommend it.Pros:-An amazing world with lots of unique minor/major factions, creatures, improvements, technology and terrain-Nice graphics, the game just looks really nice. The world art has a ""Game of Thrones"" feel to it.. and it isn't over done. Seems to fit well and looks great.Cons:-Pacing. The game is incredibly slow. I have started a few games and other factions pretty much never attack. On top of that it is difficult to ramp up your economy to field an army. I found my self restarting or quiting games because my one and only Army would get wiped out by neutrals (which are very aggressive). -Unit Variety. Each faction gets 3 units. Sure you can create and upgrade units but they all look the same and only vary slightly. Compare this to the unit creation in Fallen Enchantress (for example) where you can make virtually any unit you wanted AND change the colors of their clothing. Also there only seems to be ""damage"" not broken down to different types (fire, shock, cold, etc).... in fact the entire unit creation seemed very tacked on and shallow.-Bugs. Lots and lots and lots of crashing. Especially after about 30 turns or so. The long a game is the more frequent crashes occur.In conclusion the game has an amazing world and some good art direction but the game play is fairly pedestrian. The AI seems weak and bland, with aggressive factions just wondering around (seriously even the corspe-eaters didn't attack). The more I played the more I found myself just playing to see how I could build up a city or exploit a resource... or just explore the world while my neighbors just flounder around. I guess that might be ok but it just gets incredibly boring.Don't buy this game until it gets more fleshed out or the price comes down.  "

Review :Very pleasant 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate), with a rich & original background lore, solid gameplay & visuals, Endless Legend is not without serious flaws. The main one being the lack of intensity, as about 2 third of the game is waiting for the AI turns, animations of our armies, or slow scrolling speed. Moreover half of time spent playing is used to do & re-do the same things over and over again in each of all our cities.It is nonetheless a solid experience, especially for the casual strategist player, that will find plenty to do & discover !Pros :- Mesmerizing visuals- Good tutorial, offering an almost complete overview of the game- Quests, including a quest line different for each faction, give a story feeling to the campaigns (might get repetitive when you replay with the same faction though)- Some factions bring significant gameplay changes- A tons of buildings for our cities- Easy & efficient political system- Heroes for armies & cities, which brings an extra layer of management & optimization- Small villages to conquerCons :- AI turn is too slow on my I7@4ghz- Scroll speed is too slow and it can't be changed (in a 2014 game, really ?!? :-| )- Your armies are animated when moving and it's damn sloooow and there's no fast-move option- City management is horribly repetitive when you have several cities, as there's not enough difference between cities, so you just mostly follow the same planning over & over again- Lack of choices to make : at least on normal difficulty, you can own everything and get all victory types without aiming for them in the early game- A lot of micromanagement is required to maximize your empire efficiency ; eg: you constantly need to check your cities to be sure to balance the best time between the next production and the next increase of population (which you can determine by assigning each unit of your city population to food or building production)- Most (or all?) city improvements can't be seen in the 3D worlds (you can see only city extensions)- Basic combat system : yes, you can configure your army gear and it feels nice at 1st ; but when looking at the whole picture, it's just a power race without noticeable strategy nor tactic- You have 2 choices of combat : automatic resolve or turn-based battle in a small 10x10 hexa region ; automatic option has 0 strategy (just be sure to be the one who has brought the biggest guns ;-) ), and the battle is really very basic and not much exciting once you did it a few times (plus it's super slow)- Predefined regions which can contain only 1 city each ; this refrains empire building freedom and gives a similar feelings to all the campaigns- I got a faction quest-line broken because I was supposed to talk to a village leader, but as the village had already been conquered by an AI, I didn't have the talk option anymore >_<Ranting :Finally, an ""Endless"" game I actually enjoyed ! :-PI gave a negative vote to the 2 other ones (Space & Dungeon), and it's funny to see that _all_ of my cons from my Endless Space review have been addressed in Legend..! :)If you got enough of Endless Legend and you're looking for something deeper with hard choices, I'd deeply recommend you to try Civilization 4 Complete Edition, which is still for me the best 4X ever made... :-)			"

Strong strategic combat elements, polished presentation, unexpected depth of game options (large-screen GUI, tile geometry, etc.) I think this is right up there - perhaps beyond - the Civ:CTP series as far as new concepts and how it can influence the genre.

												A fantasy turned based Civ-themed strategy. It has a large emphasis on research and development to build and expand your empire, along with a linear diplomacy engine. Capturing provinces are eitherby force or negoiation (which is usually in the form of a side quest). The game however fails in the combat sequences where it lacks depth to decison making and overall turn by turn strategy towards tactical control. I hope the developers look into this and update the flawed combat system as the game has true potential with its already polished look.Civ fans will enjoy this game whilst Might & Magic fans may not.

												Easily the greatest 4x I've played in a very long time.The factions are all truly unique and complex, and aren't just a single mold with a unique building or unit here or there. Want something a little different? Try the Broken Lords, whose population is conjured with resources instead of grown, and produce no food themselves. Or try the Forgotten, who can't research, but can only advance technology from trade, purchase, or (best of all) grand theft. Or try playing as the Cult of the Endless and see how you faire with only being able to build a single city. You have a lot of options here.The amount of support the devs have shown after launch is phenomenal, and their creativity is bottomless. I thought they had pretty much expended their ideas after the Shadows expansion, and now we have the Allayi... This game breathes atmosphere, and each faction has its own reasons for wishing to save/exploit/destroy Auriga. The lore is interesting, as are the multitudes of minor factionsA warning, though. The combat isn't bad, but it is certainly a little wonky. It seems to be a make-or-break system for a lot of people, but it's quite interesting if you can get the hang of it. Initiative is key. :)Secondly, the AI is pretty dumb. It's good to cut your teeth on, but after a while you'll grow tired of its lack of tactics. There are some factions (The Forgotten in particular) that I don't feel it actually knows how to play at all. Bring your friends. Stomp through them together. Or stomp each other. The diplomacy system is very well put together, and doesn't feel tacked-on to fill out a checklist like it seems in many others of its type, so you can use it to your full advantage.Thirdly, the quest system is a little tiresome. After one long game, you probably won't be seeing any you haven't already seen the next time you play. It would be nice to have many more to enhance variety in individual play-thrus. Also, the addition of large-scale, world-changing events is cool, but they also lack variety. Once you know them all, you'll simply be waiting for them to happen again, and they will. Enjoy seeing Minor Faction, Major Pain pop up in every game you play, and hopefully not too early in it ;)A few minor gripes aside, there's an amazing game in here with endless (get it?) replay value. I've never had a 4x hold my attention for so long. Huuuuuge recommendation.			"

												Visually stunning, Endless content & replayability and the best competitor to the Civ line of strategy games I've seen! I was blown away from the moment I entered the game (Not something that happens often). I was expecting a game similar to Civ but discorvered something vastly different in a good way. The tutorial is a must to go through as some controls (and gameplay) will take getting used to for people who've played a lot of Civ, but it's well enough set out to help you learn the very basics. After that you have all the customisation options you could want before you even enter the game, in fact the best way to describe it all is in a list:Map and Game setup: All the usual customising options are there plus advance settings to more finely tune the worlds you play on.Civs: The ""presets"" are all well done, very unique and full of character. These can be personally customised as well in many different ways.Units: Limited in a way as each civ only has a handful to directly build. But as the game progresses you'll be able to integrate many different types of ""minor"" civ units into your armies as well as customising their gear & weapons!Heros: Customisable and can be leveled for further power as generals or city managers.On top of what you can customise is a sprawlling city building mechanic letting you build super cities, a DLC expansion adding loads of content to the seas (fully utilizing the entire map!), a huge range of quests to play, a semi-linear tech tree (you don't need all the base techs to get to the next tier unlike civs tech tree, but still progress from starting to top tier) and a battle system that both stacks your units and allows them to battle tactically across the landscapes.If you can't tell by now I'm very impressed and highly recommend this game (a steal when it's on any special above 50%). :)			"

 -- Positives:  Clear interface and a lot to discover. Very interesting tech tree to explore, in which you are encouraged to follow a route of specialisation rather than knowing everything.There apears to be little unit variarty untill you find that the weapons you equip change the unit in a fundemental way. Complement your nation's weakness by asimilating a minor faction into your empire, thus getting their unit. A very interesting battle map which has a very intriguing way of auto resolving. It actually plays the battle out as if the AI was commanding your army. All of the factions are asymetric. They'll overlap with on some areas but still do them in different ways. All factions have a unique city athstetic on a beautifully crafted map. Wild Walkers with their angular elf like structures that are almost always inside forests, Cultists have one huge city whose districs make a circle, always putting the emphasis (giving worship) to the city centre. The lore! The main questline of the major factions unlock unique technologies that are otherwise unatainable, and give you insight into the lore of a faction. After playing one faction for some time you can dream their lore, but for me it remains fun to read it every time. Minor factions will also offer questlines in return for the ocasional resource, technology and pacification (they join the city in their province, giving a population). -- Things to know (possible negatives)The combat map/system takes quite a bit of getting used to. It seems extremely counter intuitive at first and doesn't change much in single player after unlocking the 3 basic unit types and understanding what the differences types of equipment give and take from a unit. It also doesn't help that there is no way to understand the intricacies of control without manualy controling battles for a long time, while you will be tempted at first to just manualy resolve everything. You need to love experimenting. This is a 4X game and you have to love the core formulae beyond ""I once played a Civ game and didn't hate it"". Find out how all the different factions play out, try to change your playstyle when you find yourself doing the same thing over and over again. It's okay to have a favourite faction, but try a new one every once in a while.  -- Things for the next game to fix. The game heavily accelerates around turn 100, ussualy ending between 160 and 180 with the last 20 turns being extremely slow to the point where I think newer or more casual players will quickly lose focus. (But I am neither so what do I know D: ) Experiment with a difficulty setting that works for you, but keep in mind that higher on the AI will cheat heavily. (The Budget way to increase difficulty in strategygames !) Despite my earlier praise of the battle system, in late turns they do come down to biggest number wins. Heavily depending on your (RNG) success in questing, you will not see a change in unit setup after the midgame. Just better equipment and larger armies. You can of course, try experimenting with a strange unit setup to try and suprise/confuse the AI. A super tanky support unit that the AI likes to focus so much? Or maybe your Hero's abilities are now making your ranged units to shoot from an extra tiles away. There is still room to experiment, but the AI doesn't always make this required.  - - Recent mixed reviews:  Mostly by people not inherently understanding of the 4X genre or skill level concerns. Many people seemed to want to give the game a 'moderate' score rather than positive or negative (as they end up doing).  To each their own of course. Keep in mind that you need to like exploring the game, finding out how to challange yourself or what works for you. Read the lore of the factions, find how they all work. In conclusion, I love this game. Havn't loved a 4X game this much for a long time and I cannot wait to see what the company has learned going forward into Endless Space 2.			"

												Simply put, it's like Civ but...-The city management is much more interesting and complex. It's very cool imo.-The other empires are a bit less shoot first ask questions later and diplomacy is more interesting.-The art is a whole lot better and the lanscapes are more interesting.-The natural resources are more useful and varied, plus luxury resources actually provide a useful benefit instead of a static +4 happiness.-Minor factions are like city states but don't constantly have to be appeased, and they only provide their effect if you have colonized their region.-You can customize your units and create different versions for different purposes.-The combat system is fantastic. Instead of roaming units you have armies composed of units that actually have a strategic battle whenever they engage. It's a hyrbid between real time and turn based as the units attack in order of initiative. I wish I could choose things like move order or move then attack (like kiting with ranged units) but overall its a lot more interesting than Civ.-Empires feel more unique.There's a lot more I could have said about this game, but so far I'm loving it. If you enjoyed Civ 5, then this game is for you. It has a learning curve though, Every time I play I get a bit better but still haven't won. As an owner of both this and Civ 6, in my personal opinion this is more like what Civ 6 should have been.			"

												The graphic detail is really great and the factions are interesting.  My giving it a thumbs down comes from a couple of key issues.  1. The research options aren't as tactically linked as Civ 5, it's hard to see how your choices are going to offer you any andvantages over your rivals. 2. The way you seige a city  is frustrating, especially if the random army of two, seiges your heavily fortified city with troops and all, halting your production, but no clear way to attack them with any advantage.  Maybe I'm missing something? 3.  The diplomacy part, just seems wrong, you end up having to commit way too much resources to get anything in return, allies switch on a turn for little reason. 4. likely my biggest issue with the game, and maybe it's because of the CIV brainwash, but you don't really exploit tiles in the same way.  You get the whole land mass, your cities have limited growth and yes you can extract resources and so forth, but you just don't have control over the individual hexes.  Just could never feel that my decisions after a 100 turns was driving me to any specific strategic victory.  Yet the AI was getting close to a victory somehow.			"

Early Access Review
								If this is early access, the real thing is going to be legendary.  The Heroes are realistic yet fantastic.  The strat in the battle is different, allowing for RPG like customization of a simulated battle -  or just skip it!  The game allows the player to choose what parts they logistically plan for so they can opt to fast-forward.  The city planning makes more sense than most AAA strat games.  Civilization, take note:  this is how you build a GUI that makes sense.  The player can actually push other buttons whilst loading & be diplomatic.  The player spends far less time waiting and way more timeplanning & playing.    Amplitude is the studio to watch.  ALL of their alpha / betas are solid & already *well* worth their buy-in pricing.  The ""Endless"" series has great promise.  I discovered ""Endless Legend"" through ""Dungeon of the Endless,"" a sweet rogue, & subsequently purchased ""Endless Space,"" their 4x masterpiece.  All three are incredible games, offering countless hours of play with tons of variety.  I am quite happy to have all three in my collection.  If you want Early Access that gives you more game to test than you have time in your life, ""Endless Legend"" is an excellent choice.  If you want a good indie studio to support, AMPLITUDE is where it's at.			"

												What most people will be asking about this game is how similar it is to Civ and is it BETTER than Civ. Firstly, despite having many similarities in the type of game it is and the way it's played it is actually very different. Secondly, in my opinion it is a far better game. The rest of this review will try to explain why.The most obvious difference is that here you have a fantasy setting rather than a historical one - which you prefer will simply be a matter of taste.The first major positive is that you can level up heroes and give them progressively better equipment based on what you have researched. Standard units can also be upgraded in this way (through the edit unit feature). This is FAR more useful and interesting than the single purpose you can give generals/great architects etc in Civ.The second major positive is that the factions you can choose from are a lot more diverse and different in the way you go about playing each of them compared to the positives and negatives attached to factions in Civ. This gives more replay value whilst also making multiplayer more interesting. Attached to this diversification we have the fact that each faction has its own individual quest/mission thread making single player more varied by faction also.The unit types, whilst very different at a faction level, are quite limited. Some may find this a drawback in comparison with Civ but, personally, I find that it is more useful in both highlighting faction difference and STREAMLINING what you can produce during multi-player. Whilst this is true, you can also assimilate various minor factions (of which there are many) that may make extra unit types available to you meaning that armies will almost always be different even in games with multiples of the same faction.Other, non-battle related, research is also limited in comparison with Civ - the research trees here are much smaller. Again, this makes multiplayer more viable and streamlines the whole process.There ARE negatives associated with each of these improvements but also combat is more straightforward and less complex as is how you govern your cities. There is a lot less micromanagement in Endless Legend. Whilst this may be a big turnoff for dedicated Civ fans it will be a welcome difference for most players and, once again, aids in streamlining the game to make it viable as a multi-player experience.Overall I feel that whilst both games have merits and problems and neither are perfect, Endless Legend provides a more interesting experience in single-player due to faction difference, hero use, and quest lines. And Endless Legend's FOCUS and streamlining of research, production, and city management make it more viable for multiplayer. 82%			"

								I highly highly recommend this game to everyone who likes Civilization, Fallen Enchantress or any other 4X type games. Even if it is in early access it is already highly polished and oh boy it will be really great once everything is in game and rolling.

I simply love this gameI got this game a few days ago when I reached all my goals in Civ:BE (win all victory types and at least one on apollo). I am simply amazed. This studio really deserves the praise. The artwort is sooo beautiful. As a webdesigner I can say these are the most beautiful tooltips I have ever seen anywhere. Each one with nice concept art. The handling is also very good. I can´t believe I played a game for 6-8 hours without ever using the keyboard, just my mouse. I also love they didn´t take every single cliché from J.R.R. Tolkien and created something new and completely original such as the cultists. Each combat becomes interesting by using the actual world terrain unlike HoMM where you load into a combat screen. It gives each combat a new strategic variety.The only thing that turned me off at first was, when I saw some early alpha footage and saw the weird landscape geometry and the ugly fog of war. I thought this is a b-title, a Civ wannabe with no original concept. I was so wrong. I decided to give it a chance anyway and I don´t regret it. I wish the studio will make some money to be able to continue this new IP. Imagine if they had more money to spend on voice actors for the AIs and you get a nice voiced cutscene when you achieve a victory. Some time and money invested in something like a Civilopedia would also be nice. Also more money to spend on advertisement because this is truely a hidden gem more people should know about. This is a must have for every 4X lover.			"

												i love this game so much. i love that it's a lot like Civ V, but with more variety to the gameplay. you can turn off victory conditions you don't want, allowing you to focus on beating the game the way you want to. if you're playing as the necrophages (who can't do any diplomacy stuff) and want to focus on an economic or science based victory, you can. every single playable race can be customized from the full list of traits. do you like that the occultists can convert villages and wish the other races could do that too? well, they can. i also like that you can automate your entire empire or individual cities, allowing you to ignore late game micromanaging that so many people dislike. i agree with people that the combat gets repetitive after awhile-but the devs planned for that and put probably the best autocombat simulator i've ever seen in a game so that you'd wouldn't ever have to manually command a battle after the moment you got bored with it. you can also choose different battle strategies when you are about to do combat. you can choose from offensive, defensive, or hold position strategies-which is fantastic when you're sending archers into combat against melee units. often, they can win unscathed if they hold position. i just recently picked up the shifters dlc and the allayi (moth people), and i enjoy that they have what appears to be a new type of unit-flying. which suffers no movement penalties from terrain and adds to the list of unit types (archer, melee, calvary, support). i also recently got the lost tales dlc which added a whole mess of missions and lore to the game, further adding to the immersiveness and personality of the game. the shifters dlc combined with the lost tales really made me feel for the plight of Auriga. the world is so beautiful and varied in terrain types (speaking of-i like how elevation plays a role in movement during combat and also while roaming the world) and the amount of customization and control they give you over the various elements of the world. you can control how harsh the winter is, how big the regions are (regions are what split up the world-you can have one city per region), how tough the minor factions and their villages are to defeat (minor factions can also be bribed or you can do a quest for them to pacify them), and much more can be altered. i haven't played the Forgotten dlc/playable race much, but they add much more depth to the game by adding espionage and removing the ability (for the Forgotten, at least) to research technologies. the Forgotten can only buy or steal new tech. speaking of the technology, all races share the majority of the same technologies in each era (there are 6 research eras that are unlocked by researching 9 technologies from the previous era) but each playable race has it's own special techs that only they can unlock (unless you create your own customized race-then you can pick from the list of specialized techs). i also like that the technology can be unlocked in any order and you can select as many technologies are you want to create a research queue-a nice step up from Civ V's restrictive tech tree. everything produced is carried over to the next thing as well. what i mean by that is: your food production carries over to the next person after a new citizen is born, production left over from a building or unit is carried over to the next one, and science put towards a technology carries over to the next one in the queue.i don't have enough space to list all the great things i love about this game. i suggest getting the game with all the dlc you can get. each dlc adds plenty of new content to keep the game fresh. (i hope they add a dlc of a playable race, that doesn't use production, rather they buy or steal units/buildings somehow and add the Harmony from Endless Space who ignore Dust entirely-all the other resources (FIDS-Food, Industry, Dust, Science) have a race that largely ignores it and i think that would add even more depth/alternative gameplay to this game.

Sneak in with a secondary (or third army) and backdoor a few cities and boom, you're large and in charge. The game doesn't offer great depth as each race is pretty much a one trick pony.

												A great experience. Of course, Endless Legend couldn't escape comparisons with Civilization V, but, the more you look into it, the bigger the differences of the games are. And to my personal taste, Endless Legend proves to be more enjoyable due to bringing changes to an amazing structure of the genre as it is, yet not being afraid of introducing new mechanics that actually fit in amazingly well. + The game has its own lore, and it's interesting to say the least;+ Soundtrack is fantastic (but i do think that Civ's is better, a tough one to beat, honestly);+ While the number of playable nations is much smaller (10 against +40 (with DLCs)), the differences between each one of them provide the nations with completely different playstyles. Each of them has its own units (except for colonists), perks that alter your preferences entirely, abilities, some special technologies and visuals and even its own story to complete;+ Fantastic art style;+ RPG elements (that's how i call them anyways) are implemented just right. Quests, heroes, units customization with various items of equipment (weapons and shields are even visible), items have unique stats and even perks. All that just works fluently with strategy elements of the game;+ You get to play with DLCs if the host of the game owns them;? The introduction of a much deeper turn based combat system. It's kind of similar to Heroes of Might & Magic, King's Bounty etc. But it in a way it prevents allies interaction against their enemies and might ruin the flow of the game, i haven't decided myself yet;- Complete the tutorial and off you go! Not a big fan of that. I think they could've done a much better job of introducing all nations with some kinds of scenarios at least. Each nation has a 1 minute intro before the start of the game and main quest kind of helps you to understand what's going on, which is nice, but not enough;- Some of the games' mechanics still feel unpolished.Just try it.

												If you like the Civilization games, you'll love this one. For starters, the races in this game (as well as the other Endless games) actually feel unique. It's none of the old, this portrait has +20% bonus to offense, and this other portrait has +20% to defense. The Necrophages can consume dead enemies to increase their population. The Vaulters/Mezari can teleport from one town to the next. The Ardent Mages can create pillars (aka cast spells) to give bonuses to the terrain. The Broken Lords don't even use food, but instead consume dust (money) in order to increase their population. That's just a few examples, but each faction has something that the others don't.You can upgrade the equipment of both your heroes, and troops. Both of them also gain experience, and become stronger as they level up. Some games you can go the entire game, with the same two units you started with. If you upgrade their equipment right, your one army could potentially crush city after city. Likewise, the AI can do the same to you. There is an emphasis on quality over quantity in this game. Which I like. Gone are the days of micromanaging 300 units.Advanced technologies are unlocked through an Era system. Each Era is like unlocking a new block of technologies. You have to research a certain amount of technologies, before the next Era becomes unlocked. Now it's not a set amount from one Era to do that. For example, you don't need 9 Era II techs to unlock Era III. 18 techs overall will unlock the next Era. This is balanced by having the cost of researching a tech increase after every one you've researched. Unlocking the mercenary market might have been a 60 point cost at first, but by the fourth Era it costs thousands. It seems a bit weird, but it actually balances the tech progression nicely.Each faction has their own unique units. However, there are minor factions in every territory. If you conquer/pacify them and assimilate them, you can then create and customize their unique units the same way you can with your own. Combat itself is a slightly hands off approach. Once it's initiated, you can tell your units where to move, and who to attack. Once you've set up your plan for the turn, the AI plays it out one unit after the next. The unit with the highest initiative goes first, and it keeps playing out like that until the unit with the lowest initiative finishes its turn.The FIDS system (food/industy/dust/science) is pretty straightforward. Food feeds the population, industry speeds up city production, science speeds up research, and dust is money, you can't live without it. Cities have a Civilization like feel, where you can put the population in whatever area you're lacking in to boost production. You can also expand your cities by building the Borough Streets. Every tile provides some form of FIDS. So finding a good starting point for your city, and the right direction for expansion is key. The more tiles your city has, the more it counts against that city's morale. Trust me. Happy citizens are very productive citizens. Productive citizens are more important than a huge city.All in all, it's a great game IMO. The DLCs are definitely worth it, as they add a good deal of content to the game. Adding more to the winter phase, adding massive units known as guardians, more factions, espionage, building epic wonders, and even unlocking sea exploration and combat.  Maybe wait for a sale to snag them, because it does add up to more than the base game. The base game though still has a lot of replay value for those that want to wait for the DLC prices to drop.Plus, there are mods......			"

												Incredible turn-based empire building game. Sort of a fantasy Civ that doesn't follow the tired cliches we have seen a billion times (elves, humans, undead, green guys, etc). Art and design are very refreshing. The world map is beautiful. Gameplay is solid. Good level of challenge even without going into the high difficulties. Winter dynamic adds an interesting twist. The developpers seem to really care about their games and put a lot of effort into asking for feedback and applying it to the game design. Impressive considering they are a small studio.Some might find that the number of units per race is low (4 + heros)  but I guess its a design choice to keep it simple. On the other hand they can be customized.Highly reccomended. Must-play if you are a strategy or turn-based fan.			"

												If you're looking for another 4x strategy game but don't want another Civ game, I'd recommend checking this out. The playable factions are actually different enough to notice in this game, and the interesting military unit system brings a higher level of personal control over your armiesStarting off, the playable factions are amazingly unique from one another. One faction disregards food as a resource, instead using gold. One can only ever found a single city, and must rely on the small, AI controlled minor factions to expand their influence. Another has nomadic cities that can be picked up and placed elsewhere. The variety is incredibly refreshing, and the difference adds a lot of immediate replayabilityThe military upgrade system is quite different from Civilization. Rather than researching new units every few technologies, you instead research a few base models (4 per faction, one being a Settler and the rest being some combination of Melee, Ranged, Cavalry, Support, Flying, or Naval). You can then use strategic resources to develop more powerful equipment for these units and personally craft your forces. This can make early combat a bit of an uphill battle, but once you have all the technologies to start creating the new equipment, it really takes off. The feeling of having this much personal customization is great8.5/10			"

												Solid, difficult at first and pretty deep. Offers a wide array of play styles but the win conditions are split between wanting to role play (diplomacy, expansion) and wanting to win (economy, science, supremacy even). To clarify, getting a diplomacy win is possible, but everytime I wanted to win like that, I could've ended the game sooner if I had just gotten the last techs or just conquered the world. I just kept myself from beating that playthrough earlier just so I could win with diplomacy.The story elements are nice and interesting for casual players, but I feel that the game shines best when played in a bit of a min/max style. The great thing is, there are varied ways of winning through min/maxing, for example through science, industry, economy, military. Factions are varied and distinct, all offering a unique playstyle and overall quite inspired in my opinion. Playing with each faction is different enough to varrant several playthroughs and the dlc factions are on-par or even more interesting than the base factions.In regards to the dlc the main expansions (guardians, shadows, shifters and tempest) are well worth the money in my opinion. They add even more features and depth to an already good game (a good comparison would be civ V's Brave New World, which added new features to an already good game), and while not necessary I'd highly recommend them as the new factions and mechanics make the game more varied and interesting. For example, Tempest adds and revamps oceans in the game along with a sea-faring faction, and allows the player to choose between expanding into either land or sea. The expansion is handled in such a good way that both are valid options, and as such offering more choice and variety to each game.The other dlcs are minor things that aren't really all that interesting. If you can get the major expansions and the minor dlc in a discounted package then great, it's worth it.tl;dr Great faction design and good mechanics make for interesting playthroughs.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been playing the alpha for a couple months now, and I have to say I am absolutely impressed with what is on here so far.  The dev team definitely set about creating an innovative 4X Turn-based strategy (TBS) here that will probably eclipse their Sins TBS alternative, Endless Space, in its sheer success.  It could potentially rival its closest mainstream competitor, the Sid Meiers' Civilization series.  I cannot overstate how pleased I am with its progress as May 20, 2014, and what is expected down the line.  Endless Legends is fantasy TBS expecting 8 major playable factions built into a randomly generated map.  It is part-simulation in a way with quests and a storyline quest specific to each major faction.  Each faction is absolutely distinct from the others in design, much like Endless Space, with exception of basic city improvements.  Playing them similarly would be disastrous as I discovered when I played the Broken Lords like Wild Walkers once because of differences in faction technologies and their relationships to minor factions.  On a side note, I love the art too.  This is still an alpha, so it is not close to finished, but I do want to outline what I like so far in the game by analyzing its 4X nature thus far.It needs to work on its EXPLORATION aspect, but it is expected to be improved upon.  Vision and movement are important aspects of this that can be enhanced through tech and empire plan choices.  Roads, sea travel, auto-explore, and other functions are expected to crop up soon, so this will be cleared up.  Quests are an important part of this game either through their storyline quests or ruins, but I consider them perhaps the most critical part of the exploration aspect thus far.EXPANSION is where it shines with a new innovative approach to territory.  The use of expansionary districts and regions really sets it aside from Civ 5 and Endless Space, requiring not only continental and imperial management but also intense city management.  City expansion improves upon FIDSI and anomaly access while colonization of new regions accesses newer luxury and strategic resources and minor factions.  Technology advances over six eras, requiring increasing numbers of tech to reach the next era unlike Endless Space but not quite so linear as Civ 5.  City improvements work like Endless Space's system improvements.  Overall, I LOVE IT.EXPLOITATION is where the game also is expecting improvement.  At present the AI is dumbed down to simply declare war and conquer, but when it develops it is possible to create alliances, trade, and regulate borders.  Further, minor factions are important in this game.  Assimilating minor factions improves certain qualities in the empire in question as well as provides faction units.  For instance, Bos provide light cavalry Centaurs while Kazanji offer some wicked flying Demons.  There's also a marketplace for buying disbanded units, heroes, resources, and otherwise that can offer a means to get an edge on a close competitor.  This part needs help but it will probably reflect the same 4X exploitation basics with exception of the minor factions, which really do impact gameplay.EXTERMINATION is another innovative spot for the game.  Rather than doing the rock, paper, scissors approach from Endless Space or the unit-by-unit crawl across Civ 5 they chose to do a battle system based off stats such as initiative, defense, attack, and other such where stacked armies fight each other with reinforcements from nearby armies if available.  If the manual option is chosen, the player only chooses which units are attacked per unit, but heroes also get involved directly in the fight unlike Endless Space.  But the best part about using the manual option for a multiplayer match in the future is that you can direct the initial targeting and at the same time look elsewhere in your empire and take care of other business.  So, while your Necrophage necrodrones are taking out an army of Broken Lord Stalwarts, you can address your need to expand into the Tanoj region to grab the Mithrite there while determining where to put that next district in your capital.  Once you're done you can look back and redirect the targeting and do something else.  Overall, I like this style better than the other models and is the second most innovative aspect of the game behind the region-city model.This game just in the alpha stages alone is fantastic but also needs some polishing here and there as is to be expected.    8/10 for the alpha compared to similar games, expecting 10/10 upon completion.

Early Access Review
								I have been playing the alpha for a couple months now, and I have to say I am absolutely impressed with what is on here so far.  The dev team definitely set about creating an innovative 4X Turn-based strategy (TBS) here that will probably eclipse their Sins TBS alternative, Endless Space, in its sheer success.  It could potentially rival its closest mainstream competitor, the Sid Meiers' Civilization series.  I cannot overstate how pleased I am with its progress as May 20, 2014, and what is expected down the line.  Endless Legends is fantasy TBS expecting 8 major playable factions built into a randomly generated map.  It is part-simulation in a way with quests and a storyline quest specific to each major faction.  Each faction is absolutely distinct from the others in design, much like Endless Space, with exception of basic city improvements.  Playing them similarly would be disastrous as I discovered when I played the Broken Lords like Wild Walkers once because of differences in faction technologies and their relationships to minor factions.  On a side note, I love the art too.  This is still an alpha, so it is not close to finished, but I do want to outline what I like so far in the game by analyzing its 4X nature thus far.It needs to work on its EXPLORATION aspect, but it is expected to be improved upon.  Vision and movement are important aspects of this that can be enhanced through tech and empire plan choices.  Roads, sea travel, auto-explore, and other functions are expected to crop up soon, so this will be cleared up.  Quests are an important part of this game either through their storyline quests or ruins, but I consider them perhaps the most critical part of the exploration aspect thus far.EXPANSION is where it shines with a new innovative approach to territory.  The use of expansionary districts and regions really sets it aside from Civ 5 and Endless Space, requiring not only continental and imperial management but also intense city management.  City expansion improves upon FIDSI and anomaly access while colonization of new regions accesses newer luxury and strategic resources and minor factions.  Technology advances over six eras, requiring increasing numbers of tech to reach the next era unlike Endless Space but not quite so linear as Civ 5.  City improvements work like Endless Space's system improvements.  Overall, I LOVE IT.EXPLOITATION is where the game also is expecting improvement.  At present the AI is dumbed down to simply declare war and conquer, but when it develops it is possible to create alliances, trade, and regulate borders.  Further, minor factions are important in this game.  Assimilating minor factions improves certain qualities in the empire in question as well as provides faction units.  For instance, Bos provide light cavalry Centaurs while Kazanji offer some wicked flying Demons.  There's also a marketplace for buying disbanded units, heroes, resources, and otherwise that can offer a means to get an edge on a close competitor.  This part needs help but it will probably reflect the same 4X exploitation basics with exception of the minor factions, which really do impact gameplay.EXTERMINATION is another innovative spot for the game.  Rather than doing the rock, paper, scissors approach from Endless Space or the unit-by-unit crawl across Civ 5 they chose to do a battle system based off stats such as initiative, defense, attack, and other such where stacked armies fight each other with reinforcements from nearby armies if available.  If the manual option is chosen, the player only chooses which units are attacked per unit, but heroes also get involved directly in the fight unlike Endless Space.  But the best part about using the manual option for a multiplayer match in the future is that you can direct the initial targeting and at the same time look elsewhere in your empire and take care of other business.  So, while your Necrophage necrodrones are taking out an army of Broken Lord Stalwarts, you can address your need to expand into the Tanoj region to grab the Mithrite there while determining where to put that next district in your capital.  Once you're done you can look back and redirect the targeting and do something else.  Overall, I like this style better than the other models and is the second most innovative aspect of the game behind the region-city model.This game just in the alpha stages alone is fantastic but also needs some polishing here and there as is to be expected.    8/10 for the alpha compared to similar games, expecting 10/10 upon completion.

 When a Civilisation game and a Fantasy game love each other very much...  In short  Endless Legend is an amazing 4X styled game in which... well... i think you already know. Command armies of many different civilisations including: An Evil Cult, Wood Elves, Snow People, Pimp Ghosts, Traders with massive beetle towns, drastically oversized Bugs, sadist Mages, and Dragon people. Explore a world which looks way better than Civ, and is twice as interesting! But you must always remember: Winter is Coming...Have Fun!9/10			"

Early Access Review
								The gameplay is similar to Civ 5.  Technology progression is a lot more basic, in that there are no dependencies. The only restriction is that you need to research 10 (I think) technologies before progressing to the next tier.  The combat system is really cool.  You can build armies consisting off multiple different units, and then actually control those units in battles. A section of the map is marked off, and all of the units are spread out.  But, if you don't want to take the time to control the battle yourself, you can skip this feature and have your army or unit battle it out like in Civ.  The graphics are great. They did a great job designing the world/tiles.  The terrain can play a big part in battles, which is cool and add a little to the strategy of how you engage enemies. The game is still a work in progress, but I think it's great and I'm looking forward to when it's completed.			"

												A fantastic take on the turnbased 4x genre. You can find my full video review here.Endless Legend lets you play a number of factions that encourage entirely different playstyles. Custom factions can be created to tailor the experience further along with unit and hero customisation on top of your standard tile based gameplay.  The combat, like Endless Spaces, is quite hands off but more developed. The AI appear quite agressive and may make peaceful victories harder to achieve. Unofortunately dialogue between factions is not voiced and is yet the same no matter whom you talk to.The game is beautiful, has a great soundtrack and is well worth loosing a few hours or days to.

												Endless Legend is a fantastic game, and a proper contendor to the Civilization series. If you find the ""real-world"" setting of Civ to be a tad boring, and if you find the more recent Civ games to be a tad bit too simplistic, then this is the game for you.PROS:+Fantastic story, with an in-depth lore connected to both of Amplitude's other titles, Endless Space and Dungeon of the Endless+Tons of replayability with different races/factions to experiment with, each with unique mechanics+Multiple paths to victory, even moreso than Civ+Complex and deep systems and management+Hero units+Customizeable units and upgrades+Much, much moreCONS:-Tutorial is somewhat lacking.-AI can be unreasonable at times-Multiplayer can be a bit buggy, but this has improved with time-The complexity can be a big barrier to entryI strongly recommend this game. 9/10.

												First off, let me say that I'm not a fan of Endless Space. As a huge 4x fan I wanted to like ES badly, but the game felt very flat. I thought the galaxy was lifeless, military strategy is just an r/p/s guessing game and each play through feels pretty much the same after about the first 20 minutes.I mention that because this is what made me hesitate about buying Endless Legend. I need not have worried. EL is wonderful. It has all of the life and character that ES lacked and much, much more.Picking a ""best thing"" about this game is tough, but I would agree with many that it's the faction design. The factions don't just have a few different units or stat bumps, they obey entirely different game mechanics. They have their unit trees and city plans. You can't play the same game with two different factions, it just won't work. And that's awesome.Above everything else, Endless Legend is original. The regional cities, tech tree ""eras,"" expressing influence directly as a resource, redesigning units like you would in a space 4x, they make this game feel like something I haven't seen before. In a field that has been competing to become the next Master of Magic or Civ fantasy for the last 20 years, that's a breath of fresh air. Endless Legend is fun, it's original and it's incredibly worth buying.			"

												There isn't any way around it, this is a much more in-depth fantasy version of Civilization 5. Aside from all the depth and such, the setting feels far more fitting than the ""insert X historical leader as the figurehead of X nation"" of Civilization. The ""world gets periodically buried in an ice age"" lore simply works well, where that historical stuff is fun but wears quickly; at least in my experience. It generally helps the diversity of the world, factions, and even is a gameplay element with the onset of a punishing winter for elongated periods of time.City placement isn't dictated by distance between cities but rather they're divided by generated provinces you can claim with a single city, entirely doing away with gamey nonsense and weird broken borders typical to Civ5. Technology is organic, only divided into tiers rather than mandatory lines of progress more like a loading bar as a manifestation of your needs. After having played a number of Paradox strategy games, I've come to appreciate a good UI and this game certainly isn't hard to navigate through; everything's where it should be, no hassle.Diplomacy isn't the typical limited rigid enemy/neutral/friendly set either. By default nations are in a state of ""cold war"" from which point they can either become friendly or fight their opposition's armies over control of neutral territory. You can also compliment and insult, among other things to decrease or increase the cost of certain types of diplomatic declarations and agreements. No longer are the days of ""I really want to kill that guy's settler but I really don't want to declare war on him"" as now you can simply slaughter them along with everything else.Units are one of the finer points of this developer's games, at least compared to most generic units in strategy games. Each faction has three basic units but you can drastically alter them by creating(renaming kinda) a new unit with better equipment, along with any minor faction's units you pick up along the way. You could make your ranged units more durable than any generic mele unit, create a berserker unit, or even the most expensive upgraded thing you can get your hands on.Heroes play a role much like characters in more recent Total War games. They can be given the finest equipment your nation has like any unit and eventually level-up to be anything from a skilled administrator to a glorious commander through a very Total War-esq tree of passive boons. In battle, they also play a role as a most effective unit.Faction diversity's easily among the strongest features of this game, going against the current trend of making factions very much the same as each other. For instance, one of them can only build a single powerful city and subjugate distant minor faction villages which then occasionally supply that faction with free units. Another can only increase its population and heal units through using dust (magical money). The trader faction can even uproot its cities and set down somewhere else at will. This vast difference between factions is only further supplemented by the ability to create custom factions, with a limited point system providing you a series of boons along with crippling debuffs to choose from; ensuring balance.If you've enjoyed Civilization, you'll probably find this game surpasses it in pretty much every way—though the character limit on custom names is truly criminal.

												Great game, my current go-to 4x. It took me about 14 hours for my first win, and there is still plenty of replay value. Each faction has a story line that can be played out through quests, or totally ignored if you'd rather just play a game of fantasy civ. Orignal lore sets it apart from the usual high fantasy themes, which is really refreshing. A great addition to the 4x genre.			"

												booted it up after installing and accidentally played 3 hours straight.extremely similar to the civilization series (it feels almost exactly like it really) but with a better looking UI in my opinion. graphically its gorgeous. i absolutely love the art style which i find to be very magic the gathering-ish.right away it plays better AND has more content that Civ 5 at launch, and i would argue that it is better than Civ 5 in its current state. armies are stackable, there is a fluid tech tree where you can build as you want, rather than be shoehorned into specific paths to win. all of the races seem to play very differently from the little bit ive seen online. theres a unit creator which allows you to make new armies based off of pre-existing units and upgrade them (along with heroes) with crafted items to give battles more of an RPG feel to them. diplomacy works well, and switching around workers to improve different resource collection is very simple. at full price this game is definitely worth it, and for the sale price i would recommend this in a heartbeat. dont wait another 4 years for Civ BE to be in a decent state, get this instead.tldr; if you like civ you will most certainly enjoy this game without doubt.

												this game is far and away one of, if not the best turn based strategy game I have ever played.  Its tough starting out and not in the tough the computer may start out winning but I'll come back.  No its tough in the sense of get used to loseing some games until you figure out how you want to play.  The fact that i don't have to send workers out to do upgrades is a wonderful feature.  All worker allocations are instead done from the city screen. The incorporation of the summer and winter seasons is great, and that you have to plan accordingly makes it all the better. if you are looking for a simple turn based strrategy game, go play civ, if you want a challenge this game is for you.

												This is the best ""Magic Civ"" game since Master of Magic (1994)!Amplitude Studios did a very good job at bringing several new (and good) ideas to the genre. The most striking to me is that each faction plays very differently, most of them even bring some twists to the game mechanics to make them unique. One example is the Cultists faction, that can only be played with one city but have abilities to use tribes for growth, or the Broken Lords, that require no food but need money to sustain themselves. The tech tree is actually not a tree at all, and this makes the technology evolution a lot less linear than usual. The idea of regions with only one city per region and local tribes is also welcome, and use of the tribes is quite fun without being time consuming.Diplomacy and combat are more standard, I like the cold war status that allows for aggression without being at war.Endless Legend is a great game and offers very good re-playability. If you like turn-based strategy it is very unlikely you'll be disappointed. "

												Endless Space was a great game, not ground-breaking but very well made, managing to bring some new ideas despite being a sort-of-a copy of previous 4x Space games. The races while all different from each other, had many similarities to other Space Fantasy races we had seen before.When Endless Legend was announced; truth be told I only expected a simple background change to the Endless Space game we already had. Perhaps just moving from space to a single planet but keeping the core gameplay the same.That is to some extent true; those familiar with Endless Space will find themselves at home here, city management, hero skills and army interface all remind us of Endless Space, the overall style of the UI is also very similar.However what makes this game fascinating and special is the amount of detail in it and the amazing atmosphere. Every single race is unique, not only in gameplay but in background and story; even their interactions with the basic currency of the game. This small gameplay element ""currency"" changes the morals and customs of these peoples.There are Empire-stories, world-stories, minor faction-stories and all of them are told through quests that remind us of RPG classics. For the single World of Auriga; the developers managed to put in more story than all the systems in Endless Space ever had.Visuals are amazing, colourful but not cartoonish, absolutely cheerful and pleasing to look at, despite being a turn based game, I have never felt bored or disinterested, even during the periods of waiting for friends to complete their turns.The final and dearest point has to be the music; I can safely say that this game has the best or at least one of the best soundtracks I have ever had the pleasure to listen to. I have played it more than a day now in total and every track still takes me on an emotional journey. The use of Guitar tones together with the Harp is especially noteworthy. The fact that the Devs provide it for free is also much appreciated, would be well worth a fee to download.Despite the welcome popularity of 4x and strategy games causing a bit of a surplus of such games to pick from: I very much recommend this game to anyone that enjoys good strategy and story.

												Pros:1. Endless Legend is gorgeous to look at, plain and simple. From the terrain to various info and quest pages, it all looks great. A lot of care went into making this game look good.2. There is more to a good 4X than killing the other guy, and Endless Legend delivers with complex Empire Management. From tweaking production, to long term tech planning, you can control in detail more than just where your armies are going.3. Usually, combat tends to be a chore, but no with Endless Legend. With Auto-Resolve for the ""easy"" battles, you can focus on the important ones instead. The Tactical battle is a hybrid of Disciples and Age of Wonders, where you control your troops, but not everything they do. Also, new techs allow you to upgrade your armies with better equipment, and you can pick different bonuses as well, but all of it done in a non-time consuming way.4. Factions do not just look different, but they actually feel different, and not in just subtle ways. At the same time, they feel balanced against one another, so every game never feels like one faction will always win. This extends to victory conditions, as each faction features their own unique quest line for victory!Cons:1. The A.I. can be a bit bi-polar sometimes, but it is by no means stupid (usually). The A.I. can and will kick your sorry hide if you let it, so for those looking for a single player only experience, you will find the A.I. to be more challenging than the A.I. in Civilization (which I have hundreds of hours in, including Deity wins).2. Digging for information can be a minor chore, as some things are not really well explained, or obviously laid out. However, there is a lot of information and guides done by the community that are readily accessible to help you out.Summary:I strongly recommend Endless Legend to anyone that is a 4X fan looking for their next fix. I play both Multi-player and Single-player, so this will easily continue to be one of the games I will be pouring many hours into. It takes all of what makes a good classic 4X strategy, and adds in some refreshing twists that will not disappoint.  tl;dr If you are familiar with losing an hour or more when you said ""just one more turn"", then Endless Legend will not be kind to your sleep habits!

												Since this game was released I was sure that I wanted to play it. I was sold by the graphics and the artwork and I liked that it is a fantasy twist on other 4X games. I have to admit that I am not disappointed at all.I am a newbie in the 4X genre, and of course I tried the tutorial first. But that one didn't make it very clear to me, and it was pretty short. So I just started a new game and looked up some guides about the basics. I would recommend other newbies to look for guides instead of the tutorial.The gameplay is good, I think the UI looks well-arranged as well. I found out that I enjoyed expanding cities and researching new methods. So your empire will grow bigger and stronger.A nice addition is the combat system. This works similar to the Heroes of Might & Magic combat. You can play these battles, or if you think there are repetitive, you can skip them to see the results. There are multiple ways to win a match, with colonizing as many as possible regions or with completing your main quest for example. There are also multiple factions to play with, each with their own specialities. Every faction has their own main quest to complete. The soundtrack is superpretty, I enjoy the in-game music a lot. I think it is maybe one of the best game soundtracks I heard. The graphics are very pleasing to look at, the same goes for the cinematics. I think Endless Legend will be one of my favourite games. It is pretty addicting as well.My rating for this game: 9/10			"

												Endless Legend is an extremely polished 4X game with some cool mechanics, a slick interface, and beautiful music/graphics. It takes the classic Civilization formula, refines and streamlines certain mechanics for improved gameplay, blends in some lite RPG elements like quests and gear upgrades, and adds sci-fi/fantasy lore for flavor.There are only seven factions in the base game but each has unique qualities that alter how they play fairly drastically. For example, the Necrophages can convert vanquished enemies into drones to bolster their armies, and the Broken Lords consume dust (the game’s monetary resource) instead of food.Endless Legend tweaks the classic Civ system with a number of refinements, improvements, and new mechanics, like units that combine into easily maneuverable armies, a map carved into territories which only allow one city each, seasons that impact production and movement, and so forth. Where Civ often gets bogged down in micromanagement for larger empires in the late game, Endless Legend’s various refinements help keep things moving a little more smoothly.Perhaps the most impressive thing about Endless Legend is its overall polish. Anchored by an elegant and intuitive interface that gives you quick access to all features and info, the game has a great feel and every aspect of it plays extremely well. The lush musical soundtrack by FlybyNo ties everything together with a beautiful and at times haunting assortment of orchestral strings and vocals. The base game is entirely satisfying without any expansions. Each of the DLCs adds something but at this point none are truly essential, it isn’t like recent entries in the Civ series where the base games feel unfinished without the big expansions... Here, the base game gives you a fun and balanced experience with more than enough to keep you busy, then you can look at the DLCs if you feel like adding a couple of extra features on top.  The developers have also been fairly active through the game’s first year and a half with patches providing minor improvements, tweaks, and fixes for the base game.Like all great 4X games, Endless Legend will keep you hooked for “one more turn” as the hours drift away and the day turns to night and back to day again. Highly recommended for 4X fans who are looking for a cool new take on the classic Civ style game. "

												This is a great, great game.  It's worth it's meager price tag of $40.  (Meager in terms of major games, which always have a baseline of $60.)  Put it on your wishlist and snatch it up when you catch a price break.  It's all about the factions.  Unlike in Civ 5, the factions play very differently from each other.  The Wild Walkers kind of focus on expansion, exploration, and harmonizing with the planet, while the Cultists focus on forcing everyone else in the world to join their cult.  This is far from the minor differences of, say, one faction getting +2 food in the capital, as opposed to +1 industry on water tiles like you would see in Civ.  The faction differences in Endless Legend are about PHILOSOPHY, and not about mechanics.  The Cultists are only allowed one city, the Roving Clans are not allowed to declare war, the Drakken can force other factions into peace and alliance treaties.  These are game-altering differences that lead to different game experiences and interesting cross-faction interactions. Every little part of this game has been fleshed out and thought through.  Every little part of it makes sense.  It won't be the easiest thing to pick up right off the bat, since the guys at Amplitude Studios think just a little differently than you're used to, but they also like to reward you for your efforts.  The more you play, the more you see the big picture, and the more you realize just how perfect each piece of the puzzle is and what a beautiful picture it makes.  Somehow this game is more polished, more interesting, more diverse, and more fun than Civ 5, in which I've got a couple hundred hours logged.  The tutorial is excellent.  It brings you into their way of thinking without patronizing you like you've never played any kind of civilization game before.  The artwork is different and interesting, all the way down to the way the interface responds when you scroll in and out of the map.  The music and sound of the game somehow enhance the whole effect that they are trying to create.  Before you know it, you'll have hours and hours logged and wondering what you ever played before.There are a few minor issues that keep this game from being a 10, but as it is a new title, I expect those things to be ironed out as time moves on.  For instance, if you accidentally (or intentionally) get ahead of yourself in the tutorial, and even sometimes in a created game, you could end up with a quest that you cannot complete.  Overall, this is usually no big deal, since you are given LOTS of quests during the course of your adventures.  However, if the quest you cannot complete just happens to be a faction quest, then you are effectively cut off from the rest of the storyline for your faction, short of resorting to a save state.  Also, there's not much in the way of naval combat.  This is a really minor gripe for me since about 96% of the time I never used my navy in Civ 5 for anything other than a deterrent, anyway.  But if you're a big fan of naval forces and/or combat, you may miss it here.  Quite frankly, I was many hours deep into this game before I even realized that there was no navy.  Somehow it feels like they told a complete story without it.I expect a DLC sometime in the future that will probably handle some sort of naval units and a few more factions, although there will never be a glut of factions like in Civ.  Each faction is so fundamentally different I imagine it would be difficult to maintain any kind of balance (or even to come up with a plethora of ideas) if there were endless factions.  (See what I did there?  I might have just named the DLC. )  I mean, unless you're playing Venice, there really isn't much difference between the 300 factions in Civ, anyway.As it is, though, I am very happy with this game and highly recommend it to anyone who has that 4x itch, that civ itch, or anyone who just wants to play a really good game for a change.

												From the makers of Endless Space comes a stylish fantasy 4x. For anyone who has watched the intro to The Game of Thrones, the art style will be familiar, a quite unique look that I dont recall seeing before, The gameplay is fairly familiar to anyone who has played a lot of 4x, with a few interesting mechanics to throw in there. Empire planning every few seasons allows you some customisation for your empire, allowing you to focus on say dust production (game resource) or reduction in costs to recruiting units. Strategic resources located within your territory enable you to create armor, weapons and equipment for your troops as well as provide mid to late game bonuses which again provide some nice customisation. You are able to customise your units to some degree creating 1h shield or 2h for the basic infantry units for example. Further customisation in the material the weapons and armour is made from allow for further bonuses such as stuns and sweepback strikes (aoe).The only problem I have encountered stability wise is the need to run the client in 32bit as suggested by the company on the forums as it was prone to regular crashing. I have had no problems since doing this altho it will crash on exit every time now, (will update if this is fixed or changes)Overall I would recommend this as a nice addition to 4x library.

Unity has released a new version of Unity (4.6.2) with some fix which could concern the crash issue. We have generated a new build and I played for 65 turns without crash on a PC outfitted with an AMD graphic cards, in 64 bits, with the latest graphics drivers. Sounds promising, but obviously we need our QA to double check it. Lets hope I was not just lucky.Cheers, AmplimathCEOhttp://forums.amplitude-studios.com/showthread.php?38627-Random-crashes-with-ATI-cards-while-running-the-64-bits-version-of-the-game/page7---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------09/01/14 - update:Hi all,I am deeply sorry about the inconvenience. I have contacted AMD again to learn their progress. I think it is difficult for them because the crash is random and it takes some time to reproduce. As the game works perfectly in other configurations, I can only assume that it is an issue between Unity 64 bits and AMD drivers.There is a new version of Unity coming up in the next weeks/months, version 5.0, and its editor runs natively in 64 bits, as opposed to 4.X where the editor is 32 bits and we make a special build in 64 bits. My hope is that when people equipped with AMD starts migrating on Unity 5 and have the editor crash every now and then, the problem will become more serious for Unity and AMDAnyway I will update you when I have more news.Cheers, AmplimathCEOhttp://forums.amplitude-studios.com/showthread.php?38627-Random-crashes-with-ATI-cards-while-running-the-64-bits-version-of-the-game/page5---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AMD ATI Card 64bit problems:From this thread end of Oct 2014: http://forums.amplitude-studios.com/showthread.php?38627-Random-crashes-with-ATI-cards-while-running-the-64-bits-version-of-the-game/page2Over the past month we have tried to understand why the crash appended and it has taken us some time to found that it comes from the ATI hardware configuration.We have asked the help of AMD some weeks ago because we had tried all our ideas and we had no way to find why it appends. We were really pleased that they answered us and started to look at it.Apparently they have reproduced it for the first time in their lab some days ago.

												Between the breathtaking music and art style, great lore and superior gameplay mechanics, It's hard not to recommend this.  I'm 100% serious about the music and artstyle.  There were times where the breathtaking beauty of it almost moved me to tears.  Call me a ♥♥♥♥♥, but they have some great music and it matches the game so well...I've played a few 4x games before, such as CIV, GalCiv and Warlock.  This takes the cake, even if I've got limited experience.  It's just that good.  I mean, good doesn't mean flawless.  It still has all the inherent issues of the genre.  But it also has unique mechanics that add a fun spin on the game.  Really, its main issues are that at times the autoresolve combat can be stupid and that there's not a whole lot of unit variety.

												Good game. Slower pace and more micromanagement than sid 4 or 5 but over all a good game. The graphics are good but it seems to have issues with nvidia cards where its trying to use up 100% of the gpus resources just sitting at the  main menu.I just read up on the other post for this and I can see why mine wasn't doing this at first. I'm running Evga's gpu overclocking software that limits framerates and I also limit the frame rates via ingame options and the hardware settings it's self. I turned these off and I did see a spike in temp to about 75c from high 50's.I recommend trying these options.-Down load any monitoring/ overclocking tools from asus for you gpu-Set the framerate limit or vsynce on the hardware its self. can be done through nvidia gefore -set vsynce and max frame rates in game "

												I can't recommend this game highly enough.  As an avid Civilization and general 4X enthusiast for many years, I appreciate the aspects of the genre conserved by this game, but I am so very enamored with its many innovations.  Unlike Civ, which often feels deterministic--that the game is won or lost in the first 50 turns and momentum is nigh impossible to overcome--Endless Legend has a wide variety of paths to victory.  Decisions made in the mid to late game still have tremendous consequence.  It's possible to adopt a new strategy if your first one is not working out.  I appreciate that about this game more than anything.			"

												Really Unique Take on the 4x genre.  Factions play completely different. Interface is ungodly slick and gorgeous.  Impossible and higher difficulty are some BS, but I think you can find good games on Serious.  Apparently not very well balanced in multiplayer from what I've heard but for singleplayer it is worth a look.  I love a lot of what it does.  Just some examples of some of the factions:- Bugs who can only make war. Use dead bodies from battles to boost food production in a city.- Crazy puppet dudes who are only allowed to make one city- Gypsy like faction who can move cities and isn't allowed to declare war and focused on trade, and mercenaries.- Diplomatically inclined dragonsEach faction has a main quest (not sure what happens when you beat them but along the way you get cool rewards.).  Minor factions you can assimilate into your army.  There's a fully working stock market esque marketplace although I wish the AI would use it more.The map is ungodly gorgeous and theres a cool tilt shift effect when you zoom in.  Battles take place with stacks of units meeting and then fighting on the actual hexes of the world for 6 phases.  You can give pretty specific orders to units as far as who to attack and buff and where to move but they are not garuteed to be followed. I get a Heroes of Might and Magic Vibe for some reason from the battles even though they're different mechanics Overall it is an interesting system.  You upgrade your units with gear you aquire through research and moving through the ages if you wish.  I do wish there was an 'ultra' unit for each faction, as each faction only has I believe 3 units (which can be augmented by minor factions you asimiliate, or mercs).  Apparently the lore is pretty deep and all of the Endless games tie in to eachother (Endless Legend, Dungeon Of The Endless, and Endless Space).Basically a really gorgeous, slick take on the 4x genre which might not be the deepest 4x around but has tons of stuff going for it.  Not to rag on Civ:BE which I don't have anything against, but comparing BE to Endless Legend and the uniqueness of the factions is quite a change of pace.  Civ V is still probably the game to beat for most players, but Endless Legend definitely deserves a look if you are a fan of the genre.I've addressed the pros.  And seriously, Civ:BE's interface can only fantasize about being as good as Endless Legend.  You right click to back out of ANY screen, it's a beautiful thing.Cons would be --Unit variety (any way you slice it a faction really only has 3 units), the AI has almost always spammed 1 type of unit against me.- Multiplayer Balance (which is made up for in singleplayer uniqueness)- Animations are really slow for battle, you need to speed them up in the map options BEFORE you start. Trust me start with the animations turned all the way up or late game battles will drag on for minutes and minutes with not even much happening.- Really really bad AI cheating on the 2 highest difficulty levels, but what can you do?

												Do you like Heroes of Might & Magic? (3? 4? 5? 6?) if so, then great, you'll probably love this game. Do you like any of the Civilization games? great too!This game is basically a mashup of Heroes of Might & Magic and Civilization, a healthy ""just right"" dosage of both in my opinion. You can roll out the big guns, create a massive army and wreck everyone to win, you could instead expand your empire by building cities and then conquering other people's cities until 80% of all lands on the map belong to you. You can achieve a diplomatic victory by keeping your relations with other countries at peace or in alliance for a long enough amount of time (you get peace points, 1 for any country in the game, 2 for any country at peace with you and 4 for any country in an alliance. You win at like 3000 points; these values can be adjusted)You can win by finishing your factions main quest (everyone has a main quest to follow; side quests can be earned by visiting certain locations on the map, quests give rewards. Nice rewards.) which will award you with the ability to build a ""Temple of the Earth's Core"" which is a so called ""Wonder"", and you will win when you have it.You can win by being the most technologically advanced country (research 5 of the 6 most advanced technologies)Or you can play a bit more strategically than just kicking everyone's♥♥♥♥♥ and capture all your opposing player's capital cities which will give you the Supremacy victory.All of these are viable ways to win, besides maybe expansion victory (80% is a lot) but this sums up what the game is about. It's difficulty level is somewhere right between Heroes and Civilization, but the fun I'm getting here is a lot more than in either one of these other two classics. This game rocks! and if you're any sort of fan of turn based strategy, you should give it a try!			"

												First-class 4X strategy game with a sharp, vibrant color palette and deep decision-making, with enough depth to the combat to keep it interesting and tons of customizability. Replayability is also top notch, with random quests and map generation. One of the best examples of the genre, bar none.			"

												Wow, this game is really something any 4x, strategy gamer should spend time on. I'm a huge CIV, Master of Orion fan among others and I never had so much fun since Civ 4 loaded with Mods and expansions and Endless Legend is still Vanilla. The universe is story-rich, the graphics are really good, the soundtrack is immersive and the gameplay is nothing shy of Civ 5. I should say, there is a sense of deepness in this game that was lost a long time ago with the Civ Series. The different ressources you can get and their potential effects, the extended political and trading systems, the Hero and armies customizations. The different factions bring several ways to play the game and eventually win. I'm only 10 hours on this game so far and I'm still doubtful about to what extend the replay value will be lets say past when you won with every factions. I'm hoping there will be lots of good Mods and maybe expansions to push the limits of this game in the future. Some people complained about the game crashing, so far I've experienced only one crash and thanks to the auto save feature, I was able to reload the last save without hassle. In conclusion, this game is great, It's like a mother's caresss on a Civilization fan that felt left down by the last games they offered. Endless Legend HAS that one more turn feeling. Every turn brings its piece of action, being at war or at peace, there is plenty to manage and enjoy. It does not re-invent the genre, but it takes a well established concept and brings it in a Fantastic universe with a lot to explore and control. Have fun!			"

												I was skeptical at first. Coming from someone who tried Endless Space and found it dry and unengaging, I must say that Endless Legend is an extremely significant improvement on its predecessor. I'll be honest, the first two hours or so of this game, I had no idea what was going on (even after playing the tutorial). It took a second play through and watching a few ""Lets Play"" videos on Youtube before I began to understand some of the basic and intermediate concepts more in depth.Now, after some ~20 hours played on this game, I can say without doubt that this game is an absolute must-buy for any 4x fan. I have in those 20 hours only played two of the factions available, so there is a lot more to discover once I get around to trying the others. If you're a fan of fantasy, turn-based strategy, or Civilization, I would definitely recommend giving this game a shot.			"

Early Access Review
								I am absolutely loving this game. I love turn-based strategy games because you control the pace of play so much. In a sense this reminds me of Civ V with MUCH better graphics. The combat system is far superior to Civ as well as you (as the player) can develop the strategy for attack. It also feels much deeper than Civ as it seems (please remember, I'm only 11 hours into play thus far so my thoughts are very early...) that there are more intricacies to take into account. Bear in mind, I LOVED Civ V and could lose myself for hours in it. I have done the same with this game.I have had a couple of crashes mid-game but it is to be expected as a early access game. But I think I've only had two in 11 hours. I do saves every 10 turns or so to protect my game. But the game also does pretty frequent auto-saves. In those two crashes I've never lost more than a single turn of moves.I highly recommend this game if you like turn-based strategy games. You will not be disappointed!			"

												I gather the name ""Endless Legend"" is derived from this game's ability to draw you in and effortlessly absorb all of your free time.  It's really difficult to stop playing this game!  It's not like any other 4X game I've played in the past, although it has similarities with many of my favourites, including Civilization, Heroes of Might & Magic, and Warlords 2 (an old game I used to play when I was growing up).I love that this game puts a heavy emphasis on quests, because I get bored of 4X games that are just about city spamming and conquering all opposition.  Endless Legend does not include very in-depth combat, but I feel the combat system is just right for this style of game.  In fact, almost everything in this game feels just right to me, including the excellent soundtrack.The only complaint I have about the game is that you can rename your cities but not your heroes.  I sincerely hope they will add that feature, because it would enhance the role playing element of the game.If you're looking for a great 4X fantasy genre game that will entertain you for countless hours, this is definitely the game for you!  Also, if you're interested in playing with a friend, I highly recommend the ""Guardians"" expansion pack, because it adds co-operative quests.			"

												After watching 5 youtube videos I decided I'd buy the game. I picked up a few basics from those videos so I quickly managed to get the basics.Here's how my first playthrough went (Normal, Pangaea with 6 civilizations) playing as the wild walkers:I focused on my main city for a bit researching and building until I found myself in a position to expand, which I did. At this point I encountered a neighbour next to me and another a bit far from where I am.50 turns in one of them declares war on me suddenly with a smaller army than me, but more advanced. I lost my capital. So I reload the save, upgrade my army and still lose it, except he lost most of his as well and was forced to withdraw.Seeing how I have 3 towns to his 1 I quickly rebuild my army and fight him again. Tie again, and again I rebuild. This time I slowly take ground until I reach his capital, where I notice his army is at sea RIGHT next to my capital. What to do?  I try to negotiate peace but he won't budge. So I start a race to his capital, I attack it about a TURN before he reaches my capital city. BAM I win.Now I meet some other neighbours. Turns out I'm now at 3rd score (around 400, highest is 600). I make use of this time  to negotiate peace with my first neighbour and focus on trade, research and expansion. Slowly I also build up 2 armies and position them at my borders. I remain at peace for close to 150 turns slowly developing my empire and making sure my armies are a deterrent to anyone who'd declare war. Meanwhile, the 3 remaining players are at war with each other. One of them has a score of 2000 to my 1100 and the others are worn out and remain at 400-500. At this point, the guy with the 2000 is close to a scientific, expansion, conquest victory and has 50 turns where he'd win. He also conquered one of the players and is waging war with the other to the North (I'm at his East). So sensing the danger, I upgrade all my units, sell excess resources and pump out as much units as possible. I position my 4 armies at the borders with one remaining in reserve. I strategically pick targets whereas he is involved in another frontier. 40 turns left, I declare war.Blitzkrieg is what happens next. I quickly sweep through his southern and eastern lands and pick off stragglers using combined armies to overrun his better upgraded units. Although he initially had a much better army than me, the tactic I employed significantly crippled him. By the time his northern armies come south I already conquered 3 provinces and I pick them one by one. At this point he is desperate for peace, which I decline. I conquer 3 more provinces and my peaceful neighbor conquers one of his. I decide to plan for the future, so I position 3 armies at the border of my peaceful neighbour and the other 3 to conquer the remaining provinces. Just as I'm about to declare war, what happens? I win.I literally went from a losing situation to a winning one through good strategy. This is what I'd want in a game, to offer challenges and reward strategic thining. 10/10			"

												I'm really enjoying Legend so far. It's like Endless Space had a baby with Warlock, and then kept a lot of the best of both games. Seems to be a bit buggy though at some points. Randomly textures started failing (fixed upon a game restart, didn't affect save file) and more recently I've had my save crash upon load (somewhere around turn 410). Not sure what's causing it so if a dev wants the save, I'll send it.Pros:Intuitive combat system makes for interesting gameplay, especially when reinforcements are involved.Summer/Winter shift forces the economy to remain dynamic, and winter turns can be difficult to struggle through.AI Diplomacy works pretty well, though the values of tech/resources could be rebalanced.Very customizable game settings: no two worlds will be the same (unless they use the same seed)Research/Tech tree is expansive, and enables for longer paced games if neededUnit customization is awesome. You can create new units from the templates of the old ones, but with new gear. It's cool.Cons:Occasional crash issues (will update review when resolved)Not as much unit variety as I'd like to see. Sure you can create new versions of old units, but I want to see more variety in class.Not that much variety in quests. A lot of them are just ""Maintain this level of production for x resource for y turns"". Gets kind of old.Sometimes takes ages to find other players on the map, even with max players present. Not necessarily bad, just makes for some slow games every now and then.Overall:Great 4x game with plenty of things to keep you coming back. Even better with friends. I definitely recommend it.			"

												Easily one of the best 4x games in recent years, Endless Legend adds new innovations to the genre and improves on old ones. It has all of the staples of the 4x genre - eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate and it executes well on all of those with perhaps eXterminating being the weakest of the bunch. New innovations like wildly different tile yields combined with one city per zone makes even the placement of a new city a challenging decision. The lore is different and imaginative and each faction really requires a very different play style. Playing as certain civs in this game actually is like trying to re-learn how to play the game - they're that different (and this is a good thing). Other innovations are cool, like a more innovative tech tree. Other things may seem small but add to the enjoyment like goodie huts providing quests but these things help to provide a player some direction and the satisfaction of achieving a short term goal. I really love the graphical style of the game. It looks very different than anything else and it is very attractive. It's bright, colorful and the terrain can be used to your advantage. Music/sound is OK but nothing to write home about.Some players hate the winter because it's almost a forced ""down time"". This is somewhat true. But it also provides a sense of urgency to achieve your goals before the next winter sets in. And if you really plan correctly you can make the winter really the factor that weakens your biggest rival, making them easier to destroy the next summer.It's by no means a perfect game. Combat is kind of dull, there's no esponiage (since fixed in an expansion), the AI can be dumb (improved in expansions) and a few other minor issues like some late-game boredom. But these don't get in the way of a truly enjoyable playing experience. Highly recommended for anyone with a passing interest in 4x games.			"

												Good game that is let down by the limited control in 'manual' battles.You can't really get a unit to move to where you want it to and attack the specific enemy unit you wish.You pre select the target for each of your units and click 'launch'.As soon as an enemy unit moves, it prevents your orders being carried out and leads to your units walking all over the place. Ranged units walk to enemy infanty.Cavalry run infront of infantry, blocking their attacking position. If this game had Eador style combat, it would be epic.			"

They are fantastic and add a whole lot to the base game. My least favorite would have to be the Guardians expansion. It's good, but not AS good as the other three.			"

												I love Civ 5 and heroes of might & magic. Endless legends seems to be trying to attempt both. It is a civ lite city management while you run heroes around to complete a race storyline, random quests, and beat up local minor villages. I'm 60 hours into it now and have Played half of the races. Each race is very interesting but each has a completely narrow way to play them. By that I mean if you play the shadow race then you don't generate science, you have to buy it or steal it. If you play the unbroken you don't need food but alot of gold. Depending on your style this could be frustrating if you pick the wrong race. This is a good game. But I realized I am jaded from Civ 5. I would suggest this game to someone before they play civ 5.			"

												Honestly, this is probably my favorite strategy game. I don't play a lot of them, but I love this world and how it's got tons of depth and complexity but no unnecessary complication. At the very least, this is up there with Civ V, which is a game I can easily lose hours to. I think where Endless Legend takes the win is in the excellent worldbuilding.If you like strategy games, it's well worth your time. And if, like me, you're not much of a strategy fan but you're in the mood for something other than Civ V, I can't recommend this highly enough. Sometimes I play a strategy game because my brain needs a challenge, or I want to play something that's more cerebral than twitchy. Sometimes I play a strategy game because I'm looking for satisfaction more than fun. This game is satisfying AND fun.I like it. Two thumbs up. It says I've only played 11 hours, but I promise I've played longer than that. And despite my massive and neglected back-catalogue of games I need to get around to playing, I hope to play many more hours of Endless Legend in the future.			"

												I love Endless Legend, but my schedule doesn't support my playing it as much as I'd like.  Each faction feels distinct and matches up with their theme well, and the game has just enough quests and story to make it feel like a mix of RPG and civ-like.  It feels extremely polished, and the storyline for each faction flesh out the world very nicely, and really make it feel like a living world.Gameplay mechanics are somewhat simplified from some titles in the space, but I think the simplifications smooth it out more than make it feel lacking.  There are some UI improvements that could be made, but overall it feels responsive and doesn't get in the way too much.I have spent too many nights realizing they aren't nights anymore, after starting my '1 more turn' mantra at around 11pm.I definitely recommend. It probably won't replace Civ* or other go-tos, but it absolutely deserves a spot on the shelf, and is definitely its own thing more than simply a clone in the space.			"

												After playing this game, I can definitely say it's worth playing! The unit and civilization choices may be small, but the variety between them all and the unique play you can have, even as the same faction, gives for countless replayability, I would strongly suggest this game to anyone who looks for a good Civ building game!

												I love this game.The first ""few"" hours were hard to get through but if you start to understand all these little things, it starts getting awesome.I can say this game has more depth than any 4x Game I've played before, the art is more than I'd expect from a 4x and the whole game has beautiful design.If you think about buying the game but it's too expensive then wait for a sale, otherwise just get through the first hours and then start having real fun games. Only bad thing is you still got the ""just one more turn"" problem :3			"

												Being introduced to the 4X genre by Civilization, as i am sure most are, led me to impulse buying this game while it was on sale. The price that i spent was well worth it (if i knew how much I would enjoy it I would still buy it off sale). The beautiful art style, the wonderful animation, and the exciting gameplay all come together to create an extreamly fun game that will probably end with you wasting hundreds of hours on it. Although coming from CIvilization the lack of factions may seem like a turn off; the difference in playstyle for each and every faction is vastly diffrent than in the CIv games. Each faction has enough depth that none of them seem broken (except the broken lords ofc...kill me) or underpowered. If you are coming from Civ the way battles play out may be unenjoyable to you; however, i personally found it much more fun than in any of the Civ games.			"

And all the dlc are a nice addition as well. If you like 4X games this is definately a must have. A real gem. "

												Endless Legend is a well built 4X game that has a unique flavor of its own, and does a lot of things that keep the game interesting at all stages. This is the initial draw for me, as other games (Civ, Endless Space) have a tendency to devolve into a click End Turn fest towards the end of the game.First off, the factions of the game not only are different in terms of advatages and disadvantages, they each have a wildly different playstyle. My first game was as the Necrophages, and I felt like I was literally devouring the minor tribes and faction cities that I encountered. I produced little food on my own, but pacifying vilages gave me a boost, and I could feed my slain foes to a city for a growth boost. The second thing I like about the game is how it forces the player to think long term and also consider his opponents when decided tech choices. Each level of tech has several choices, but every 9 techs researched opens the next level, forcing you to consider stay at the lower level to reseach those magic swords you need, or going up to the next level to research the wonders of the next age. Furthermore, the overall cost of technology increases with each researched, so any time spent on low level tech beyond the necessary gain slow your progression into later technologies.Thirdly, I enjoyed the game's use of resources. Endless Legend has a resource system that I feel is much better done than Civ. All tiles immediatly surrounding your city are gathered, and you can expand your city to talk advantage of strange and unusual tiles. Also, as your city grows you can assign workers who can be focused on any of the 5 major resources. This means that you can found a city where you know you will make money and use workers to compensate for the food shortage. The game also sports 6 strategic resources that are used for building unique buildings and producing advanced armor and weapons for your troops, as well as 10 luxury resources that can be gathered and then activated for empire wide bonuses.  This means that you will rarely find a resource and not be able to make use of it.Endless Legend is a run and well designed game that I will probably play long after I have beaten it as all the major factions. It sports the expected unit and faction customization, so the possibilties are limited only by your imagination. I have not yet tried multiplayer, but I hear the experience is improving. This is a solid game I can easily recommend.Barter? One does not barter with one's next meal...			"

												This is one of my favorite 4X games. Here's why!1. Graphics and Visuals: The game is beautifully designed, from the styles of each faction, to the world map. I have no complaints here, it's very well done. Not much more to say, take a look at screenshots or videos if you want to see for yourself. 2. Soundtrack: I'm not very experienced when it comes to talking about songs, but the music of the game is as well done as the graphics. Surprisingly, a good portion of the music is relaxing, soothing even, making this a very comfortable game to play and take your time with. 3. Lore: Each faction you play as has a story that unfolds while you play. I thought this to be a great mechanic, after playing Civ V where there wasn't much personality to who I played. 4: Gameplay: There's a plethora of things to be working on in this. You'll have plenty to manage, from your cities to your armies, diplomacy and research. Build an army, customize each unit of the army. Hire a hero, and customize him to suit your needs. Have him become a mayor or a great leader or warrior. In combat, you can choose to play it out, or auto-resolve. When you play it out, there's actual strategy to be taken into consideration. Which units you send against who, who counters who, who has the best equipment. And yes, units get equipment. You need to make sure you've given your warriors the best armor and weapons you can. In Civ where you'd have to keep upgrading units to a more modern unit, here you get to keep your unit, but you need to make sure you're outfitting it with modern gear. Overall, this is a game I can feel safe about recommending. It has an occasional hiccup, but nothing too serious. (In one playthrough I ignored error messages and then when I achieved victory all I got was an error instead of victory. So don't be silly, pay attention to things like error messages popping up.) It's plenty of fun, alone or with friends. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Well, I was a fan of civilization back in the day so I decided to give this a whirl considering the 50% off.My lady and I have just finished a 2 hour session and we were both quite impressed.Its got a great flavorful feel to the world and races. Its an experience of wonder and warcraft.Many different ways to progress like diplomacy, military, commerce, or just out tech everyone.though my couple of hours is certainly a drop in a bucket of what this game has to offer, we will definitely be making it part of our gaming routine.Incredibly complex but you can get the hang of it in an hour or so. Which goes to show, its easy to pick up but very hard to master (the sign of an exception gaming experience)			"

Early Access Review
								I will realese a full review when the game is realesed. I'm reviewing this at patch 0.48. With the exception of occusional crashes this game amazes me! I haven't played any previous games by these developers. Being a Sid Meirer's Civilization fanboy I loved the fantasy and diversity this this turn-based strategy game has to offer. The combat is alright but my favourite part about this games is exploration, building, settling, technologies and improving your empire. There are many resources and unqiue tiles that offer certain yeilds. Upgrading your hero (physically and with the skill tree) is essential for winning battles and exploration. Technologies are very interesting and fun to research. So far I'm loving Endless Legend! Keep it up AMPLITUDE STUDIOS!			"

												After buying and playing the last Shifters expansion I want to recommend this game to anyone searching for advice/help on wheter or not to buy.When I bought this game about a year ago. I played it often, single player and with friends. The base game has a problem though in the sense that it's not necessarily the full in-depth experience that lets you come back over and over again for multiple victory conditions and playthroughs. With the 3rd major expansion now out however I will wholeheartedly recommend EL to anyone searching for a cool 4X.The game has bus loads of character and is gorgeous (even to the point of being almost objectively pretty, which sounds  strange I know ;)). The different races and the corresponding empire design are very well fleshed out. Not everyone enjoys the quest aspect of the game, but for me it ties in quite brilliantly with the universe lore (even across other Amplitude titles) making it a unique feature in comparison to other civ-like games -albeit that as a victory condition consecutive playthroughs make it less interesting, but you can disable the victory quest when that happens because the side quests are plenty as well.The faction traits are pretty radical but the balance between civs is reasonable. There are obvious easier and more difficult factions to choose from IMO, but in the hands of someone that wants to invest time into figuring out the best strategy; every faction and respectively every victory is viable.The DLC mechanics: wonders and deeds, covert ops, pearls and winter altar,,, improve on the base game in such a way to make it a very complete and full experience.There are still some caveats though. Due to the nature of the very different faction system, multiplayer is probably more difficult then say Civ5. To win against someone playing Wild Walkers on a warm climate map, you'll have to come prepared. Don't expect to be able to win against upgraded rangers with any army. And talking tactical battles: don't underestimate these in thinking that it is only an automated process. A lot of success involves in learning to read battles and prepare accordingly. For example where do you engage an enemy? Or which unit stance should you choose? What units should you upgrade? And so on. And then advanced tactics like poking with mercs to see the stats of enemies' armies, or infiltrating with spies are all very important to check the exact initiative values of their units for instance.Also, there are some issues with AI difficulty. There is a tendency to snowball in late game and the AI empires sometimes make dubious and even bad unit choises compared to my Uber armies (30% the damage output of mine for example). Which can also mean that I should play on a higher difficulty than hard by now. (I'll get back to that as I make my way through the game).Thanks for reading, hope I've helped HF			"

												Full Review based on the game in its original form plus the free add on for making new items...tldr: Yes, if you enjoy a challenge.EL= Endless LegendThere are lots of references to Civ so players who have played Civ type games can understand some comparisons. If you have never played a strategy game, get this one, and watch some tutorials.I bought EL when it came out and barely played it because it was overwhelming. This is after playing many hours of Civ 5 and beating everything but Deity to give you some perspective. When I saw that recent reviews were mixed I figured it was because a bunch of people participated in the recent summer sale and couldn't handle it. I have read about the Chinese issues and I do hope that the game expands into other languages, but am glad they take a hard stance on cheating. There is no point in cheating, earn it, and if you want something easy to play there are lots of mindless FPS.This game is beautiful. The artwork is amazing, the minor details that appear while playing and remain active (like pollen flowing from flowers (anomaly tiles), is prestine. The music fits but like any strategy game that can take 300, 400, or more turns, I would like to hear an evolving music system. This does not mean the music is in anyway bad because it is very good. I just want more of it.Starting positions are genuinely quite random, unless you change some settings, but I enjoy it. Out of all the games I've started I have only ever had 1 great starting position. You must earn your keep in this game because it is very easy to be destroyed, and most of the time it will be by your own ignorance/mistakes.The ability to customize is great. Customizable factions, very customizable terrain options, and so on. I really enjoy trying out different versions of what the creators deam starting traits for 'faction'. I like that you can take penalty items like less food per tile for more points in something else like dust growth (like a currency). Civ definitely has more factions, major and minor, however the uniqueness of the game play and the factions themselves are so different it makes up for it. Of course, they have released some expansions with 2 new factions. There is another that was free but I do not count them, the Mezari, because they are vaulter copy cats, and that's honestly nonsense (but they're still my favorite because they're from outer space, PLEASE GIVE THEM THEIR OWN OUTER SPACE FALLEN STORY LINE ETC!!! <<<<33333). Back to faction uniqueness...in Civ I could play most any faction the exact same way if I wanted with very little change and that kinda sucks because its just a grind session over and over. Sure there are many ways to win but the process of achieving those things are all too similar. In EL you have to play the factions to there base way of 'life' or you will fall behind very quickly.Going to cut this short b/c I'm hungry AF and want some mexican.Remaining list of things I'd like to see (talking to developers now, others buy the game and move along, feel free to add me). Also, if any of the following are already included in the expansions I've yet to purchase please ignore/let me know, thank you.-Rally points for units, especially those being built-Ability to retrofit purchased UNITS (nothing worse than having a lvl 6 healer at half potential)-ACTUAL MULTIPLAYER TEAM PLAY...-More music (it's already all awesome, but let's not go 200 turns and quit, be the 4K you were meant to be)-True history, traits, etc set up for the Mezari (who would be the true science faction), no more Vaulter knock off...I have some ideas-Make trade more involvedOVERALL GREAT GAME, DEFINITELY BUY, IF YOU LOVE CIV TYPE GAMES YOU WILL LOVE THIS, DON'T MAKE IT A CIV VS EL VS THE WORLD ETC. PLAY THEM ALL, LOVE THEM ALL, BUT THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE, TACO TIME!			"

												Endless EnjoymentYou look up at the stars, seeking hope and answers to unspoken questions.The planet is dying, and in her death throes she spreads harsh winters over your crops and cities, and summer takes ever so long to return life to the fields.Soon everything will be over for the dragonkin savants, insectoid warmongers, ghoul-like remnants of the Endless, shady assassins, and scores of Auriga’s inhabitants…But before this impending cataclysm, you build what you can, reap what you sow, and build your empire from the ground up.Cities will stretch as far as the eye can see, over the horizon or into the clouds.You venerate the ground you walk on, or destroy everything in your path.Pacts are made in Dust or blood, yet your homes still need to be fortified, inwards and outwards.Powerful magic is created, ancient elemental guardians are resurrected,  and some will even learn to prosper during the icy colds of winter.But the end is inevitable.Your knowledge increases, experience is amassed, and by undertaking many quests you carve out a name for yourself. And maybe, by exploring the world, by uniting factions or obliterating them, by digging deeper into Auriga’s shell, deeper into her past, you may yet find a way to survive her, to survive the future.You look up at the stars.This is the Endless Legend.This… is your present.http://www.mush-room.be/startgame/endless-enjoyment/ "

												Compared to Civilization V, this is actually a better game overall. It's just that civ 5 got this ""charm"", this connection with the real world and better balance because the factions are mostly the same.But the addition of.. * Heroes/Governors* Districts (that civ 6 has now implemented)* Items* Military value can be built through just a few units because of armies and items. While in civ 5 it becomes tidious when you have 20+ units to move around.* Unit diversity* Strategic combat system rather than just two units calculating their strength.* Magic and colorful fantasy* Quests..creates another layer of depth and fun on top of the great game civ 5 already is.It's easy to relate and connect with Civilization because it's based on us, but I highly encourage you to get to know this brave new world, even though it might feel a little weird in the beginning.

Yeas i got bashed in the beginning but i wen t on and learned to play the game not to simply repeat the tricks like a trained monkey.People complaining from complexity ?Come on... LEARN AND ADAPT, many races need a bit of adaptation thats the beauty of the game, don t play a diplomatic faction as a warrior, don t play a comercial race as diplomatic one, you may but you will have a hard time.You can win by diplomacy, was, comerce, and some other ways, which is very refreshing.The story is not blah blah blah..... well its a 4X game hard to stay on the tale all the time.The game is far from perfect..ok which is not ?

												Real talk. This plays like Civ. You start with nothing, you end up with spaceships. Not literally, but you know what I mean. But it flips the script because you don't pick a nation with minor benefits, you pick an entire race that is completely different from the others. And these races tend to lean towards a certain playstyle, so you can choose the one you that suits how you want to play for that game. As an example, there is a market in the game where, with the right research, you can buy the resources you don't have for that next city improvement. One of the races controls this market, and gets a cut of all the sales that go through it, and they can even ban you from it as a diplomatic tool. The even crazier thing is you can just mix and match parts of races you like and make your own, because why not? And this gameg handles combat very interestingly. Each race has its own set of 3 units that you keep for the entire game after you research them, but you keep them upgraded with new items and you can have multiple versions ready at any time. Got a type that you made three hours ago that suck but can be pumped out in a turn? Keep it. Then make a new version that has a sword that can kill that weaker guy in one hit. Anything is possible.Its a good game, its got a lot of concepts that I haven't even touched on here, but for a short list:Armies can consist of multiple units that move togetherCombat works by two armies fighting, but nearby armies can join in as reinforcementsCombat is turn based, runs on a zoomed in version of the map, and runs for 6 turns of each sideIts basically DnD combat, with initiative and all that jazz, but it can be skipped with an automatic calculationHeros can be assigned to armies as an  extra super unit that give extra benefits or to a city to boost its production valuesThe world map is split into regions, and only one city can exist per regionThere are minor factions like the city-states of Civ that can be pacified to join your empire. They then help boost production in the city of the region they are inThese minor factions can also be assimilated to have an empire-wide benefit and allow you to produce an entirely new type of unit that can be upgraded like the rest of your armyA quest system, with quests being available from ruins found around the map and from minor factions to pacify themEach race has a main quest that, when fully completed, is a victory conditionMany ways to win, including just making a certain amount of money or performing enough diplomatic actionsIts a great game. Especially half off. Just buy it. "

												Endless Legend is a hexigrid turn based strategy game set in a randomly generated medieval fantasy world that has you making alliances, declaring war and peace with other nations. If it sounds familiar, that's because it is, but there's the promise of turn based battles rather than bumping your units into enemy units. However, its little more than you watching these battles play out on the hexigrid. The entire game amounts to little more than watching a gorgeous painting dry. Its a true time sink for anyone into the genre, but after spending 12 hours into it, I didn't start to ""enjoy"" Endless Legend until about six hours in once I had mastered certain nuances.The game is like several others in the genre, you'll make settlements in regions and grow the settlements and chose their development. Then over time, they'll amass industry, science, food and ""dust"" or the game's currency. Industry gets things done quicker and I wish I had paid attention during the tutorial to know that. Science researches upgrades faster. Food keeps your citizens alive and dust pays for a lot of things. Each settlement will have a default yield of all four resources, including a fifth and that's influence that every so often you'll get to unlock more things that can be upgraded. If you'd like a higher yield, you need to balance your town's populous to put effort into each of the five. Its little more than clicking and dragging an icon from one grid cell to another. These citizens are never seen, its like a statistic that you have control over.Now that everyone is up to speed on these genre as a whole, you'll use these settlements to generate units. You can speed up any process by spending dust to get it done on the next turn. The nation / faction you select will determine the units you can use. Everything from dragons, to ogres, archers to knights and so on. The game breaks down into three different class types, infantry (melee), ranged and support. You can combine units on the world map into an army, so six units into an army, but then the icing on these little cupcakes are heroes, which you can buy for around 2,000 dust. The heroes are tougher than units, but they can still be killed. When they're killed they respawn after a battle with little health. If they're injured, they're disabled for a few battles and you can assign only one hero per army.You'll move your armies around and engage in battles or attack settlements. That's when the army separates back into units. As a general you've moved your armies, and now its up to them to fight on the hexigrid. Before hopping into battle, you've got a choice, manual, spectate or auto. Auto will just tell you what happened, who died, who survived. Spectate will watch the turn based battle play out for a total of six phases. So each unit goes once and that's a phase. If you select manual, at the start of each phase, you'll get to point each of your units at an enemy to attack. Then they'll do what it takes to carry out your order. If they can't do it by the end of their turn, they fall back on your choice of either offense, defense or stand their ground. So if you want an infantry to attack a supporter way in the back, but they just can't reach them in this turn, they'll move as far as they can, and attack someone else instead if you have them set to offense.If a unit is attacked, they'll defend or attack back right then and there, but that counts as their turn. Your units have all sorts of abilities, defense, offense and stats. Your units use the abilities, you don't. You're sitting there watching the whole thing play out up to six phases. After six, if there is no decisive winner its considered a draw and its back to the world map! During the battles, if you have other nearby armies, they'll join the fray as time goes on, so if there's an army two spaces away on the world map, they'll join the battle in phase three. It definitely makes things interesting.Another thing that's interesting is troops from each unit will fall dead, but that doesn't mean they'll be any less effective. So if there are six archers in one unit, five of them are dead, that lone archer can deal as much damage as the six of them. The amount of troops per unit is only a visual aide.So you're not just conquering your enemies, you're winning battles or at least your units are. You'll build boats to get them from place to place, or just walk them. When capturing settlements, you've got a choice, attack or siege. Siege will cut off their resources and weaken them for your attack.Attacking settlements can be difficult to the point that it made me think there was some sort of a glitch. You can keep attacking an enemy and see the damage indicator telling you that you've done 45 damage, but their health doesn't go down. This is the effect of being within city walls or even around a settlement in general.  You'll need to keep attacking them knowing that at some point their health will finally go down. Its a strange hidden mechanic with no reference that they're safely fortified. Settlements also come with extra militia in a garrison. If you can't capture a settlement on that turn, the militia will regenerate.Conquering a new settlement will mean its people will hate you, but you can just arrange some morale boosters to be built. You'll also need to fix whatever problems the settlement has. A few of the cities that I had taken over had food shortages, so I had to reassign the populous from dust (gold) harvesting to food harvesting. The game will warn you if your people are about to starve so you can fix it. In fact the game notifies you of far too much with prompts that you'll need to open. These processes have been done, these units have leveled up, this hero needs you to select their perk.Heroes have perks, just like you as a nation have upgrades. To be honest, there was far too many upgrades and perks that my mind went numb and I just started randomly selecting things. Some of the upgrades boost your harvests. Other upgrades unlock new units. As for the heroes, they'll unlock skills and passive buffs, but again nothing felt like a game changer especially when you have such little control.One interesting facet is the seasonal change. There aren't four seasons, no; here there are just the two. Summer and winter. The winter makes travel slow and starves your people, so if you don't have enough food stored up from the summer months, you might have to pull everyone off of other duties and assign them to food harvesting. It really forces you to use things that most wouldn't even think about when playing.Like most games of this nature, when you start, you can list a lot of specifics such as world size, climate, how many nations and difficulty. You can select random for most of them and hop into a new game generated just for you! The rival nations will watch your actions. If they feel threatened they can declare war or even offer a truce with some rewards if you're about to curb stomp them back down the hole they came out of. Its interesting seeing nation leaders so happy to trade with you or say hey we have common friends, let's be allies! No one asked to travel through my land though and that's usually a good sign that they're about to wage war on you and make a play for a city. There are neutral minor factions too that you'll need to either murder, bribe or negotiate with.I spent twelve hours staring at a beautiful painting and at some point I started auto skipping the battles. I discovered that an easy crushing victory on spectate turns into a draw when auto battling. You're almost forced to watch these slow battles play out and that's just part of Endless Legend. Even if it weren't for the battles, the game is dull, but still gorgeous to look at with beautiful music.  I'm not even sure that I can recommend it to fans of the genre, just because you've played this before, but its now time consuming with these battles you have no control over.			"

												If you are a fan of Civ this is a game you want to try. Allowing you to merge single units into armies. Allows for direct control of city growth, along with the 1 city per region causes player to stop and think and explore before they plop a city down. great game I highly recomend			"

												Was really hoping for a solid civ-style game, and while this game has a lot of cool features and differences than CIV, it is beyond painful when it comes to clunkiness. The pace and length of time to complete a turn is exceptionally long. You can also manually resolve combat (unlike Civ) but you'll only do this once, because as soon as you realize how incredibly SLOW and boring the battle is, you'll promise your future self NEVER to put yourself through that again. Watch incredibly slow mob move two spaces, wait 5 seconds for attack animation, repeat. To let 6 of your units complete one round of moving and firing takes like a minute, it's insane. A single battle which should take no more than a minute, takes several minutes. It's super unfortunate because in a lot of ways this game has many improvements over Civ, but its overall playability is nothing compared to any civ. It honestly feels like work to place this game rather than fun.			"

												It tries, it really does.Endless Legend has good fundamental mechanics in almost all of the empire-building aspects, it has great art, solid writing and nice music. But unfortunately, it's a combat-heavy game that has kind of bad combat. There are units that are downright useless, units and abilities that are overpowered, and the way the mechanics work out, a battle is usually either a breeze or a curbstomp, there are very few battles where your ability as a commander actually matter. It's almost always down to the composition of your army beforehand.There are also other annoyances, like the random quests. ""Go do this thing in this region!"" it says, then never tells you where the region is, if you're lucky, it's right next door, and you can get a head start on your quests(and the ""story"" quests both A) tend to have huge rewards and unique techs/gear, and B) are required for a ""quest"" victory. So it introduces a huge element of random chance). Now imagine some variation on this annoying random chance garbage everywhere in the quest system and you get why the qyuests are more than a little poorly-implemented.It also has a good few expansions at this point and, unfortunately, it suffers from the usual thing in those cases, which is that each expansion is fundamentally well-done... but because they're mutually exclusive they tend to forego actually interacting with each other, which tends to make them feel shallow. Like a game composed of a lot of minigames with limited complexity, rather than one single game with serious complexity.Don't get Endless Legend, however, if they ever do an Endless Legend 2? Get that, because if they can fix what's broken about Endless Legend, it could be an amazing game. Because what they get right, they REALLY get right. "

												I'm no newbie to stragegy games, 4X or otherwise, back from the original Master of Orion up through Endless Space, which I really like. I bought this expecting the same level of awesomeness as Endless Space... and was thoroughly disappointed. Pros : It's pretty, which isn't really a selling point for strategy games, but it's there. The setup of resources is pretty self-explanatory - Food, Industry, Science, and Dust (money). It's basically the same as Endless Space. Sure there are other resources, but I like the simplicity here. If I wanted something more complex I would go back to the Hearts of Iron series. Having seasons actually affect the game was pretty nifty. As far as innovation goes, this is a good one. I wish it was more controllable in the game setup, but maybe that'll come later.Design your own faction and play against them is pretty great. I've loved this feature ever since GalCiv II. Cons : (this might take a while)AI is immune to the approval penalty for expanding AND building burroughs. Sure, human players are ALWAYS gonna be smarter than a video game's AI, but handicapping me in this way kinda made me feel like they took the ""eXpand"" out of the ""4X,"" which is my primary problem with the game. You get penalized for expanding while the AI doesn't, and since the AI likes to just burrough their cities in whatever random direction they want, if you capture that city, your approval rating plummets. Again sure I understand the need to beef the AI so it's a challenge, but this kind of handicap makes me feel like I'm playing a 3X game instead of a 4X one. I'm certain there are other, better ways to handle this. OR the other option is to not advertise it as a 4X game, which I'd also be ok with. On a side note, GalCiv III is out and they're always seeking new ways to tweak the AI so it's a challenge and thus doesn't really need these weird buffs. UI is completely WTF. Some elements are good, but I shouldn't have to search for stuff like ""how long do I have on this siege?"" Also had to dig for how to activate buffs. Combat is clunky. as. hell. Go play Fallen Enchantress or Master of Magic to see how it's done. Seriously, everyone wants to be Master of Magic. The concept is so simple, but somehow everyone misses the target. Immersion is meh. The seasons were nice, but nothing else was compelling about the storyline or the gameplay. For good immersion, go study Emperor of the Fading Suns - while it's a terrible wargame, it does an amazing job of immersing the player in said terrible wargame. Even Endless Space sucked me in - I would play for hours and not realize that it's past midnight. What happened here guys?Difficulty. It's pretty standard that I play the tutorial, which was moooostly good, though it left out some key info. Then my first game I pretty much always set on ""easy,"" or whatever's just below ""normal."" Learning curve. That said, and the fact that I'm not a newbie to strategy games, I still get my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me. Like it's not even a contest. This isn't my first time juggling villagers between production and food, nor is is my first time moving armies around. On easy the game claims that ""the French could win Agincourt."" Still, the AI wipes the floor with me. Did I maybe miss something crucial in the tutorial? Slooooooooooooooooooooow animations. Even if you win / lose a combat, you have to sit through watching the surviving units on the board do a little shuffle. Moving around the map is pretty slow too. Maybe a speed slider for that? I mean I don't want to feel like I'm watching something in fast-forward, but being able to kick it up one notch would be pretty great. Pathing is a complete crapshoot, and when certain spaces or actions cost you ALL the remaining movement, this is a BIG deal. Also if I mis-click an area, no matter how fast I click to correct it, there's no going back. On a side note breaking sieges is pretty wtf too. I had to path clear around my entire city, which took a while during winter, to break a siege. If the attacking army is only on one side of the city, that's not really a ""siege."" That's ""hey let's everyone sneak out the back where it's unguarded."" So yeah, if you want a good 4X fantasy, go give Fallen Enchantress a shot. Or if you're an actual wizard and can get Master of Magic running, play that - it's the original ""weird races + FIDS + fantasy strategy."" If you want a good space 4X, Endless Space is good. For some reason though, they really extra failed with this one. It turned me off enough that I'm proooooobably not gonna buy from Amplitude again.			"

												My first impression of this game was very good.  It has a lot of unique features that make it a great game.  For example one that I like is the Summer/Winter seasons where you need have things prepared before Winter hits & crops won't grow.  Another good feature is the quests which give you something to shoot for while playing.  The tutorial was fairly quick but teaches you enough of the basics to get into a full game.  The combat is similar to Age of Wonders but a little more simplified & automated.  Overall it's a really great game so far!			"

Early Access Review
								Good day to You!Don't turn a blind eye on this game, saying 'Just another 4XStrategy Game'. Well it is just another one, with its own little spin. I'm talking about gameplay mechanics which set this game apart from the likes of Civilization or other 4X games - A few of these features might actually come as a surprise and make this game worth its while. Think of it as Endless Space, well just that suddenly different nations, alien to one another, crashlanded on a planet which already harbored life, bound to be integrated into the empires, so that one may reign supreme.Right from the start of the game you notice the differences, instead of singular troops you move whole armies, sometimes accompanied by Heroes with their own set of skills and items. Talking about items, you can create new troop layouts with better equipment throughout the game and change up the game with the resources you harvested, suddenly your basic archer squad that died to the roaming armies, now takes them on with ease.Combat itself works a lot like it does in Endless Space, just that you position your troops on uneven terrain, target your enemies and roll for iniative! - Combat itself is simulated and several armies, which stand nearby can partake. The roaming armies I spoke of are the native races of the planet, which can be integrated to gain a minor bonus for your empire and will follow you willingly into war against your enemies.The main important feature that I wish to talk about however is the founding of cities. It is alike that of Civ yet very different at the same time: The land is split into regions filled with different encampments, resources and important structures. A region becomes yours as soon as a city is founded in it. So expand your territory wisely, otherwise you might not be able to gain supremecy over your enemies, be they bots or since a recent update human players, fulfill your quest to find out the truth (Yes there is an actual storyline for each nation) and immerse yourself in a beautifully crafted game, which keeps on getting better. The devs certainly know where they are going with this.Check it out, it really is more than worth the money,EnoTeK.			"

												Endless Legend is like Civilization 5 with less gravity and more character.Less Gravity - The status quo in Endless Legend is very fragile. Cities can be captured quickly, and faster still if you choose to automate combat. A single technology can catapult you ahead of the game, and customizable hero units sway the tide of battle with their powerful skill trees. There are lots of fun game mechanics to interact with, and when you properly exploit them, there's this wonderful feeling of getting away with a clever trick.More Character - A beautifully rendered world map with named provinces is yours to conquer. The soundtrack is top notch, and has a sort of mythical, tribal feel to it. Each faction is dramatically different from the others. One can uproot and move their cities, and another that can teleport their units from city to city. Still another ignores food and consumes Dust (the game's currency) to reproduce and heal. Each faction also has a unique quest that you follow throughout the game, and it can interact with your neighboring factions in surprising ways if they accidentally get in the way of your goals. Each playthrough feels like a unique story, and that adds a lot of longevity to a game you're meant to replay many times.The devs are still doing some patching and bug squashing, but the game is exciting, fun, and complete. If you dig 4X style turn-based strategy, don't pass it up!			"

												I love this game.  What else can I say?  In the course of a week, I've poured more hours into playing than I care to admit.  Endless Legend is a refreshing take on the previously stagnant 4x genre.  It introduces several new mechanics, including a more nuanced control over combat sequences, that really make it worthwhile.  Initially, I was a bit dissapointed by how little the game's tutorial covers.  To really understand how the game worked, I had to play several playthroughs and look up information on various forums.  But it was worth it.  I'll be playing a whole lot more of this game, and I look forward to trying out the muliplayer option once I convince enough friends to buy it =P			"

												This, hands down, is the best 4x to come out in recent years. It takes all the good points of Civ (management of resouces, cities, buildings, units, diplomacy ect) and mixes it with some minor unit tactics and hex based battles, as opposed to just running a unit over another and the game calculating the battle (although there is an auto battle feature if you want it). I prepfer the fantasy setting of the game to the real-world setting of Civ, myself.The factions are varied and interesting, and actually do have differences between them as far as they play. (IMHO, many 4x games have only minor differences between the races/factions whatever and its mostly a cosmetic thing). Yes it does have some flaws, but they are minor and overall, its amazingThe 4x genre has been suffering in recent years, but I think this game's going to end up as classic as MoO2. And it deserves to be.			"

												This is a game that is tremendously entertaining now, will hold up 20 years from now.  I've put in 34 hours thus far, 24 on the full released version, and I will say that this is my favorite 4X title of all time.  The beauty, the immersion of storylines, the RPG elements, the soundtrack, and the deep strategy, make it a game that I have to peel myself away from.   Is it a Civ clone?  No.  It's like saying is Far Cry a Half Life clone.  Is it a 4X game?  Yes.  Just scrolling out to the Risk-looking map, and down into the micro view of the cities, and watching the textures bleed in is so satisfying.  Can't recommend enough.			"

												Thumbs up because it is above the good/not good threshold.What I like:1) There's a role-play of the civilization you pick. It also plays into Endless Space (and maybe the other Endless game, but I don't have it). That is a neat feature and I love it2) Visuals for the most part. The map is gorgeous but sometimes it's hard to find that there are lootable sites on it. The unit appearnces and animations are poor, however3) The ability to see tile yields4) The neat way resources are harvested and a part of the game5) Many quests and different ways to approach the gameWhat I don't:1) The super long lag between selecting an action and something happening (no longer a problem - seems like the game is better optimized)2) Encountering units early on that wipe out yours. Particularly because I can't determine the strength of enemies until too late (due to my lack of knowledge. I've learned a LOT through trial and error)3) The long build times for anything. It has the Civ V keep advancing turn 'cause nothing is happening' problem (not as bad as it was when I first got the game - maybe something better optimized)4) Poor Man-Machine-Interface. Too many clicks to accomplish things (nowhere near as bad any more, again suspected to be caused by tweaks to the game)Overall, worth having, but I probably won't play it often. If I see updates, particularly optimization/speeding up things, I might be more patient with it. But a minute plus load time (fast machine, mind you) and then about two minutes from the setup to playing do not a happy ninjaGhost make.[EDIT] Since writing, there have been multiple DLC releases, which greatly improved the game. The load times are still really long, but the feature that allows the player to speed up combat mechanics is very nice and prevents the long delays during fights. Now, this is my favorite city builder ever (just nudged Civ IV out of top billing.> Each race is unique and feels like a completely different game based on who you play> Game mechanics differ for different species> Much deeper experience with all of the modifications.BUY THIS GAME. Seriously. Buy it. Then play it.			"

												Cons first!This game still bears the scars of being an early access game, and being developed on Unity. The 64-bit version is crashy (likely due to Unity), it has unnecessarily high system requirements (also Unity), there's some bits of the game that are still broken like a bunch of the text with the events and quests, and there's a weird sort of general feeling that the game is still not 100% complete. Unity is an awful engine and anyone reading this would be wise to avoid it if they're developing a game. On that note, I'm amazed at how well the devs of Endless Legend managed to polish that turd of an engine. Great effort.Now for the good stuff, and there are a surprising amount of good things about this game!The art direction is simply fantastic. I absolutely love the art in this game, and the artists who worked on it are the best I've seen on any video game. Forget all those pretentious indie games whose main goal is to be art. This game is art, it knows it, and it feels no need to draw undue attention towards it. It's confident in what it is. It even helps the gameplay, and even though the game is hex-based, the landscape art simultaneously removes any jarring inter-hex transitions while also making a hex-grid helper overlay unnecessary. Simply amazing.The gameplay reflects the care and attention they put on the art. It's solid 4X gameplay, every single faction plays very differently, and there's the option to make custom factions to play with and play against. The FIDSI mechanic and the way this game treats land grabbing and city/land improvements is a surprisingly good innovation on the old tired Civ-like mechanics. All strategic and luxury resources are produced on a per-turn basis with different modifiers depending on your faction and any events or quests. Very nice since it avoids the civ-style limited resource wars to prevent being locked out of certain buildings and units, but it also requires you to practice effective resource management.The combat! I saw a lot of grumbling on reviews of this game and it made me hesitant to get it. Originally it seemed as if it was going to have combat like Endless Space, mostly just rock-paper-scissors doomstack-pushing. It was surprisingly different! On combat, armies spread throughout the surrounding landscape and it plays very much like a hex tactics game. Each unit type has different abilities, different strengths, different weaknesses, and these are all modified by your faction type, your technology, your heroes, and your customizable equipment. Equipment and heroes are customizable and you have to pay either production per unit or gold per hero, so you can have cheapo combat troops pushing forward while your expensive combat troops stay behind to finish them off. There's a surprising amount of flexibility here and it's better than most 4X games.The quest system and the minor factions are locked together in terms of mechanics, and overall their random spread gives you something to worry about in the early-game. Not as completely horrendous and violent as pirates or barbarians or aliens in other 4X games, their pacification through quests, bribes, or destruction gives you direct bonuses if you colonize that region, and killing someone else's minor faction villages removes their bonuses from your enemy. They're another interesting strategic facet of the game.The victory conditions are quite odd in that there's 8 of them and they cover almost every possible way you could think of winning a game like this. There's the requisite kill everything, love everything, research everything, and discover everything victories, but there's also a few odd ones like having loads of money and doing your faction's questline. Generally you'll be doing the faction questline or research victories, or an economic victory might sneak out of nowhere and win the game for you. Sometimes the AI will suddenly win an economic victory or pull a diplomatic victory off if you stop watching it. It's all very fun and has a lot of replayability compared to the conquest-dominated or research-dominated victories of Endless Space, or the conquest-dominated victories of the Civ series.Overall this is a very very solid game made by developers who have clearly shown that they can and have improved. Vastly better than Endless Space, much better than pretty much any 4X made in recent years, and overall a very good game. That's coming from someone who liked the civ series (even 4 and V), BE, and Distant Worlds. Endless Legend is a better and more solid game than any of these. Less flashy, perhaps, but excellent in its gameplay and unified direction.If Endless Space was any indication, there will be tons of free DLC packs and patches coming out in the next year or two, followed by an expansion or two, followed by more free DLC packs and patches for people who got the expansions. A very hearty recommend! Get this game if you enjoy 4X games!			"

												It is a beautiful and well made game. It does need some work on the late game and the difficultly is on the easy side. But it is a great fantasy 4x game with great unit design and I haven't really noticed any balance issues.			"

												One of the best 4x games I have played. Played for about 20 hours so far and everything about this game feels thoroughly polished and well thought out. I absolutely love the UI, art, city building, army customisation... Learning curve can be a bit steep, but you'll be able to play effectively on your second game. 10/10 so far!			"

												Endless Legend is like Civilization 5 with less gravity and more character.Less Gravity - The status quo in Endless Legend is very fragile. Cities can be captured quickly, and faster still if you choose to automate combat. A single technology can catapult you ahead of the game, and customizable hero units sway the tide of battle with their powerful skill trees. There are lots of fun game mechanics to interact with, and when you properly exploit them, there's this wonderful feeling of getting away with a clever trick.More Character - A beautifully rendered world map with named provinces is yours to conquer. The soundtrack is top notch, and has a sort of mythical, tribal feel to it. Each faction is dramatically different from the others. One can uproot and move their cities, and another that can teleport their units from city to city. Still another ignores food and consumes Dust (the game's currency) to reproduce and heal. Each faction also has a unique quest that you follow throughout the game, and it can interact with your neighboring factions in surprising ways if they accidentally get in the way of your goals. Each playthrough feels like a unique story, and that adds a lot of longevity to a game you're meant to replay many times.The devs are still doing some patching and bug squashing, but the game is exciting, fun, and complete. If you dig 4X style turn-based strategy, don't pass it up!			"

												Thumbs up because it is above the good/not good threshold.What I like:1) There's a role-play of the civilization you pick. It also plays into Endless Space (and maybe the other Endless game, but I don't have it). That is a neat feature and I love it2) Visuals for the most part. The map is gorgeous but sometimes it's hard to find that there are lootable sites on it. The unit appearnces and animations are poor, however3) The ability to see tile yields4) The neat way resources are harvested and a part of the game5) Many quests and different ways to approach the gameWhat I don't:1) The super long lag between selecting an action and something happening (no longer a problem - seems like the game is better optimized)2) Encountering units early on that wipe out yours. Particularly because I can't determine the strength of enemies until too late (due to my lack of knowledge. I've learned a LOT through trial and error)3) The long build times for anything. It has the Civ V keep advancing turn 'cause nothing is happening' problem (not as bad as it was when I first got the game - maybe something better optimized)4) Poor Man-Machine-Interface. Too many clicks to accomplish things (nowhere near as bad any more, again suspected to be caused by tweaks to the game)Overall, worth having, but I probably won't play it often. If I see updates, particularly optimization/speeding up things, I might be more patient with it. But a minute plus load time (fast machine, mind you) and then about two minutes from the setup to playing do not a happy ninjaGhost make.[EDIT] Since writing, there have been multiple DLC releases, which greatly improved the game. The load times are still really long, but the feature that allows the player to speed up combat mechanics is very nice and prevents the long delays during fights. Now, this is my favorite city builder ever (just nudged Civ IV out of top billing.> Each race is unique and feels like a completely different game based on who you play> Game mechanics differ for different species> Much deeper experience with all of the modifications.BUY THIS GAME. Seriously. Buy it. Then play it.			"

												This is a game that is tremendously entertaining now, will hold up 20 years from now.  I've put in 34 hours thus far, 24 on the full released version, and I will say that this is my favorite 4X title of all time.  The beauty, the immersion of storylines, the RPG elements, the soundtrack, and the deep strategy, make it a game that I have to peel myself away from.   Is it a Civ clone?  No.  It's like saying is Far Cry a Half Life clone.  Is it a 4X game?  Yes.  Just scrolling out to the Risk-looking map, and down into the micro view of the cities, and watching the textures bleed in is so satisfying.  Can't recommend enough.			"

												This, hands down, is the best 4x to come out in recent years. It takes all the good points of Civ (management of resouces, cities, buildings, units, diplomacy ect) and mixes it with some minor unit tactics and hex based battles, as opposed to just running a unit over another and the game calculating the battle (although there is an auto battle feature if you want it). I prepfer the fantasy setting of the game to the real-world setting of Civ, myself.The factions are varied and interesting, and actually do have differences between them as far as they play. (IMHO, many 4x games have only minor differences between the races/factions whatever and its mostly a cosmetic thing). Yes it does have some flaws, but they are minor and overall, its amazingThe 4x genre has been suffering in recent years, but I think this game's going to end up as classic as MoO2. And it deserves to be.			"

												Cons first!This game still bears the scars of being an early access game, and being developed on Unity. The 64-bit version is crashy (likely due to Unity), it has unnecessarily high system requirements (also Unity), there's some bits of the game that are still broken like a bunch of the text with the events and quests, and there's a weird sort of general feeling that the game is still not 100% complete. Unity is an awful engine and anyone reading this would be wise to avoid it if they're developing a game. On that note, I'm amazed at how well the devs of Endless Legend managed to polish that turd of an engine. Great effort.Now for the good stuff, and there are a surprising amount of good things about this game!The art direction is simply fantastic. I absolutely love the art in this game, and the artists who worked on it are the best I've seen on any video game. Forget all those pretentious indie games whose main goal is to be art. This game is art, it knows it, and it feels no need to draw undue attention towards it. It's confident in what it is. It even helps the gameplay, and even though the game is hex-based, the landscape art simultaneously removes any jarring inter-hex transitions while also making a hex-grid helper overlay unnecessary. Simply amazing.The gameplay reflects the care and attention they put on the art. It's solid 4X gameplay, every single faction plays very differently, and there's the option to make custom factions to play with and play against. The FIDSI mechanic and the way this game treats land grabbing and city/land improvements is a surprisingly good innovation on the old tired Civ-like mechanics. All strategic and luxury resources are produced on a per-turn basis with different modifiers depending on your faction and any events or quests. Very nice since it avoids the civ-style limited resource wars to prevent being locked out of certain buildings and units, but it also requires you to practice effective resource management.The combat! I saw a lot of grumbling on reviews of this game and it made me hesitant to get it. Originally it seemed as if it was going to have combat like Endless Space, mostly just rock-paper-scissors doomstack-pushing. It was surprisingly different! On combat, armies spread throughout the surrounding landscape and it plays very much like a hex tactics game. Each unit type has different abilities, different strengths, different weaknesses, and these are all modified by your faction type, your technology, your heroes, and your customizable equipment. Equipment and heroes are customizable and you have to pay either production per unit or gold per hero, so you can have cheapo combat troops pushing forward while your expensive combat troops stay behind to finish them off. There's a surprising amount of flexibility here and it's better than most 4X games.The quest system and the minor factions are locked together in terms of mechanics, and overall their random spread gives you something to worry about in the early-game. Not as completely horrendous and violent as pirates or barbarians or aliens in other 4X games, their pacification through quests, bribes, or destruction gives you direct bonuses if you colonize that region, and killing someone else's minor faction villages removes their bonuses from your enemy. They're another interesting strategic facet of the game.The victory conditions are quite odd in that there's 8 of them and they cover almost every possible way you could think of winning a game like this. There's the requisite kill everything, love everything, research everything, and discover everything victories, but there's also a few odd ones like having loads of money and doing your faction's questline. Generally you'll be doing the faction questline or research victories, or an economic victory might sneak out of nowhere and win the game for you. Sometimes the AI will suddenly win an economic victory or pull a diplomatic victory off if you stop watching it. It's all very fun and has a lot of replayability compared to the conquest-dominated or research-dominated victories of Endless Space, or the conquest-dominated victories of the Civ series.Overall this is a very very solid game made by developers who have clearly shown that they can and have improved.

Early Access Review
								Good day to You!Don't turn a blind eye on this game, saying 'Just another 4XStrategy Game'. Well it is just another one, with its own little spin. I'm talking about gameplay mechanics which set this game apart from the likes of Civilization or other 4X games - A few of these features might actually come as a surprise and make this game worth its while. Think of it as Endless Space, well just that suddenly different nations, alien to one another, crashlanded on a planet which already harbored life, bound to be integrated into the empires, so that one may reign supreme.Right from the start of the game you notice the differences, instead of singular troops you move whole armies, sometimes accompanied by Heroes with their own set of skills and items. Talking about items, you can create new troop layouts with better equipment throughout the game and change up the game with the resources you harvested, suddenly your basic archer squad that died to the roaming armies, now takes them on with ease.Combat itself works a lot like it does in Endless Space, just that you position your troops on uneven terrain, target your enemies and roll for iniative! - Combat itself is simulated and several armies, which stand nearby can partake. The roaming armies I spoke of are the native races of the planet, which can be integrated to gain a minor bonus for your empire and will follow you willingly into war against your enemies.The main important feature that I wish to talk about however is the founding of cities. It is alike that of Civ yet very different at the same time: The land is split into regions filled with different encampments, resources and important structures. A region becomes yours as soon as a city is founded in it. So expand your territory wisely, otherwise you might not be able to gain supremecy over your enemies, be they bots or since a recent update human players, fulfill your quest to find out the truth (Yes there is an actual storyline for each nation) and immerse yourself in a beautifully crafted game, which keeps on getting better. The devs certainly know where they are going with this.Check it out, it really is more than worth the money,EnoTeK.			"

								This game is an EARLY ACCESS, which means contents are not 100% available yet. Made by the creator's of Endless Space, this title is yet another awesome game by them, whith a spice from Endless Space and inspirations from Civilization, it takes place on ground in a fantasy setting rather than futuristic in space.Although this is a game that I am really looking foward into, it is having a certain of bugs that could be by-passed by restarting the game. I know people will compain about them and give negative reponses, but Rome was not being built in one day!So far in the game, as of 10th May, 2014, I enjoyed the game a lot after beating Outlast: Whistleblower and Dark Souls II. I just can't wait until next update in which new content are going to be delivered, keep up the good work, devs!   :)			"

												As a gamer I am not usually a fan of 4x type games. I generally prefer strategy games like Xcom, where it is more focused onshort, intense battles than total empire building. However Endless Legend not only managed ot keep me interested, it became one of my favorite games of the year. What I think sets it apart more than anything else, is the story elements of the game. If anyone is familiar with the internet personality Angry Joe, one of his favorite things about games like this and Xcom is the ability to easily craft stories of your own. The light story elements that each race has throughought the game is a perfect setting for your own legends. For example, in my first game I played as the Broken Lords. Even as the years went on and my empire grew and flourished and waned, I had many units that lived and died. However there was one that never did. There was one group of Stalwarts that I started with when I booted up the map for the first time. This group of soldiers became a Legendary figure to my people, being the icon of our strength to all. It is little things like these that truly brought me into the game. I didn't feel like an outsider that was simply watching over the world. I felt like this was MY world.			"

Early Access Review
								This is not a game about tactical battles. I expected the battles to be similar to CIv 5 when I looked at the screenshots. But this is not the case. I prefer to play this game with auto battle resolution and this is no bad thing here.This is a very enjoyable empire builder game with the focus on decision making and exploring. Which technologies do you skip and what do you research first? How fast do you expand your controlled regions and cities? How much money do you put in your defenses? Do you strive for peace or war? There are many alternate paths to victory and I enjoy the faction diversity.In my first game I was a little disappointed with the crispness of the graphics, but thankfully this was only due to the low graphics settings that are selected by default. So my advice, crank up the settings before your first game.I stayed up late for my first game and could not wait to get up in the morning to continue my next one. Last time this happend to this extend was with Civ II many years ago. So my verdict: highly recommended!			"

Early Access Review
								This will be my first review, actually, so cut me some slack. I'll goo through things I find important.First off, all these features about bonus factions and mini factions like Drakens that you can get through early access will not be given to you DURING early access. You will have them, but not until later on. I decided this was important because I spent 3 separate games trying solely to find the little mini factions and all that.Second off, there are multiple features in here that are shown, but not yet accessible- namely the tutorial mode. Thankfully, there ARE tutorials out there on youtube, and pretty good ones at that. If you're not one for tutorials, I figured out most of what the game has to offer by the time I finished my 5th game. Also not available are little things like adding friends into your game, setting your army to standby until an enemy enters it's vision, and so on. Pretty much the only feature I found to be excrutiating when left out was the tutorial, but that was most certainly due to the fact that I've never really played a game like this before, actually.Thirdly, I never needed to use the CD keys-yes, there are two for the founders- so I'm not sure if I'm actually playing the most up to date version or anything.  The game still works, mind, but I'm just wondering if I'm breaking any rules. I HAVE the key. I  would LIKE to put it in, but the game isn't asking for it.Now that those three extremely important details are over with, let's go over what I like and dislike.Compliments:1. For a non-gaming rig like mine, the graphics are still gorgeous. Seriously, the detail in the land you will see is astonishingly good.2. The music is very much focused on ambience, except when you are manually taking part in battles and such. That said, it creates the PERFECT feel for the game.3. For an early access, they really did well with the settings. There are a ton of options focused solely on adapting the notifications system (which is so, so nice.... really, it's amazing.), but it is extensive in other areas as well. Suffice it to say you will be able to adapt the game almost entirely to your liking, when playing against AI's. I still am not sure how playing against other players will change things, but I'm looking forward to that.4. Despite the lack of tutorial, it was easy enough someone entirely new to the genre to pick up and puzzle out. After my third game (and I hadn't finished any at that point, I was just trying characters until I unlocked the 3rd Age), I was comfortable in my knowledge of it. So it's pretty intuitive if a guy like me can learn the ropes in such a short time.For the most part, that's all I want to reveal about this game, as I sincerely want those reading to have plenty left to discover when they play it.Complaints:1. No tutorial. My biggest, most important complaint.2. This game does crash every once in a while. On the bright side, it autosaves quite often, and I'm never forced to backtrack very far when I load the game up again, so it's really just a minor inconvenience.3. I find it VERY hard to make peace with other people. For some arcane reason, they just never take that option, so it always ends up being a war. Quite annoying. That said, it's probably MY fault, I just haven't figured out why yet....That's it. Three complaints is all I can muster against an ALPHA version. This game is so darn good that once the bugs get ruled out and all the features are there, this game is pretty much a must-have. If you read this long review, I thank you for sticking with it, and I hope it persuades you into buying it as soon as possible- it's so worth it.			"

												I will compare this to Civ 5 since most people will probably have had experience with that title, due to the fact it can be considered one of the most popular 4x games out there right now.Endless Legend is a 4x game similar to Civ 5 but with many changes and improvments that makes it really stand out from Civ. First off, I always found the nations in Civ 5 to be really similar to one another. Two things would be differnt between them all, like a unique unit or building and a special ability that most of the time I don't really notice and thats it, everything else is pretty cookie cutter and the same. Now I can understand why it's like that, human civilizations did develop and have similar technologys at around the same as eachother. But since Endless Legend is set in a fantasy setting they could develop these really unique factions. They all play and look and feel differnt. For instance, one faction is a cult of creepy living doll like beings who can only build one city,but they can pretty much build it into a super city and can convert minor factions to there cult to do there bidding! Or how about another faction where you can't really do much diplomatically and you are just one big war mongering swarm of blood thirsty zerg-like insects who spread in a fashion similar to the zombie plauge that feed on your fallen enemies? And on the opposite end of the spectrum, You have the opportunity to play as dragons that use there vast knowledge and prestige to force people to do what you want them to do through the power of diplomacy? And who says actions speak louder than words?Alot of thought as gone into this game, not just gameplay wise but lore wise aswell. This game boasts a very deep and interesting lore that shares the same universe with 3 other games this developer has well...developed. Not only are the factions histories deep but the worlds is too. It's an absolute joy to read up on the lore of this games and those connected to it. If you like deep lore I am sure you will enjoy what this game has to offer.The graphics are nice too, they are not next gen or anything, but they are good looking. They use them very well too and make a world that looks very imaginative such as trees shooting blazing flames from its branches, large forbidding pits that lead down to dens which contain giant spider women hybrids. And so on and so fourth. The game also contains 2d art aswell which looks stunning. Some of it is even animated and is very nice to watch.Some gameplay elements that differ from Civ 5 and this game is that this game got rid of manually telling what tiles you wanted to be worked,now every tile that is in the cities range is automatically being worked on. So instead you can now put your workers into these little check boxes that will increase the amount of resources you gain that that particular check box represents. Some people may have liked the micro management that civ 5 had in that respect but I personally found it tedious and boring and much prefer this system of doing it which gets you the same outcome but with alot less time wasted. Another change is the research tree in this game. You dont have to know specific technologies in this game to get more powerful versions of previous ones, or to advance to the next era, you just have to research enough of the current era to advance to the next era. Battles are differnt too. When units fight they take a small portion of the surrounding map and then have turn based tactical fights going on. Using the terrian is important since it gives you boosts in combat and you have to be weary of your units stats since they matter quite a bit in these skirmishes.There's alot more to this game that I haven't touched, and it would take a long while to explain it all, but I hope that you get a good idea of what this game is about and its quality. If your a fan of 4x games, fantasy or just strategy games in general I think you wont regret giving this game a try.			"

AMPLITUDE Studios is not a name that is up there with the big ones, yet they have produced 3 games that did reasonably well and have been on the Steam spotlight several times: Endless Space, Dungeon of the Endless and this one (with Endless Space 2 expected later in 2016). The Endless lore connecting the 3 games together, albeit not interactive.While Endless Space received some critique on lack of personality, Endless Legend spins around any issues with a thorough execution. It has netted Aggregator & Publication score marks above 80% and a RPS GOTY 2014.Do like it?The beauty of Endless Legend is that of all the 4X I have played, this is one I can come back to (after a year), load up a save game and play right away without thinking that I should probably start over. Things make sense, the logic is there and one can jump right back in, even though there's layers of: quest running, customizing, ruins attending, resource managing, city governing, weather calculating and village raiding - just to name a few.Yes, I do like it.Moreso than I do the latest iterations of Civilization or any of the other 4X TBS. It's a colorful game, brilliantly molded to fit your tastes through customization of the map, factions, units, cities and even armies. One can grow their cities, level their heroes and units. It is entirely possible to hire mercenaries and have them attack another faction without them knowing you sent them. Then there are the quests: world events, faction quests, side quests, village quests, ruin(dungeon) quests. These all add flavor to the game so you always have something to do in that turn, even if it is just army movement.Do recommend it?Had this game since 2014, but the shortcut has never once left my desktop screen. I have currently a little over 100 hrs logged playing it due to the fact that this game wasn't optimized for integrated graphics at first. However, Amplitude has remedied that and the game plays like a charm. So, likely those hours will increase.I do, including the DLC.Endless Legend is a full game that happens to have DLC expansions.So, if you're into 4X TBS with RPG elements, you're good to go with this one!

												9/10Civilization 5 has got a serious contender for the Throne. If your a fan of Civ this should be in your library already.For the casual and new the genre I'll start off by saying that this game can be a bit slow paced and the learning curve makes for some frustrating early moments. However there is more depth here than in just about every other game I've played this year. If you like strategy, sim, godgames you've got to let yourself experience this.Enjoy			"

												Wonderful game, in my opinion much deeper & more varied then Civ (although don't get me wrong, Civ is amazing).PROS- Each playable race plays distinctly different from another- More to combat than stats & dice rolls- Great UI, easy to navigate- Great art style, animations, music all work together well- LORE, also extends to the other games, which gives a great continuity to the worldCONS- Much more complicated then CIV (a pro in my opinion, but not for everyone)- Lot's of menus, finding information can be difficult at first- mid-late game is often a slog- Games can run away from you (get you in a position where it's very difficult to win)- Playable races, though fun, are not balanced well- Guests can be fun, or can build up & be ignored "

												Fun game, but the winter mechanic makes longer games extremely tedious, particularly after about turn 300 or so. Play through the tutorial or read the manual because there are a number of functions essential to playing that aren't common to other games in the genre. A steeper learning curve than comparable games like Civ5 but extremely addicitve.If you are running 64-bit windows you need to download the 32-bit patch or it will start crashing on you constantly. The patch can be found in the Steam library. Right click on Endless Legend, click on properties, betas tab, and select the 32-bit for 64-bit users. Clears up all the crashing issues.			"

												This game is just great. It feels almost perfect the way it is done. The graphics are incredible, the immersion is complete. It's a masterpiece of a game.The combat, many people complain about it but I find it to be within the most strategic combat system I have ever seen in a non-Total-War 4X.You provide orders before the start of a turn. Units with higher initiatives start first. Not only you need to make the correct assumption concerning your units, but you need to make assumptions with the other player moves. If you are for example playing Stalwarts, you know you'll play last, so you won't tell everyone to attack a specific unit because probably it will have moved somewhere else. At this point your units will start disturbing one an another and you'll lose the battle. So in this case you must builda strategy to make sure your defense will hold, units will support each other etc. On the opposite, you play a faster faction, it will be easier to plan how the turn will evolve, but certainly your units are weaker so you must take advantage of having the initiative to kill where the enemy is weak.IT IS A GREAT GAME!!!!!! You have to buy it.			"

												This game is super good! The music is excellent, exciting gameplay, simple easy-to-use HUD. Right click to exit an ingame menu is awesome. I recommend this game to anyone who likes 4X games. I've played Civilizaton a lot, and this game got me hooked even more, however I'm still a new Endless Legend player with little experience.A little con: The untis look a bit wierd at first glance, but you'll get used to it. I think it would be better with a more cartoonish approach, however it may break the game from the Endless Universe, and I don't want that!Update: All the DLC-s worth it! It's my favorite 4x, until Endless Space 2 is finished.			"

												Very solid game for a 4X strategy game.Stunning Visuals. Character models very detailed and extremely well made. A nice array of equipment to choose and equip your heroes and troops. The game has quite a lot of factions to play and they do play very differently from one another, giving you a lot of replay value, as well as a lot of play styles and strategies to use.For instance you can go and build a huge empire with an entire array of cities with a certain faction, bur this same strategy might not work so well with another faction.The game does offer a lot of depth in almost every single aspect of a turn based 4X strategy game. You have a whole lot of resources you can explore and make use of, a lot of special tiles with different effects. Minor factions you can actually assmilate to your empire and add to your strategies.Heroes leveling is also interesting, since you can have quite a few options to focus on, such as a army commander or a city mayor.Another truly commendable aspect of the game is its soundtrack. Its really amazing, one of the best I've seen in this genre so far. You never, absolutelly never get tired of it. Most important, you do not find yourself thinking that this soundtrack is annoying, or turning its volume down.You should certainly get this game!			"

												Beautifully done. The game plays extremely well, has some great strategic depth, the lore is engaging and fairly original, and there always seems to be new ways to play the game. It also doesn't hurt that the game looks really nice and has an OST worth listening to on its own. From what I've seen, the devs are active, care about the playerbase, and actually listen to valid ideas and critique. The standard version is pretty much the average price of a new big name release nowadays, if not cheaper. The only real problems  I've run into with it is occasional graphic and memory issues, and I'm pretty sure that's user-end, so I can't really let it affect my opinion of the product as when it works, it works very well. If you like strategy games and civilization-growing/4X-type games, you can't go wrong with Endless Legend.9/10			"

Graphics are pretty good for today.Sounds are lacking  , you pretty much feel like you are hearing the same soundtrack every game. Races are interesting and fun to play with . Never a dull race. Gameplay. easily accessible. Mods and custimization makes the game further accessible.  It is really a must have if you like 4x.

												Currently my favorite 4X game (although Stelaris is a close second). Zoomable detail levels on the map are particularly well handled (and the art assets are really nice). I played an absurd number of hours of Civ II when it first came out and this is the first one that has merited a second playthrough.My only grump is that I wish there was a more consistent set of hot keys (clicking through notifications that you just want a quick look at gets tedious by turn 400).

												I suppose this one already has zillions of positive reviews. I don't care - I'll add another one. I played for... maybe an hour? and I can already see this is a pretty good game. I thought I would have to play Shogun 2 for the rest of my life but Endless Legend might save me.In short, this is probably your game if:-you liked Eador/Broken World but wanted it to be a bit more complex-you liked Civilization and wished it would go fantasy-you liked Civ and wanted a bit better battle system-you like games where skill and luck both play a part-you like customisable games-you are not a big hack&slash fan but rather like to plan and learn-you like large games with specific goals-you like the idea of combined adventure and empire buildingOne of the best features so far: the game got stuck when a battle was just starting (waiting for opponent). Most games would have crashed at this point, but EL let me save the game, reload it, and start the battle - this time successfully. This is some good coding the way I see it.(The rest of the review is mostly just rambling. tl;dr works here.)After playing for a day or so:I'm hooked. I don't know if this game is much deeper than the ordinary 4X game, but it feels that way. It seems as if the designers have taken the best bits of several different games of different genres and slapped together a frankensteinian.... you get the point. Let me elaborate a bit:-you get tasks, major and minor. Some are very easy and can be completed on the spot if you have the right resources about you, some take at least 50 turns to complete. This alone keeps the game going for me.-you battle against different beings with VERY customisable armies (and the customization actually makes a difference).-you have heroes that progress and can use different weapons, armor and trinkets. This is one of my favourite aspects of any game.-you develop your empire. This works pretty much the same as in Civ: grow too fast (or too large) and the people will rebel. Science seems to be the key, along with a few other factors. More interesting mechanics than in any comparable game I've played.-tactics and strategy work together in (at least) a couple of different ways. Not sure yet if it gets more complicated/many-sided as the game progresses. I hope it does.-winter. A great idea.-empire boosters. A great idea.The battle screen could be better... I would be overawed if this game had similar battles as Total War games have - but this is no big deal. The strategic side is more important.The game, all in all, is like a souped-up version of Heroes of Might and Magic or similar, if you want it in a nutshell. Like a rocket is a souped-up version of a slingshot missile.After two days of play: It's hard to quit and go to bed. Very immersive. The graphics look great - at first they looked a bit clumsy but the idea is that different elevations of landscape are easier to see. Fun to play. Challenging enough. Looks good. What else could you ask of a video game? Non-stop action perhaps, but that one's not my thing. I have an attention span.I will edit this review after getting through some campaigns.			"

												I highly recommend this game! I've been a long time fan of 4X games and I find Endless Legend perfectly balances heroes alongside the traditional 4X experience. Where Endless Legend stands out is the differences between civilizations. Nearly every civilization stands out and feels like a completely new experience. Many other games only differentiate civilizations with a few units and bonuses. In Endless Legend it feels like a completely new game when you load up a new Civilization. I've recently played other games *cough Civ VI*and found myself going back to Endless Legend because of it's perfect mix of accessibility and depth. It doesn't take 50+turns to begin to feel invested in your civilization, from the very beginning the quest system helps guide you through pacifying local tribes and expanding your empire. I didn't take to the game until they second time I started it - the wealth of customization can be overwhelming at first but if you can focus on the game and pay attention to the tooltips (Upgrade your units weapons!) you'll be rewarded with hours of immersive gameplay.

The turns late game go for a very long time and it prevents me from getting enjoyment from the late game. That said though it is still worth getting if you like 4X games and good art, if its on sale then its a steal and all the expansions i have played released by them have been fairly priced and add more depth to the game9/10			"

												Endless legend is a wonderfully in depth 4x strategy game set in a rich and unique fantasy universe.  There is exploration, diplomacy, city buidling, tactical combat, and so much more.  Every playable race feels very unique, albeit some more unique than others.  While Civilization may be considered king of the genre, EL is a much needed breath of fresh air as it isn't afraid to do many things differently, and not just differently, better.  For those coming from Civilization, which I expect is most of you, you should note that this is a hard core 4x game comparitavly.  Endless Legend's strength is unfortunatly its only weekness.  It has far more complexity and inovation than other titles, but it does nothing to ease players into it.  It is by no means the quagmire you might see from something like Europa Universalis, but it is fair to point out that it WILL take some work to get the hang of it.Overall, each game plays out faster than CIV,  and the multiplayer is actually put together so much better.  While sparse on players on some days, I have never found problems on the whole of finding people to play with.  And even better, if the host has an expansion you don't, you still get to play it.Overall if you are a fan of the genre and want an amazing breath of fresh air, this is the game to get.  It excells at just about everything it does, and even without expansions it is an incredibly solid game; altough i do recommend getting the major expansions.  The complexity and difficulty arise out of the newness of the concepts in the game and the complete lack of a competent turtorial.  But if you can get over this hump,  you won't be in for an experience on par with Civilization, you will get to play a game that I think is even better.			"

												 TL;DR - AI can be dumb and underwhelming but game fun and unique none the less.     The game is really fun but the AI military wise is utterly pitiful. E.g. At endgame I was using the base melee soldiers ( Didnt know there was soldier custimazation till I saw the soldier naming endgame of enemies that run) as the Vaulters going againest the Vaulter reskin and everyone else and completly steamrolling their revised 27 time soldiers and heroes. The AI in diplomatic situations can be rather stupid sometimes, I call for peace early game, They break it and go cold war even though it says ""Fears Your military might"" under their name, its also quite hard to acually make a beneficial deal (For me) with them at any given moment.     Dont get me wrong tho, everything else made in the  game was great; The sea forts, Winter, questing, districts, how territory is divided, policies, market, governers, Krakens or some seprent thing thats cool none the less, custimization, unique tech tree options, tribes, looks great, great spelling, many endings, and etc...

												Amongst the many 4x fantasy strategy games, this is the one that for me mostly re-creates Masters of Magic, even though there is no magic. The kind of troop management, and the variety of troops, villages, natives and vastness of the world is commendable.These people seem to like this ""endless"" setting, having done a 4x fantasy, a 4x sci-fi and even a sci-fi dungeon crawler. Next i'm expecting a visual novel just to round up the genres. XDSeriously, though. The only problem that i find in this game is that it seems very forgiving. I mean i have a race  that by design is limited to >A SINGLE CITY< which i took just to see how screwed i could get in a single playthrough, yet i'm in the third era (out of 4) an i yet have to be obliterated into oblivion. And i only have the 4 troops (plus 3 militia) that you are allowed to keep in the city (plus a few roaming ones). And yes, it's the first time i'm playing this game.So... yes, a tad too easy. But if you can forgive this thing the game itself is strangely enough full of lore to explore and full of strange sights, resources and friends to meet. It even has (weirdly enough for a 4x title) a quest system that allows you to pacifically annex neutral cities. It's weird but i dig it.			"

Early Access Review
								This is an awesome game. My friends that love civ V say that this is much more enjoayable. I personally didn't love Civ V, but this blew me away. The graphics are beatiful, the customization vast and the story great. You might say, there is no campaign, but you are missing something. Each faction has their own major questline, along with amazing lore. For instance you have to parley with 2 villages to find out more about your brothers death ( ardent mages faction). It is plain old amazing. The multiplayer is fine, as long as the host is a baby and disconnects when you start seigeing him( That sucks), but the game is in beta... They will improve multiplayer. If the game stayed just like this, didn't even change or fix more bugs ( ther aren't too many.), I would still buy it anyday. The factions are all 100% unique and play differently( there is going to be 8 in total, there are 6 as of tomorrow.) You can have trade routes and ship harbors and highways and pillars and blah blah blah. If you are considering this game, buy it. It is one of the best games I've ever played.                                                                                                                                      ~SincerelyGamingmantis			"

								If you liked Endless Space, Civilization, HoMM, or a lot of other strategy games where you build cities and invade places, you'll love this. For an Early Access, it feels remarkably polished. Several featrues are missing but what has been released in the current version is well done and fun.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a first glance review as I've only had one hour of gameplay so far, however I do feel it's enough since I've played games by this studio before. First off, for an early access game it doesn't feel like anything is missing, after playing the tutorial, and an hour of real game, it feels like it is complete. Units all feel balanced (even if it IS possible to get some OP roaming armies kicking down your door in the first 20 turns) and the ability to customize heroes and units feel similar to unit customization of other 4x games by this studio, but again, more robust. To go into detail, you upgrade individual items through research, you equip basic unit types by creating new units off of your base units, then giving them equipments of differing tiers, like if you could create armies in a similar way to equiping a WOW character.Assimilating nearby cities feels like a great way to add unique races to your population, I've never seen a strategy game that had that system before. For how the ame feels and handles, it is VERY inuitive. You never feel like its holding your hand throughout, but 4X games are plagued with hard UI and steep learning curves, something this game doesnt have. The tutorial can be skipped altogether and most people could play without issue.The theming of the game is also very fun. I personally enjoy high fantasy lore, and this game definately feels unique while still staying true to the Tolkien feel of most good fantasy games. Monsters are varied, quests and history are detailed, and the world generation is robust and fun to explore. It is also very beautiful.Frankly it doesnt feel like an alpha stage game. Perhaps I'll run into some issues later, but for the first hour, nothing has gone wrong, and I've been having a blast.The only thing I would suggest for this game is to include at least twice as many races to choose from, as the worlds can be massive (up to 8 players suggested) while there are only 7 player races. The studio who created Endless legend also brought one of my favourite space strategy games to life with a similar race selection, and it felt limited in the same way. There is only one race with a conquest suggested victory condition, similar to econemy and diplomacy, while there are two science races. Seems like this could be expanded, especially when the game feels so replayable. It would feel stale fighting across the ages with the same 7 races. As this game feels so much like a fantasy Civilization game, perhaps 14-20 unique races could be written (not a hard request as the requirey only a unique city, some faction art, 4 race specific units, faction questline, and traits, which is not much compared to most strategy games).This game is also a bit of a CPU hog, for slower computers you may want to play more limited maps, but again, I experienced no great framerate drops or lag, or even freezing that I experience on comparable strat. games. Review at a glance 8/10.Great artEach race feels  uniqueNew concepts that work wellSoundtrack is sexyQuests are pretty metalUI is intuitive and easy to learnDifficulty can be erraticFeels limited in regards to races and unitsAI is pretty stupid, for now (think civ5 mixed with any game from this studio)			"

												Perhaps one of the best 4X style games I have ever played, hands down. To be quite honest, Civilization used to be my favorite game in the 4X category. I grew up playing that and the Age of Empires games. Unfortunately for my childhood memories, these games pale in comparison to the content, richness, and style that Endless Legend gives.When I first saw this game on steam, I originally thought what most people thought: ""Oh great, another Civilization rip-off."" When I saw this was on-sale in some pack, I decided to purchase it just to see what it was. The moment I started the game, I was blown away. It runs better, it looks better, it plays better, there's more people playing it, and it has amazing support. Furthermore, if you have Games2Gether points, you can help shape the game itself (not that feedback doesn't, but the points system is pretty cool).  And finally, it's challenging. I STILL haven't been able to beat the AI on Endless mode yet, even though the hardest difficulty in Civ 5 is a cakewalk. This game was worth the 29.99$ I spent for it in the pack, and I'd gladly spend 150$ flat for this game, with no add-ons (which, by the way, are amazing). It is that good, and I recommend this over any other 4X game, including Endless Space, another game by the same publisher. I honestly have never been more impressed by a videogame than this one, and I have played a LOT of games. Don't take just my word for it though, read all the other reviews, most will say the same thing. This game is amazing.  "

								Though still in Alpha Testing and being rough around the edges due to that fact, the game already has great gameplay.  It does tend to crash, but for an alpha it is already as good as other similar games I've played of the same genre.  If you've ever played Endless Space, this is basically a must.  It has elements of many of the current turn-based games but has it's own unique feel, play, and style that anyone can quickly enjoy.			"

												Damn, can't believe, that there is such a huge amount of negative reviews on EL. It is great and balanced turn based fantasy strategy game made with diligence and love. While playing it you will enjoy charming graphics, charismatic characters, challenging gameplay. At the same time you need to be expirienced turn base strategy player in order to master the game and win it. It's not CIV 5 (which I adore), where you work out a single strategy and only make a several correction to it, determined by the start region. In EL world you can't do that, you can't pick Tradition - Commerce - Rationality - Order, build few wonders and discover artillery. Every game is really unique. Also all nations in the game are really very different and it is great to play for each of them. Buy the game, if you like turn based strategy games and also like to see into a big new strategy worlds and concepts. You will love it. Just relax and do not try to understand it all at once. Play 1-3 games for one race, read a guide on it, try one more time and go to the next one. I hope AMPLITUDE will gift us more DLCs for EL and in a few years we will see EL 2. Thank you!			"

												This could be viewed as a fantasy version of the Civ series with the same kind of quality and graphical finish but with a richer and more developed background. Take control of one of several races each with their own challenges and abilities and lead them to greatness. Use your units to subjugate or diplomatically ally yourself with minor factions around the map, destroy your enemies or go for the diplomatic victory. In contrast to Civ it also has a simple combat system where your units can be given general orders and fight it out on a replica of the strategic map meaning that where you engage enemies can actually make a difference. Research and science progresses through a tree system allowing you to determine your own path of advancement but then impacts on the game worl by unlocking the ability to build new buildings on the strategic map outside of your cities, craft new items for your heroes and equip your troops with new weapons / armous.

												eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate....This, by far is the best 4X Strategy game i have ever play. It has the best city management system and the exploration is so great, there are a lot of unique neutral faction in each region, interesting quest and rewards, and a several ways to win the match. You can win by economics, elimination, quest and a lot more...The things i don't like in this game is you have to gain access of peace treaty research in order to do it and it's in the 2nd era. The diplomacy is not widely enough for early game, it shouldn't need to be unlocked in order to do it, total war has more freedom of diplomacy system but endless legends is more wide when all of the diplomatic research has been unlocked. Overall, this game is great it really is game of the year of 2014. Heavily recommended for PC gamers...			"

The diplomatic games are what makes this fun and different from Civ games, so don't buy Endless Legend unless you plan to play it with other people as the AI is no good for that.			"

												Endless Legend is a tbs similar to Civ 5, but instead of culture, research, faith, currency, etc it has the Endless system of Dust, Production, Research, and Influence. There are also plenty of luxury and strategic resources which accumulate over time instead of each node providing a set #. Units are not phased out, but instead they level up and the equipment can be customized and upgraded as your research and resources grow.			"

												Endless Legend may prove to be my favourite 4X game ever. With most games of this kind, I get bored after a few playthroughs and don't have any incentive to stick with them. Not so with EL. While the game doesn't have any revolutionary mechanics (though the different playstyles and storyline of each faction is a nice touch), there is something going on that is all too often neglected in 4X games, and this is ATMOSPHERE.When playing EL, I feel like I'm part of a fantasy epic, a struggle of nations in a dying world. The stylistic world map evokes the feeling of actual PLACES rather than an abstract map to push pieces on. The regions I build up or conquer become more than just a bunch of numbers and resource indexes, and gain a character of their own. The graphic style, illustrations, flavor text and lore makes this game so much more than the some of its parts.Granted, I am still quite a newbie in this game, and I am still in the progress of my first playtrhough on Serious difficulty. I can understand the criticisms of hardcore 4X fans complaining about the AI (My second playthrough was on Hard and I barely broke a sweat, even though I am NOT a hardcore gamer at all), but on Serious, it seems to provide just the right amount of challenge for me.All in all, a great game and I enjoyed every minute spent with it so far. I am sure it will be a long time before I get bored with it, and then with the modding support having been added, I hope that we can expect a good number of UMCs in the future.P.s. anyone knows why all Vaulters have Hungarian names? :)			"

												Think of this game as Civ 5. But with better combat and in a fantasy setting. The factions all act uniquely and the ai is decent. Combat is much better than civ 5. Armies have individual units that move independently during a battle. Managing a city is fairly simple, you have workers that you can assign to different tasks depending on what you need. And the quest system is a great addition to the somewhat boring win by diplomacy or military might. I would definetly recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based strategy games.			"

												This game basically built on everything you liked about Civ V and skipped all the stuff you disliked about Civ VI. Yes it's a deeply complex game, but the rules are never arbitrary and it's depth allows for some incredible designs. You have breadth to win the game how you'd like, and it keeps you engaged even if you never wage war against an opponent. Also, rather than doom stacks, you have a max number of units in a space and then when a fight breaks out, all nearby units are also called into battle, merging Civ IV and Civ V.As well, the detail in the science component of the game is astounding. Each technological advance feels like you've actually gained something palpable and useful, and you have the liberty to decide how much of a focus science is in each specific age. Lastly, just the sleek uniform design and layout in its presentation makes for a very uniform and carefully constructed game overall.			"

												This game sports depth, a nonstandard fantasy world, very aesthetically pleasing art direction, and is generally just quite pleasant mechanics-wise.Where it falls down (and it does), is some blatantly problematic game balance derived from the assymetric faction units and perks (Necrophage AI is your neighbor? You better hope you actually have a counter to his Necrodrones available to you at all). Added to this that a ton of the depth in the game is not explained, it leaves you frustrated and confused unless you go outside the game to get the information you need.I'm still going to reccomend the game because it is really a special 4x experience, and fantasy setting with great writing.. but be prepared to have the game frustrate you when even lower difficulty AI can trounce you HARD because of those holes in the game balance.

Early Access Review
								WARNUNG - Early Alpha Access - Kein MULTIPLAYER geplant. Erst in BETA, vorher nicht. Also wer jetzt kauft kann ""nur"" Singelplayer spielen. (Soll keine Kritik sein nur als Info fuer alle)Um es einfach zu sagen, dieses Game ist fuer mich der Heilige Gral dieses Spiele Genres. Nach Heroes of Might and Magic, Civilizations X-X, AoW3, traue ich mir doch zu ein wenig Ahnung von den Games aus diesem Genre zu haben. Und das was Endless Legends bietet ist einfach nur sau gut.Was auf jeden Fall mal raussticht hingegen zu allen anderen, es ist zu 100% im Fantasy Bereich anzutreffen. Keine Menschen, Zwerge, ... Ritter, Musketen, ... Volle Dosis Fantasy in diesem Game. Insekten Monster, Geister Kaiser und und und. Das Gelaende Design = DER HAMMER. Hunderte verschieden Tiles, optisch sehr nett miteinander verbunden und im Gesamten sehr stimmig.Das UI - sehr modern, ich liebe es, ist allerdings sicherlich fuer viele sehr gewohnungsbeduerftig. (Nicht fuer jeden was)Die Darstellung der Daten ist sehr gelungen und uebersichtlich und leicht zugaenglich.Die Strategische Tiefe des Spiels ist in meinen Augen sehr gut gelungen. Es ist ein guter Mix gefunden worden, wo man tiefer gehen sollte, und wo eher nicht. Es ist fuer meinen Geschmack zwischen Casual und Hardcore eingereit. Die eigentlichen Staerken in meinen Augen sind Dinge wie:Diplomatie (Man braucht Einfluss um Krieg zu erklaeren, man braucht Regions um maechtig zu sein, ...)Kampf (Man wird nicht auf ein virtuelles generiertes Kampffeld gebaemt. Man kaempft auf dem wo man steht und was man sieht.)Winter/Sommer (Im Winter ist das ueberleben nicht leicht und man muss sich auf seine Stadt fokusieren)Das Questsystem (Einmalig wie ich finde)Minion System (Von ausruestung bis ueber Skills alles dabei)Und noch vieles mehr. Das wuerde jedoch ein Review sprengen.Ich empfehle jedem im allgemeinen sich zumindest die Videos zu diesem Spiel anzusehen im speziellen das erste grobe Tutorial Video eines Game Testers, es zeigt das Spiel im Groben sehr gut.Link:

												I am addicted. This is a truly excellent game, engaging from the start. There is a learning curve, it is not very steep, but given the number of options for custom games, large or small world, aggressive or not minor factions, rarity of resources, and so many others, you can make the learning curve as long as you want, and this gives the game a lot of depth.You can make the game fast and brutal, or slow and involved, to your liking, which is awesome.The graphics are out of this world, they are so beautiful that sometimes I catch myself simply staring at the landscape and buildings for long minutes... While streaming... the sounds are great as well, especially with the new tracks recently added to the game, which make playing for long hours even more fun.This game does very well for multiple playthroughs, and is very enjoyable.I have only one gripe: At higher difficulties, you might think the AI is simply optimising its buillds better and better. But such is not the case. At higher difficulties, the AI *CHEATS*. Find a titanium deposit? You'll get 1 titanium per turn. The AI? At higher difficulties, it gets 2, 3, 5, it gets huge bonuses to everything, making the game less of an actual difficulty level, and more of an unfair challenge. So -0.5 points for that.9.5/10 from me. IT would be a 10 otherwise, and I don't give 10s if I can avoid it... ;-)If I could add something negative, it might be that I would have preferred 10 technology eras instead of 6, and 500 turns normal duration instead of 300, but then, I'm just professing my love for this game, saying I want more, and more, and MORE!What are you doing still reading? Did you purchase it yet? Is it downloading? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!			"

												This is one of the most unique 4x games out there.  It has a very beautiful, IMO, art style.  It has a nice region feature that really changes up the way you create new cities and where.  the fact that you can only put one city in each region really helps to add strategy to the placement of cities and helps to maintain the beautiful art style.There are a number of interesting factions, and each plays significantly differently.  There's a nice story here as well that helps to drive the overall strategy and gameplay.If you like the fantasy 4x subgenre than this game is a must.			"

												I picked up this game and all the DLC fpr $10.50. What a deal. In short, the game is excellent. I like games with lots of detail and where you have to do a lot of thinking and deciding before the turns. This game does  a very good job of it.I've played Endless Space, Civ V and Europa Universalis IV a lot. EL is better than ES and Civ V and almost as good as EUIV.  If've you have played ES and CIV5 you will find the learning curve pretty reasonable, but it's not as hard to learn as EUIV. "

												Ssenkrad_II is a reviewer that falsifies how this game's mechanics works as well as blocks any comments that bring out the blatant lies the ""reviewer"" makes. It is possible to win the game through diplomacy, quest, supremacy, etc. This is coming from some one that has the achievements for winning the game multiple ways and has almost the same amount of hours as the reviewer claiming that supremacy is the only way to win.The false review mentioned found here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072017110/recommended/289130/Do not trust any reviews from the previously mentioned Steam user as they simply do not go in-depth or even allow people to question the credibility of their claims when they try to paint the game in a light that implies a mechanic is broken.The actual game itself does not have a hard learning curve if you've played previous turn based strategy games. The diplomacy system is straightforward and shows you whether or not the trade will be agreed. Diplomacy is basic to the point that complimenting an empire for a handful of turns can make a hostile empire more friendly to the point that you can eventually ally them.Endless Legend is a great game that is an easy pick up for anyone wanting to get into the 4x, turn based strategy genre. Factions are easy to learn and the game allows you to partake in an interesting campaign if you decide to try the quest victory. The AI can also present a challenge at higher difficulties as they are given modifiers to their economy, the handicap for the player will increase as the difficulty increases.Settling cities is also an easy task depending on how you prioritize your city, where you place your city, and whether or not the city has a hero assigned to it. If you have a city focused on production you can dish out settlers to expand quickly but will have to sacrifice turns in doing so vs. building up that city to become a dust farm (gold).This game also has a wonderful modding community for anyone that is interested in expanding the game through user-created content.

												The game seems deep and complicated at first, but this is because there are tons of gameplay elements that turn out to be shallow and useless. You need Influence for empire policies (Which are nice to have, but far too weak to allow for meaningful specialisation) and diplomatic actions (Why limit the amount of diplomatic actions you can have with the AI? It doesn't really use Long-term strategy and diplomatic planning.)You can outfit your units with different equipment, but the choice usually reduces to ""More damage/health vs. crippling overspecialisation with poor payoff"".Then, there's this region system, where you build a city directly beside a resource, but don't get access to it, because the magical regional borders that existed even before the founding of the first permanent settlements runs between the two tiles.Also, the system in which you expand your city is weird and doesn't make much sense. Apparently, your people love overpopulation and hate it when you expand your city with boroughs? But as soon as one part of the city is surrounded by boroughs, they totally love it. I get it, I'm not allowed to build stretched, snake-like cities to reach resource tiles, but isn't there are more elegant way to prevent me from doing this?Graphically, on every resolution I tried, the information windows are ridiculously small, with tons of information crammed into tables with small-sized fonts and microscopic symbols for different things. The worst example is the screen where you choose the equipment for your soldiers or Heroes. I don't understand why they couldn't just use the whole screen for these windows, but decided to use only half of the screen size. Because of the small size of the symbols, and the fact that many of them look nearly identical, the interface is very un-intuitive.			"

												So far, the best 4X Strategy I've played to date.The Factions are intensly different, offering the most diverse game to game experience I've ever had in a 4X. Each faction plays completely different from the one before it. It's not just a buff here, and a bonus there. There's a nomadic merchant faction that doesn't declare war. A faction that eats the bodies of dead enemies. A group of spectral knights that require 'Dust' instead to survive, and thrive.There's a vast array of resources, each useful in their own ways. Luxury resources are good for cash, but all provide a bonus you can cash in. There's pretty much a resource for everything you need, and strategic resources are your standard offensive and defensive upgrades. (Speaking of which, there are unit/equipment customization options).The only negative I can think of is the combat/warfare is slightly different than what you might be use to, but it's easy grasp after some trial and error.

												I've really enjoyed this game. In a lot of ways it's pretty standard 4x fare however, it really differentiates itself the way the different factions play. Whether it's the hyper-aggressive Necrophage or the singular Mega-city-having Cult of the Endless... you get a different play experience.  The style of the game is terrific and the game lore is very interesting as well (I'd love to see a pen-and-paper RPG setting for it actually).  My only quibble is that combat isn't quite what I wish it was... it's not quite Civ and it's not quite Masters of Magic/Orion tactical combat... it's not BAD but it isn't my favorite thing. Towards the end of my first playthrough I mostly autoresolved battles.			"

												A mix between civilization and heroes of might and magic.  I definitely enjoy playing this game.  It is quite complex and is meant for adults, not a kids game (too much thinking to do, nut much action). Its a thinking game, not action game.  For next version the fighting needs to be more fun.pros:+units gain experience, level up and can be retrofitted+does not matter who attacks first in melee+game victory limited to 300 turns makes you think how to do things quickly (can be changed to 600 turns)+different races+hero quests make game fun especially during the beginning+diplomacy options (make friends, trade research)+minor factions keep you busy, can be assimilated and you can get interesting units+great graphics+game stability, does not crashcons:- fighting gets boring after a while, i do mine on automatic- i always run out of resources as i try to build everything- i would need more turns in the game to achieve elimination victory "

Early Access Review
								Imagine Civilzation V with customizable armies and quests. While unit Type A defeats unit Type B in Civilzation, here you create and customize your own army, equipping them with a variety you receive from quests and from production. While Civilization's focus isn't on combat and more on build order and adapting to the environment, Endless Legend keeps in stride with interesting land improvements and incredibly unique races to play as.Personally, I'm a fan of the Broken Lords. They look pretty sweet, and they grow from dust - the currency like gold you'd normally use to just hurry production. As a result, you don't need to worry about food but instead need to constantly manage dust, which is now used for everything from hurrying production and gaining citizens to healing your troops on the field and improving their gear.It's a hefty price-tag for something in alpha, but the game is very playable and has yet to crash / glitch on me. I'm honestly having more fun with this than I am in Civilization V.

Early Access Review
								I've never been so impressed with an early access title in all my time spent on steam. I don't write very many reviews, more than likely because I generally haven't felt compelled enough to rate mediocre products or I simply haven't been captivated enough to say yay or nay; but this product definately deserves attention.For those of you out there who are used to the typical 4k-esk game, prepare to have your minds blown with concepts that are some of the most interesting means of progression I have ever seen. Research is done in teirs, every single technology costs the exact amount of research points to aquire, and you can aquire any of the researches in a teir in any order you want, no wasting time learning military tech to unlock useful social tech; if you're not the combatant type. But, here's the catch: every time you research something, the cost for the next thing gets higher, and when you research enough of one teir, you unlock the next, allowing a form of non-linear progression that I've frankly never seen in any game to date.City Progression and Expansion have also taken an extremely unique approach as well, In Endless Space, a common issue was being unable to expand your empire fast enough to have enough planets to defeat larger expansionists, Turtling or having a small but strong empire was not really an option. In this game, there are two very unique ways to expand, Either by spreading out and colonizing, as per usual; or city growth. Unlike in Endless Space, your cities can in theory grow to unlimited sizes by building expansions onto them, when you surround an expansion with 4 other expansions, it levels up. To get a level 1 city to level 2, put 4 expansions around it, to get your city to level 3, put 4 level 2 expansions around it, which require another 4 level 1 expansions around that. Each level exponentially increases the power of your city's output, so focusing on making one city a super city is compeltely viable, and can really pay off.Considering for a moment this game isn't even halfway completed, It's probably the best investment you could make in early access on steam, assuming you like empire ruler 4k type games. I haven't even scratched the surface of explaining all the interesting but easy to understand mechanics of the game. Let's just say the rest are just as mindblowing and interesting by comparison to other games. This is no clone title, there's no repitition here, instead an entirely unique and utterly interesting fantasy empire building experience that you will not be able to stop playing once you start.10/10, I will eat my beard if you buy this and don't immediately love it.

												Its a beautiful game with some unique ideas. It looks gorgeous, has nice music, a great interface which has a lot of improvements over Endless Space (although lacking in keyboard shortcuts), interesting stories and factions. But the gameplay just does not work out.Normal"" AI is insanely easy. I just killed everyone on my first game. ""Hard"" AI is incredible cheaty. You can only scratch your head at how many cities they construct while you churn out your first settler. Enemy AI seems very weak and just wins with extra resources. No apparent AI strategy is visible.The battle system is atrocious. You can place your units, set them to offensive, defensive or stationary and give them targets. As soon as you press the turn button they do whatever they want. In fact you can just autoresolve its the same. The same company made Endless Space where you could not control your units as well. But they put in a paper-scissor-rock-like system and made sure, that fleet composition and ship design is important. Here, you just need the expensive equipment, there is really no choice. I suggest Archers on stationary. The rules for reinforcements are completely unclear. I think it is based on movement range but the game will not show you any info about it. Why could they not adapt the system from Endless Space? This is beyond me. The battle system is the greates weakness right after the bad AI.Diplomacy is quite basic and costs too much ""Influence"" (something you can ""gather"" like science or dust points). You need quite a lot of influence to unlock Empire plans. Those a really powerful boosts and a must against the ""hard"" AI. Exchanging a couple of techs is just prohibitively expensive in influence as to render this option useless.The market for heroes, mercs and resources is a nice idea but again very very expensive. You won't use it much if at all. For example the seasonal change between winter and summer is nice but as it affects (one faction as unique buildings against winter effects though) everyone it just slows the game down. Even more so as mid and late game has more winter than summer.The game has certainly interesting ideas but the whole balance does not work out. And it suffers from the same fate as Endless Space....as soon as someone is in the lead with a  bit of a margin you can just stop playing. Nothing is going to happen until said player fulfills the victory condition. There are no shake ups in mid or late game.---Have a look at my channelhttps://www.youtube.com/user/phoppe1980 "

												This game is a near miss for me, but after several attempts to get into it, i just cant. The asthetics are amazing and the lore and storytelling is far and above the competition. However there are several mechanics i don't like that actually manage to make me hate the game dispite all its good points. Examples would be the terribly implemented combat, where you assign orders before the turn. This is stupid as when the AI moves before you (different units act faster than others), all your strategy becomes pointless. Its a sort of 'guess what the opponent will do' mechanic similar to endless space, but a lot more frustrating. Then there is the occupy-a-region mechanic. On paper it sounds good, but there are times where it will annoy you to no end. This game requires large investments for a city to make a settler, and if you are one turn away from placing your settler on your chosen spot ant then bam an opponent has settled the opposite end of the region and all your effort is up in smoke.There is also an impression that this game was released once all the features were ticked off as complete and bug free (which tbf they are), but that the devs skipped over the polish stage. At the end of combat all units still waiting to move have co 'cycle' a do-nothing action. When building a settler all population you assign to food have to be moved out (you cannot produce food when building a settler) and then back on completion, manually. And so on.In short, this is a very well made game, but just isnt for me. However it is extremely deep and different to most of the genre (especially civ), so if you are looking for that go ahead.

												Having played Civ 5 Brave New World i was looking for a breath of fresh air when i purchased this game. At first it seemed a very interesting game but i immediately got bored. Doesnt matter what civ you play it feels you are playing the same thing over and over. The game encourages one type of victory, supremacy.  The more cities you build the more powerful you become, there are almost no negative consequences because of the luxury resources you can exploit. You will have a ton of gold, production, food... and the more you take from the other civs the better. Just conquer everything you see and you will win, its that easy. Maybe with dlcs the game will offer new mechanics but for now it feels you are playing the same game over and over.			"

												I wanted to like this, it had a lot of potential. Unfortunately it got bogged down in some rather clunky mechanics. Armies are small enough that you can't really form a tactical plan, and it ends up depending purely on stats. I found no reason to use multiple unit types, just build one up and spam it. The game itself is mechanically dodgy, I had a fair amount of units get stuck (Reloading the game fixes), and fairly frequent CTD. I also had it get stuck loading a turn. I wound up using the autosafe feature frequently to escape gamebreaking errors. I also found a lot of items not working as intended. Quest delivered weapons are useless as they have no base stats (+60% isn't very good if your base is 0), buildings marked as 1 per empire you can build infinitely (In the same city no less, with stacking effects)All told they need to hire some quality control and try again in a year or two.

So for final conclusion, it would be wise to purchase a game when they fixed all the bug. Or just purchase now for endless hours of wonderful fatasy.....with little bit of confusion and OP AI!			"

You simply tell the AI which of your units should attack others, then sit back and cringe as the AI derps and moves your troops into the worst possible tactical positions. It reminds me of the game risk, You should win with 12 units vs one, but you can get unluckly and lose everything. Except instead of saying ""ahh man, they keep rolling 6's and won"".

												This game combines elements from similar titles like, Civ 4, and 5 and Fallen Enchantress and is all around quite good. What really makes this a good purchase is the faction and the setting. Each major and minor faction honestly feels very unique and though some may have their similarities many of the factions have an entirely diffrent play style and often include many unique features and tactics.

												Endless Legend has made a very good first impression on me. I've spent less than 10hrs with it at the time of writing this, but I already love everything about this game. Graphically, it's a just a joy to look at - Everything has a soft hand-painted look to it, the UI is amazingly sleek and clean, and the way the map dynamically changes as it's revealed, as well as when you zoom in/out, never gets old. The addition of hero units, quests, and other RPG mechanics is executed very well, and is definitely a highlight of the game. They've also made some smart changes to the design/mechanics of traditional 4x games, which let you spend less time micromanaging different aspects of your cities, and more time exploring and completing quests with your hero units.If you're a fan of 4x and strategy games, I'd definitely recommend Endless Legend.

												4X has always been my favorite genre in PC games, luckily it's a popular one that has had a lot to choose from over the years. Plenty of developers try new twists on the standard formulas, with mixed success.Amplitude, the studio behind Endless Legends, has had some pretty good results with some of their changes. Their ""tech web"" from Endless Space has clearly influenced Civ:BE, and I think they're on to some really interesting innovations in Endless Legends that we might see pop up elsewhere in the future.Their region and city-building system is really interesting and complex. It takes a lot of getting used to. They also have fully customizable units - you can really specialize your unit choices to your own needs. It's really well-done. Even their approach to the tech tree is innovative... you'll often choose many important techs each time through, but I can't imagine always using the same optimal path like you would in Civ for example.Heroes and missions are also interesting and well-implemented. The reliance upon minor factions to round out your army, provide empire buffs, and bolster your workforce is also very cool. And have I mentioned that there are a ton of resources, each with unique qualities, that are actually relevant? It's crazy.Of course the game isn't perfect. The AI needs some work, it does well at the start but before long the player can easily out-perform the computer. Amplitude was very good about supporting Endless Space and improving the AI and other features, so I am confident in the future. However if you chose to exploit the AIs weaknesses you can run them over pretty easily. Of course, there's also a lot of customization that can be done in the pre-game menu, so an argument could be made that you could set paramaters up enough to hinder yourself and boost the AI... but really that's a big workaround for what should be in the game already.The game has huge potential but currently (9/28/14) it still has some room to grow. I'd recommend buying it if you're a fan of the genre, although waiting for the AI to improve wouldn't be the worst decision. It shouldn't take too long.			"

												Endless Legend is like Civilization but not really.It does use the same hex tile map system as Civ does but the gameplay itself is rather different. For instance, the combat is not just command unit here, numbers decrease and something dies.You get the option to command your individual units as they fight and the battle itself takes place on the world map. The commands themselves are rather limited but still involving and your decisions may change the course of the battle since the AI is a bit questionable at times. Or you could just select autoresolve.The factions are also interesting. Every single faction is unique in aesthetic and lore and each comes with their own questline which you can complete or ignore. Their story is told through the questing and is done in a way which adds to the gameplay; you are not punished if you don't complete the quests but you are rewarded if you do. The quests also break the monotony somewhat by giving you a goal to build toward.Asymmetric gameplay is also implemented very well. All factions have handicaps and bonuses, some of which seem rather extreme at first glance and yet, if one plays them skillfully, each has an equal possibility of winning.The main complaint that I have with this game is the learning curve. Certain mechanics are not explained very well like the district levelling system where your city districts level up when there are three or more districts built adjacent to it. I only found that out after doing a little reading on the Amplitude Studios forums. And at the time of writing, I still haven't figured out how to traverse the oceans even though I know there are ships in the game.In summary, I would definitely reccommend this game if you enjoy a good Civ style 4X turn-based strategy game or would like a Civ style 4X strategy game but found it a little too dull.

												Too busy playing to write a full review, but definitely worth picking up, at full price and even more-so while the sale is still going. To me this is better than Civ5. This is a beautiful game and yet still seems to be pretty easy on the video card. I was fully expecting a 10+ GB download for this game, but it's quite compact at ~2 GB. Endless Legend is definitely one of the best games I've played from 2014. Oh yeah... Happy New Years!---In only a few other reviews I saw people have issues with crashes, and so I thought I might comment on that. I've had one crash in ~15 hours, but the game auto-saved and everything was fine. Every other new PC release I played of recent has had far more crashes. The issue those other reviewers were having could be due to a specific driver or hardware issue, but I don't know. All I know is that this game has ran excellently almost entirely for me.			"

Early Access Review
								Amplitude has provided yet another immersive 4X strategy game in this newest edition to the Endless series of games. I have to say, they have really knocoked my socks off with this game; the UI is crisp and clean, easy to follow, and will be easier when the tutorial is added.That being said, it does lack a tutorial at the moment, so not having experience with Endless Space would be a bad thing with this game. The two games play very much alike, although I prefer the lore and atmosphere of Endless Legend far more than its sister. As of this moment my pros for the game are as follows:Easy to get in toAmazing Lore and artwork, as to be expected.Beautiful terrainFar better combat systems when compared to Endless Space (my opinion)Well-implemented Empire quest systemThe current cons are few but present:Laughable Diplomacy: I excuse this on the grounds that this is early access, but as this game nears release I will start harping on it more frequently. The current cost of diplomatic action (devs and current players will know what I mean) is a grand idea, but the system seems rather broken at this time. I have often encountered AI empires and attempted negotiations with them, only to have war declared on me a few turns later. AI seem to ignore any attempts at diplomatic relations, as far as I have seen.Lack of Victory Condition Options: I assume this will come in the future, but for the past three games I have lost due to one of the AI reaching a score limit. The scenario is set to default, however the setting leaves out what victory conditions that entails. Conquest is a given condition, but score capacity? I'd like to know what the max score is that players have to reach to win. Sieges: Sieges are a great addition, but they don't make much in the way of sense. They cut off all benefits from the besieged city, but sicne cities don't seem to ever be conquered by them (as far as I have noticed), they seem rather pointless.In closing, this is an amazing game that has some flaws due to it being in development. Amplitude is an awesome studio that makes awesome games; furthermore, this game has a TON of potential, and they seem to be doing most everything right for now. I can dream that this becomes a well known 4X, since it has already consumed some number of my personal hours with its immersive lore, quests, and warfare. I believe this game is a worthy investment, especially in the Founder's edition, which I purchased myself. Great game, great mechanics, it's like someone in Amplitude is making their own universe a reality, something I can appreciate and admire. 9.5/10(InDev Score)			"

								This game has potential. However, right now it has many problems. The game is in alpha and it shows - there are only half of the planned factions, some important mechanics aren't present (automation for example) and it feels unresponsive at times (especially in diplomacy screen). But it is playable and I personally enjoyed it. Like I said, the concept shows potential. I recommend to wait for a bit before buying it, but if playing it with only base mechanics implemented  doesn't bother you then by all means, pick it up.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm 15 hours in and just won my first game after 10+ starts. I absolutely love it, and I think AMPLITUDE has made some great changes to common 4X mechanics. If you love the Civilization series, you'll probably get some great gameplay out Endless Legend. Keep in mind, however, that the game is in alpha, so some features don't exist or aren't complete. Here are my thoughts on the gameplay, coming from someone who has put hundreds and hundreds of hours into Civ5:Map and Exploration=====One of my favorite aspects of EL is its maps. They're beautiful, and the concept of regions prevents city spamming and promotes city management. Tile anomalies also add strategy and diversity to the map. They're similar to Civ5's naturual wonders in that they have unique visuals and bonuses, but there is more variety and they are more common. Exploration is pretty startard fare, but ruins only have three outcomes: free dust, a quest, or nothing. I love the concept of minor factions, as they replace the mostly useless and generic barbarians found in the Civ series.Cities and Expansion=====Only one city can be founded in each region, so city placement is particularly important because you'll have to raze your own city if you picked a poor location. Most of my starts have been near good spots for my first city, so I usually don't wait to explore before settling. I recommend generating maps with small regions, however, to increase your options for expansion.City Expansion-----Cities can be expanded by building boroughs, which increase the tile reach of the city, and boroughs are upgraded by surrounding them with four regional improvements (city center, borough, or resource extractor). This is very different from Civ5's cultural borders, and I like having control over where my city expands. Additionally, ALL resources in a city's region can be improved with extractors--you do not need to place your city near them or expand towards them. This is a very welcome change and works perfectly with the one-city limitation. Most importantly, heroes can be assigned to cities and can give MASSIVE bonuses.Empire Expansion-----Every city you found decreases empire-wide approval by 10%, and I've had my best luck building up two powerful cities until I unlock the technologies required for more approval-increasing buildings. If you've pacified all minor faction villages in a region where you have a city, you can assimilate that faction, get their empire bonus, and build their units. The road technology is currently in development, so I haven't been able to build roads.Resources=====The game has three different types of resources: the FIDSI (food, industry, dust, science, and influence), luxury resources, and strategic resources.The FIDSI-----I'll ignore the obvious four (dust = gold, by the way), and just talk about influence. Influence is accumulated every turn and is required to perform diplomatic actions with other empires, assimilate minor factions, and institute empire plans. Every so often, you'll be able to spend influence to give your empire temporary bonuses with an empire plan. It's a great feature and gives you a variety of options for empire improvement (extra gold or science, additional unit movement, decreased building costs, etc.) every 20 turns or so.Strategic Resources-----Not much to say. They're similar to Civ5's, as they're revealed with technology and required to equip your army. What's cool is that your extractors extract the resources EVERY TURN. So like dust, you can accumulate them and spend them all at once or just spend them as you get them.Luxury Resources-----EL gets it right with luxury resources. In Civ5, they just give you boring happiness, but in EL you can spend stacks of them on temporary (often powerful) boosts to your empire. Just found a couple new cities? Spend a couple lux stacks to get a large boost to food and industry in all of your cities. Another of my favorite features. As with strategic resources, they're extracted every turn.Technology=====There is no tech tree in EL; you progress by technology eras. Each era has a set of techs and a cost at which all techs are researched. Once you research 10 techs in an era, the next era is unlocked and the cost for all techs goes up. While I love tech trees, this gives you more flexibility and prevents you from feeling obligated to research everything in every era. Why finish up era 1 with era 2 prices when era 2's techs are so much better and now cost the same? You have that option, of course, but advancing through eras is almost always better. Keep in mind that some techs aren't functional, and the last 2 eras are empty.Units and Combat=====Units-----Each faction has 3 units, excluding Settlers, and you can obtain new units by assimilating minor factions. While this is limiting, you can create unit designs to build. A design is just a set of equipment, so you can build slow, durable rangers with crossbows and full armor at the same time you're building speedy, fragile rangers with nothing but a 2-hand bow. The design aspect is very cool and creates a lot of strategy, but I do wish there were more available units.Combat-----Combat has been talked about quite a bit. You have two options for battle: manually set your units on a grid and watch it play out, or just let it automatically decide the outcome immediately. The manual option is kind of interesting and has a little strategy to it, but in my experience you can just build a powerful army and click ""Auto"" every time.The downside to combat (and units in general) is that ranged units are way too strong. There is no real feasible strategy other than buliding an army of ranged units, equipping them with no armor and a powerful 2-handed bow. Because they have no armor, they have high initiative and will always attack first in combat, and because of their powerful bows, they can kill any unit is one or two hits. Flying and infantry units need a MAJOR boost to either defense, initiative, or in-combat movement (or all of those). Right now they're just arrow fodder.Factions=====Play as Wild Walkers or Vaulters and win. Not only do the get the most powerful bonuses (Wild Walkers get industry from forest, Vaulters get science boost), but they start with ranged units and the era 1 techs that you'll always want. The game definitely needs faction balance, though if ranged units weren't so powerful it wouldn't be so bad. The Necrophages can build boroughs at a low cost, which is cool, but their units are no match against a ranged army.Missing Features Not Mentioned Above=====Diplomacy doesn't really exist in the game. When you meet other empires, you start off in a cold war, and they'll declare war on you a few turns later. I haven't been able to get an empire to like me or accept a truce, let alone enter an alliance. The button to execute a diplomatic action subtracts from your influence, but doesn't give any feedback about whether or not they accepted your offer. There isn't even a tech to propose a peace during war, only during a cold war.Trade routes also don't exist, so I guess the AI has no reason to accept a truce or enter an alliance.The AI right now doesn't create powerful unit designs with good equipment, so war gets pretty easy after you upgrade your units.All games currently end at turn 200, and there is no option to continue playing the map.It's too easy to get dust with a dust-related hero assigned to a river city.Verdict=====The game is the best alpha I've ever played, and its depth, gameplay, and fantastic visuals make up for its balance issues (which are easier to fix than bad gameplay). After putting over 500 hours into Civ5, Endless Legend is a fresh take on the 4X genre. If you can accept the lack of diplomacy and trade, building and expanding your empire is a lot of fun.			"

												I put 21 hours in this game in just four days.This is a great game featuring the best of Civilization and Heroes of Might & Magic.You play this as your ""ordinary"" hex tile 4X game. However when you enter combat you play the combat out on the same hexmap like you would play in a Heroes game. That is just an awesome combination.The game features several different races that all play very different. Not the civiliation different of ""Here you get that unit that is like all the others and looks differrent and has +1 stats"". No, we are talking of an elven kingdom called the ""WIld Walkers"" using basicly ranged combat or a race of dragons that tries to win the game via diplomacy. Or how about honorable undead ghosts? Every race can win by conquering - but there are many other options. Play it. You will love it.			"

												I could almost recommend this game based only on its slick interface. It is probably the best interface in any turn-based strategy game ever.A strong point this game has over other turn-based strategy games is a technology system which allows you to adapt to your surroundings and playstyle. I.e if you don't intend to go to war, you don't need to pick an sort of military tech to advance your civilization. If you have a lot of rivers, you could pick a tech that improves their output. It is a great system for players who like devloping unique minmaxing strategies, and gives the game a lot of replayability. The same faction with two different sets of technological choices play very differently.  "

												This Game, Dispite being Similar to Civilization V is a much more complex and unique 4X Game than Civ 5. It has may features that build on what Civ 5 Started and improves it. The Map has more complex Terrain Types than Civilization as well as an interesting and unique use of Elevation that has a large effect on Combat. The Technology is the Most Liberating and Dynamic System I have seen with absolutely nothing Linear it adds a unique Mechanic of ""Nominal Cost"" Which makes it important that you research the proper techs that you need, unlike in Civ where you need to Research Steel even if you have no Iron. The Expasion system is one of the things I love the most as your Borders don't Grow naturally and you must construct ""Districts"" to Expand your Borders, you will however lose Approval Ratign For doing this so you have to Balance valuable Tiles with your Citizens Happiness. The Most unique thing about the Game is its Amazing Art Style which makes the Game Look Like a Playable peice of Art, and the Fantasy Themed Factions who Build, Trade, Expand, and Fight for Control of the Unstable Planet of Aguria. The only Major Flaws this game has are a few Bugs that Amplitude are constantly patching, and the AI is a bit Poor at managing Armies and Battles; Which will most Likely be improved on in a Future Expansion or Patch. If you Like Games Like Civilzation and Enjoy a Fantasy Genre with good Lore this Game is For you.			"

												I would definitely recommend this game.First off, the soundtrack and art design of Endless Legend are amazing. Even after sinking hours and hours into the game, the background music still hasn't gotten old, and I often zoom in on the map as far as I can to examine the landscape and units. Secondly, each faction brings a unique style of play that adds a lot to the replay value of the game. Each has a focus (industry, science, war, diplomacy, money, etc.), like what you would expect from different factions in a 4X game. Endless Legend takes it a little bit further, however, to make the gameplay much more asymmetrical. For example, the Necrophage, a zerg-like bug race, has no diplomacy options, and is always at war. On the other end of the spectrum are the Roving Clans, who cannot declare war, and focus on trade and controlling the market. In addition, the factions in Endless Legend avoid typical fantasy cliches very well. Many of them are familiar races with a twist to them. For instance, the Wild walkers, the game's elves, are focused on industry and construction, and the Drakken, or dragons, are great diplomats.Speaking of which, the only main grievance I have with Endless Legend is with its diplomacy. It seems very bare-bones, with only limited functionality. You can trade, declare war, make peace and alliances, trade and research agreements, and compliment or denounce other factions. However, it is not possible to ask for one faction to interact with another. For example, you can't ask a faction to denounce or declare war on another, like what you can do in the Civilization games. Additionally, the decisions the AI makes often make little sense. I was 'blood brothers' (very friendly) and allied with a faction once, but only several turns later they declared a cold war on me, and I couldn't even find out why. Along the same line, the AI's dialogue is often very generic, and gives little to no hint of why it is deciding to reject my treaty proposal, or leave the alliance, or warn me about my 'attitude'.Despite the flaws of Endless Legends, its pros far outweigh its cons. The game's eventually mod support will definitely help with some of its lacking aspects, as well. Overall, this is a great game that is well worth the $35.			"

												This game is a fantasy based 4x strategy game created by the same people who made Endless Space. The pacing is good, but combat can take a bit of time if you do it manually. I wish the tutorial explained the game mechanics better. It took me a while to figure out what everything was, but once I did that the game is great.			"

												Endless Legend is like Civ, which is fantastic because Civ is a great, sturdy game, with some flaws though. There are some differences between the two.In Endless Legend, you have 9 aysmmetrical (completely different) factions to choose from (with the exception of 2 as far as I know), each have their own ways of obtaining victory in an easier way, much like Civ, there's Expansion, Elimination, Science, Diplomatic, and so on...Unlike most RTS's and TBS's/4Xs (Turn-Based Strategies), In Endless Legend, each faction only has 3 different military units.Now, I know what you're thinking: Where's the diversity?!?! BUT, the COOLEST thing about your armies is that you can change what weapons, armour, and trinkets they can have equipped, depending on what you have researched at the time, and then retrofit your current armies to have the newest equipment, adding in an RPG-like element! Also, better equipment made from different alloys you research have special properties to each of them that add damage to certain enemies (flying, infantry, etc...) or that buffs your unit or army (regen, health boost, etc...). Same goes for heroes, in which you start out with one hero, then can buy more via in-game marketplace you have to research to unlock first. Also, all armies and heros level up over time, making them more powerful, and for heros, have a skill tree.ALSO, so that just 3 units doesn't discourage you; There are what's called ""minor"" factions that are basically neutral camps all over the different regions. If you have a city in that region, and destroy the minor faction's little base, you can assimilate them, thereby being able to produce the combat units that they create as well, so there's a lot more to it than just the 3 base units you have!Personally, just having 3 units is so much better, so you don't have to build a crap ton of different units and worry about ""what is strong/weak against what"" and have a huge ordeal over it.The combat is supremely better than Civ, being that, there's actually combat (lol sarcasm...sorta). The combat is completely tactical, meaning once you initiate a battle, you get to organize your force on the board, and then take turns targeting and attacking/defending attacks, it actually takes some tactical knowledge to win a battle! Unlike Civ, where you just send a gajillion people into one square/hexagon and hope for the best.  But if you know you're going to win a battle without any casualities (in which the game gives you statistics before you go into battle), you can auto sim the fight so you don't waste time on your turn.There's a lot more that I would like to say, but most people won't read this far anyway.... SO:Pros___________-Beautiful Graphics-Aysmmetrical Factions- Very, Very Solid Gameplay- Fantastic Combat System- The ""Endless"" Universe, which is freaking sweet- Simple Army System (3 diff military) With Awesome Equipment InterchangeabilityCons____________- If you haven't played Civ, it's going to take a little bit to get used to the interface and everything....but that's common sense. No turn-based game is easy the first time around.-There's only one faction that is preferred to win by elimination, which is perfectly fine, but they can't go to peace, an alliance, or even trade things with other factions. If you're using that faction and playing with friends you want to ally with, you're not going to be able to, unless you can pre-organize teams in the menu before starting the game (whether you can or not, i'm not sure, haven't had much time to play to find that out yet). - I can't think of anything else.Other Thoughts____________In the past, I would've totally recommended Civ and I have played it a lot with a bunch of friends over time. But, Endless Legend changes everything. Don't buy Civ, buy this game, it's just better. I highly recommend it.			"

Civ's exploration/conquering/technology trees combined with units getting into Hero/Army style HoMM battles is what makes this game superior to other games of it's ilk.  Especially when you factor in being able to equip and outfit your heroes as your Technology Age advances.If you love either Civ or HoMM, or absolutely if you love both you must play this game.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is early access and yet my very first game I played to the very end (no crashes or major bugs) and enjoyed it. I like the different races, the backstory and the quests, the art and the mechanics. I'm looking forward to watching the game grow, add new races and mechanics that aren't in the game yet (trading, for example).I think it's worth buying even now, should be more than worth it when it's all complete.Plus points:1. The Map. Large maps with clearly defined regions, terrain features and independent races2. Mechanically distinct races with good art and lore3. Interesting concepts like Winter, which could become quite interesting (the effects aren't too significant atm but it's a wip)4. It ties in with the rest of the 'Endless' franchise, sharing lore and concepts like 'Dust'.5. A strong attempt to have community interactions with the games development through G2G voting and contests.			"

												If you have the choice of buying CIV Beyond Earth or Endless Legend, buy Endless Legend.The combat is entertaining to watch, as well as more intuitive and responsive. The graphic style of the game is gorgeous, and the sound design is very nice as well. The factions have unique personalities to them (unlike Beyond Earth) and each race plays significantly differently (vaulters choosing a holy resource that buffs their economy vs. Drakken who can force diplomatic decisions). The region system is an interesting addition to the game and adds an element of significance to each city you own. Minor factions can be integrated into your empire, providing powerful and useful units to build your armies with. The unit customization is intuitive, and relies on you as the player to make sure your units remain effective on the battlefield. The hero units can change the tide of a battle by healing or using range attacks against enemies.If you want a solid 4x strategy game that is new and exciting to play, pick up this game.			"

												Unlike some other 4x titles that have received undeserved hype this year, this game is actually really good.Once you get into it, you will discover that it plays quite differently than what you may expect at first glance. It's sleek design and great faction strategy variation makes for one of my 2014 game favorites.There are a few less than perfect elements and maybe some of parts of the game could use a little revision, but overall I think these are relatively minor and the game does feel quite polished.I can't say anything about the multiplayer because I haven't tried it, but from a single player perspective I will not hestitate to recommend this title.

I like it more than Civ 5 because it has more of a fantasy feel with different types of creatures for the factions and the lore. I know this game type has almost been done to death, but Endless Legend puts a nice spin on it.			"

								This game is amazing,it has so much depth in it and it's REALLY well made! I really recommend this game! When I first tried it I got stuck in front of the computer for 8 hours straight (and I don't generally like strategy or turn-based games) This games has it all, from conquering small villages, building gargantuan cities with epic monuments, to changing the single armor of your hero/units aswell as earning weapons/armors from quests.This game also have a slick and minimal design of everything which makes the game feel fresh as fuark.  You can also play it however you like, research new upgrades and science, customize hero and units with weapons, rigns, armors, shoulders, hands etc. customize units, finish quests, upgrade your city, spreead to another land, build another city. Start a market and sustain your civilization from just trading, conquering others cities/ villages with a great army. Man this game is freaking awesome, the decisions are endless, literally!TL;DRPlayed, Heroes of might and magic 3? Played age of empires? Played xcom? Played ANY strategy and enjoyed it? THEN BUY THIS GAME, A solid 9/10!			"

												Endless Legend, developed by french Amplitude Studios, is an amazing 4X turn based strategy game: the art, the lore, the gameplay mechanics are all top notch and presented in a very stylish, unique and original way. Whenever I sit down to start a gaming session, I notice that I've never been so excited to play a planetary 4x game like Endless Legend since the release days of SMAC (yeah, I was there and still own the big black box).If you remotely have any interest in the 4X genre immersed deep in a dark fantasy/sci-fi theme, don't miss the chance to play Endless Legend, a true gem.I can't wait to see how they further improve with expansions this already wonderful Endless Legend.Rock on, Amplitude !!!

												Endless Legend innovates on the 4X genre in ways similar to how Warcraft 3 brought forward RTS into a new era. They do it in the same way: with hero units that can lead your armies (and here, cities), gain levels, use equipment, etc. This adds a ton of new possibilities. Combat is also different and more interesting, with armies moving as one and then breaking up into their component parts when a fight starts. So rather than just click to attack, there is a 6-round battle that requires strategy and tactics. There's a lot of other things to recommend as well. The game is simply gorgeous. It's a pleasure just to watch the map rise out of the fog. The lore and factions are all interesting, with diverse playstyles and quests to shape your goals.  I have played thousands of hours of civ over my life, and this game now makes it all seem new again. I am loving it already and can tell I will be playing for many hundreds of hours.			"

From a non-4x kind of guy's perspective, the gameplay is super detailed and well done. The way minor factions work is like the city states in Civ but somehow it just feels a lot better implemented.

The complexity and depth of this game provides hundreds of hours of gameplay, being every match unique since the random map generator.The interface is really polished and clean, and easy to manage. There is maybe too much information to learn from the very beginning, so the tutorial may seem a bit long and hard to familiarize with, but once you learn the schedules, it's way to go.In my opinion cultists are a bit underpowered so they need a little bit of balance still.Multiplayer is a bit deserted, even in peak hours.Great game overall for strategy fans.

												I went in with no expectations, and was pleasantly surprises by what I found.Pros:1. The merge of genres: Typical 4x gameplay as expected, with a few city building and RPG elements thrown in.  2. Gorgeous world. Loving the Sci-Fi Fantasy vibe that's going on. 3. Love the races, and how each one plays differently and is focused for a different victory type. 4. The Summer-Winter cycle and effects is a nice touch not seen in many games. 5. The race-specific Quest Lines are pretty cool as well. 6. The Drakken. Cons:1. The A.I. can sometimes leave you questioning the games coding - they can make some pretty ""out there"" decisions. 2. Tactical battle have little use, it just feels like a point and click (After a few they're all the same, might as well use Auto-Resolve and get it over with). The addition of bonus damage to flanking, larger armies/battles, and more unit types could go a long way to make it fun. 3. The Summer-Winter cycle - as I got later into a game - seemed to heavily favour Winter. In 40 odd turns I only had 5 turns of Summer. TL;DR:A solid 4X game I'd recommend to anyone. There may be a few things that are annoying, but you'll spend more of your time being drawn in by the great aspects than lingering on those,			"

												4X has always been my favorite genre in PC games, luckily it's a popular one that has had a lot to choose from over the years. Plenty of developers try new twists on the standard formulas, with mixed success.Amplitude, the studio behind Endless Legends, has had some pretty good results with some of their changes. Their ""tech web"" from Endless Space has clearly influenced Civ:BE, and I think they're on to some really interesting innovations in Endless Legends that we might see pop up elsewhere in the future.Their region and city-building system is really interesting and complex. It takes a lot of getting used to. They also have fully customizable units - you can really specialize your unit choices to your own needs. It's really well-done. Even their approach to the tech tree is innovative... you'll often choose many important techs each time through, but I can't imagine always using the same optimal path like you would in Civ for example.Heroes and missions are also interesting and well-implemented. The reliance upon minor factions to round out your army, provide empire buffs, and bolster your workforce is also very cool. And have I mentioned that there are a ton of resources, each with unique qualities, that are actually relevant? It's crazy.Of course the game isn't perfect. The AI needs some work, it does well at the start but before long the player can easily out-perform the computer. Amplitude was very good about supporting Endless Space and improving the AI and other features, so I am confident in the future. However if you chose to exploit the AIs weaknesses you can run them over pretty easily. Of course, there's also a lot of customization that can be done in the pre-game menu, so an argument could be made that you could set paramaters up enough to hinder yourself and boost the AI... but really that's a big workaround for what should be in the game already.The game has huge potential but currently (9/28/14) it still has some room to grow. I'd recommend buying it if you're a fan of the genre, although waiting for the AI to improve wouldn't be the worst decision. It shouldn't take too long.			"

												Endless Legend is similar to most 4X games, notably the Civilization genre. There are a few major differences:1. Armies are far more personable. Each unit you create can be outfitted with equipment that can massively increase their stats based on how many strategic resources you have (think iron, oil, etc. from Civ5). This lets you create one ""death stack"" of 5-6 units that both get experience and equipment to allow them to defeat any group of enemies.2. Hero units are also available that level up into skill trees you put points in. They can either lead armies or command cities improving the stats of each.3. Combat occurs on a grid, similar to Heroes of Might and Magic, with turn based combat occuring based on the Initiative stat of each creature, it creates a whole new depth to combat allowing a weaker force to subdue a better one with good positioning. Most everything else is  similar to Civ5, if you were disgruntled with Beyond Earth, this may be a better choice for you.			"

												TL;DRA good, entertaining turn-based strategy focused on empire building.8/10--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Endless Legend is a continuation (or prelude? The timeline is unclear, in case you are interested in the backstory) of Endless Space and bears distinct similarity with its predecessor. Basically, it is a mixture of Civ5 and HoMaM set in a fantasy world (an industrialized fantasy world).The game itself is more oriented towards empire building rather than combat; however, you will fight a lot, especially on higher difficulties, where the beefed up AI tends to rush you. EL utilizes the same resource system as ES, also known as FIDS (food, industry, dust, science); this time, we also have an additional resource called ""reputation"", which you can spend in dealing with other factions, minor factions or on focusing your empire via long time buffs. The strategic and luxury resources are also present - strategic resources are spent on upgrading your units and heroes or building particular structures in your cities; luxury resources, when activated, give a 10-turn long buffs.The world map is divided into regions you can colonize. Each region can hold only one city and a player in control of such settlement controls the resources in that region. As the city population increases, you have an option to expand the borders of your city (not the region) to make the city more productive. Also, the city sprawl looks very quaint :). There are season changes present in Auriga - summer shifts into Dark season. As you progress through the eras (research and development of your empire), the Dark season ultimately lengthens to a point where summer lasts only a few turns (kind of a soft cap).Combat is more engaging than in ES, though it is clearly not a main focus of the game. Every turn, you can give orders to your units and when you are done, your minions try to carry those orders. You are unable to interfere when the combat round is proceeding, therefore you need to consider the initiative (the order in which all units act) and terrain - if you order your unit to attack an enemy unit that acts first and retreats, your unit can end up in the middle of enemy army trying to pursuit its target.Each race can build and deploy three unique units (and a settler); by assimilating a minor race into your empire, you get an option to produce the respective unit (upgrade it, too). If you have enough dust, you can hire mercenaries from the marketplace, but those cannot be upgraded.Heroes have three skill trees now - army focused (blue), city focused (orange) and general (green). An experienced hero presents a significant boost to your city output (based on the skills taken of course) or for your army. When leading an army, the hero doesn't take a spot in the army cap, but is still deployed on the battlefield as a ""free"" (an powerful) unit.Races are quite diverse, with their own unique storylines and special abilities. If you are not happy with the options presented to you, you can create your very own race.There are currently two big flaws with the game:1. Optimalization - the game runs smoothly until you attempt Impossible or Endless difficulty on any of the 4-8 maps. The computer tends to stack massive amounts of dust and other resources, along with building large armies. Having a few AI opponents alive doing this results in game freezes, when the game simply refuses to load - I was once waiting for 40 minutes for a safe to load, since it was a scenario on endless difficulty where I was doing well. After said 40 minutes the game still did not load and thus I gave up. Mind you, I have a decent computer that runs smoothly significantly more advanced games. Apparently, this is a known issue, so hopefully a patch will be issued soon.2. AI - on lower difficulties, AI tends to be sloppy, not building proper defences to its cities, not maintaining decent armies or researching military projects. The AI will still attack you, but if you survive the initial onslaught, you are likely to take all the cities you desire at your leisure. In ES, I liked the fact that in order to conquer a planet or the whole system, you need a large invasion fleet along with your warships - in EL, you are usually opposed just by rather pathetic militia units. In my latest game on serious difficulty, each of my army stacks took one big sprawling city IN ONE TURN, destroying the whole AI empire that had more score points than me in 5 turns.On higher difficulties, namely Impossible and Endless, the AI is ridiculously buffed. Forget about overtaking the AI economically or scientifically, unless you keep conquering its cities, which is not easy, given the units and heroes are buffed as well. Civilisation used this way of managing difficulty too and I do not like it - it is a lazy way how to provide you with some degree of challenge instead of programming smarter AI.All in all, a worthy successor of Endless Space; Endless Legend can proudly stand on its own and provide you with hours and hours of good, turn-based fun.8/10			"

												better than Civ in pure singleplayer, the civs/races are completely different and play completely differently. amazing experience. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ writing, the english is at times very bad / badly translated from whatever the devs use. the descriptions are insufficient to say the least, i basically build things on guess. what does ""+1 xp per turn for army"" mean for a hero skill? +1 xp for the army under his command probably, but could be global because then there are abilities like +1 gold per turn and i wonder, does this only apply if the hero is garrisoned in one city,.. if yes, then does it only apply to that city's gold output i guess?you can choose to do manual fighting, this isnt possible in civ but it's useless anyway. i dont really get it, and the strengths of the units sometimes seem quite random. however there is a certain strategy to it but also a certain idiocy to it: i had an attacking sieging army on my city, it was located on a tile that wasnt easily accessible (only accessible via sea or 1 ground tile, think russian krim island). i moved my massively superior army to attack the invaders, with my city's guards it should be an instant win but i lost everything. i then realized that there was simply no room for the units to be stationed, thats why i lost. (i pretty much always let the fights resolve on automatic, the problem is that u cant skip forward if you are in manual mode once and often its quite obvious how it will turn out, so why keep having to click around). so back to the story: luckily the krim island had two groundtiles so i was able to land there with my own armies and this way i had more tiles to attack his army from than him and i won. This would be a great cool thing but there is one problem: He could theoretically destroy my entire city fortification and destroy my entire city just because i cant get to his army from any vantage point. Even though his army is only able to siege my massive city from one tiny district. just to be clear, this is quite an unlikely thing to happen but it happened.in general i like it but its REALLY hard to tell how good an army will fight against mine. his units are lvl 6, but his hero has better items maybe? who knows. Then he has a demon, ok that has a swipe attack but who knows how well it will be used. most of the time you really need to have more guardian elite units than him to win any fights in late game. also what i wanted to mention about the confusing language: the items for the heros say something like +2 iniative for army. What the hell is initiative? There are tons of things that arent explained at all properlymultiplayer useless, one game is running, 2 russians, refuse to speak english, constantly desyncs, people randomly join and leave the game and it takes minutes each timeOverall i can recommend this game as a better alternative than Civ 5, actually imo it is a lot better. The AI however is almost as bad as Civ, I mean i get it.. it's hard to make a good AI but it seems that they make the AI very lenient... why does it allow me to truce when it could very easily kill me?

												This game combines elements from similar titles like, Civ 4, and 5 and Fallen Enchantress and is all around quite good. What really makes this a good purchase is the faction and the setting. Each major and minor faction honestly feels very unique and though some may have their similarities many of the factions have an entirely diffrent play style and often include many unique features and tactics.

												I absolutely love Civ V and I absolutely love Heroes of Might and Magic.  This game combines the best of both worlds in one of the best fantasy 4X packages I've ever played.  Civ's exploration/conquering/technology trees combined with units getting into Hero/Army style HoMM battles is what makes this game superior to other games of it's ilk.  Especially when you factor in being able to equip and outfit your heroes as your Technology Age advances.If you love either Civ or HoMM, or absolutely if you love both you must play this game.			"

Love Multiple victory conditions emphasizing many playstyles. Like to make friends and trade? Diplomatic victory. Like scaling the tech tree? Science victory. Like doing quests? Quest victory. Like building ""wonders""? Wonder victory. A major faction for everyone. Total of 11 unique major factions with all DLC (8 without DLC). Each of them plays very differently compared to the others. E.g. Broken Lords don't eat food, instead consuming dust to create new citizens. The Forgotten don't earn science on their own, instead they steal technology from other factions. The Empire Plan mechanic. Every 20 turns you select a new Empire Plan: military, economy and population, science and industry, and empire and expansion. Each plan represents a specific goal for that time period. If you are behind in science and need to catch up then going science and industry for 20 - 40 turns can help. Summer/Winter. During the summer the game plays as you would expect it... then winter hits and all hell breaks loose. In the early game winter is short and the penalties it levies are an annoyance at best. Mid to end game winter can cripple all players. Some races actually thrive during winter though; Allayi units take on a different form entirely during winter, changing their abilities to be more offensive.Hate Random map generation can occasionally screw you over. See: your first region being filled with infuriating cliffs and forests, making it impossible to place your initial settler. This sometimes forces you to mulligan your start and reroll the map.  Some factions so strongly favor certain victory conditions it is bordering on OP. Go to war with the necrophages to see what I mean. Unless you are very familiar with their weakness they have the tendancy to steamroll during elimination victories. Meanwhile: Broken Lords can create massive cities... we're talking hundreds of districts in size. Major factions are unique, but hero units are not. Heroes are supposed to be unique, but underneath their racial portraits they all fall into three categories: infantry, support, ranged. With such emphasis placed on making the races play differently I would have expected heroes to be similar. "

Early Access Review
								I bought into the early alpha access and have put in about 30 hours. Right now the art of what is implemented is there and it looks impressive. Learning the game and each race you should feel pretty good and it definitely has more to do than AoW3 even at this early stage. However, once you put in the time and you figure out a good build order and expansion balance, this game will quickly be very easy and boring to play. Right now by the time you get into the 2nd tech tree, you can create two armies and just go rampage the AI. When this goes live, or as it develops, however some things are going to have to happen to make this even worthy of comparing it to Civ 5. The aggressive AI is admittedly not implemented yet, but it will need to consistently challenge the player. Currently there are no victory conditions other than military dominations, something that will change. Currently there are no settings that increase the difficulty at all. You can barely get through the middle of the tech tree before the game ends on turns. Another problem that good players will struggle with is the differences between the races. When you first start they are huge differences. Broken lords do not use food at all and rely on dust. Necrophages have to kill to get food. Others get science bonuses. However, when you get to the point where you are good at this game, the differences between the races merely alter where you focus your population at each stage of the game. The differences are really minor at best. The quests and goodie huts get stale and repetitive as you play a lot of this game as well. Hoping that the minor factions play a bigger role as time goes on.  If you are used to a Civ 5 type game, where you use the terrain, leader and terrain type to gauge what victory condition you're going to go for..... this is going to be disappointing to you at this stage and the potential is still probably going to fall short. However, some things are going to be much better than Civ 5, such as the ability to create custom units using any of the basic (or assimilated) unit types. There are some terrible balance issues right now (i.e. ranged units dominate currently), but you can equip your units with serious fire power (at a cost, however). The map turns into your battlefield and the manual combat, when implemented properly, has the potential to make the strategy of moving about the map just as important as the battle itself. In civ 5 the game is won or lost in the first two eras. This game, however, picks up steam and has a lot of better late game potential if it didn't end so early.  Micromanagement is a 4x ""flaw."" In civ 5 worker and population management can be a downside for some. The same is true for this game. Standard exploits are present already where if a building/research project is one turn away, you literally have to go into the city and move population from production to another area so you can take advantage of the 1 turn bonus in that other area from moving them. THEN, once the project is completed, you have to move the population back. This gets tiresome when you have over 5 cities, and this game (unlike civ 5) benefits from as many cities as you can manage without going into rebellion.  I can definitively say this is already better than AoW3. But I can also say that it will never have the depth of Civ 5. Time will tell whether they get close enough to make it worth a fraction of the 1000+ hours I've already put into Civ.			"

Early Access Review
								Amplitude has provided yet another immersive 4X strategy game in this newest edition to the Endless series of games. I have to say, they have really knocoked my socks off with this game; the UI is crisp and clean, easy to follow, and will be easier when the tutorial is added.That being said, it does lack a tutorial at the moment, so not having experience with Endless Space would be a bad thing with this game. The two games play very much alike, although I prefer the lore and atmosphere of Endless Legend far more than its sister. As of this moment my pros for the game are as follows:Easy to get in toAmazing Lore and artwork, as to be expected.Beautiful terrainFar better combat systems when compared to Endless Space (my opinion)Well-implemented Empire quest systemThe current cons are few but present:Laughable Diplomacy: I excuse this on the grounds that this is early access, but as this game nears release I will start harping on it more frequently. The current cost of diplomatic action (devs and current players will know what I mean) is a grand idea, but the system seems rather broken at this time. I have often encountered AI empires and attempted negotiations with them, only to have war declared on me a few turns later. AI seem to ignore any attempts at diplomatic relations, as far as I have seen.Lack of Victory Condition Options: I assume this will come in the future, but for the past three games I have lost due to one of the AI reaching a score limit. The scenario is set to default, however the setting leaves out what victory conditions that entails. Conquest is a given condition, but score capacity? I'd like to know what the max score is that players have to reach to win. Sieges: Sieges are a great addition, but they don't make much in the way of sense. They cut off all benefits from the besieged city, but sicne cities don't seem to ever be conquered by them (as far as I have noticed), they seem rather pointless.In closing, this is an amazing game that has some flaws due to it being in development. Amplitude is an awesome studio that makes awesome games; furthermore, this game has a TON of potential, and they seem to be doing most everything right for now. I can dream that this becomes a well known 4X, since it has already consumed some number of my personal hours with its immersive lore, quests, and warfare. I believe this game is a worthy investment, especially in the Founder's edition, which I purchased myself. Great game, great mechanics, it's like someone in Amplitude is making their own universe a reality, something I can appreciate and admire. 9.5/10(InDev Score)			"

Also there seems to be no way to change the dificulty so as of right now the game feels easy, but all in all I have enjoyed the time spent playing this game I am hoping that there will be unit customization in this game like in Endless space, it seems like there is a spot for you too do that.

								its a really fun game :) im fan of strategy games and this one does its job good ^^ you have to look at more then just spamming units out there :p there are alot of dimplometic things and you can edit your units with other gear that you found or unlocked which is pretty cool for planning :p you can either make 2 units that are abit weaker or 1 unit thats really strong :p there are some things that i dislike atm tho... when in battle units will attack twice in one launch and you can chose which unit attacks what. however if the unit that you target is dead they will ofc look for another unit to attack :p and sometimes they dont target the right unit. like my archers would move foward to aim for another enemy with full health but another enemy unit is closer to them and is almost died which is annoying because i wouldnt need to get hit by the almost died enemy if i could have command the archers to do that :p anyways! its a really good game and i wasnt sure if i should buy it or not, but now im happy with it :) there is allot to do and there are still 4 fanctions and 2 ages to be released which is crazy			"

												The 4X genre has been around for a long time, and I think, as a fan, it's fair to say that most of us have certain expectations when we play a new 4X game.Endless Legend ticks all of these boxes confidently without adding much new of its own... which is not a problem!City management, while not especially intuitive, is robust. Research progression is interesting (as far as I can tell, you can't learn every Research Skill, so big decisions await regarding exactly what is important to your empire!), combat is strategic and fun (even if unit movement can get a little wonky), and overall I feel like I am in control of the destinies of all my little citizens!If you're a fan of the shared history of the Endless Games (as I am), there's a lot to love on that front as well, as the developers put a LOT of fluff in there to read, and it's all well done.Endless Legend is not ground-breaking or especially innovative, but it is fun, easy to play (for veterans of 4X games) and for 34.99 US you could certainly do a lot worse. There are a lot of big name 4X games coming out this year, but do an indie developer a favor and give their game a shot before everyone gets buried in Civ and Galactic Civ. There's always more room for fantasy 4X games on my Steam list.			"

But it is playable and I personally enjoyed it. Like I said, the concept shows potential.

Early Access Review
								I'm 15 hours in and just won my first game after 10+ starts. I absolutely love it, and I think AMPLITUDE has made some great changes to common 4X mechanics. If you love the Civilization series, you'll probably get some great gameplay out Endless Legend. Keep in mind, however, that the game is in alpha, so some features don't exist or aren't complete. Here are my thoughts on the gameplay, coming from someone who has put hundreds and hundreds of hours into Civ5:Map and Exploration=====One of my favorite aspects of EL is its maps. They're beautiful, and the concept of regions prevents city spamming and promotes city management. Tile anomalies also add strategy and diversity to the map. They're similar to Civ5's naturual wonders in that they have unique visuals and bonuses, but there is more variety and they are more common. Exploration is pretty startard fare, but ruins only have three outcomes: free dust, a quest, or nothing. I love the concept of minor factions, as they replace the mostly useless and generic barbarians found in the Civ series.Cities and Expansion=====Only one city can be founded in each region, so city placement is particularly important because you'll have to raze your own city if you picked a poor location. Most of my starts have been near good spots for my first city, so I usually don't wait to explore before settling. I recommend generating maps with small regions, however, to increase your options for expansion.City Expansion-----Cities can be expanded by building boroughs, which increase the tile reach of the city, and boroughs are upgraded by surrounding them with four regional improvements (city center, borough, or resource extractor). This is very different from Civ5's cultural borders, and I like having control over where my city expands. Additionally, ALL resources in a city's region can be improved with extractors--you do not need to place your city near them or expand towards them. This is a very welcome change and works perfectly with the one-city limitation. Most importantly, heroes can be assigned to cities and can give MASSIVE bonuses.Empire Expansion-----Every city you found decreases empire-wide approval by 10%, and I've had my best luck building up two powerful cities until I unlock the technologies required for more approval-increasing buildings. If you've pacified all minor faction villages in a region where you have a city, you can assimilate that faction, get their empire bonus, and build their units. The road technology is currently in development, so I haven't been able to build roads.Resources=====The game has three different types of resources: the FIDSI (food, industry, dust, science, and influence), luxury resources, and strategic resources.The FIDSI-----I'll ignore the obvious four (dust = gold, by the way), and just talk about influence. Influence is accumulated every turn and is required to perform diplomatic actions with other empires, assimilate minor factions, and institute empire plans. Every so often, you'll be able to spend influence to give your empire temporary bonuses with an empire plan. It's a great feature and gives you a variety of options for empire improvement (extra gold or science, additional unit movement, decreased building costs, etc.) every 20 turns or so.Strategic Resources-----Not much to say. They're similar to Civ5's, as they're revealed with technology and required to equip your army. What's cool is that your extractors extract the resources EVERY TURN. So like dust, you can accumulate them and spend them all at once or just spend them as you get them.Luxury Resources-----EL gets it right with luxury resources. In Civ5, they just give you boring happiness, but in EL you can spend stacks of them on temporary (often powerful) boosts to your empire. Just found a couple new cities? Spend a couple lux stacks to get a large boost to food and industry in all of your cities. Another of my favorite features. As with strategic resources, they're extracted every turn.Technology=====There is no tech tree in EL; you progress by technology eras. Each era has a set of techs and a cost at which all techs are researched. Once you research 10 techs in an era, the next era is unlocked and the cost for all techs goes up. While I love tech trees, this gives you more flexibility and prevents you from feeling obligated to research everything in every era. Why finish up era 1 with era 2 prices when era 2's techs are so much better and now cost the same? You have that option, of course, but advancing through eras is almost always better. Keep in mind that some techs aren't functional, and the last 2 eras are empty.Units and Combat=====Units-----Each faction has 3 units, excluding Settlers, and you can obtain new units by assimilating minor factions. While this is limiting, you can create unit designs to build. A design is just a set of equipment, so you can build slow, durable rangers with crossbows and full armor at the same time you're building speedy, fragile rangers with nothing but a 2-hand bow. The design aspect is very cool and creates a lot of strategy, but I do wish there were more available units.Combat-----Combat has been talked about quite a bit. You have two options for battle: manually set your units on a grid and watch it play out, or just let it automatically decide the outcome immediately. The manual option is kind of interesting and has a little strategy to it, but in my experience you can just build a powerful army and click ""Auto"" every time.The downside to combat (and units in general) is that ranged units are way too strong. There is no real feasible strategy other than buliding an army of ranged units, equipping them with no armor and a powerful 2-handed bow. Because they have no armor, they have high initiative and will always attack first in combat, and because of their powerful bows, they can kill any unit is one or two hits. Flying and infantry units need a MAJOR boost to either defense, initiative, or in-combat movement (or all of those). Right now they're just arrow fodder.Factions=====Play as Wild Walkers or Vaulters and win. Not only do the get the most powerful bonuses (Wild Walkers get industry from forest, Vaulters get science boost), but they start with ranged units and the era 1 techs that you'll always want. The game definitely needs faction balance, though if ranged units weren't so powerful it wouldn't be so bad. The Necrophages can build boroughs at a low cost, which is cool, but their units are no match against a ranged army.Missing Features Not Mentioned Above=====Diplomacy doesn't really exist in the game. When you meet other empires, you start off in a cold war, and they'll declare war on you a few turns later. I haven't been able to get an empire to like me or accept a truce, let alone enter an alliance. The button to execute a diplomatic action subtracts from your influence, but doesn't give any feedback about whether or not they accepted your offer. There isn't even a tech to propose a peace during war, only during a cold war.Trade routes also don't exist, so I guess the AI has no reason to accept a truce or enter an alliance.The AI right now doesn't create powerful unit designs with good equipment, so war gets pretty easy after you upgrade your units.All games currently end at turn 200, and there is no option to continue playing the map.It's too easy to get dust with a dust-related hero assigned to a river city.Verdict=====The game is the best alpha I've ever played, and its depth, gameplay, and fantastic visuals make up for its balance issues (which are easier to fix than bad gameplay). After putting over 500 hours into Civ5, Endless Legend is a fresh take on the 4X genre. If you can accept the lack of diplomacy and trade, building and expanding your empire is a lot of fun.			"

												I put 21 hours in this game in just four days.This is a great game featuring the best of Civilization and Heroes of Might & Magic.You play this as your ""ordinary"" hex tile 4X game. However when you enter combat you play the combat out on the same hexmap like you would play in a Heroes game. That is just an awesome combination.The game features several different races that all play very different. Not the civiliation different of ""Here you get that unit that is like all the others and looks differrent and has +1 stats"". No, we are talking of an elven kingdom called the ""WIld Walkers"" using basicly ranged combat or a race of dragons that tries to win the game via diplomacy. Or how about honorable undead ghosts? Every race can win by conquering - but there are many other options. Play it. You will love it.			"

												I bought Endless Legend because of the sheer beauty of it but when I first played, it didn't really 'click' in most part because the game doesn't do a great job of explaining its complexities. So around six months went by without another until a few days ago when I fired it up after enjoying a game of Endless Space (I had a similar experience with that too). This time I resolved to play through an entire game and then make up my mind. Six hours and a heavy defeat later I can safely say - Endless Legend is great. One of the best measures of a game is whether you have fun even when you lose and, while I came last in my play-through (I'm not very good at EL or ES it would appear) there came a point around three hours in when I sat back and thought 'This is really good'. I won't go into why because a lot of the reasons have already been covered in other people's reviews, but I did feel compelled to put my appreciation on record.			"

												Polished Civilization-like game with some interesting concepts.  It does a lot of things well, and is a solid turn-based empire strategy game.  It's just a little bit behind Civ 5 in quality.  A lot of the complaints I have with the game could be fixed with patches or expansions, though I know of none coming.Pro:-Unit customization that affects effectiveness-Races (nations) that have different gameplay styles, all mostly balanced-Good writing and story-Mostly painless multiplayer.  Simultaneous turns are welcome.-Good new concepts.  Winter is a period of increased cost and slowed movement, injects manageable uncertainty.  It can be thought of as a cyclical global economic depression.  No workers, just city buildings to improve tiles.Con:-World location quests need balancing.  Some objectives are much more annoying to fulfill than is justified by the reward.  Some rewards are useless, some are incredibly powerful, and overall the questing system does not reach its potential.  Some quests are tedious micromanagement (I refer to you, quest that requires a level 4 infantry hero to complete)-Computer difficulty.  The AI is not very challenging,  At higher difficulties, the computer players get resource bonuses.  AI is hard to do well for a strategy game, but this one is noticeably worse than Civ 5.  Games against the computer rarely last to completion: long before any victory conditions are met, the player will have achieved superiority, and a long slog through the remaining provinces remains.  With a large enough resource headstart, the computer will be very challenging in the early game, but can't keep pace with the player.-Writing and story.  One problem with having a single story-line for each race, even if it is well conceived and written, is that it doesn't give the same satisfaction on future playthroughs.-Terrain.  Whereas the distribution of resources in Civ 5 dictates expansion and diplomatic relations with other countries, in this game city placement is more of a task of selecting the highest output tiles.-Auto city governors.  These guys love to build unique buildings, and if you let them run free they will sink all your resources (non-refundable) into starting construction of the unique buildings in each city.-Research mechanic.  Each tech you research increases the cost of all future techs.  So if you skip over an early tech, going back to research it will effectively slow techs at your higher level.  I see the need to scale requirements with the greater research power of a large late-game empire, but the way it's implemented penalizes a large empire for researching low level techs.-Inadequate documentation.  The manual is a wiki page, and the developers seem to rely on the community to explain some game mechanics there.  What does the parasite skill do, and why do the slugs cast it on your own units?  (After battle it will spawn a unit from an affected enemy that dies, and nobody has any idea why the slugs cast it on friendlies.)  This is the sort of thing that should be explained.			"

												Were you one of those disappointed by the dull Civilization 5 reskin earlier this year that was Beyond Earth? Do you crave for a return of personality to the Civ-like 4x genre? Do you want a game that makes you want to start a new game as soon as your last one ended? Well, consider trying out Endless Legend.Firstly the mechanics of the game: It takes the functional shell of a Civ game but makes subtle tweaks to almost every mechanic so that the game feels very unique among its genre even as it retains the fundamentally strong core of a Civ 4 or 5. I'm not going to go over every smart thing this game does to switch up the formula, but trust me, the changes are mostly very positive and really make it an enjoyable experience. The questing system and the periodic bits of writing you get when doing faction quests are also quite strong and give the setting of the game some interesting 'pop'. Secondly the presentation: This is a game that looks and sounds impeccable. The game looks amazing with colorful and attractive visuals, the interface is sleek, and the sounds and music are all excellent. Finally the factions. The factions of Endless Legend are where, I believe, the game is truly special. Each faction is so unique and plays so differently from one another, it's just tremendous. While I've so far only tried out 2 of the 8 unique factions (1 is currently just a reskin of the other, I'm told this will be changed later on), the differences between the two changed my playstyle dramatically. While the nature of these differences generally pigeon-holes some of the factions into specific playstyles (Vaulters are going to necessarily use their bonuses to go for a science victory, the necrophages will probably be gunning for a domination or supremacy victory) I don't consider this a great weakness when the variety on offer is so strong.There are some weaknesses. No espionage system is a bummer. Imagine how cool it would be if you could hire heroes to work like probe teams from Alpha Centauri. Also it would be good if there were some big projects or wonders you could build like in those games. Some voiced snippets upon research to give the game some more flavor (which it already has a ton of) would be nice too. The tutorial for the game is inadequate and it took a full playthrough for me to really come to terms with all of its mechanics.With continued support this could be one of the finest 4x games ever made. If you're a fan of the genre, pick it up.			"

												Wow, what a game. Honestly, it's hard to actually dislike a game like this, to me at least, or in general, an expierienced strategy game player. If we speak about the game, the simplest thing is, it's a combination of the tile system of Civilization Five, and the story, unit systems, and advancements of Endless Space.If we get complicated...Endless Legend is to Endless Space, as Warhammer is to Warhammer 40 Thousand. Except Endless is actually relative to all the games. They all connect in some way, and they are similar. All Endless games are heavy on Strategy, and are difficult games in general, to most. If you liked Endless Space, or Dungeon of Endless, there is a fair chance that you will like, possibly love, Endless Legend. The Good is - Lovely UI, look wiseSpecific Graphics, sharp edges except for units and some factionsWell science trees and techs, if some are illogicalAn EXP system for next to every unit, I think, anyway.NuetralEverything is explained by the magical essense called Dust.Smart AIEnough variety that a single strategy may not work every time.BadQuests, sometimes they require you to achieve or do something, that is not actually possible for a very long time. IE, a quest recieved on turn 5 may not be fulfilled until turn 50.Lore breaking, I suppose? Lore tech- Vaulters survive, and are a faction in Endless Space, which takes place in 3000, EL takes place very early.Random surroundings. A dirt field having a random tile of sand, or a desert, sand or ice, having water.			"

												My current favorite 4X. The art style is quite beautiful and the sound is top notch (something this developer always manages to pull off in my opinion). The gameplay is quite solid and the interface is very clean and easy to use and understand.Pick one of the premade factions (that all play quite differently) or create your own by picking their race and their passives/perks. Each faction has a story that's progressed by completing quests. There are even side quests you can pick up. These quests help add goals that make the turns a little more interesting than just spamming ""Next Turn"". You can also assimilate minor factions that are located within your territories. This will allow you to use that faction's special unit in your military.The world is made up of regions, and there can only be one city per region. This makes you plan your expansions a little more carefully as you hunt down strategic and luxury resources (which you can only extract if they're within your borders) or possibly even look for chokepoints to build your cities in so you always have a terrain advantage. Cities can be expanded tile by tile as your population grows, which in turn increases the amount of land that you're exploiting for resources. Putting a hero in charge of your city will also give that city very nice buffs as the hero levels and you pick new perks.The combat is quite satisfying if you choose to play it out tactically. You can either auto-resolve, spectate, or manually control your units each battle. You can even watch other players' battles in multiplayer if you're allied with them. The combat isn't as deep as some of the other more war focused 4x games, but it's also a lot less time consuming which is something I appreciate a great deal. You should keep terrain and reinforcements in mind as well. You may be able to take out the small army next to you, but the one a few tiles away might reinforce it mid-battle. You'll also need to outfit your units and heroes as you unlock stronger weapons and armor. This will increase their production cost and, depending on what you outfit them with, add strategic resources to the cost.As briefly mentioned above, this game has heroes that you can either put in charge of your armies or cities. While with an army, they will fight on the field with them. Whether a general or governor, they will level up. This allows you to pick passives that will help them no matter their situation. For example, if they're a governor, pick passives that will increase food or industry production; if a general, give them passives to buff your units. There are also hero only pieces of equipment that you'll come across and quests requiring a hero (sometime of a specific race).The diplomacy feels a bit lacking, but I've never been one to try for Diplomatic Victories in any 4X. I mostly use it to get map vision and create temporary alliances while I hunt others down.The tech tree is quite large, and I like the progression system it uses. Instead of tech directly leading to another, you have to research a certain number of techs from the previous tier to unlock the next tier.Overall, I'm a huge fan of this game. Great art, sound, music, and interface. The game plays and runs well, and it's backed by an active developer.			"

												This game has an incredible amount of detail. Sid Meier's Civilization is the only thing I can compare it to. The gameplay is relatively similar: turn-based empire building where every construction or unit costs a city's production to create or expand. But where Endless Legend differs is its focus on simplicity. In Civ 5, you see your armies splayed out on the map, each one taking up a space, which makes mass movement a very calculated process. However, Endless Legend allows you to merge your armies to make a larger one and the best part is that army only takes up one space on the map! One of the highlights for me as an avid RPG player is the focus on customization. You can field heroes much as you can generals in Civ 5. However, instead of Civ 5's seemingly random bestowing of generals, you have much more control in how you obtain your heroes, what they carry into battle, and where they will function in your world. You can customize them using not only their individual ability tree, but also by their race to suit your needs. Having only played the game for a few weeks, I haven't seen all there is to see in Endess Legend. But I can say it leaves me wanting more every turn I play. Also, the Easy difficulty is much more punishing than you think.			"

												Having finally put more hours and multiple games into Endless Legend, I can now comfortably say that it is just as fun, if not slightly more so, than the other game we've probably all played - Civilization 5.The comparison between the two games basically ends at ""4x game"" and ""Empire building/management."" Beyond that, the games play very differently as its core mechanics are similar, yet different.The best thing about Endless Legend is in its Endless Universe - an original, story-rich environment that spans all of their games; In fact, people who played Endless Space will recognize that Endless Legend takes place on a unique planet that spawns in that game -- Auriga.Expanding on this is the fact that the factions are not only diverse, but are actually very different from each other, with their own strengths and weaknesses; More than I can say about the relatively 'bland' Civs from Civ5.In Civ5, the best things about the various Civs were in their individual character; They represent known leaders from history, and their dialogue and actions strive to align with their personalities. However, ultimately, every Civ boiled down to a couple bonuses here and there, with one unique ability to prevent them from being exactly the same as each other. Unfortunately, I felt most of these Unique Abilities were simply an extension of a fairly simple bonus - More Culture, or Production, or Science, etc. Occasionally you had ones that affected other systems, such as stealing technology, or annexing City-States, which were a bit more unique.In Endless Legend, the factions' mechanics themselves are functionally different from each other, much more than simple bonuses and penalties. Do not misunderstand -- there is still a system of bonuses and penalties (such as +1 science per tile, -1 Food per tile, etc.) but each faction's UA causes these to have different amounts of value to the player. For example, there is one faction (Broken Lords) who doesn't need any Food at all - Imagine the options available when you can outright completely ignore one of the basic resources! Another faction (Necrophages) instead generates extra Food through slaughter with their armies; Imagine if Civ5's Zulus were aggressive because killing things was how they grew their cities, instead of just being needlessly aggressive because that's what they liked doing.Unfortunately, the diplomatic game leaves much to be desired. It's functional, but the interactions simply aren't as 'fun' as those in Civ5 where, again, the best thing about the Civs were their individual characters, which are flaunted quite proudly in their diplomatic interaction screens (even if the diplomatic logic was flawed, but then that goes for both games.)In the end, I find both games fun and ""one more turn""-ish, but they cater to different 'games' and requiring different strategies. To that end, I do recommend Endless Legend, not as a replacement, but as a change of pace from Civ5, and switching between the two depending on my playstyle mood.Finally, just as with Civ5, pick up the expansions/DLC. Civ5 is quite boring without Brave New World, and I feel Endless Legend is a bit basic without Guardians (for World/National Wonders,) Shifters (for new Winter mechanics,) Tempest (for Naval play,) and Shadows (for the Espionage system.)

												Hey Everyone!Now I don't normally write recommendations, however his game is worthy of it. To begin, people who don't enjoy Civilization would struggle to enjoy Endless Legend, as they are the same type of game.However, as opposed to guiding humanity through history, Endless Legend allows you to craft your own civilization in a futuristic fantasy world. Futuristic Fantasy you ask? Well there are demons, as well as high tech exploitation of resources. Cool stuff if you ask me. The game looks absolutely fantastic, and is probably one of the best looking strategy games I've played. Further, the download is under 2gb! Gameplay is deep, and rewards forward thinking and planning of city positioning. The A.I. is pretty good, more predictable and more realistic than the Civ A.I., however it seems a little too passive and generally won't engage in a war unless provoked or absolutely necessary.Leading onto that, the combat system in this game is very unique and while a bit odd to come to terms with, is very intuitive and ultimately fun. Some negatives are it is a hard game to pick up. The tutorial isn't bad, and does a good job and teaching the basics but it took me a few games to fully understand how to play the game properly and well. Furthermore, the endgame seems a little messy and it's difficult to understand what needs to be done to achieve victory, but again this will come to the player who spends a few good hours tinkering with the game.Overall, a very solid game and one every strategy and 4X fan should look into!

												I bought Endless Legend on a whim to satisfy my 4x cravings whilst waiting for Beyond Earth and as such wasn't expecting that much.Overall it's worth buying, especially as it's not yet in full release and will no doubt get better when it is.The good:1) factions are varied and each has unique mechanics which completely alter gameplay.2) the graphics are very nicely done and work on a low-mid level spec machines.3) the storylines for the various factions add another element of depth to the game.The bad:1) The AI is very passive, even on higher levels of difficulty. Though if you want a challenge, set your world on hard with aggressive barbarians and watch as they wipe out the AI factions (and you, if you're not careful).2) Combat is a bit lacklustre and unless you're severely outnumbered doesn't pose that much of a challenge. Partly due to the AI, the computer doesn't upgrade its units very well.3) The tech tree can be a little odd. It's possible to unlock the last tier of research whilst still researching medieval-level tech.Overall it's a solid game and with some updates to the AI and balancing of certain units (driders can make an army virtually immortal) it should get better. I'd give it 7.5/10.			"

												This is not just 'another 4x stock gameplay rehash'.If you enjoy 4x in general and want to play a game that ACTUALLY puts a new twist on it, then this game is well made and does exactly that.Compared to Civ...-Factions are actually unique, in significant ways.-Terrain features have a much larger impact on gameplay. Hence, random map generation can lead to a more unique game than in Civ where all that really matters is how many enemies you have on your starting continent, and maybe how long it takes you to get horses.-Hero units which aren't just 'generals' giving passive buffs.-Combat isn't just a dice roll with summed attack vs defense. Since there are actual tactics, unit composition is important.-Create custom units by choosing equipment for a base model type. Eg, flying dragon with +ranged defense items, etc. This it a lot more interesting than 'mass highest tech level tank-equivalent unit till i win'.			"

												I literally can't stop playing this game. I knew nothing about it when I bought it, just one of the dozen supercheap games of the Holiday sale. I played through it three times (losing each time), uninstalled it to try out some of the other games, then changed my mind and reinstalled it. It's wrecking my marriage. I need help.			"

												Really good 4X game... multiple races and lots of units, all customizable. If you want a real challenge you'll need to crank the difficulty, otherwise once you know what you're doing you're going to box out the AI. That said, it's a fun game. A full game can take an evening or a whole day, each faction has their own storyline and playstyle than they are very different yet balanced. I was really impressed by what they accomplished with the different races and units here. The world, resources, and technology are interesting, fun, and meaningful as well. There is so much to the game just from an economy perspective. Have no regrets getting this game. Only sad issue is it seems there are a few little ""expansion packs"" for the game, that while they would be fun if you had them, aren't really substantial enough to warrant the expense. Good thing you won't need them. :D Recommended!			"

												This is not just 'another 4x stock gameplay rehash'.If you enjoy 4x in general and want to play a game that ACTUALLY puts a new twist on it, then this game is well made and does exactly that.Compared to Civ...-Factions are actually unique, in significant ways.-Terrain features have a much larger impact on gameplay. Hence, random map generation can lead to a more unique game than in Civ where all that really matters is how many enemies you have on your starting continent, and maybe how long it takes you to get horses.-Hero units which aren't just 'generals' giving passive buffs.-Combat isn't just a dice roll with summed attack vs defense. Since there are actual tactics, unit composition is important.-Create custom units by choosing equipment for a base model type. Eg, flying dragon with +ranged defense items, etc. This it a lot more interesting than 'mass highest tech level tank-equivalent unit till i win'.			"

												Essentially, this is everything I could have hoped Civilization: Beyond Earth will be and more.That said, for anyone who has played the Civilization series, this is a bit more abstract. For instance, technically there are only 4 units per race (one of those being a settler unit, which doesn't quite count). You aren't even guaranteed to have one of every type of unit (flying, infantry, ranged, and cavalry). However, you are able to absorb minor native races into your own, granting you access to many new units. Plus, rather than all units being the same, you are allowed to pick and choose items for them, as well as making entirely new styles of a unit based on the basic unit blueprint. So you could have one cavalry meant to move fast and hit hard, while another is meant to soak up damage. So in this way, compared to Civ there is an infinite number of units, in a slightly less straightforward way.A couple of other features take getting used to, even if you have played Endless Space before (though it does carry on a quite a few things from Endless Space). There are a few things I don't entirely agree with (the diplomacy mechanic could use some work), and definitely some things that need some work or expansion, but based on Endless Space I would say the developer will patch the game quite a bit. Plus the graphics are very, very eye-catching. I think this is the first game I’ve actually paused to look at the graphics.Edit: Thought I would add this about anyone who was concerned about things that are lacking at the moment. In the forums, they did a Q&A and answered a number of questions about where the game was headed and whether they will continue updating and expanding it like they have done with Endless Space.http://forums.amplitude-studios.com/showthread.php?36196-Q-amp-A-Ask-us-(almost)-anything "

												Endless Legend is easier than Endless Space, and by easier, I mean less stressful, a lot less stressful.With that being said it's also a vast improvement on what Endless Space set up, Endless Legend's UI is lot less cluttered and easier to navigate, stuff (anomalies, terrain) is spread out over the hexes, and luxuries do more than provide industry, science and so on, when you have enough of them you can activate them for a major boost.There's also a lot less big waiting for units or improvements to finish production, which is really nice when setting up new cities. Not to mention you can equip heroes now, and best of all the combat system is no longer card playing but actual right there battles, turn based.All in all Endless Legend hits a high mark just like Endless Space did, and was a major relief after dealing with stress Endless Space may put on, and Endless Legend is no less difficult than Endless Space is/was, so expect a challenge, bring your A-game!

												In total, the game is pretty straight forward and good. The victory conditions and controls for game rules are unique and are, at least to me, the main draw for this game vs over 4X games. However, there is one area where the game feels like it falls flat: combat. Combat happens in a pseudo-simulataneous turn layout that, to me, feels exceptionally clunky and manual control is poorly implemented. A combat turn begins with you issuing general commands to individual units and once you hit go, the turn executes for all units on both sides of the conflict with faster units moving first. The problem with this setup is that if any other unit moves into the area you instructed a unit to move to, it disregards the order and re-assigns to whatever order the AI feels is the most important move. It would have been just as easy to begin a turn, rotating through the units in order of speed and issuing individual commands that execute and complete before moving onto the next unit in the turn. Instead, they threw this tried and true system to the wind to create this clunky, chaotic and often times infuriating system in which the actual player does interacts tactically with his units very little and the computer basically controls the entire flow of combat.Overall I'd give the game a 7/10.Strategic gameplay and lore: 9/10Combat: 5/10			"

A solid 4x turn-based strategy game with a unique universe, art direction, and quest system that breaks it from the pack and makes it a great game amongst many, not counting the extended universe that spans 2 more games.+ Solid, consistent 4x game in the vein of the Endless Universe.+ Different factions play completely differently thanks to wise application of characteristic mechanics unique to the faction, from one that is wholly dedicated to Dust production for both ""food"" and ""money, to another that cannot directly wage wars, to another that can leverage strategic resources for faction-wide benefit.+ Hauntingly beautiful art direction that seemingly lifts from the concept art right into the game assets wonderfully, as if the game itself is made out of the art on a Magic: The Gathering card.+ Rest of the game looks, flows, and works very cleanly, from UI to graphical fidelity to stability and performance, and actually plays on IGP (read: Intel HD Graphics) hardware when my GPU died at acceptable levels (with everything turned down).+ Endless Universe is a large, deeply engrossing lore-universe to dig into if you are into lore, which spans 3 games as of this review.- Combat is a weak point as with all of Amplitude's offerings so far, with obscure mechanics, number crunching and uninspired and wooden animations, which is a shame since the rest of the game looks and flows wonderfully regardless.

												The first thing Legend does right is that it disregards genre tropes in favor of injecting its own unique lore into a fully realized and lush game world. One can't help but compare Auriga with Brian Reynolds' sentient planet Chiron in the 4X classic Alpha Centauri. Though perhaps not quite as epic as Firaxis' earliest and most grand creations, Legend's universe and the inhabitants of Auriga are no less captivating.The turn-based gameplay is similar to that of Sid Meier's Civilization series, but brings a number of innovative features and improvements to the table that I've been crying for since Civilization II. Legend also borrows from other classic and highly regarded strategy franchises like Heroes of Might & Magic and Age of Wonders. The wealth of options available to the player for directing the evolution of his faction is staggering. I don't think I'll ever have enough time to explore every single nook and cranny of this game. With all of the expansions, there is a huge amount of content here.The in-game tutorial is adequate for getting your feet wet, but ends rather abruptly, leaving quite a few important gameplay elements untouched upon. Thankfully the UI and comprehensive tooltip systems do a great job of filling in many of the blanks. If you've ever played a strategy game like this before, you'll acclimate quickly.Highly recommended for veterans of the genre, and friendly enough to keep from scaring away interested newcomers too. The developers of Civilization 6 would be well-advised to take a look at some of the unique mechanics in Endless Legend; and perhaps take a few notes while they're at it.			"

												Endless Legend is an interesting beast, in many ways.First of all, each faction is unique. If you're used to Civilization factions, which have maybe a unique unit or two and some kind of resource boost, you may have to take some time to readjust.Each faction has powers and mechanics that render them VERY different from each other. For example, one faction relies entirely on money for its population growth. Another has such diplomatic mastery that it can force treaties through. One can only build one city, and relies on converting minor factions for resources and military.Secondly, the seasons. While writing this I only have the Guardians expansion installed, and there's another expansion that deals with seasons, so keep that in mind.Auriga has two seasons: summer and winter. At first, winter is simply a minor inconvenience, lowering resource production and movement for a few turns. However, Auriga is a dying world, and winter comes more and more frequently as the game drags on, and becomes more and more harsh.Preparing for winter becomes incredibly important, as an empire that does not have the proper means of dealing with it will fall behind.While I mainly find winter to be a bit of a nuisance, grinding the game to a halt when it gets bad, it does offer a lot of strategic depth to the game.Then there's combat. I honestly find the system a bit unwieldly, and recommend simply using auto-resolve for fights, but there's certainly room for tactics if one wishes it. Overall, however, it is much more important to keep your armies up to date and packed with the right units to counter your opponents.4X is generally about macro more than micro.Heroes. You start with one, they help your armies out, some locations require them to be interacted with. But don't just storm off exploring! Consider setting your hero up as governor of a city, gaining experience every turn and providing benefits. Come winter, you'll be glad to have one to keep your city from becoming completely snowed in.Then there's quests. These can be ignored if you want to, but each faction has a story to explore, and minor quests crop up all over the map. Quests do grant you valuable resources and items, so they're definitely worth pursuing if you can spare the units.Lastly, city building. Alright, listen up, this is important: you expand you city by building burroughs. Any tiles adjacent to or under a burrough grants you its listed income of science, food, industry, dust(money), and influence. But you don't want to stretch your city out too much, because tightly built cities get bonuses. So, when settling, judging your options for expansion is important.Furthermore, the strategic resources available depend on the region you settle in, rather than proximity to your city. As long as the resource is within the regional border, you can build an extractor on it.Overall, this game is a great little timesink, and one I recommend for fans of the genre. It looks great, sounds great, and plays great. Just be aware that it's not a game that ends quickly.			"

												 Its graphically beautiful, and has a deep backstory with unique characters. The city sector building system is much like how Civ 6 is described to be, if a bit more simplistic. The combat system is pretty fun, and makes for a secondary tactical game on top of the Civ like strategy element. Now where it falls short is navel combat is quite rudimentary and the late game as a whole gets rather dull. It just sort of falls flat and turns into another Civ clone to finish it off (though I do like how the ""cultural"" victories for each race are unique). I really like it, but I want it to do more.

They're like Civ's city-states but with unique stories and units.I will definately purchase if/when it drops to 75% off, but the couple of bugs I saw make me wary to spend more (at least while I still have a game backlog).

												This game feels fantastic. After my enth playthrough of civ V, I wondered if there was more that I could do to make it feel like I commanded a nation. This game provided more of an answer. The base game is pretty great (soundtrack alone is superb), but like Civ V it feels more polished with every expansion. By the time Tempest came out it felt so full of life that it was unreal. The background lore is refreshing, with some tie-ins with endless space if you have played, but not alienating if you have not. The mechanic of 'Winter' is something that changed the pace of the game, especially if you have Shifters. Naval combat/sea control is the focus of Tempest, and the rarely used espionage system in Shadows is interesting and provides a host of options. Guardians adds some great units and events, and the remaining DLC are icing on the cake. Mods are supported but pretty sparse. Honestly it suits the game. If you want to get a mod that creates a god-tier faction, go ahead. Steamroll those *****. If you want more traits for your well balanced civ, have at. Makes events feel ancient, with a main quest that is optional for each civ, but so much fun to go through. At first it can be overwhelming with all of the new info, but once you play through a game (and maybe die) things make more sense. Try it out. Goes on sale with decent regularity. Pay attention to the news about the game. I bought shifters literally two days before they released Tempest and I could have gotten both for the price that I payed for one. Such is Steam.

												If you have ever played a game of Civilization and thought 'this is pretty fun' and wanted to play other similar strategy games then I cannot reccomend Endless Legend highly enough. There is certainly a bit more to learn than for a Civ game (Civ directly tying to our world rather than a fantasy realm help it enormously) there is far, *far* less to learn than in a Paradox Interactive title like Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis. Thats the short of it. Keep reading if you want to go more in depth with me.Endless Legend has frankly the most original setting and inhabitants I may have encountered in any form of media. Little to nothing feels pulled from the Tolkien-inspired vein of fantasy that dominates stories. I could sterotype factions as samurai moths, viking spacefarers, mages a little too into BDSM, or a robot cult; however, none of these really convey the whole image of what you encounter. Playing the various factions and completing their quests is like a mystery novel wherein you are viewing the same events from multiple perspectives and peeling back the layers of misunderstanding and slanted perspectives to develop a picture of what is really going on.Not to say the game is without its faults. I may just be dense, but the tutorial is in the running for all-time worst I've expierenced. It introduced the mechanics, but I felt it didn't draw attention to the varying importance of the mechanics it was introducing or painting a picture of how I might want to go about accomplishing longer term goals. This does tie back into the the boon mentioned at the start that is Civ's anchoring in the real world: the lack of real world analogs leaves you feeling out the systems in the dark. Trust me though there is a sense and order to things even if it isn't apparent at first glance.To end I'll just briefly touch on recommendations on the big DLCs. Guardians integrates most seemlessly and polishes off the rough edges of the core title. While it doesn't have a faction packaged with it, trying to play a game without it after having expierenced it feels hollow. The other 3 major expansions (Shadows, Shifters, and Temptest) offer 3 more factions and the mechanics they are most at home with. All change your gameplay decisions, all are quality. I'd recommend all of them but you could do without them as well. Any DLC can be toggled off on a game-by-game basis though so don't feel locked in or out. Plus the game follows the super player friendly 'if the host owns the DLC, all players have access' policy.			"

Not to mention it's absolutely gorgeous, the battle system is really tight, the faction differences really matter and the music is the most chill soundtrack I think I've ever heard for a game such as this, and all of this also goes for Endless Space too, which is another great game. 10/10 would buy again.

												Endless Legend has only been around since 2014 but its rewards for the ardent 4X gamer are “timeless.” It is certainly one of the most beautiful and evocative realms in all of PC gaming and the Amplitude development team deserves, that’s right, unending praise for their accomplishment. Wonderfully, they continue to support and build on that accomplishment, as their latest “Tempest” expansion proves, opening up the boundless seas of Auriga’s world for exploration, new modes of combat, rare minerals, a new race,  and new capabilities with which to build’s one world.As a “seasoned gamer” of 60+ years, I especially appreciate the game’s  cerebral challenge, especially its  customization choices, world-building, questing, and hero-building. Combat is not the high point for the real treat in Endless Legend is the infinitely replayable gameworld itself, shimmering and shining with colorful terrain and plentiful resources and vasty continents and seas to be explored. If there is any flaw in the game design it is that the “recurring winter” syndrome becomes a bit tiresome and the mid to end game could be spruced with more random events and surprises. Let’s hope Amplitude holds on tight and never lets Auriga go.			"

												I don't often write reviews, because few games deserve one, be they positive or negative. This game however is special. Its one of the most unique 4x games I've ever played. I'm not a veteran with the genre, but this is one of the titles that has opened my eyes this style of gaming and truly showed me how much I can love it. This is not going to be an in-depth review, rather one based on emotion. I LOVE this game. The mechanics are so satisfying and the game has so much depth and variety through the different factions that it provides huge amounts of replayability. If you like or love 4x games or turn-based strategy in general, you're a fool if this game isn't in your collection. Worth every penny, full-price or not.			"

												Is the game worth it for the single player? Yes, it has various difficulties for challenge, numerous ways to play the game, and unique civilzations to play as.Is the game worth it for the multiplayer? If you can find people to play with you yes absolutely. Public lobbies are not too common.This has become my favourite 4x game. "

												A great and enjoyable take on 4x. In particular, I found the questing aspects to be a particularly enjoyable aspect of the game, whereas other 4x games I've played have not had them. It is also nice being able to play diverse factions as opposed to slightly differed bonuses like countries in civ5. The biggest drawback I experienced was combat in multiplayer -- it can take a long time to get through turns with a large amount of fighting.			"

												I just got back to this game and re-loaded partly as I was interested in the new Tempest release.  This game has a lot to offer those who love the 4x model.  First a bit about the game, there is a learning curve, the tutorial is out there and will get you started, but by know means extensive so a few restarts are normal. While playing on the ""very easy"" level is really not much of a challenge against the AI, I would play a game there just so you can get the mechanics down, you really do need to learn to keep a close eye on your growing empire, this comes more apparent as you move up in the level you want to play. There are a lot of limiting factors in the game, each balancing out the play.  You do have to pay attention to your growth and your cities or you can find yourself resource poor, money poor, influence poor and so far behind the eight ball you will be hitting the start of a new game from the main menu.Graphics and Sound, personally graphics in a 4x game is the least important, and the map can be a bit of a challenge graphically wise, but nothing that is a stopper. Sound, I typically don't even play with the sound on, so not important.  Unit Graphics are nice, and meet the needs of the game.  Overall the look is fine.Interfaces, not perfect, but not hard to navigate, you don't have to go down more than one to two levels to find what you need. So getting where you need to go, and getting what you need to get done, is quick.  Movement is click on a unit and move the cursor to where you want to go then mouse click.  Easy enough.The game play, this game is a ""Just One More Turn"" game.  This is what a good 4x game does, in my opinion, you get rolling and there is always something to do, and somewhere to go, especially in the mid game.  There is a lot of checks and balances in the game to prevent over expansion as your empire population gets unhappy with you expanding to quickly.  So the game is not just about expanding and grabbing every region as  you will find yourself with an unhappy population which effects your cities outputs.  Low outputs, means slower production, slower population growth etc.....There are lots of resources in the game, some of which makes more powerful units, others give bonuses to your region and city.  Building a city in the right place is important, as being able to control your growth and expand your city takes planning of your new Districts, you get bonuses for a good growth.  The game balances this nicely with the tech research.  You can choose pretty much any tech in your Era you are not limited to a path, keep in mind that you may need to shift how you research through out the game as you try to balance the game and meet the needs.  Do you select researching a more powerful unit, or do you select bonuses that allow you to equip current units with more powerful weapons.  Do you select production buildings over money making Buildings.  Typically there is an ever increasing cost to opening new research no matter what the era, so selecting a research you passed in Era 1 while  you unlocked Era 4, does not really quicken your research.  Over all this game has a lot going for it, continued DLC support adds challenges and new leaders and factions.  9/10, especially since it is on sale. "

												One of the best 4x games i've ever played. It's up there with Civ. I can't say one or the other is better, but it has certain mechanics that really set it apart and make it an original. I do wish there was an equivalent of the Civilopedia in the game. A lot of information is not immediately available and requires a google search. Some key information relating to approval needs to be better explained in the tutorials, but there is plenty of information on this topic online.The combat system is neat because it involves more strategy in a way that's different from civ. There are aspects of combat that you will notice the absence of compared to civ, like the air and naval combat which is mostly missing from endless legends. I find that the combat system is very good overall.Some unique things compared to civ: -Winter system-Unique and different playable factions (the factions you can play are quite a bit different from one another and influence their playstyles, improving replayability)-Lore and backstory-Technology system-Districts and regions			"

												I've played the civ games since I started gaming so I love this type of game. That being said I think this game is great because its not trying to copy civ, like I've seen so many times. It has plenty of it's own unique things to make it stand out. The factions all have their own kind of playstyle which drastically changes how you play. There are countries who don't use some of the basic resources instead opting to use gold to replace them. This forces you to focus on what you're researching and planning towards. I'm still working out the combat system since you need to find a good mix of units. This game overall though has great replayability and I highly suggest playing it. 10/10 hands down.			"

												This 4X game is incredible. I prefer this game over Civ. Not saying that Civ is bad, still a great game, but I truly feel that each race I play has a completely different strategy to winning. With all the DLC that is available now, especially the new one that was recently released, Tempest (Oct 2016), the game now feels more complete and has new elements that were in desperate need before, such as naval battles. The game is beautifully designed and has a certain characteristic that separates it from other 4X games. Even clocking in at over 100 hours with this game now, I have yet to fully explore all the races and master them. That is how involved each race is. Games even on the fastest setting still have a length in which you need a considerable amount of time, but is possible to do in one sitting. However, I feel like sometimes the automatic battles are a bit goofy and can cost me some games, but I guess that’s what you get when you can only process a battle based off numbers.			"

												This game is fantastic. It is everything Civ V is and more, so much more. It has depth and flexibility that Civ is still lacking to this day (even with the release of VI, which included some features Endless Legend has had for 2+ years). The espionage system is actually really neat and includes some really useful things to help handicap other factions.The battle system is possibly the most fun (although lengthy) part of the game. This game features unit-stacking armies which you can combine with a hero, but when battle starts it breaks all the units and lets you position them and choose their targets at your whim. This adds a great layer to strategy as certain terrain offers different bonuses, and setting up your units intelligently can make all the difference in battle. You can also equip your hero (and units) with items, upgrading them as the game goes on to further increase your power.It truly offers unique, repeat play as each faction has unique units, bonuses, and playstyles that completely change the way the game is played. Additionally the minor factions are actually useful, each mini-faction providing you a new unit and bonus if they are assimilated into your empire. Combine that with a neat little quest system, amazing tech trees, great lore, FANTASTIC music, and you have easily the best strategy game available at the moment.The graphics are beautiful and the ability to scroll all the way out to easily locate resources, units, and borders is a great feature as well. Honestly there are so many positive things I could go on all day. In terms of cons I would say that it is certainly a lengthy game, manually controlling the combat can really add up over time, so it certainly isn't for the faint of heart. At the same time turns generally progress quickly and you are not forced to constantly manage your units/productions so you can move the game forward fairly quickly.			"

												Turn-based fantasy games are the main reason why I play computer games, through the years I played all of them, so I guess I can call myself a connoisseur. That being said, I must admit that Endless Legend is one of the best designed games of that kind. Certainly some very intelligent and talented people stand behind it. It basically builds up on the complexity of FE:LH and successfully adds another set of unique mechanics to the genre. Also, graphics style is unique, the music is nice, and UI is one of the best I ever used in games (although I'd prefer its graphics to be less mobile-like & flat). There's really only a few minor things I don't like. So far I'm disappointed that factions like Necrophages have the same development tree like higher races - I wouldn't really expect them to have schools, laboratories, etc. - after all they're just an insect parasite zombies. And personally I'd expect Ardent Mages with their philosophy to look more like Cenobites from Hellraiser movies.			"

The game is more challenging and exiting. After all you are writing your own legend. Playing as the Wild Walkers I was just minding my own bussiness, then the Ardent Mages declared war on me. From there after rolling over their cities, my love for combat and conquest could not be quenched. I declared war on everyone, and destroyed them all. Auriga can only have one ruler and that ruler is me! I deffinatley recommand this game to anyone who loves empire building. 9/10.			"

												If you think it's just a Civ 5 clone, it's not. The major gameplay aspects are similar, but that's about it. It seems like there's a deep, complex lore hidden. Also the battle system is way different, it almost turns into a RTS during battle.			"

												Some of the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time, I keep losing track of time constantly I get so consumed by everything thats going on.  Everything on the map looks amazing, from the buildings to the environments to your army units.  All of the different factions feel completly unique allowing for vastly different experiences depending on who you're playing as and who against giving the game great replay value can't recommend this game enough.

												It's hard to think of anything wrong with this game.If you found Civ 5 interesting at all, Endless Legend is like an improved and more interesting version.One of the best things for me is this game does a terrific job at giving you freedom from micromanaging every little thing.  In the beginning game, you probably want to micromanage a lot, and you can totally do that.  But when you're ready to go on the offensive (which means different things for different races) there are easy ways to step back and automate the minutia.Arguably the main attractions are the different races themselves.  The first three have a lot in common in terms of playstyle, but they are each aimed at totally different win conditions.  The other five (that come with the basic game) have very distinct approaches with pronounced strengths and weaknesses.  Three more races are available with expansions.Besides all that, I would just point out the replay value.  You can alter the game so much just by changing a few of the basic options at the beginning, like geographical patterns or just difficulty.You can also create custom races if you want.  The system is pretty involved, and there's some constraints in place to keep you from going too god-mode.  But I like that.  It makes it like a minigame.Come to think of it, I wish there was a way to create custom heroes.  Not an extremely practical wish, but maybe in the realm of possibility for a future expansion or sequel.			"

												     I was a little unsure about this game before purchasing it. I am a fan of the Total War series, Hearts of Iron and Final Fantasy Tactics. I would say that this game is a combination of these 3 games. I do not like the Civilization series at all and as such I was worried when reviews said that it is similiar, yet different, to Civ. In my opinion, this game blows the Civ series out of the water. They are in fact similiar but different and it caters to people who did not exactly care for Civ. The music is amazing, this was a high selling point as some games have soundtracks that make you want to tear your headphones off after they repeat the same track for the 30th time 35mins into a session. The Music list is expansive and glorious.The Art is amazing. The building design, character design, background design, all of it is amazing. It gives me a Magic the Gathering vibe and it is glorious. THe city building is very cool. My first region/city looked hilarious as I was still trying to figure out the mechanics. But once you do it is very rewarding.Combat is very fun. I find myself finding it similar to Final Fantasy Tactics rather than Civ. This is a rewarding experience to me. My first war with a neighboring faction left me completely uncertain. The game said I was the top Empire by about 400 points. But having no idea what that translates to I played my first campaign waiting to get swamped by the AI. For the first time ever I was the swamper. The AI was busy focusing on trade, friendly relations, building as was I, until I encountered the other agressor. Once the cold war became Hot I engaged his cities. The combat was intense and I managed to pull through thanks to my superior Marines and Hero. (The upgrade system for units is stellar. You can choose how to upgrade units and to what degree and you can manufacture any kind you want. This is very akin to the Hearts of Iron series of upgrading Tanks/Airplanes/Ships) The war was hard fought but after taking his final piece of land I realized this game was where I wanted to be. I haven't even touched the Tempest expansion yet and I am excited.If you don't like Civilization but thought that this game looked interesting, then buy it. You will not regret it.			"

It is seriously addicting, and worth every single penny I spent on the bundle. So many unique features like micro-managing your heroes' inventory, and variations to races that feel more like intriguing challenges than frustrating limitations.

												This game and this world is awesome!I'm not a big fan of 4X strategy games. Well until now that was.I liked this universe because of Dungeon of the Endless but now I like it twice more :)This is a cool fantasy world and it's new and unique and interesting. Also beautiful.I cannot say with knowledge that the gameplay is usual for 4X or not or if it's better, but I can say I like it and it's not that bothersome or non-intuitive as in some other 4X complex games that are a bother to get into.The factions are fun, the assimilation and quests are kinda fun. I also like the science progression in here.And it's kinda awesome how they link all their games (different genres mind you) with similar concepts, e.g. resources and nations etc. You instantly feel at home if you played Dungeon of the Endless or Endless Space.And the music! I definitely like it in all the games of the Endless.A grabbing and an immersive experience.I still have a lot to explore in this game, I'm not that long into it but it's already really worth it.

												Now that Endless Legend has had ships added to the game ( The Tempest dlc ), it finally plays like a complete 4x strat that easily competes with any other title in the genre ( I've played many hours of civ 5, warhammer, etc) The depth of the combat systems, diplomatic, and quests keep you strategic appetites nourished ever single turn. The factions that you can pick from are all intresting to play with the option of customizing factions to your liking using a point system. Aesthetically its a beautiful game and is quite enjoyable to follow the endless lore that Amplitude has created. The legend keeps me comin back for more endless turns.			"

												As someone who is extremely casual about this genre and has really only dipped his toes into it a few times (Civ5, Galciv2, and a lot of Ck2), I still feel like the strengths of this game are very apparent from almost right out the gate, and they set some high bars for the rest of the genre.-Tutorial is boring, slow, and kind of necessary. The interface and mechanics are just different enough from other staples of the 4x genre that it's helpful to know how to get your army out of the city, why you can't just settle anywhere, and a few other things you think you know already.-Preeeeeeeeeety.-Reigons are a great twist, forcing you to plan where to settle based on what you give up. Patrolling your borders is made easy thanks to a pulsing state line.-Every action has an obvious effect, making it very simple to understand what you should and should not do to meet your goals. -There is no tech tree. Tech items are grouped into eras, so you can research weapons all game without once having to research animal husbandry. Need something? Research it. Bam. The benefits of each item are immediately felt, too.The bottom line is that you never feel like you are tasked with stupid busywork, and still have the strategic depth that all the greats have. Mechanics make more sense, and makes it all that much easier to stick around for more turns than you wanted to.			"

Review to Endless LegendEndless Legend is a 4X turn-based strategy game. The graphics are quite decent and really impressing (especially the ""From-Paper-Map-To-3D-World"" effect). You can choose from diffrent races/factions or create your own (use a main race and change the skills/habits). Most of the KI are pretty intelligent and respond smart on your offers and actions. The mechanics allow you to trade and communicate with the other races. There are also many technologys to unlock and use. From simple troops to heavy improvments you can just choose your favorite. "

												The best 4x civ-like strategy out there. Civilisation was the first, but the king is dead and long may live the new king - Endless Legend. Outstanding visuals with a very original theme, crisp gameplay with a sleek UI, simultaneous turns on MP, varied races and victory conditions, freeform research tree, new city-management concepts, hero building, and an awesome motherflippin soundtrack. Oh and cool DLCs that are fairly priced and add tons of content. Game is still getting dev support and new stuff even after 2 years that it's been out. 10/10 looking forward for the next DLC (Tempest) and even more to the Endless Legend 2!Update: I want to get the badge, so the choice of EL for the ""Just 5 more minutes"" award was obvious.

The game's biggest, strength, however, is in the diversity and individuality of its factions. Each faction is so compleatly different that it really serves to keep the game fresh and interesting. Not to mention the lesser races you can encounter and recruit. Lastly, the lore and sense of history to the setting is just great. I honestly can't praise this game enough.

												I was gonna get Civ VI, but I happened to notice Endless Legend went on sale for $7.50 and i've been looking at buying this one for a while now. I bought it to scratch my itch for a new-to-me 4x game, and i was surprised. the combat is so in depth. I used to be a Civ V military guy til i die, but this game changed me to Endless Legend combat or die. Itr's similar to Heroes of might and magic combat. Every unit is different in their abilities they can use in combat and uses RPG elements for upgrading every unit. It even has heroes that can be used as govenors or military generals with their own skill trees. Every faction plays extremely differently. It makes Civ factions feel so similar to each other in comparison. You can quest in this game, doing so for minor factions to make them join your empire and every minor faction has its own unit unit design completely different from every other unit which adds that much more variety to the units especially when considered you make your own variations with as much gear as you want on every unit differentiating and diversifying them from one another even more. AI is actually pretty solid IMO testing out the game on Easy the AI watched me move every one of my units out of my empire and as i left my city completely vulnerable straight seiged my city. I was forced to save scum and wait fomrt hem to patrol the area again and they decided not to attack when seeing my area defended. In short this game switches up the feeling of a 4x more than anything has done in a very very long time and if you like thre thought of a 4x game merged with sci-fi factions with completely different feelings form one another amd major bad-a$$ RPG influences to make a game much better than anything that Civ V can deliver, you've got a great game i'd be happy to spend 30 dollars on. also its the prettiest 4x game you'll ever play to date.

												I am the guy that always wants to like strategy games, but never have the patience to fully understand and appreciate their complex systems.Maybe it is because I am older now, I have no idea.  I bought this game because I thought it looks fun, just like every other RTS or 4x game I see.  It looks fun and I get in game, and I lose interest fast because it is so overwhelming.This game is so beautifully put together.  From the art style, music, character, gameplay, and strategy.  I became totally engaged and committed to the game I had started.I can't compare this to other 4x games as I don't have a lot of experience.  I can say though, for those who have always been intrigued by 4x games but could never get into them, give this one a shot.			"

												What can be said about Endless Legend? It's hard to really fault the game in any way - thats what I'd say. As far as 4X games go this one is perfect for people who want to give the genre a try for a number of reasons. First of all, the UI isn't cluttered and it really groups together everything you'd need that relates to each other together so you don't need to keep switching between screens when you have a task in mind. As your empire grows you often struggle in stategy games but EL offers more than one way to approach micro-management of multiple cities which could be called the classical 4X approach with menu screens or a more RTS method which don't require screenfilling menus. Unlike Endless Space, the world of Endless Legend actually is very eye pleasing and responds to your actions. The majority upgade to a cities causes buildings to rise or expand and it is that kind of visual feedback you need when you are given choices and want to feel that those decisions made an impact on the game experience.What EL does not do well is the AI and diplomatic features. Compared to ES, it feels like the diplomatic approach has limited options and it isn't really clear how you are impacting other empire's attitude towards you. From what I saw they are either dismissive, unfraid, envious or leery. Not once did I ever see anything positive. Negotiations were always one-sided with them never being satisfied with simple peace agreements, they always wanted something in return and even when allied they did not want to share technology, resources or anything. In the end the diplomatic game is spent pandering to their selfish needs and buying peace with everything valuable you have. Endless Space actually did this a lot better. The AI is also rather dumb because it will go to war with vastly superior opposing factions and refuses to be diplomatic even in the face of self-preservation. In the game I played I gave up buying peace from a nation that was so far behind me in tech, land and resources because it wasn't a threat anymore. But the AI still insisted on a fight, declared war and then got promptly smashed. It still wouldn't accept a truce until I took over 3 of it's 4 regions and even after that it didn't want an alliance or peace unless I gave them advanced technology. My end solution was to leave them with that one city, surround it with my nation, close borders and leave 2 guardians standing watch over their last city.However, there is plenty to keep you occupied during turns. I'm not joking when I say that in my 64 hour initial play-through all of that was 1 game which went up to around turn 230. At an average of 15 minutes per turn if you do the math then I'd say that sounds about right from my experience. Be it quests, upgrading, scouting the terrain, battles, diplomatic tactics or tinkering with unit customisations you are never going to find a dull moment where you are just taking turn after turn waiting for something interesting to happen. This was a fault of Endless Space which I'm glad the developers addressed in this title and it looks like Endless Space 2 inherited some of these features which I'm pleased to say made all the difference.Can I recommend Endless Legend? Absolutely. Certainly better than Endless Space 1. If you are new to 4X games or are considering what game to try for your first dip into the genre I can heartly recommend you start here. Even veterans of the genre would find there to be plenty of depth here to enjoy,			"

												Recently, I bought the Emperor Edition when it was on sales. At first, I was unsure whether the game suits me or not but after reading all the positive review I decided to buy it. The game is very confusing at first, a lot of mechanics to be learn and also you need to think far ahead if you want your empire to be successful. The AI is great, and each faction have their own quest, lore and story line which make the game even more interesting. The only thing I regret is not buying the whole pack including the DLC. For those who enjoy a 4X and RTS game, this game is a must to own and play.			"

												Fantastic 4X with beautiful art style and which feels really unique compared to other games of the genre.

												The game is a refreshing take on 4X. In a genre dominated (defined, almost) by Civ-likes, there are a few brave design decisions in there which I truly loved. Chief among those is the way the game restricts the number of cities you can build (severely, for one faction) so you can concentrate on those you do build. Heroes are interesting, the art is beautiful as always for Amplitude games, and it runs like a charm. Also, the storytelling is amazing for this genre. Highly recommended.			"

												I rarely give out reviews as it is very rare to find a game worth commenting on.However, when I went to the store page to pre-purchase Tempest, I was astonished to see that a bunch of Chinese players, angry that the developers had removed their language mod because the mod maker itself was promoting a pirated version of the game. Honestly, I was both astonished and angry that a bunch of players would throw an outright tantrum over something like that.The reality is that Endless Legend is a shining gem in the 4x community. It is factions that are very engaging and different from one another and a compelling narrative behind each of them. Honestly, I haven't seen factions made in such a way since Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, which had very memorable factions and faction leaders. The game is also very interesting with the winter dynamic that comes every now and again to test your faction. The winters will continue to get heavier and longer as the game progresses, which ties into the story a bit.So where does this game falter? Honestly, the combat leaves a bit to be desired. It's completely automated for the most part and you only really direct your armies on a very minimal level. If in-depth combat is what you're looking for, you're better off looking at Age of Wonders 3. Otherwise, it's a pretty solid addition to the 4x formula and I consider it a must have for anyone who enjoys Civilization or other 4x's. It shouldn't come as any surprise that Civ VI is borrowing a lot of the mechanics from Endless Legend given how well they worked.But yeah, the game is amazing and is nowhere near deserving of a mixed rating. The Chinese players should suck it up and not throw a tantrum because their language mod got removed for promoting piracy. It's a risk you take when the game doesn't have the native language.			"

												throwing my positive review into the mix to help counterbalance the butthurt china men! Ultimately this game is fantastic. It's a wonderful fantasy 4x game that is definitely a cheaper alternative (And just as polished) alternative to the Civ games. City building is relatively easy to understand, all the races you can play as are nicely varied, and the custom factions are fantastic. A few minor nitpicks is that I've had units generated by ruins spawn in water before I've unlocked the water traversal tech, rendering them imboile and useless. Also, on normal difficulty, the ai doesn't seem to like to negotiate? Maybe it was just that one game, but they never wanted to negotiate, and despite literally being unable to declare war on people myself, I had 3/4 enemy factions declare war on me. Other than that, great game. 4/5 rubber chickens :)			"

												Civ6 owes Amplitude some hat-tips, clearly. What's not already been said? This is as much 'art' as Planescape Torment was in its day, regardless of genre.When a developer pours love over their project it shows, as it does for this title. So give some love back and buy Endless Legend and its DLCs -they're all tightly knit and work really well together (Tempest needs some time via patches to gel with what was broadly speaking a land-based hex game).My only real personal and highly subjective nitpick is the overly twee OST. The rest is clever, smart and addicting.Recommended!			"

												The game is beautiful smooth and has a huge amount of depth to it. The developers are listening to their community extensively and that is always great to see. It is on the same level as Civ V that I used to play extensively. This game has got me saying: ""one more turn"" and that is what I need!The game is fairly complicated though, and requires a lot to get into, but once you understand it it really is a blast. Another donwside is the combat. It is extremely slow and repetitive and can get frustrating to look into. The concurrent details and over the top factors to combat are annoying sometimes, where another faction will over power you based on their stats is too much. to take into account. The factions are great and work differently which is nice to see in a 4X game. Compared to Civ V there are less factions but more depth to each and can really cater to people's different interests in playstyle. It is great for all types of players. I highly recommend this game if you are willing to macro and micro manage for a long time. Furthermore, if you are into growing cities then this game is for you! "

												After the chore that was Dungeon of the Endless, I thought I'd dive into this game and see if the devs have learnt any lessons, And they have.  This time there is actually a game here, and there's a tutorial that actually explains the basic game mechanics and user interface (a must for this type of game).  As for the game itself think a fantasy set version of Civilization with greater depth, and combat that you can actually influence.  Speaking of which the unit customization is a good idea.The user interface contains just the right balance between information and usability, with the mechanics similar enough to other games that's it's very easy to pick up.I'm early days into the game, but I'm encouraged by the start, it's imaginative in it's setting and factions, the game is easy to pick up and get in to, and there are enough options to customize the game to suit a player's play style and system limitations.Yes it's never going to make my top 25 all time games but on sale, this game is value for money even more so if youre a fan of these types of games.  Oh and it is a thing of visual beauty (always my last consideration with a game - I just look for a professionally done job gfx wise).			"

												If you don't like 4X games, this probably wouldn't be the game to change your mind, but it's a delightful entry into the genre with an exceedingly well-designed UI overlaying a veritable trove of imagination.Strange as it may sound, I'd put the UI as the standout feature of the game; other studios really should pay attention to just how well designed and thought through it is.The game itself is a 4X with a few twists to the genre: RPG-lite elements for heroes; tactical combat; quests to find and complete; winter rolling around every so often, and so on.  The factions are also something of a star feature.  They don't have the writing behind them that the SMAC factions did, but mechanically and visually, they're much more diverse than the SMAC factions ever were.  City building is much more interesting than in Civ and most other 4Xs, but it seems that Civ6 is copying the city expansion system from this game.Combat's a mixed bag; it can be quite frustrating, at least until you learn how it all works, and then becomes rather too easy.  Of course, on higher difficulties, that gets balanced out a bit, but I'd still put the combat as a weak spot.  On the other hand, it's still enormously more satisfying than combat in CivThe artwork is reasonably polished with a highly coherent aesthetic, but looking through other reviews, it's clear the aesthetic is not to everyone's taste.  Personally I like it, and find it gets across all the information I need to understand things very well.One annoyance is, well, it's a sci-fi fantasy, and that means it comes with strange names for resources.  Gold?  Makes you richer, yes.  Spices, inmproves food production, of course. Pixie Blood?  I guess I know what that is, but I've no idea what it would be useful for just from the name.  Palladian?  Huh, what?  This comes with the territory I guess, but is still much less clear than mechanically equivalent resources in less exotic games.All in all, this is well worth the asking price and is exceedingly well-designed.

												This game is really good. It's far more ambitious than other 4X games, and it does so very well, but it still has its fair share of issues.Pros+Cool lore+All victory types are more or less equally attainable+Decently expansive diplomacy, very expansive AI diplomatic states (when civ would have five states, neutral, friendly, guarded, hostile, and afraid, Endless Legend has at least 10, with things like envious, mildly envious, terrified, indifferent, or dismissive)+Fleshed out espionage+Well put-together war, with mechanics like high-defense cities giving more health to the garrison, sieging cities to decrease fortification and cripple the city, privateer armies that can fight without a flag to attack other civs or even allies without any repercussions+DLC is all worth it even at full price+cool devs+Only the server host has to have DLC for all the players in a multiplayer game to use it+UI is very efficient and effectiveNeutral-Combat, the community seems to be split in half for whether or not the combat is any good, so I'll try to explain it and you decide for yourself. One army (group of several units) attacks another, and an area of about 15 hexes by 15 is fenced out, and the each army's units are sent out to the battlefield. You can set your units position on your half of this area before any combat starts. Once you're ready, you can give your units orders. You can right-click where you want your units to go or who you want them to attack, or where you want them to go and then attack, and you can set a stance, where if that unit can't complete its orders it will either A. attack if an enemy is in range or B. do nothing if an enemy is in range, or you can set it to stay where it is and not attack unless it's counter-attacking. Once they have orders, all the units on the board move in one turn, in the order of which units have the highest ""Initiative"" stat. Also, other armies can join at the beginning of each planning stage, at two tiles (two units per turn) marked with a flag. This can be upgraded to four if certain criteria are met.Cons-UI is meh in appearance-Worlds feel claustrophobic due to empire's expansion and the number of empires compared to the size of the world-Few factions make replayability lower, because every game has the same factions, but it's balanced by the fact that playing as each faction is essentially a whole new game-No local multiplayer (Devs say it would be impossible because of the way the game is structured, and I'm inclined to believe them because of their reputation and what I've seen so far in the game)			"

												If you're like me and wanted to find games similair to civilization, I would highly recommend this game. A lot of the aspects are the same as Civ only with more depth. For example the technology has much more customization, and allows you to shape it uniquely around the way you chose to play. While the game has less playable empires than Civilization 5, but the ones that it does have are very different from eachother. For example, one empire uses dust (gold) for vitrually everything they do such as healing units, and another empire cannot declare war. These are just two examples of the seven empires (10 with expansions). Where as in Civ the differences between empires are usually quite small like Japan having samurai instead of longswordsmen, but the game mechanics remain the same. Something I do like more about Civ 5 is the combat. In Endless Legend combat occurs the same was as Civ, somebody attacks the other, but it gets very different after that. The game makes a little battlefield for you and it becomes a turn based battle between both sides. You chose where to move your units and where you want them to attack. If you have any nearby soldiers they will join the battle one turn in as reinforcements. After 6 turns the battle is a ""draw"", but you can just attack them again the next turn and continue the fights with the surviving units at the health they ended the first battle on. Don't really understand the point of that. But yeah great game if you like Civ you'll love it.			"

												I've only just gotten started with it, but I definitely feel like I've seen enough to give this a confident thumbs up.In a sense, that I think I can judge it after only 30 or so hours is in and of itself the main issue I have with the game. The model for it is Civilization, in terms of gameplay, minus the 'real world' historical/cultural perspective (supplanting it with its own 'endless' series lore, I believe). Next to Civ V - I haven't played VI - it feels like a Civ VI would feel - most of the same core functions with a few slightly less fleshed out 'additions'/'upgrades.' It's a successful model, on the other hand, and as a former Civ player, makes the game very accessible from the get go. The settlement 'system' is slightly different, but in a good way. It emphasizes 'counties' and better judgment and a need for more info in terms of city placement.As for the lore, I believe this comes from other Endless games, but I've only played Endless Space very briefly and none of the others in the series so I can't speak to how the lore they've already created previously is represented/implemented in this game. That said, the different cultures, attributes, etc. are impressively fleshed out. The campaign does a nice job of bringing a story/narrative to the game that is unique to this genre. One of the DLC races gets the same storyline as a race that was already in the game, so beware of that (can't remember names off the top of my head, 'Messari?'). Maybe it's a bug with a fix, I haven't looked into it.All-in-all, I'm very pleased with the game. I've emphasized in here that I'm a former Civ player and for a reason. In terms of that historical take on this genre, after playing Crusader Kings II, going back to Civ was literally impossible. Having Ghandi live thousands of years as a war-mongering nuke troll feels almost childish having dug into CK2 all these years now. That said, I've occasionally craved the simplicity of a Civ type of game - you know, ten colored blobs slowly expanding into conflict-strewn madness. This game has given me the ability to do that, and by placing it in this alternate reality, completely divorced from actual history, I've been able to really jump in and get my urge to conquer multiple continents out of my system without just wanting to switch back to ck2 after half an hour.Oh, and the battle is more involved and strategic than Civ or CK2 for sure. Don't think Total War, but perhaps a dumbed down, turn-based, simplistic version of it...? Better than nothing! Not just numbers or troop health/morale bars flashing on the screen...? Anyway, thumbs up. Get this, especially on sale since it's come to be quite affordable on a few occasions. I can't tell if the DLC is worth it yet. As I said, the plot for the dlc race I tried didn't seem to work but it's possible others do, and I think there are other ways that the dlc expanded the game that I'm not aware of since I've only played a version of it with all but the most recent DLC.

												I learned this game was getting its score tanked by chinese reviewers so I thought I'd throw in my 2 cents. 4X games seemed daunting to me so I never truly got into them before Endless Legend. While the UI is overwhelming when you enter your first game, the ability to stick with the game and learn how truly in-depth it is opens this game up to a level of strategic mastery that I have seldom encountered in a turn-based game. Every faction has their own defined strengths, weaknesses, and unique characteristics. From The Forgotten's lack of science to the various stat boosting pillars of the Ardent Mages, there is something for everyone as far as overall victory conditions and play styles. Furthermore, much like Civilization, the amount of resources, number of continents and general temperature of the map can help spice up each game and offer new obstacles to overcome.If you are on the fence about delving into the world of 4X strategy, do it here. Endless Legend offers beautiful visuals, profound strategic gameplay and a wonderful world that ties in to the other fantastic games that Amplitude has created. I cannot get enough of this game and it feels brand new every time I play it. I can't even begin to cover all that this game offers, so I implore you to find the rest out for yourself. I'll see you on Auriga, settler			"

												I personally found Endless Legend a little slow, but that goes with the genre to some extent. I guess if you are worried it looks a little slow, maybe give this title a miss. EDIT I have been informed you can change game speed, I haven't tried that so I'm not sure how it impacts the game.Now, on to some of the postives. 1. This game is beautiful. I was blown away by the music and visuals of this game, and in fact I still am.2. Highly customisable, you can equip units with different weapons and armour and it really makes a difference to their abilities in combat.3. Diverse, every civ felt really different to play as, and they felt pretty balanced.			"

												Not going to go too in-depth but, if you like Civ, you will like this. It isn't too different from Civ once you learn to navigate the UI. The tutorial was a bit tedious, so I skipped it and I didn't have much trouble adapting. There are a few features that are difficult to get the hang of, but an intuitive player can figure them out on their own without much trouble. I really enjoy the fantasy setting and there are some cool unit designs. If you are worried about the mixed reviews, most of the ones I read were complaining about issues running on mac or about the learning curve of this game, which I did not find bad at all. For some people, it's just not the right game. But, what you will find is that it is well executed and, for the sale price of $11, quite a snag (and I'd still give it a solid recommendation at full price).			"

												Fantastic entry into its genre, beautiful, atmospheric, and immersive. One of the best 4X games ever made, for my money.The factions feel genuinely unique and require entirely different playstyles and viewpoints. Avoids the pitfall Endless Space fell into of making it virtually impossible to improvise from the expected faction playstyle, but still definitely makes it a unique challenge to turn pacificsts into world conquerers. That said, it does have its issues. Pacing issues early on, difficulty curve that goes from an early ""Wow what happened to all my units and cities and hopes and dreams?"" to a late ""Wow what happened to all the AI's will to live?"", and a somewhat bland combat system all keep it from perfection, but they're not dealbreakers by any means.As an afterthought, the expansion packs are definitely worth it on sale, but perhaps less so at full price. The game would lose a lot by not having them, but they're still a lot of money for pretty small shifts in the experience.			"

												I'm not a massive 4X fan, nor experienced in them, but this game intrigued me. I got it on sale and since playing I can honestly say, it's worth full price.I seem to be plowing through eras much faster than I'm actually spreading out over / exploring the map. There are little quests that you can do throughout the game so it's a little more than just farming resources, killing everything and being the biggest. I've not got far, but it seems that each faction has it's own storyline which is pretty cool. Not sure if there's an almighty reward at the end or if it unlocks anything. I've found myself proceeding through the story very slowly.I've found a couple of things in the game that kind of niggle at me, but I think they're personal perference over anything else. I've played for a good few hours now and I feel that I've barely touched the surface of what the game has in it.			"

												The best 4x game out there which finally breaks out from the standard norms (and habitual repeatition) of the Civilisation series. After being a fan of the Civilisation series since Civ 2 I was pessimistic that this game could be as good but when on sale some time back I purchased it and was blown away.The graphics, story, missions, heros, interface... essentially almost everything... is incredibly well done. The only ""con"" so to speak is that the AI is ocassionally a bit odd but still decent.I don't know about you but in Civilisation games I generally play one nation repeatedly through all my playthroughs as there is very little difference between nations overall. In this game each race plays very differently making the game have replayability far beyond any Civ game. Now the DLC, various have been released since launch and the pricing for them can be a bit questionable to say the least. Never buy these at launch unless you have more money than sense or are desperate to scratch that itch. Whilst the DLC does significantly change/improve the base game and I highly rate each one, at the time of release the pricing for them is a bit dear. Wait a bit for them to be on sale though and you will potentially see this as the best DLC you have ever bought.To sum up, this game is like if Civ and Age of Wonders had a baby which is vastly better than either. Buy it!			"

												This is a fun game for those who like the genre. If you're tired of the extremely safe polish of the Civilization series, this is an enjoyable jaunt. In some ways, it reminds me of the excellent Fall from Heaven mod for Civ 4. (Anyone else play it?)It's a comparitively complex game, meaning you'll need to be willing to spend some time on dummy runs to figure out what's what. To me, this is part of the fun.Pros- Staggeringly beautiful worldmap - Masterclass in user interface and style- Constant hard-hitting decisions and prioritizations- Genuine differences between races- Well written, with fun lore- Lots and lots of innovative ideasCons- It's not a super-polished game. You'll find things that aren't quite right. Nothing that breaks the game, and in general it just gives the game texture and alleys to explore.- Combat isn't quite right. You know the fun tacticality of Civ V and VI? Well, it's absent here. There's both an initiative system and a pre-order unit action system, which combines screwily, which doesn't quite give the depth of play they were hoping for. Not to mention some oddities (archers that shoot too far, awkward zone of control, etc.) - Tilted end games. It's the usual problem. Either you or the AI snowball and become Godlike, meaning it's either a simple walk to victory or complete trashing. AI has trouble making comebacks from setbacks. Also, when you're winning, you can take your pick of victory options, which is too bad. March on capitals, win by science, quest victory are not always exclusive.- Boring exploration. In the beginning, you run around searching ruins. Sounds fun, right? Unfortunately, there's rarely anything in them but money, occasionally a fetch and destroy quest. (Update: the expansions mostly resolve this issue)Oh, and yes please to Endless Legends 2.- UPDATE -After playing with the expansions (Guardians and Shifters), I can say they make the game categorically better. Do buy them! (Especially after a game or two on the base edition to get the hang of it.)PROTIPS -- You can adjust the attack animation speed in the options menu- Try setting the world map to ""mountainous."" It's fun!- Try setting the turn-based mode to ""advanced."" That way, you only give orders every two rounds, which streamlines combat and makes it more fun and feels more tactical.			"

												Amplitude has created one of the most beautiful, intersting, and engaging intellectual properties with their Endless series of games that I have come across in a long time. It is truely a masterpiece of story telling and a world that is so rich and deep, it pulls you in becuase it feels like it's alive. None of thier games pulls off that feeling of being an actual  living breathing world better than Endless Legend. While all of their games are set in the Endless universe, they are all quite different in scope, scale, and type.  Endless Legend itself dives back into Amplitude studios 4X roots, building on their experince with the incredibly polished Endless Space, to bring you something more intimate and grand, all at the same time. Endless Legends seeks to take the basic 4X template of Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate and paint it with a whole new pallete. While it clearly borrows from its predecesors in many mechanics and themes there is so much inovation it trys to add, and mostly successfully. From dynamic weather, seasons, and beautiful world genration; to truely unique factions and storytelling; to creative takes on diplomacy, technology, and combat. Endless legend takes everything you know and turns it 90', just enough to keep it for what it is, but just enough to make it new. Some of the new you may grow to love as i have.  Some may not be your cup of tea, but to Amplitudes credit they have tried and succeded in my opinion of providing a unique experince.  If you are a fan of 4X this game is worth a look.  It offers so much for those truely seeking to dive into something deep, like a great 500 page novel. This game is not for the feight of heart or those with no desire to take the time to learn its inner workings.  In many ways its greatest strength is also a weakness. The innovation implemented often makes it less than intuitive at times, even for seasoned 4X players, and it can be frustrating when you are not looking for something different on a fundamental level.  This is by no means a reskined version of anything you have played before, which opens up doors to hours of enjoyment as you experince a whole new way to play a 4X.  It also opens the door for frustation at times. The game has a sub par tutorial and so much of the meaty information will have to be researched outside of the game if you truely want to grasp it in full. Its a heft investment that will hopefully be resolved with better in game info as the developers have a history of polishing and supporting their games long after release. Luckily info is out there and the community is very friendly and helpful if you engage them on forums and in multiplayer lobbys.The biggest thing I love about this game more than anything else is the perfectly balanced imbalance of the game and factions. There is so much flexibility and uniqueness to everyone of them that every game can be different. Technologies and strategies that worked in one game may be horrible in the next because every choice is so interdependant on things like starting location...who your neighbors are...what resources you have close by...ect ect ect. There are defiinetly fundamental techs and starts for each race, but nothing and i mean nothing is set in stone. You will have to think more than ever to be successful, and every choice matters, and taking your time to hit that end trun button is almsot never wasted time. Waiting to give this challenging, beautiful, and reasonably priced game a try by not hitting the buy button during the next steam sale however...most definetly is.   "

												This is by far one of the best 4X games I have ever played.With all its 4 expansions, it is far deeper and substantial compared to Civilization V with all 2 expansions and additional civilization packs. This is the case for the following dimensions:1) Factions: Even though there are far fewer factions in Endless Legend (EL), each one of them is extremely differentiated from one another due to its primary unique faction trait, in a way which directly affects gameplay very deeply. Even the faction units are unique to each race.2) Terrain: The diversity of terrain in this game is a lot more than civilization. Adding actual graphical and gameplay changes to terrain during winter even adds more to this. The seas in Civ 5 tend to be homogenous, but in EL, it is very diverse too.3) Battle: EL simply has more tactics compared to Civ 5, since you enter a 'battle mode' just like you do in games like Heroes of Might of Magic V. Some units have spells, support, and unique abilities, adding more flavor to the game, rather than just attack as in Civ 5.4) Customizability: The factions can be customed in ways more unique than Civ 5. The units too - even though there are only 3 core unit templates per faction (minus the 5 - 6 'elementals'), each one can equip up to 5 - 7 items, which actually translates to visible graphical changes that you can see in-game. Changing the weapons do more than just change stats - some weapons change the ability of the unit.5) Moddability: Already, I'm having fun with the various mods on the steam workshop. Additional faction traits, endless faction traits, enhanced map generator, earth maps, level 4 district mod - it adds a lot of gameplay customizability to one's own personal preference.6) Graphics: graphics in EL are superior to Civ 5 by a huge amount.7) Sound and Music: both comparable, in terms of sound effects and soundtrack quality.8) Espionage: EL is deeper, unlike in Civ 5 where you could only use 5 - 6 agents. In here, you can hire just about as many heroes as you can afford, and there are far more espionage options and flexibility.9) Terrain improvements: Unlike in Civ 5 where most buildings are built in the city itself, you actually build many buildings and wonders over the land, by selecting a tile to build on.10) Heroes: The heroes in EL are actually capable of doing battle, have their unique talent trees (for each faction) that are very deep, and you can equip them, or even ask them to govern cities. 11) Others: EL also offers governances (city automation) where you set from up to 7 types to auto-govern extremely large empires to cut down on micromanagement. 12) Quests and lore: There actual quests in the game, many of them, where it builds up the lore, and also offers empire bonuses as you finish them.13) Victory options: More numerous in EL compared to Civ 5. That only things that EL loses to Civ 5 are the following:1) Number of wonders: Civ 5 wins this in sheer quantity outright, but EL's wonders are actually visible very conspicuously on the titles themselves, in an enlarged manner compared to the former.2) Audios: There are too few verbal audios in EL!3) City Policies: While EL does have this in a way, in terms of winter perks, government plans and hero faction perks, this is by no means as developed as the social policies of Civ 5. 4) Diplomacy: Negotiations with other factions are just as diverse as in Civ 5, but more restrictive, in that you must make peace with a faction before you can trade with them. Conclusion:Altogether, EL offers a far deeper gameplay than Civ 5, with a different fantasy sci-fi genre. I strongly recommend Endless Legend.			"

Early Access Review
								Wow this game is stunning even in early access.  Combines alot of great elements from Civilization and Warlock and even the Total War games.  The world and ui design are also very intuitive yet full of options.  It's got quests, heros, and i really like the way the battle system works.  Really unique usuage of TB in that you can autoplay with your army or setup your units.  This game really makes great use of ranged units in that way.  Also i don't think i've seen TB battles directly on the empire map before, though admitedly I haven't played the King's bounty games etc.  I prefire empire building, research, resources etc and this game has all that.  Hell you can even customize units and create new ones, which often sounds cool, but can get very obtuse in practice.  Music also has been great so far.  Definately don't regret dropping ~$25 to play this now, and more as it progresses.			"

I personally may give it a go again at some point, since I basically can't get a refund (bought during holiday sale '14 and played 3 hours)If not for Steam's Refund Policy I wouldn't recommend and rate this as something to avoid completely.

												The most enchanting, visually stunning, and gameplay immersing 4x strategy game of it's genre.  Amplitude Studios has done it again!  This game easily beats Sid Meier's series.  Hands down.  No contest.  End of discussion.If you like turn-based strategy, if you like science fiction blended with fantasy topped with cataclysm and music that will make you shed tears, then this is the game for you.No boring historical recreations, no, no, no:  We have anthropomorphized dragon people, borg-like plague hordes of necrophages, cultists spreading the ultimate truth, druid folk from the trees, traders on giant lizards, sci-fi space travellers stranded in a fantasy world, femdom magi fueled by pure rage, and suits of armor with nothing but ideas inside, ideas that kill!  Just buy it. "

												The long and short is that this is a great game that breathes new life into the 4X genre. If you like strategy games, get it.Pros+ Good variation between sides. Much more than ""+1 to plantations"" or something of that sort. One side has to steal or buy technology. One side turns its foes into food and can never initiate alliances or even truce.+ ""Cold war"" state encourages military activity. Everyone starts of in cold war, not peace, and can attack each other in neutral territory (or be attacked in hostile territory). Peace or alliance requires later diplomatic tech.+ Quests encourage your armies to get out and about. This obviously leads to conflict, since there's the cold war thing. Also, you will end up sparring with...+ Minor factions are like a cross between city states and barbarians. They're great. You can recruit those you integrate into your empire (i.e. as a military unit) or simply use their faction bonuses, which are powerful.+ Units are incredibly diverse. You create unit templates based off your side's researched unit types (3 types and a settler + any assimilated minor factions), and different gear can change a unit greatly, from a quick and heavy hitter to a defensive powerhouse.+ Battles aren't just ""roll the dice, see how much damage you deal to each other."" Battles are between armies (4-8 units max per army, can reinforce from other armies and cities). Battles are 6 rounds long, during which units move in order of initiative. Balance is relatively good. Near the middle and end of the game, if you're winning, you're likely to auto-calc battles, avoiding tedium.+ Resources are fun. Luxuries provide huge bonuses to your empire, not just happiness, and strategic resources are used in making equipment for your units. Each produces on a per-turn basis, making extra extractors of a single resource type very useful.+ Lots of other small reasons: graphics, UI, music, and on and on.Cons- I only have one major complaint: the snowball effect can change things very rapidly. Mid-late game, you start overflowing with dust (gold, basically), can buy everything at once, and are spiraling out of control. AI is not as good at siezing on the snowball. This regularly reflects in the post-game score screens where you have comparable amounts of dust, science, production, etc. for 2/3 of the game until suddenly boom goes the dynamite, aka your economy. As a result, late-game feels imbalanced in your favor.- Minor gripe: a select few UI elements are cumbersome. Stockpiles are the main thing. They're one-turn boosts either to a city or your empire in the way of food, science, or production. You end up having to activate them one at a time -- quite annoying when you're churning out a lot of them. Batch usage, where are you? It's been 3 major DLCs already.Final Notes (AKA buy this game)Buy this game if you like 4X games. It's easily my favorite, even outdoing the giant of 4X gaming, Civ V. Civ VI is building off of at least a few of this game's mechanics, which ought to say something.			"

Early Access Review
								With over 600 hours logged on Civilization V I'm pretty happy to see Endless Legend launch into early access! And despite being an alpha release, it's kept me playing for hours - more than most early access games. Granted, it still needs a lot of refinement, but it's a beautiful game with lots of potential.Enter the bullet points!- The graphics are brilliant. When you zoom out to a certain point the 3D world re-renders into a paper-style, with features drawn on, as if you're suddenly surveying a map of the battlefield. There are tonnes of map features and terrain types and everything is backed up by rich and interesting lore.- The map itself is split into regions so that - in contrast to Civ - you don't end up with a cluster of cities all over the place. Here you place 1 city in a region. It's an interesting choice which means territory is quickly claimed in bulk and there's a realistic and exciting rush for land which also reduces the risk of another faction placing a city in between two of yours!- The game has great depth, but there's lots to be refined and balanced so that decisions acually matter and tactics really come into play. An example is the coming of winter; a cool Game of Thrones style feature which should be an ominous reminder to stockpile resources, but at the moment only noticably slows your units down and reduces the land yields a little.- The combat is good - it can either be automatic or manual (like in Endless Space) but here the manual combat feels more interesting. I like that your hired heroes also progress in skills and gear; plenty of room for expansion. - Some more advanced features like trading and diplomacy are often missing or implemented in a basic way, but that's only natural. Ultimately the devs have organised the roadmap very well - the game is not only playable but greatly enjoyable and full of depth, even at this early stage. If you like 4x games and want to try something new and exciting then give it a whirl and support the development. If you're looking for the finished thing then this - obviously - isn't quite there yet. But when finished this could easily be another 600+ hour game.			"

								For a Pre-Alpha this game is really well polished. There are some minor problems, but all of them seem to be alpha related and can be easily ignored. You have to learn by experience as they don't have a tutorial system, but it can be really easy to get into the flow of things after spending some time with it. Over all you can have a lot of fun with this, and so long as they keep adding to it and fixing the minor alpha problems I can see this as a game that can step up to Civilization.			"

Early Access Review
								On trying this game, I definitely felt at home playing it, and not because I've played Endless Space prior.  This game takes the 4X system of control in slightly different ways, some of them well done, others, well, it's still Alpha, so they could be cleaned up later.Combat is definitely a change, as you don't micromanage armies, and as others have pointed out, the combat occurs on the world map you've been running you're army around on.  No 'seperate' field of conflict in this game.  They've definitely nailed the 'Feel like a general managing a conflict as opposed to a lieutenant managing a squad' sense to the combat.  You get teh choice of where to start your armies, and who they focus on, but after you click that launch button, the whole thing is no longer in your hands or control.  And, as you've not been pulled to a seperate screen, if the battle seems the kind to be a while, you can manage you're empire by simply scrolling the map.Empire building is different, as you aren't looking to just cluster yourself as much as possible to ensure a firm holding, as you've now got Regions to focus on, and each region you settle gives you all but the field goodies without need of actually having a city touching them.  This means less cities to hold larger swathes of land.  And the inclusion of the Watchtower structure gained in Age II helps to further this mechanic.  And since friendly minor factions in the regions provide bonuses to your cities in teh regions, you get even more for less.  And with science being non-linear beyond needing Age X for Tech Y, you can develop in teh ways you feel will most benefit your empire's growth.The troop 'improvement' system is very much Endless Space feeling, though currently the unit types and selection feels very basic from what will be available in the final game.  The weapon and armor selections also feel sparse to start with.  With only a small number of factions as well, it gets quick to identify what units are what, and which faction they belong to.  Though, currently there appears to be some issues with some unit models not being in the game in a working state for manual battle control, as I had a couple of game halting error logs pop up that required reloading the turn from an autosave to get around, so don't expect to see the troops in combat in all their glory just yet.The quest system feels clunky at this time, but definitely looks to be on the right road.  It feels head and shoulders above Elemental: Fallen Enchantress's system right now, what with the quests actually feeling like they're part of the world as opposed to just thrown in to extend play-time.  the fact that each faction has a 'Main Quest' chain that's tailored to their culture and mythos (what there is available of it right now) definitely helps with the idea of this being a deeper world.On the whole, this IS in alpha, so expect a lot of changes to come, but so far, they've done a fairly strong job of building a mythos of the world that helps tie it to Endless Space, and Dungeons of the Endless, and I can't wait to see more of the story brought forward, further revealing how the three games are tied together.  I'm also hoping some of hte mechanics that feel very empty get filled soon, especially has there are a large number of commands and options, from technologies to hero skills, that have the whole 'NOT YET IMPLIMENTED' icon strung upon them making me hope that what's available now is just the tip of the iceburg we've found.

								Endless Legend is a killer new take on 4x strategy games with a fun fantasy setting. Fans of Age of Wonders or Civ will find similarities with this game. Though it does a lot of things similar, there's plenty of questing, exploration, and an in-depth RPG leveling/item system for your characters that make this game just as addicting, even in its alpha state. The game is very polished all things considered, and has enough content that this could be released in its current state and I'd still buy it. I have yet to try multiplayer so I can't speak to its berevity - I will update this review once I have.			"

								I'm a fan of Civilization V, but I enjoy fantasy games more than others. Endless Legend might only be in the alpha stage of development, but it's already incredibly fun to play. I recommend this game to anyone who loves fantasy or strategy games. There are cons to this game, as expected, and most of them come from the fact that it's an alpha game. As of this moment, as I'm writing this review, there is no tutorial to the game. Many features such as mulitplayer and the abillity to automate some of your unit's development are not yet implemented. I only just realized on turn 150 or so of my first match/game that you need to manually increase your city's population, thus enabling you to create settlers to expand. Becauset there wasn't a tutorial, it took me 1.5+ hours to figure out how to properly expand your empire. However, believe me when I say that this game is truck-loads of fun. Despite the fact that I couldn't figure out how to play correctly, I'm still immensely enjoying this game. It looks awesome, it feels incredible, but the updates can't get here soon enough. Go buy it. Now. Please. Seriously, you'll thank me later.			"

												*Release Recommendation,if the AI issues get fixed I may update this* Very good 4x strategy game in a fantasy setting. Extremely engaging if you like fantasy and turn-based strategy,it gives you the same ""just one more turn"" feeling the Civ games do but with a more advanced combat system and focus on customization.It has a lot of similarities to the other Endless games, like the customization of your faction traits,troops and heroes (pl)  and minor factions,giving you the ability to make specialised troops and change their equipment with several tiers of weapons,armor parts and trinkets with special tier weapons made of Strategic resources and even unique equipment found through quests or in ruins. These different stats and traits on equipment and units give you some interesting combinations and possibilities. Plus the ability to ""assimiliate"" a few of the minor factions gives you unique troops that you can customize too,each with different base traits,stats and abilities. Giving your troops different weapons and trinkets gives them different traits, so you can customize your Archer unit into a crossbow-wielding close ranged fighter that gets buffed when attacking at close range with a shield or long-ranged Archer with a bow that has bonus damage against certain unit types. Your Spellcasters can reduce different stats on enemies depending on the weapon you give them and your melee units can focus on striking before your enemy does,dealing or tanking damage or being mobile skirmishers to take out ranged troops. Your faction essentially has 3 ""template"" units unique to them from which you create this specialized troops which will cost more depending on what you add. Want cheap cannon fodder or elite units,a mix of both?Want your settler units to be able to fight well? The customization gives you a lot of playstyle options, not quite as much as Endless Space (yet) but it's a really engaging system once you get into it and in my opinion one of the strongest features of the game.On to the issues: The AI needs a LOT of work to give it some longevity. As of right now,the AI is still really lacking,I would almost say it's broken as they're very passive and never attack or even defend their lands properly. It takes a while to notice this and apparently some people don't notice or have this issue (?) but it's very noticeable once you've advanced several eras and begin expanding into AI land. The minor factions,quests and micro-managing and customization of your empire and troops obscure this issue as they keep you engaged for a long time and there never really is a *need* to fight the AI leaders for a very long time unless you had a start close to each other or play an offensive Faction. There is still plenty of content without fighting the other leaders with the tons of quests,customization of troop equipment,research and expansion but unless they fix the passive AI there isn't much of a point to most of what you're doing as you won't really have any opposition or motivation to stand out on top. Also,diplomacy is possible but not really that advanced. Research agreements and trade routes are pretty much it,and as the AI doesn't really do much on it's own you essentially have to do it all yourself. But I have hopes that the devs will keep updating and hopefully improving the game as they did with Endless Space.The game is already very well polished in most aspects apart from the AI so the foundation already shows lots of potential. Once the AI issues are resolved (again,some people have said they don't have the issue which I can't really explain) this would be a definitive recommendation for fantasy and 4x fans.			"

								This game is only in alpha, yet it is one of the best strategy games I have ever played. It removes some of the previous mechanics from other 4X games, and adds new and engaging ones. The quest system, for example, adds an entirely new way win the game. You are always given a quest line dedicated to the faction you are playing, and if you complete that quest line, you win the game. Quests reward you with resources and weapons and armor, and sometime you can find side quests if you explore enough. The atmosphere and art direction are also really cool! If you enjoy strategy games and rpgs then this game is a good buy.  Very streamlined and fun!			"

However, the biggest gripe I have with the game so far is how it would seem to be pretty easy. I may be missing some sort of difficulty option, but I don't think I am. And, of course, everything is subject to change. Unless you're sure you really want it, I'd reccomend purchasing it once it's done.			"

								A really polished early access game, the graphics and interface already look great but the content can feel a bit disjointed in places (especially the tech tree). The game combines ideas from a number of other classic strategy games, most notably civ, and the extensive customisation options from Amplitudes previous game Endless Space make a return. It also has some great features like the city development system and assimilation of minor factions within a controlled region although it would be nice to see a team feature introduced.With many features yet to be implemented and inevitable tweaking and balancing I’d recommend waiting until the full release; but with a familiar framework and some great new ideas Endless Legend is shaping up to be an excellent game.

Early Access Review
								Personal opinion from an average gamer. Recommended if you want to back the game - for an early access and the price of the game, it gives a satisfying amount of content.Take into account that without a wiki and having only played one playthrough with Broken Lords, my opinion can be argued relevant, but, limited.Straight up for people, like myself, who want alot to play around with - aside from the expensive mercenaries and heroes, there are only 3 unique units per faction. This isn't positive or negative, I just figure it to be something to take into consideration.Endless Legend is great but it suffers the early access. Four big things sucker punched my experience:1. AI is half baked imo.Only one faction (bug people) was tough because it focus spammed units at me, the other factions were a cakewalk considering they were made up of archers or came from a less developed civ.You might overlook this until suddenly all the factions gave up half way through the game, by turn 100 out of 200 turns I ended up capturing all enemy cities with absolutely ZERO resistance.2. Forget about politics. Other factions immediately hate you and demand waaaay too much to become neutral, even when you're about to completely annihilate them (I wished for a diplomatic win).3. Storyline quest bugged right at the end.Bugged as in I met all the, very nit-picky, requirments to proceed, yet it still wouldn't let me (like getting to third base in a relationship, only to give you the middle finger). This is probably just me being Broken Lords and having reached the 200 turn maximum (you can continue after 200 turns so it may have been a glitch). I just consider that if their's going to be a storyline, it should be thouroughly looked over.4. Awkward fighting system.Perhaps the most intended problem. When you choose to initiate moves for your units, they play out the option twice. So say I want my infantry to hold a line and my archers to hide behind it. If an enemy is out of range for my archer, there is no way to tell them to run in front of the infantry, shoot, then run back behind the infantry. More of an understanding if you exp the game, but this is very irritating.Sum it up in a sentence: I loved the game, there was alot to explore in both map and content, but, in its current state the mystery is short lived after 50 or so turns - support the game, but I'll be waiting for extra content to make the current content relevant.

												Civilization 5 was a big empty vessel to me and while it improved with expensive dlc I lost intrest, not to mention the reskin called beyond earth.This at 20 bucks with dlc (really recommend you get them) was totally worth itPRO-factions are diverse and play very different-timeless ghrapics and clean UI-quests give a sence of story and progression with extra challenges-combat = excellent vs others but very basic → with turn based battles on smaller map sections, but the AI is not the greatest.-game is highly optimized, only 2.5gb big and runs great-nice soundtrackCON-max 8 factions on one map-only 10 different factions including dlc-tutorial covers barely anything-no naval combat-fantasy world (executed very well but its always more fun to mess with history imho)In the end each faction had a lot of effort put into them and result in diverse and fun campaigns. But I fear for replayablity with some more complex elements missing like religion and a central council plus the faction quests will never change.And I wish there where some realistic mods or warhammer 40K would fit in perfectlyUPDATE: tempest its biggest dlc yet has introduced naval combat, naval regions, naval faction etc. A real game changerMULTIPLAYERsince AI is getting a little easy after 200 hours, Playing with friends is where it is at.The good:Humans are more eager to persue victories making things more competitive.The very different playstyles for factions does force more intresting and dynamic campaignsautomatic saves up to 5 turns ago mostly prevents loosing lots of time when a save goes corrupt.The bad:The lobby often has to be hosted a second time for odd bugs, and desyncs are not uncommon.if you want to resync... it sends you back to the lobby (wtf)The tempest dlc also introduced many bugs but are being fixed at a regular paceeducating new players about each faction is a must to keep things fairCultists, forgotten and roving clans are though guys to win with in mp			"

												(Disclaimer: Keeping in mind that I have only played this for a few hours)TBH i bought this by recommendation, mostly because of the time I sank into Civ 5 otherwise I wouldn't have given this game a look.My biggest issue with the game is mutliple layers of UI's, as it makes the game look to complex to fully grasp and learn, even after the tutorial (done the tutorial twice and forgotten most of it after a while during an actual game).Despite that I think that if I could overcome my issue with the UI's, I might enjoy the game more, but sadly I can't give myself a reason to give it a chance again.Overall, I would recommend it to people who can handle the complexity of this game (and the UI's).And to others that are on the fence about to maybe give it a try, now with the Steam Refund, to see if it is your cup of tea. I personally may give it a go again at some point, since I basically can't get a refund (bought during holiday sale '14 and played 3 hours)If not for Steam's Refund Policy I wouldn't recommend and rate this as something to avoid completely.

												I am a huge fan of the ""Endless"" series of games, and Endless Legend is no exception.The game economy/resource management is very close to civ. Hexes produce food, industry, science, and dust (aka money) and you can assign workers to focus on producing one resource over others. There is no culture, but instead a resource known as influence allows you to take several diplomatic actions.There is a large amount of customization in the game. You can tweak the base races with a point buy perk system. You can also modify your units with various weapons/armors/trinkets.Each race is unique and thematically cool.The combat is tactical and based around army/squad type mechanics, where if a fight breaks out units in nearby hexes will join on future turns as reinforcements.The hero system is great as well. You can have heroes lead armies or assign them to improve your cities.			"

Absolutely beautiful game, great empire building, and entertaining gameplay.Pros:+ The game looks incredible+ Very fun empire building (none of the empire building aspects are terribly deep, but overall theres a lot of things which lends it depth). + Interesting array of units.+ Resources and diplomacy are easy to understand.+ Map is somewhat self ordering (its actually a challenge to find and place cities in optimal ways). + Quest system is interesting, and for the most part entertaining.+ Game is very smooth and streamlined if you desire it to be.+ Improvement system for units is interesting.Cons:+ Not a lot of unit diversity. You can recruit units from minor tribes, but in reality its somewhat of a letdown that each empires armies boils down to 3 different units. The game would really benefit from a larger roster of empire specific units (at least one for each type of role) or more units opening up when you recruit a minor faction (the haunts give both flying ghosts and infantry ghouls for example). + Combat is a mixed bag. It looks pretty, can be fun at times, and is relatively simple - but by and large is something I mostly skip over. + Hero trees are flat out boring.Neutral:+ Game sometimes feels like it plays itself at times. Its not a con, because you can always find ways to occupy yourself, but the feeling is still there.Overall great game. Mostly a empire simulator to be honest.			"

												+ interesting factions with different gameplay and unique quests(storylines)+ you can change equipment of your soldiers and heroes+ gameplay twist - decreased movement and industry during winter season+ beautiful graphics + perfect, clean UI+ superb soundtrack+ continuous support of game by developer, mod support- lacks naval combat- AI is slightly worse than in Civ 5 - easily predictable?  (altough they are improving it in every patch)- very addictive :)			"

												Civilization 5 was a big empty vessel to me and while it improved with expensive dlc I lost intrest, not to mention the reskin called beyond earth.This at 20 bucks with dlc (really recommend you get them) was totally worth itPRO-factions are diverse and play very different-timeless ghrapics and clean UI-quests give a sence of story and progression with extra challenges-combat = excellent vs others but very basic → with turn based battles on smaller map sections, but the AI is not the greatest.-game is highly optimized, only 2.5gb big and runs great-nice soundtrackCON-max 8 factions on one map-only 10 different factions including dlc-tutorial covers barely anything-no naval combat-fantasy world (executed very well but its always more fun to mess with history imho)In the end each faction had a lot of effort put into them and result in diverse and fun campaigns. But I fear for replayablity with some more complex elements missing like religion and a central council plus the faction quests will never change.And I wish there where some realistic mods or warhammer 40K would fit in perfectlyUPDATE: tempest its biggest dlc yet has introduced naval combat, naval regions, naval faction etc. A real game changerMULTIPLAYERsince AI is getting a little easy after 200 hours, Playing with friends is where it is at.The good:Humans are more eager to persue victories making things more competitive.The very different playstyles for factions does force more intresting and dynamic campaignsautomatic saves up to 5 turns ago mostly prevents loosing lots of time when a save goes corrupt.The bad:The lobby often has to be hosted a second time for odd bugs, and desyncs are not uncommon.if you want to resync... it sends you back to the lobby (wtf)The tempest dlc also introduced many bugs but are being fixed at a regular paceeducating new players about each faction is a must to keep things fairCultists, forgotten and roving clans are though guys to win with in mp			"

												**Edit 10/2/2014: A bit of information on the tech tree and my feelings on it added.**Having played an ungodly amount of Endless Space, I of course was looking forward to Endless Legend. And overall, I'd have to say my experience has been a positive one-- but not without numerous potholes.First, the positives: The graphics are gorgeous. Just totally amazing for a 4X game. Units move fluidly, resources sparkle invitingly, and the transition from summer to winter and back again is just lovely to watch. Then there's the level of customization you can get into with your armies.It's basically the massive level of outfitting you could do with your ships in Endless Space... but with people! Mix-n-match older tech with new, or just put everyone in the shiniest stuff you can find, and upgrading is nice and easy (if ludicrously expensive sometimes). And the game is definitely engaging; my first playthrough was of the ""okay, one more turn and THEN I go to bed-- oh, wait, I just won a score victory. Huh. That was 300 turns?"" variety.The quest system keeps things fairly fresh throughout the game as well, as it gives you something to actually work towards instead of just the standard ""build stuff, build armies, kill everyone"" or ""build stuff, research things, wait for end of game"" ideas. You have a series of tangible goals, with rewards, and can even get massively advanced technology through them. And it can make pacifying those locals with parley much more of a rewarding endeavour than just beating them until they stop moving.However, there are a fair amount of balancing negatives to look out for: Remember those gorgeous graphics? Yeah, I'm going to be turning those down for my next playthrough. The transition effect for the season change is lovely, true, but it also causes some lag when you've got the graphics maxed out. And maxing the graphics also doesn't help with the next complaint...There's no mini-map. At all. You would think that a mini-map would be standard for a 4X game, yes? Well, you don't get one. In order to move around the map, you can either drag the viewpoint around (which, on high graphics settings, causes the aforementioned lag), or zoom all the way out to the 2D map representation, scroll to where you want to be, and then zoom back in. A total waste of time that could be avoided with a simple mini-map somewhere.Battles are also...odd. After playing through several of them, I fail to see why anyone would use anything other than ranged units. For any battle. Ranged units with high enough initiative, on high ground, can slaughter anything else. Even if not on higher ground, they're still going to take out most of the opposing army before anyone else even gets a turn. It just seems fairly broken. I acknowledge this may need more playtesting on my part, though.Then there's the problem that Endless Legend has with giving you information on how to actually PLAY it. Don't feel like reading the manual? Then you, my friend, are going to have a VERY hard time playing this game. ""But the tutorial will tell me everything I need to know, right?"" Wroooong. The tutorial completely leaves out several important things, not least of them the highly important district/city center upgrade procedure, how trade routes happen, how to use ANY of the special abilities for the various races (And no, they're not particularly self-explanatory. For instance, the Vaulters information in-game just says that they can designate a Holy Resource. Several techs say they need a Holy Resource. Nothing bothers to tell you that you have to activate a booster effect on a resource to designate it as ""holy"".), and the rather important bit of information that only one city can be placed per region, so you'd better be dang sure that you're putting it in the right spot. Or even what a ""region"" is, other than just referring to them.And if you try to open up the Archives in-game, thinking it's the equivalent of the Civilopedia? It minimizes the game and takes you to the Endless Legend Wiki. And that may or may not have anything useful for you.There's one more major thing that I've decided counts as a negative, and it's enough to warrant an edit to my original review. I originally just thought that the tech tree idea was ""original, but a bit rubbish"", and not terribly impressive, but after further thought and a few more tests, it is my opinion that it really does need an overhaul. Now, I realize that many players treat the tech tree as an afterthought, merely a way to get their new weapons to beat other civs over the head with, but to me the tech tree is one of the main parts of the game. And Endless Legend downright punishes you for using it.The tree is split into six ages. You start in Age 1, obviously. After nine technologies are researched, you advance one age. This seems all well and good, but there's a catch; it's not just ""nine technologies from the previous age."" It's ANY nine technologies. Research nine technologies from Age 1, unlock Age 2, and then want to get the rest of Age 1 that you haven't researched yet? Congrats, you're progressing towards Age 3! That may not seem so bad at first, but then you hit the second catch: every time you advance an Age, the technologies from the PREVIOUS ages become MORE EXPENSIVE. Yes, that's right. Suddenly, in the more advanced ages, it becomes harder to learn how to make more primitive things.Now, I'm guessing they put this feature in to make sure that people couldn't rush to the Sixth and Final Age just by researching lower-end techs, but you know what would've been an even simpler fix? Make it so that the nine techs you have to research to advance an Age can only come from the Age directly prior to it. Not particularly difficult to implement, one would think. And it would allow you to have a little more time to actually get all of the techs your civilization needs, rather than having to rush through and try to pick out nine per Age before they skyrocket in price.Now, you may have noticed that one of those negatives is fixed by reading the manual, another is (potentially) fixed by turning the graphics down, and another may not be a problem if more playtesting reveals other strategies to work better than just all-ranged-all-the-time. So yes, overall I'm rather happy with Endless Legend. It's no Endless Space, and it's no Civ V, but it is something sort of halfway between the two. I'm not terribly impressed with how they messed up the technology tree, and I'd like quite a bit of refinement with things like starting position and a few other minor gripes, but overall it's a good way to spend the time until Civ: Beyond Earth comes out....c'mon, you know we're all thinking it.

												I am a huge fan of the ""Endless"" series of games, and Endless Legend is no exception.The game economy/resource management is very close to civ. Hexes produce food, industry, science, and dust (aka money) and you can assign workers to focus on producing one resource over others. There is no culture, but instead a resource known as influence allows you to take several diplomatic actions.There is a large amount of customization in the game. You can tweak the base races with a point buy perk system. You can also modify your units with various weapons/armors/trinkets.Each race is unique and thematically cool.The combat is tactical and based around army/squad type mechanics, where if a fight breaks out units in nearby hexes will join on future turns as reinforcements.The hero system is great as well. You can have heroes lead armies or assign them to improve your cities.			"

								Even if this is only early alpha, with a limit of 200 turns i am really, really enjoying this game already.If you enjoyed the CIV 4 mod ""Fall from Heaven"" i explicidly recommend you to give this a try!It is more to my liking than Enless Space, which still is a solid title.Let's see where this ends, for now my thumb is def. up!

												Attention long time Civilization fans, prepare your wallets for battle!Do you long for the good ol days of Civ IV? Before our beloved friends at Firaxis decided that we did not enjoy the near-tedious level of management and detail in their flagship title; and long before they began the process of streamlining (aka watering down) all of those aspects? The time when playing a single turn of a 4X strategy game could take 10, 20 even 30 minutes? Well look no further for your next strategy fix.It may sound as though I am being sarcastic, but for those of you who truly enjoy the long, slow and deliberate game style the older Firaxis used to offer us, then Endless Legend is worth a hard look.  EL is molded from the standard 4X format we are used to but with a heavy layer of originality and flavor thrown on top, not to mention some fantastic novel gameplay mechanisms.  If you are ready to take full control, and I mean FULL control over every aspect of your sprawling population, right down to the weapons each individual unit carries, then its time to pickup Endless Legend.  Overall: 8.5/10Suggested Maximum Purchase Price: $20-25 (US)PS: I am not hating on Civ 5, I love that game.  But in my opionion, it did not fill the painfully intricate shoes of its older sibling, and left much to be desired.  I was finally able to fufilled that desire with a heavy dose of Endless Legend.

												This game visually is Stunning. I love the way the cities look, and expecially the visuals of the cultist faction. Gameplay wise, the single city per region requires a very nice ounce of thought as to where you will place the city. It isn't too difficult to learn the basics for the game. However learning the combat system is very tricky. The Combat system is highly unique. You can choose between Automating your battles like Civ, or controlling it manually. Manual Combat takes a long time and might not be suited for everyone, otherwise you can just do auto attack like any other 4x game. City Capture/Attacking is very basic, it is very easy to raze cities if you have enough armies, there is also no reaction delay to whom ever is being attacked which can be problematic. It is too easy to steamroll a massive cluster of armies onto every city of your opponant and wipe them out within a few turns. There is very little need to siege a city, as a large enough army can demolish any militia within.Moving on to the Questing system, Each unique faction has a main storyline quest which can be used to unlock Dust, research, and resources. Ontop of that each minor faction has quest chains to pacify them in a region giving you unit buffs in each city. Unless you are the Cultists which have One Massive City then you convert villages after either pacification or by destroying them. Once converted they basically become mini-cities that auto-produce units once every 15 turns, the tiles add to your city's production and provide a citizen onto your capitol. Pretty impressive. You are also able to get unique Techs from exploring and looting ruins that dot the map. You can even search ruins investigated by other players, and have less chances of finding valuable items. Hero weapons can also be found inside of these ruins, they are stronger then average weapons you research and can provide interesting bonuses to armies commanded by your hero. The game does have some issues. Running a larger map can take a toll on your FPS if you have a massive multitude of armies all moving around at one time. Along with FPS drops over some cities if they get large enough. Some mechanics aren't explained at all in the tutorial, including city upgrading. Which is something that should be highly hinted at. (Spoilers, if you want to upgrade a district you need to surround it with 4 other districts to level it up, there I saved you some headache). I personally haven't played around enough with the customization of unique factions, but I would assume it would work much like Endless Space.However, I do reccomend that people buy this game. Inspite of its flaws, it is still a very solid game with a lot of replay value. "

												Endless Legend, developed by Amplitude Studios, is a turn based strategy of conquering, discovering, and surviving. You will get your choice of seven preset races, and each of them have benefits and shortcomings. It is all in how you choose to take on the game when it comes to selecting one of these races. If you are a warlord there is a race for you, if you want to be the scientist, there's a race for you, etc. There are also different conditions to win in the game, some are for conquering your enemies, some are for taking over enough of the world, and I think you know at this point that there are even more ways to win.Graphically this game looks amazing. I love the fact that as you zoom out the map becomes simpler, but doesn't lose any of its importance, and that of course is the boundaries of your cities. Until you play the game you will never know how important those can be. I just have to say that I was blown away on all fronts when it came to the look of the game. The differences in land type, the units that you will be using in the game, the buildings you will explore, protect, and create, all of it looks polished. There's also something else that looks amazing, and is usually a sore eye when it comes to games, and that is the load screen. It will depict a scene for the race you are currently playing as, and it looks amazing. So I guess what I'm saying is that graphically there's no way you can be disappointed in the game.The sounds of the game seem to blend in to the game. I can't say that anything blew me away, but I can tell you that I had no issue keeping the volume on in this game. I say that because there are definitely games that when you put a serious amount of hours into, you are ready to mute the game because of repetition, this is not the case with Endless Legend.The controls consist of hotkeys to get to different game screens, such as your research screen, your unit screen, the marketplace, etc. You will be spending the majority of the time armed with your mouse to make decisions ranging from selecting what to put in your research queue, building queue, and of course where you want your units to move.There really isn't a story to this game, I mean everyone is out there trying to carve out something for their race. It's really up to the player to determine how the story goes. You maybe the savior of your race and you'll be able to protect your borders and slowly grow your foothold on the world. You may also be a tyrant who only sees red and all that lie before you must be destroyed. The thing about this game, and most turn based strategy games, is that it all relies on the strategies that you employ. Now of course this is more than just a war game, there are other aspects to the game that should not be ignored.One of them is research, this is where you can set a certain path to show what you are trying to accomplish. You will get to choose what your race researches and what upgrades or enhancements your race will receive once the research is done. The only thing that I didn't really find that impressive about this was that I was either spoiled or trapped by the way Civilization does its research and I felt like Endless Legend's way was as sophisticated or complicated with prerequisites and what not. All you really need to do in this game is research enough subjects to advance to the next ring of subjects.Another thing that you are going to need to pay attention to in the game is that each race has a set of units, and you are not going to be replacing them as you go along with brand new units. What you will be doing is retrofitting old units with new stuff. In something that I really enjoy, you get to customize your units with newer armor, weapons, and trinkets. You also get to do this with the heroes that you hire during the game. Not only can you customize your heroes this way they also have different upgrade tracks that will allow them to not only level up but become specialized in a way that you choose.This is a solid game throughout, and the really cool thing is that this is also a game that is ever evolving. What I mean by that is that there is still stuff getting tweaked and added by the developers, but the really cool and interesting thing is that they are doing it based on gamer feedback. So I guess in the end if you are looking for a fantasy themed turn based strategy, where you are definitely going to find yourself locked into playing the game, you are going to want to get this game immediately. This game easily gets a 9.4 out of 10.			"

												This game is everything I have ever wanted out of a turn based strategy game. Factions are balanced and unique. Maps are beautiful. There is immense replay value. You can play the same faction on the same map 10 times and still have a different experience each time. It has a similar structure to Heroes V. You hire a hero recruit units and explore the map founding and upgrading cities along the way. It has much more depth and polish than that game however. The DLC is pretty cheap if you wait for sales and adds nice touches to the game. Another nice thing is that the DLC unlocked is based on the host, so if one person in the group has everything unlocked and he hosts his friends only need the basic game.  The music is fantastic and I play it all the time when doing homework or browsing the web. The art is very good and I use it as wallpaper often. It looks great.The only downside to the game is matches can take 10 or 12 hours to complete for larger maps. The game can be saved so this is not all in a row, but still it can be hard to coordinate with friends to finish a game. The other downside is you are going to need to play about 3 matches to learn the game. I've played several matches and several partial matches and there are still things I need to learn. You pick up one or two new insights with each game in my opinion.			"

Its a like Civ 5 with a fanstasy theme with some story and RPG elements.When I frist started playing the game I noticed the game felt sharp and crisp and uncluttered just looking at how the game ran and using its menus,  particurly most games feel clunky nowadays that was kinda refreshing.  The soundtrack is great.  The visuals are awesome.  The game play is fun and fluid.  This game also has some interesting mechanics, such as winter, questing, and how they do territory just to name a few.The downside is winnning is a bit anti climatic, as 4x its fine, just theres a plot of the game going on and its a bit of a cliff hanger.

Each group plays very uniquely; as well as the ability to create yout own. The generated worlds are amazing, and you have a great amount of control to make them just how you want them.I really have nothing negative to say. Its still being patched and tweaked as well as atleast 1 more DLC in store at the time of writing so don't worry the development team is great!If youre a fan of 4X you'll love this.

Best 4x experience I've had. Keep in mind when you read this review that I have only played the game with all of the DLC enabled. Long story short this game is amazing.  If you've played games like Elemental or Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes you'll love this one and if you've played Endless Space a lot of the mechanics will seem very familiar even though it's a completely different setting.  It does everything right and far as I can tell only one thing wrong. There is no way to achieve a multi player co-operative victory. I mean you can ally with another player and just go until one of you wins or you kill off everyone else but only one player will be awarded victory.So if the issue I listed doesn't turn you away here's some of the things I really enjoy about it.Legendary buildings that can only be built once, period.Other legendary deeds that only one empire can obtain.Awesome quests, both competitive and co-operative with sometimes great rewards.Very diverse factions.A victory condition for every play style.The option to toggle on/off any victory condition or DLC. (this should be in every 4x game)The legendary buildings always have a relatively large bonus to whatever city you build them in.  The legendary deeds always give a really good reward (usually just the legendary building you made that nobody else can at that point) and sometimes just a large amount of a resource.  There are also quests that give a great reward like an amazing piece of equipment for a hero that only one empire can get the reward for.  There are also quests that everyone works together to complete (usually to get rid of a terrible global effect that is randomly thrust upon everyone) and the highest contributor gets a good reward that's sometimes more valuable than contributing 100% yourself.Lots of different ways to achieve victory, if you've played Endless Space most of them will be familiar.  Victory by annihilation, conquering 75% of the world, conquering each other empire's capital, getting massive love (diplomatic points) from your friends, getting a certain amount of resources, researching 5/6 of the final technologies, having the high score at the end of the specified turn limit OR for those of you with size issues you can just build that big ol' ""pillar"" in your city that lets everyone know you're boss.All in all I'm thoroughly impressed with the game and I highly recommend it.  But again, keep in mind I have only played with all of the DLC enabled.  And I can't say it would be worth the... $73? getting it all at full price but it certainly was worth the $30 I paid.			"

												Endless Legend is one of those games that captivated me instantly. From gameplay to lore, from artwork to music, this game is one of the few that I can say I adore. I won't go too much into its gameplay, as many reviews point out both the great mechanics of the game, as well as its flaws. In short, I believe that Endless Legend is a very polished, and still growing, 4x game that is complex, fun, relatively easy to access, hard but enjoyable to master, with unique factors to consider (like winter), while also being unique in its diversity of factions with substantially different playstyles.Rather, I wanted to delve more into what makes Endless Legend a unique 4x experience to me that has not been seen since Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. I am, of course, talking about immersion, narrative, and lore. Though Endless Legend does not have a story campaign, I found myself instantly engrossed and invested in Auriga, a dying planet, with its myriad of children scrambling to secure their survival. Its roster of factions is unique and highly creative, with ideas and concepts that are seldom seen or approached in such a way in fantasy. From honorable vampiric knights torn between expedience and honor to Insane robot cult bent on destroying the legacy of their creators, Endless Legend provides a breath of fresh air to the fantasy genre (by in large part, infusing healthy dosages of Sci-Fi into it without compromising the Fantasy aspect).  Each faction's lore and story is explored through faction quests, a unique aspect in 4x, providing for those who wish it, a narrative experience and objective that goes beyond the traditional victory conditions present in 4x games. Each new game on Auriga is a new story from a different and engrossing perspective.  This immersion into the narrative of Auriga and its children is supplemented by minor quests which add much to the lore of the minor factions of the planet, in addition to an exceptional and beautiful artstyle that is, to me, incomparable. This is all topped off with an incredible and amazing score by FlyByNo, who perfectly captures the ambience of Endless Legend and its lore with every track. Gameplay wise, Endless Legend can proudly claim a high seat among the best of 4x games, with an active development team that constantly listens to feedback and improves the game. But if one is interested in complementing a fun gameplay experience with immersion and fascinating lore, then Endless Legend stands unrivalled with its head held high.			"

												I see this is on sale so just wanted to do a quick recommend. Especially if you enjoyed any civilization games. This one stands out on it's own, and feels different, but will appeal to civ players or players of similar games. The equipment for heroes adds an rpg style progression to them along with the trait focus as you level them. Allowing you to make your heroes more proficient in some areas for different uses. The game starts out slow in the early turns, but if you can get around that it's pretty nice so far. I hadn't put too much time into yet, but keep it installed since I plan to finish my custom once I feel like putting the time into it. You have an obvious and easy way to select/deselect dlc individually also in case you want some disabled for a particular scenario you make.  At like ten bucks currently for the game and dlc, or 17 bucks for the entire endless series (dungeon is also good, a tactical tower defense type of game with a different feel though I haven't played endless space so can't comment on that one). One Endless Legend expansion just came out a couple of months ago, so the packages on the current sale are a steal and you pretty much are close to getting the current expansion for free.			"

												I see a lot of people comparing this to Civ V, and I can undertand why, turn based 4X strategy. However I think that Endless Legend really stands up to Civ in its own right. It is certainly a hell of a lot prettier and at times a lot more challenging. The diversity of the races is absolutely a plus, each with amazing pros and intimidating cons. And the district system which Civ VI is stealing is definitely a much more accurate and interesting method of controlling city growth, and the army/unit stacking system is certainly a load more appealing than Civ V's single unit per tile policy and it can speed up turns signicantly. With a greater emphasis on planning and micromanagement, and an actual story for each faction and lore behind the game, I think that Endless Legend cannot really be compared to Civ; although it's the same genre, it has many mechanics that just work a lot better, it's more colourful, more challenging, less dry and simple; it lets you really get down to the nitty gritty of manging everything yourself, and I totally understand that that isn't everyone's idea of a great experience, but for me, this is a fantastic strategy game, that ALL devs can learn from, even 2K apparently.

												Overall, the game is a lot of fun.  The factions are actually DIFFERENT from each other, which is a great idea.  It's not just different colored cities and units with the same abilities; the factions actually work differently and have very different goals and backstories.  You can equip units and heroes with different gear, giving them different abilities, making them hit more or able to take more damage or move sooner in battle, for instance.  Each faction has only 3 unit types that are specific to them, but there are plenty of subfactions to conquer, that you can then assimilate into your empire, and gain their unit types.  The idea of regions and not being able to build more than one city in each region took some getting used to, but it actually ends up working rather well.  All of this and everything else the game offers leads to a really enjoyable experience.That being said, I think the overall story of the game could use some fleshing out.  I've now beat the game with 3 different factions, all of them by going through that faction's storyline to the end (I like story).  All of them are well-written and interesting, but it feels like I'm now done with that faction: there's no reason to play them again.  The story is the same each time you play with that faction, with no variance.  The story always ends with you getting a faction-specific tech and being able to build a specific building (trying not to give plot away here).  All of it's great, but no questions get answered.  Do the cultists succeed in their plot?  Do the drakken figure out what caused the war of the Endless and how to save the planet?  None of these questions are answered, so it ends up feeling really anticlimactic.I do recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a good, solid twist on Civ-type games with a fantasy setting.  Plenty of buildings to build, plenty of terrain to exploit.  I just wish the story was more solid at the end.			"

												This is an amazing 4X strategy game. Some level of fantasy is very welcome to me; as well as a strong background to each unique nation and the world as a whole. Each group plays very uniquely; as well as the ability to create yout own. The generated worlds are amazing, and you have a great amount of control to make them just how you want them.I really have nothing negative to say. Its still being patched and tweaked as well as atleast 1 more DLC in store at the time of writing so don't worry the development team is great!If youre a fan of 4X you'll love this. Even if youre not youll very likley love it anyways!			"

												I see this is on sale so just wanted to do a quick recommend. Especially if you enjoyed any civilization games. This one stands out on it's own, and feels different, but will appeal to civ players or players of similar games. The equipment for heroes adds an rpg style progression to them along with the trait focus as you level them. Allowing you to make your heroes more proficient in some areas for different uses. The game starts out slow in the early turns, but if you can get around that it's pretty nice so far. I hadn't put too much time into yet, but keep it installed since I plan to finish my custom once I feel like putting the time into it. You have an obvious and easy way to select/deselect dlc individually also in case you want some disabled for a particular scenario you make.  At like ten bucks currently for the game and dlc, or 17 bucks for the entire endless series (dungeon is also good, a tactical tower defense type of game with a different feel though I haven't played endless space so can't comment on that one). One Endless Legend expansion just came out a couple of months ago, so the packages on the current sale are a steal and you pretty much are close to getting the current expansion for free.			"

												Seems like the game was rushed...There are numerous issues. Enemy troop movements invisible because of popups, settlers can't be disbanded once you discover troop market, no way to check the current victory conditions in game, endless searching for a mission-critical item in the equipment screen, wrong text messages (accusing me of breaking an alliance when THEY are the ones doing it).Some people have compared it to Civilization. It's not, it doesn't nearly have that depth. More like Armored Princess :  Fun in its own way, but can't be taken serious as a strategy/build-up game.Price too steep for this IMO. Best to wait till it goes down.			"

												Stylisticly the game is 15/10.Mechanics wise I'd give it a 9/10, since some strategies are just too game changer. Bear in mind I haven't tried multipalyer yet, but economic plan+slaves buyout cost is very very strong early on with only dust production. Some races notebly drakken, forgotten can ""cheese"" they're way pretty reliably into a fast t2 and then rush glass/titan t2 wpn and armor and just streamroll you from there.Also its pretty hard to be defensive. I imagine multi games not going past turn 80 even tho as I said I have never played those just because of all the rush thats possible. The ai is sometimes really wonky. Still better then Gandi in Civ5.Also add a couple of hundred hours to my played time I'm a dirty filthy pirate.			"

												This game visually is Stunning. I love the way the cities look, and expecially the visuals of the cultist faction. Gameplay wise, the single city per region requires a very nice ounce of thought as to where you will place the city. It isn't too difficult to learn the basics for the game. However learning the combat system is very tricky. The Combat system is highly unique. You can choose between Automating your battles like Civ, or controlling it manually. Manual Combat takes a long time and might not be suited for everyone, otherwise you can just do auto attack like any other 4x game. City Capture/Attacking is very basic, it is very easy to raze cities if you have enough armies, there is also no reaction delay to whom ever is being attacked which can be problematic. It is too easy to steamroll a massive cluster of armies onto every city of your opponant and wipe them out within a few turns. There is very little need to siege a city, as a large enough army can demolish any militia within.Moving on to the Questing system, Each unique faction has a main storyline quest which can be used to unlock Dust, research, and resources. Ontop of that each minor faction has quest chains to pacify them in a region giving you unit buffs in each city. Unless you are the Cultists which have One Massive City then you convert villages after either pacification or by destroying them. Once converted they basically become mini-cities that auto-produce units once every 15 turns, the tiles add to your city's production and provide a citizen onto your capitol. Pretty impressive. You are also able to get unique Techs from exploring and looting ruins that dot the map. You can even search ruins investigated by other players, and have less chances of finding valuable items. Hero weapons can also be found inside of these ruins, they are stronger then average weapons you research and can provide interesting bonuses to armies commanded by your hero. The game does have some issues. Running a larger map can take a toll on your FPS if you have a massive multitude of armies all moving around at one time. Along with FPS drops over some cities if they get large enough. Some mechanics aren't explained at all in the tutorial, including city upgrading. Which is something that should be highly hinted at. (Spoilers, if you want to upgrade a district you need to surround it with 4 other districts to level it up, there I saved you some headache). I personally haven't played around enough with the customization of unique factions, but I would assume it would work much like Endless Space.However, I do reccomend that people buy this game. Inspite of its flaws, it is still a very solid game with a lot of replay value. "

												Endless Legend, developed by Amplitude Studios, is a turn based strategy of conquering, discovering, and surviving. You will get your choice of seven preset races, and each of them have benefits and shortcomings. It is all in how you choose to take on the game when it comes to selecting one of these races. If you are a warlord there is a race for you, if you want to be the scientist, there's a race for you, etc. There are also different conditions to win in the game, some are for conquering your enemies, some are for taking over enough of the world, and I think you know at this point that there are even more ways to win.Graphically this game looks amazing. I love the fact that as you zoom out the map becomes simpler, but doesn't lose any of its importance, and that of course is the boundaries of your cities. Until you play the game you will never know how important those can be. I just have to say that I was blown away on all fronts when it came to the look of the game. The differences in land type, the units that you will be using in the game, the buildings you will explore, protect, and create, all of it looks polished. There's also something else that looks amazing, and is usually a sore eye when it comes to games, and that is the load screen. It will depict a scene for the race you are currently playing as, and it looks amazing. So I guess what I'm saying is that graphically there's no way you can be disappointed in the game.The sounds of the game seem to blend in to the game. I can't say that anything blew me away, but I can tell you that I had no issue keeping the volume on in this game. I say that because there are definitely games that when you put a serious amount of hours into, you are ready to mute the game because of repetition, this is not the case with Endless Legend.The controls consist of hotkeys to get to different game screens, such as your research screen, your unit screen, the marketplace, etc. You will be spending the majority of the time armed with your mouse to make decisions ranging from selecting what to put in your research queue, building queue, and of course where you want your units to move.There really isn't a story to this game, I mean everyone is out there trying to carve out something for their race. It's really up to the player to determine how the story goes. You maybe the savior of your race and you'll be able to protect your borders and slowly grow your foothold on the world. You may also be a tyrant who only sees red and all that lie before you must be destroyed. The thing about this game, and most turn based strategy games, is that it all relies on the strategies that you employ. Now of course this is more than just a war game, there are other aspects to the game that should not be ignored.One of them is research, this is where you can set a certain path to show what you are trying to accomplish. You will get to choose what your race researches and what upgrades or enhancements your race will receive once the research is done. The only thing that I didn't really find that impressive about this was that I was either spoiled or trapped by the way Civilization does its research and I felt like Endless Legend's way was as sophisticated or complicated with prerequisites and what not. All you really need to do in this game is research enough subjects to advance to the next ring of subjects.Another thing that you are going to need to pay attention to in the game is that each race has a set of units, and you are not going to be replacing them as you go along with brand new units. What you will be doing is retrofitting old units with new stuff. In something that I really enjoy, you get to customize your units with newer armor, weapons, and trinkets. You also get to do this with the heroes that you hire during the game. Not only can you customize your heroes this way they also have different upgrade tracks that will allow them to not only level up but become specialized in a way that you choose.This is a solid game throughout, and the really cool thing is that this is also a game that is ever evolving. What I mean by that is that there is still stuff getting tweaked and added by the developers, but the really cool and interesting thing is that they are doing it based on gamer feedback. So I guess in the end if you are looking for a fantasy themed turn based strategy, where you are definitely going to find yourself locked into playing the game, you are going to want to get this game immediately. This game easily gets a 9.4 out of 10.			"

Plenty of buildings to build, plenty of terrain to exploit.  I just wish the story was more solid at the end.			"

												This game is... really odd. That's pretty much all I can say about it with complete confidence. Well, other than the fact that I think it is fantastic. Now, hear me out. This game is a 4x Strategy game with a hex based movement system and all that jazz. That comes with it's own sense of comparison cliches and mechanical trappings, but if you really do enjoy games like Civilization, and AoW and all of those, you will find somethere for you here within the bounds of Endless Legend. What draws my attention about it the most, is that it really does it's best to make every single game you play feel dramtically different. Each individual aspect can make or break your game, and will have you changing playstyles on the fly. To the random terrain sometimes not giving you the dust you need as a Broken Lord, or the first minor faction you get being absolutely useless, you have a whole host of things that will mess with your style, and keep you on your toes. That being said, the main issue I have is just how non-confrontational the A.I. is. You kind of feel like you are in the game alone, and it's dreary. But other than that, Im enjoying myself immensly. I WILL edit the review once I have a chance to experience Multiplayer.			"

Early Access Review
								Endless Legend is in amazing shape for an Early Access Alpha! I have always been very impressed with Amplitude with the quality of their titles and their constant communication with the player community which actually has a say in how their games develop.The graphics at this stage are wonderful with awesome tilt-shift effects (selective depth of field blurring) that make the game seem like a tabletop miniatures session when you zoom in (check some of my screenshots)! There is so many little neat details to look at and explore - so many great little finishing touches (like how the playing field becomes a hand drawn hex map as you zoom out) that you just wouldn't expect at this stage of development. Even more amazing is that Amplitude has indicated that they will be making improvements to the graphics as development continues - awesomesauce!Audio at this stage is above average - not as great as the graphics but totally acceptable at this stage.  Think string quartet kind of stuff - it can get a little sleepy after a long play session but thats just a nitpick. They plan to totally rerecord the audio at a later stage.Gameplay is a lot like Civilizations V in a fantasy setting. Currently, this is the area that is lacking the most features - auto-development of cities, more in-depth diplomacy, a tutorial, roads and trading, half of the factions (currently 4), etc... it's a long list of features they intend to put in but have not yet at the Alpha stage. Understandable. Anyone familiar with Amplitude knows they are a great studio and will certainly include these missing features as development continues - they just want to do each feature right and give them the dev time they deserve. That said, there is a TON of content already in the Alpha - outdoing many a beta or even finished product I've played. Setting up and equipping armies and adding heros and outfitting them as well are all present and quite intuitive. Combat is fun, even if you let the game auto-resolve. It's still very satisfying. City development, while not fully fleshed out, is quite deep. Random and faction-related quests are present. It PLAYS very much like a game much further down the development road. Kudos!EL is very intuitive to play, even for players who aren't huge 4x junkies (like myself). Don't be intimidated and not buy this game because of the tag 4x - it's accessible and fun to play with a surprising amount of information that is all easy to get at and digest.Bugs - sure. There ARE bugs. It's an Alpha. I have encountered FAR less bugs so far in EL than I have in some finished titles. Some are a little annoying (I had one crash the game - once in several play sessions) and some are just minor little things (like variables showin in text instead of unit names).Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone even remotely interested in playing 4x type games or anyone looking for a great, fun to play, awesome looking strategy title. Once you get it, you can head over to Amplitudes website and start voting on future development features and take an active role in EL's development. "

												One of my favorite games that I will keep coming back to. If you like 4x strategy games, then this is a must-buy! It's a fantasy themed empire building game with rpg elements. It may be similar to Fallen Enchantress, but it has unique gameplay elements that make it very interesting. There are many paths to victory, amazing art and graphics, and simultaneous multiplayer. Fantastic reply value!			"

Early Access Review
								Endless Legend is in amazing shape for an Early Access Alpha! I have always been very impressed with Amplitude with the quality of their titles and their constant communication with the player community which actually has a say in how their games develop.The graphics at this stage are wonderful with awesome tilt-shift effects (selective depth of field blurring) that make the game seem like a tabletop miniatures session when you zoom in (check some of my screenshots)! There is so many little neat details to look at and explore - so many great little finishing touches (like how the playing field becomes a hand drawn hex map as you zoom out) that you just wouldn't expect at this stage of development. Even more amazing is that Amplitude has indicated that they will be making improvements to the graphics as development continues - awesomesauce!Audio at this stage is above average - not as great as the graphics but totally acceptable at this stage.  Think string quartet kind of stuff - it can get a little sleepy after a long play session but thats just a nitpick.

												I should say a few things from the beggining. The first thing being, I am not a huge fan of 4X games. Games like Sid Meiers do not appeal to me too much. However, I am a fan of the combat system this game has, so I purchased this for what ever reason. I was not disappointed in the slightest. The movement system is very well-crafted and enjoyable. The addition of tribes and smaller races are very appreciated. One thing that is very interesting about this game is the major factions to choose from. The ability to choose from several unique, aesthetically-pleasing factions is great. Forming armys with several different units is a good ability. Also, there is a type of character called a Hero in this game. Heroes are a more powerful unit that lead an army. They are a cool addition to these types of games.Overall, this was a very pleasureable game to play, and I could recommend it to everybody. The basics are easy to learn but hard to master. This is a great game.			"

								This game is currently in Alpha [early access]. and yet. so far as I played. No glitches, bugs, the game looks better than alot of ""finished"" products on steam. How? I have no idea. Do I love it? YES!I bought the founder edition because I can :DBut let's see about the gameplay.I have no idea what I'm doing honestly. Just pressing buttons and going somewhere until the tutorial is online.But even with that the game is simple. Build, and conquer.You get missions often to keep you going.Troops and battle system are amazing.I don't have any negative things to say for this game.You should really buy it.			"

												This game is... really odd. That's pretty much all I can say about it with complete confidence. Well, other than the fact that I think it is fantastic. Now, hear me out. This game is a 4x Strategy game with a hex based movement system and all that jazz. That comes with it's own sense of comparison cliches and mechanical trappings, but if you really do enjoy games like Civilization, and AoW and all of those, you will find somethere for you here within the bounds of Endless Legend. What draws my attention about it the most, is that it really does it's best to make every single game you play feel dramtically different. Each individual aspect can make or break your game, and will have you changing playstyles on the fly. To the random terrain sometimes not giving you the dust you need as a Broken Lord, or the first minor faction you get being absolutely useless, you have a whole host of things that will mess with your style, and keep you on your toes. That being said, the main issue I have is just how non-confrontational the A.I. is. You kind of feel like you are in the game alone, and it's dreary. But other than that, Im enjoying myself immensly. I WILL edit the review once I have a chance to experience Multiplayer.			"

												I am really enjoying this game. What I like most is that it encourages you to exploit the various features of the game. For example, even if you want to focus on just a handful of cities, you may end up needing to expand in order to get access to the strategic resources you will need to build the best city improvements. I expect I will spend a lot of time playing this game before I am done.I should add that my system is running this game just fine even though it is below the minimum specifications. I have an Intel HD graphics 530. The default graphics settings that came up on install work fine for me although I'm sure it'd be nice to be able to support higher resolution. Maybe some day!			"

The core vanilla game has plenty to offer while the expansions supplement it well. However, it is a 4x game. I love 4x games but they're not everyone's cup of tea.

Early Access Review
								Ok so I am about 2 hours into the game and all I have to say is.... WOW. It is an extremely addictive, fun, challenging, rewarding game with great mechanics, great graphics, and is really well optimised which is a BIG plus for me. The lore and story involved is great, the way the world feels is just so immersive and the gameplay is smooth, I HATE TO COMPARE... I HATE IT SO MUCH, but its kind of like Civilation 5, in the way it feels, but I feel this game has MUCH more to offer and I cant wait to see what all they add. For an early acces game at this price with this ammount of quality, quantity, gameplay and fun, it is DEFINITLY worth the cost....5/510/1010000/10000 ........... if thats even a thing. lol			"

												For a more detailed explanation, read on.Overall Rating: 9/10   Verdict: Highly Recommended BuyGraphics: 10/10Storyline: 7/10 (or 9/10)Gameplay: 10/10Game Mechanics: 8/10Controls: 8/10Music: 10/10Content: 8/10If you've ever played any 4X game, then you know the general gist of this game. However, this game takes many of those general ideas of civilization-style games and turns them on their heads. I'll go through each of the above ratings ones by one below.Graphics: 10/10The first thing you notice about this game is how polished it looks. Typically, 4X games have clunky graphics, outdated UIs, and seem like they're trying too hard and failing at providing a beautiful experience. This game, however, is easy on the eyes. With wonderfully layered graphics and a depth of color, Endless Legend takes the bland look of Civ V and turns it into an artistic masterpiece. Everything is vibrant, even in the winter, and it's impossible to grow tired of the battle animations, city growth animations, etc. The integration of the world map into the playing field is also very intuitive (when you scroll out, the gameplay view slowly shifts to a tactical world map view). The world lives and grows continuously, unlike in Civ V where animations and graphics are executed in discrete, clunky motions. Endless Legend creates a world that looks and feels alive.Storyline (by itself): 7/10Storyline (in context of the game): 9/10This game has a storyline. Strange for this type of game, but Endless Legend fits it in perfectly. In fact, if you don't want to follow the storyline, you can completely ignore the quests. However, the lore adds a sense of depth to this world much like the graphics do. Instead of feeling like an invader or a foreign entity on a playing board, the quests integrate the player into the world. As a story alone, it lacks some depth. However, the way it is integrated into the game, and compared to other games, the storyline is definitely a rare one. If you enjoy fantasy/rpg elements, then you will definitely enjoy the storyline. However, if you do not, the lore does not detract from the playing experience.Gameplay: 10/10Clarification: by gameplay, I mean the ""plot"" of an individual playthrough. I am NOT referring to lore, controls, etc., I am referring to the events and cohesiveness of a single playthrough. The gameplay is wonderful. Like all 4X games, the infinite number of possibilities in this game makes replay value extremely high. Each time you play through the game, new things happen and new interactions between other countries occur. Unlike in Civ, where AI interaction is predictable by civilization or by design, the AI in Endless Legend is less predictable from game to game. The way they react is dynamic, taking into account how you and the other players react, and not necessarily tied to their race. Thus, playing the game is a lot like being immersed in another world. As in real life, you do not know how other players are doing; you can only react to what you see (army movements, city developments, etc). Other than that, you must play diplomat and make smart choices. Once again, the gameplay is unique in that you can be in another world making your own choices; you develop your civilization to your specifications, not to the specifications that history has told you to follow. Game Mechanics: 8/10The city mechanics are solid, but they lack some depth. For example, when building trade routes, the routing and trading is automated, and the only benefits you can get are gold and science. Additionally, the tech tree is less interdependent than the one in Civ V, resulting in less planning needed (and fewer conequences for researching something you don't need). Buildings also belong to the entire city, and upgrades to the city are provided throughout the entirety of the city (with the exception of wonders and strategic/luxury resources). Thus, less city planning is needed. Other than this however, the variety and scope of city upgrades, buildings, planning, etc. is huge. Unit mechanics, on the other hand, are absolutely mind-blowing. There is so much depth to heroes, including skill trees, a ton of equipment, and synergy between different types of units, land, etc. The tile control in Endless Legend is very developed, especially during battle. Battle mechanics are also very fun compared to other 4X games - it's hard to describe without trying it out yourself. Each battle, especially as they scale up to larger and larger ones, immerses you in the action. Controls: 7/10The controls are quite natural. Left click to select, and right click to deselect or exit a menu. Left click for unit/city actions, right click for unit movement. Scroll out for tactical/world map, scroll in for gameplay map. Drag or use your mouse/arrow keys to move the camera around. Simple and more intuitive than most 4X game controls.The reason controls gets a 7, however, is because they can be buggy. Sometimes, when scrolling, i'll have my units pop up when I merely want a view of the territories. Other times, I'll select an army unit and pan out to plan tactical moves, and my screen will be flooded with other information. Most importantly, unit movement is buggy when not in gameplay view (i.e. when I'm in tactical/world view).Music: 10/10No need to explain. Listen to the music in some of the videos, or look it up on youtube. Absolutely sublime.Content: 8/10Lots of content. And I mean LOTS of content. However, it is still not at the content level of Civ V (probably because it is a newer game). After around 25 hours of exploring the game, however, I feel as if I have seen most of what this game has to offer. While this game certainly has high replay value, the lack of deep content, more varied AI, etc. makes it peter out. However, the lore, faction quests, and DLC quests provide quite a lot of extra content to explore. On top of that, the different combinations and orders of building, exploring, fighting, etc. makes the content more than enough. The depth of the gameplay and immersion makes content an 8 because the buildings, terrain, tech, etc. that the game provides are extended upon through their varied uses. Summary: Overall, a great game. For me, even at $10 more than Civ V for the full game + DLCs, this game would be a must-buy purely for the immersion that comes from the music, graphics, rpg aspect, lore, etc. However, if you are more into games with depth of content and strategy and do not care as much for immersion, buy this when it is on sale (for $50 or less for Endless Legend Collection). One final note: if you care, even the slightest, for feeling like part of the game, whether it be due to music or graphics or rpg aspect or lore or anything for that matter, then this game is a must-buy. Otherwise, it's still highly recommended that you try it out.			"

												Fantastic. I love the story and combat system. It's basically an improved Civilizations game with a more complex build. I used the utterly broken Broken Lords for my first game win. The Tempest expansions does not add anything special to the game, instead they become far more cluttered and complex as they are merely a copy of the game's tech tree. They simply add another resouce called Pearls. The ocean fortresses are a nice touch but it's like any other base. There hasn't been any major improvement in the game with the expansions. Iceberg Interactive has probably run out of new ideas and is doing the same thing that Heroes of Might and Magic 7 did. Tempest simply spawns more items on the map. The Morgwar are Dungeon and Dragon's Formorians and the Endless Legends Formorians are basically robots. Most of the Tempest expansions are all references to pirates, pearls to Black Pearl and the Black Spot from the black spot from Treasure Island.I compiled everything into a review guide instead.

												I'll be honest, that although I became a huge fan of EL, this game isn't very newbie-friendly. There are so many elements that are very important but not decribed directly, especially battle elements. So here comes..WARNING: If you are not used to or not comfortable with figuring out systems by yourself, this game is probably not for you.If you have no problem with it however, I promise that you will have a real good time playing this game. You will start to understand more how systems work as you play more, and will be amazed how things are beautifully designed at the end. Gaming experience gets better and better as you understand the system and start to actively use them for your sake.Use the community discussion section if you have questions or problems. Guys there are such kind fellas and the game developer will reply from time to time.			"

												I love this game and I think it's great. It is sort of like Civ however it is a bit more in depth with it's features like editing Civs and changing your units equipment. The recent reviews are very mixed at the moment but that is because of a recent bit of drama involving a chinese language mod (this game does not support chinese) being taken down from steam due to it having a link to a cracked version of the game in. The author got automatically banned from steam automatically for 1 day and he has riled up a load of the chinese player base agaisnt amplitude because of it.But onto more of a proper review (i just wanted to get that part out of the way because the recent review percentage does not reflect the game)Pros:> In depth combat system that takes place over 6 turns and uses unit speed for the move order> Being able to mod civs is useful for those that want to play a particular style as a civ that normally doesnt allow it> Winter mechanic makes period of the game quite difficult but with right hero upgrades you can bypass these issues> City building requires thinking with the district system. If you expand in a straight line trying to get certain tiles your city will be less happy then if you slowly expanded as a circle> Hero system is cool as you can level them up in different ways. The same hero could be used as a spy by one player and by another as a powerful war general.> Quests. Both ones that are only for you as well as ones where you compete with other plays to finish it first as well as cooperative ones (although the only cooperative one i've seen is one where you need to all put in resources to lessen the market resource cost)> Diverse civs. Want to be a cult leader? You can! Want to be in control of who uses the market? Easy! Want to be a ""diplomatic"" dragon that can just decline anything the others civs try to force on you? Done!Neutral:> The one city per region is a nice touch however it is incredibly annoying to have a quest in a region that a civ controls and they have closed their borders.> Winter gets longer and longer which does make sense lore wise but personally i would like an option to remove winter negation but also make summer and winter cycle normally like always having between 18 and 23 turns of summer for 13 and 17 turns of winter.>  Some legendary building (one per world) affects seem a tad too OP (like cutting millitary costs in half) but you can also just take the city with the building and claim it for your own.Cons:> Lack of ocean combat is quite an issue for me. You cant even attack units on water from land.> Few mods (I dont know if this is any fault by the dev and if this is their fault or if the community for this game doesnt include avid modders but it is still something to take into consideration)> The tutorial isnt that great in this game but i found out how to do everything by either looking online or trial and error,> No teams in multiplayer is a bummer for me as I prefer playing these games with my friends agaisnt a team of AIs than having a free for all.Overall I think this is a great game and I prefer it to civ V for single player however playing with friends the team function in Civ V wins it for me but i would still definitely recommend this to anyone especially as it is on sale right now.

												First let me say that I don't think this is a bad game. Its very polished, looks great, the menus are intuitive, and its easy to get an understanding of what your empire is doing in a quick look.However, this game bored the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me.My biggest problem was the combat. I read reviews and from what I understood, combat was going to be like Age of Wonders 3. And while they share similarities, Endless Legend dumbed it down big time. In this game, you don't individually move your units and attack. Instead, you give a very, VERY general set of instructions. You tell a unit to attack an enemy, no matter if the unit can reach the enemy or not, and thats it. Your unit does its best to get within range and attacks if able. Automatically. There is no tactics, no skill. Its purely who has the most units, who has the smartest units, and who has the best equiped units.No special powers, no tactical positioning to flank an enemy cause there is no bonus for such things. You can't select one unit, move it out of the way so another unit can move to its spot and attack. You can't even really tell your unit where to go in most cases. While it is true that you can tell your unit to move to a specific place next to an enemy and attack, if that enemy moves before that unit, the unit isn't going to do anything except move because now the enemy isn't where you told your unit to move.Combat in this game has been dumbed down to ""Everyone attack this one guy! And if he dies, then attack whatever guy you feel like! But be sure to trip over yourselves trying to get within fighting range!"" You make sure the red lines are all pointing towards one guy, hit play, and watch your units try their little hearts out to attack whatever the red line pointed at.My next issue is equiping and upgrading your units (I.E. the RPG aspect of this game)First, I have an issue with having only one infantry, archer/support, and calvery unit per race. In order to get more units, you have to convince a minor faction (Either by destroying their village in your region then rebuilding it, bribing them, or completing a quest for them) to be assimilated into your faction. Then you get their one unit. Which I must admit, was pretty lame to me. I like to have multiple units with different abilities so being restricted to less than a hands count sucked.I was fully expecting to find magical gear like powered up swords or armor and having to choose which units or heroes to give it to. Instead Endless Legend makes you choose between having your one racial infantry unit hold a sword or spear (Doing extra damage to infantry or calvary respectively) and just getting the next ""Tier"" of armor your technology level allows.I will admit, I liked being able to upgrade or ""Retrofit"" as the game calls it my units after adding my newly researched better armor to them immediately. But again, the upgrade itself is nothing more than equiping the next level of equipment rather than making any real choice as to how to upgrade them.The heroes was something I liked however. Your heroes have a skill tree with 3 different trees with abilities that can affect them if they are the general of an army or the mayor of a town. Or both in some cases. It did make you have to choose if you wanted a powerful unit or to give a city huge bonuses.The city building was interesting. Its a mix between Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic 6 I believe. Maybe 5. I don't remember. But you build a city anywhere you want in a region, which are randomly cut out areas on the map. But you can only have one city per region so once you build a city, that region is considered yours. Along with everything in it. So enemy players can't build a city directly next to your land and take it via influence like in Civilization.I'm not a real fan of the thumbs up or down method steam uses to rate games because this game itself isn't bad. It was just incredibly boring to me which is why I cannot recommend it.			"

												Just finished tutorial, this game is good. Overall this game is like civilization game with a new fantasy setting, battle is similar to Heros of Might and Magic.1. Graphics 8, just normal.2. Music is awesome, 9!3. Game play 9, it's fun to play so far, so much to explore, and I think it's better than Civ beyond the earth at this moment. (This will be altered if 2k release other dlcs to complete CIV:BE...)Overall it's worth buying, another game to waste time on next round.才结束教程，感觉还不错。总体来说相当于一个新的世界设定下的文明游戏，战斗倒是类似英雄无敌系列。1. 画面8分，普普通通吧。2. 音乐很赞！9分！3. 游戏性，9分！说实话目前玩下来感觉比超越地球要好玩。（如果后面2k发布dlc把超越地球做好的话就把这句去掉。。）总体来说推荐购买啦！又多了一个不停下一轮的游戏！			"

												Please note: I am only giving this a thumbs down due to crashes and bugs that make the game unenjoyable, I may change my opinion when the game is fixed.I was so looking forward to playing this game, but in its current state, it is just a lesson in frustration. The game looks very interesting and entertaining, but if you are thinking about buying it, WAIT UNTIL IT IS FIXED. I appreciate that the developers are working to fix the many, many bugs and crashes occurring throughout play, but part of me feels that these things should be addressed BEFORE release. Just some of the issues I have come across: Crash at world loading screen (sometimes fixed with the workaround on their forums here: http://forums.amplitude-studios.com/showthread.php?36242-WORKAROUND-Crash-at-world-generation-Identical-world-generation, but not always), the steam overlay does not fully close within game when exited, chuggy and slow menu load up (I am running the game on simple graphics also, which my computer should easily be able to handle), sometimes menus don't load at all or take excessively long to focus in. I appreciate the efforts of smaller developers, but in its current state, this game is frustratingly unplayable. You are just waiting for the next crash or malfunction, which means you are a little on edge every turn wondering if you will have to go through the entire process of reloading the game and hoping that this time it works properly. I would not write this game off, as I said, it looks to have real potential, but keep an eye on the patch lists and wait until it is fixed to a playable state before spending forty dollars on it.

												This game has a very nice-looking hex-based map with a well-polished effect for transitioning between a highly-detailed view of the terrain an an abstract map with borders between regions. That's really the best part of the whole game. On the other hand, I've been dissatisfied because:1. The game crashes all the time.2. It's the blandest combat system out of any 4X fantasy or medieval game I've ever played in my life: from early games like Master of Magic and Lords of the Realm, to Dominions, Warlock, Eador, Stronghold, Total War, Age of Wonders, Disciples, even Civilization in the early ages - they're all better combat systems, where I get to build at least some units that I enjoy fighting with.3. There are many neat-looking special locations on the map, but they all just give some resource to whatever city you build next to them, and you end up ignoring most of them because each region can host only one city. In the end there a few different kinds that are all interchangeable.4. The research feels unbalanced and fairly game-y: the cost increases with each previous research item you get, so you can never use your superior research power to clean up the simpler items you've skipped. It's somewhat like an RPG where the enemies always feel the same because they're scaled to your level. Meanwhile many late-game techs are inferior to early game items. It costs so much production to build late-game buildings that it seems more effective to stick with the boring early game tech.5. There isn't anything exciting to research for your military - just +2 swords to replace your +1 swords basically.This is the second time I fell for a stylish, superficial, empty, unfinished ""Endless"" game made by this company. I hope I remember this before I buy another one.			"

												This game looked pretty good, the setting and factions seemed interesting and colourful. But when it came time to actually play it, I found it to be really boring. I gave it about 10 hours of gameplay over two days, but had to put a tv show on the other screen so I could avoid falling asleep. Ultimately I gave up without finishing a single match, with about 90% of my playtime being spent clicking next turn, waiting for the contruction to finish so I could select a new construction and click next turn some more. Really quite tedious, I'm glad I got it in the sale or I'd be kicking myself.			"

												Accessible to those who enjoy the Civilization series, but breathes its own unique ideas into the 4x formula and executes them very well. The game has strong graphics, beautiful music, and well written lore. The factions play very differently from each other with their own mechanics, which adds a lot of variety to your strategy and play style. A surprise hit for me this year that I'm greatly enjoying!

												The cons:-This may sound strange, but it feels like the game could never be finished. Not in a bad way, but in the sense that there's room to add a seemingly infinite amount of extra mechanics and concepts that might never get the proper attention to balance they need. I feel this was apparent in the Guardian expansion that has yet to see the addition of a unit that is meant to kill said Guardians (despite it's announcement with the release of said expansion). -Compared to their other title, Endless Space, the sync issues are handled EXTREMELY well, with probably 1% of the games I've played being ruined because of instability. Huge improvement there.-Gameplay issues I have include city defense and siege, which I feel needs more appropriate fleshing out. One unit can siege a city with immense size and population, and while it only takes a moment to deal with this in reality, it still feels a little strange that one guy can shut down a whole city.The pros:As usual, Amplitude Studios delivered a 4x with a great variety of gameplay options. Each race in the game basically acts as a foundation and template for the custom traits the player wants to add on, individualising their faction. For example, one race can only have a single city, and this affords that race slightly more ""trait points"" in creating their full array of characteristics. Another race is the only faction capable of moving cities. Another race survives without food (thriving on ""Dust,"" the gold of the universe). Another race survives without science (stealing knowledge or research). Therefore, these are simply the base of where you want to take your gameplay as any of these races can be tailored to a militaristic, economic, diplomatic, scientific, etc. style of gameplay. Again I feel Amplitude nailed multiple victory types without any single one being the ""one"" way to win like in other games such as Sins. Combat is handled in real-time, locking out a section of hexes on the map for the battle to take place in what I consider a very creative way of managing battlefields.I'd keep typing but everything else is totally awesome, including the updates and balance fixes.Also, the developers are active on the forums and actually have made several key changes to this game based on feedback from users. A huge plus in my book.			"

												Civilization V is the most famous and well know 4X game. Well this game is a 4X, and basic mechanic are the same.... but numerous changes to key features, additional options and  many ways to play this game make it a new experience. My personal favourite and probably the biggest difference from Civ V is how different play style is for  different factions. From builders of great cities or science seekers, through religious freaks who can have only one city, to Zerg-like insects who want to win with their massive infectious swarm.This game has great art design, but programming needs some tweaks as it is quite often for it to crush.

												First Impressions: They've come a long way since Endless Space. You can see some of the DNA there, but the world is so much more colorful and alive, with terrain to explore and more interesting side missions to complete. Still, while it has some of the complexity and stat crunching of older Civ games you'll find your eyes looking all over the screen for details and clues on how to best exploit this ability, or that resource, or that tech next. In other words, fun for the serious 4xer, but could use a bit more polish.Recommended -- With the caveat that I do so because there's potential to enjoy here. Still, there are other things that would hold my attention stronger and earlier than this.			"

THIS GAME IMO:-Very extensive mechanics with tons of content.Complicated at the first hours, but when you get to it, you will see why the game is good.-The game has multiple ways to win. Diplomacy, economy, military, and so on.-Races (actually called as ""major factions"") are very different from each other in ways of winning.-Art is amazingly great and has its uniqueness on aquarelle painting.-Lore won't disappoint you. In fact it is very deep with hours of reading and understand of each faction. With so many cultural and personalities in the game, you could creat a pnp rpg from it(e.g: use a d20 sistem adventure based on endless legend).-Music and sound effect are gorgeous. You will be surprised on how good this is.-Combat system is easy to understand but it can be complex; and even outnumbered, or with low chance of winning a good strategy can turn the tide(e.g: Putting a ranged unit on a forest hill can give them high damage output as well as survivability even tho most of them are squishy).-Every hero has its own concept and background.-Customizable units since the early game till the very end.(e.g: the starting units have basic settings, but after a fews researches or questing on the starting rounds, you can dramatically change your units stats to as good as a hero)-A tactic game with a main quest for each major faction.-Many side quests with a high variety of rewards and requirements.-Many units to choose from (as long as you can afford them of course, money is everything). With this in mind, you can make many team combinations. (e.g: having 2 support units(one heal and another debuffs) 2 cavarlry(one damage other tanky) 1 flying(aoe damage) and 1 ranged(damage)-You can save a online match with a friend and then load to play another time. (this works surprisingly well, no crashes, no erros, just load and play)-Online multiplayer works perfectly good.(no dsyncs)-Dont 1x1 Ardent Mages you will regret doing so.-Economy in this game is vastly complex, and a well timed strategy can turn the tide. (e.g: you can ban  players from using the market when that players are engaging a war with someone, and pkers tend to have more military based strategies, so they wont have enough influense to ""un-ban"" theirselves to acess the market to buy resources or units to maintain their attack or defense.-People might mention that some factions are unbalanced, but believe me, they all have strenghts and weaknesses and every single faction is good and excel at something. No faction can thrive on every aspect of the game. You can be very good at military, but you will lack a diplomacy or economy.-If play against your friend, consider a lost friendship, because this game is very competitive.-Graphics are fantastic. Every detail is this game feels alive.TL;DRWhat i have to say:I have tons of hours playing this game and have only played 3 factions (have been playing for like 6h a day for 2 weeks offline). Haven't mentioned the dlcs yet but i cant talk about them since i didn't buy any yet. But overall the game is more than it looks, at first you will be very confused on so many mechanics involved in this. This is a game that you wont pwn anyone by being good at just something, you gotta be good at everything, good at trading, good at skirmishes, and be aware of the map. the sound is very involving and will make you feel inside the game. I can assure you will never get bored on something in this game(unless you really play it hardcore 20h a day for 6 months then might get bored, just like any other game). You alway have so many thing to learn, every new game teaches you something and will be a very unique experience.This is one of the best games i've ever played. Its now marked on my personal top games.10/10 for all the incredible work done on this game.Everything is a master piece. Art, Soundtracks, Mechanics, UI, factions.The game is very satisfying and worths more than the price suggested.			"

												This game is everything I had hoped Warlock: Master of the Arcane and Elements would be.The game at it's core is a 4x strategy game. You build towns and armies, develop them and conquer the world or become the world's leader through the several other victory types. However the implementation is better, with clever changes to many of the mechanics: Combat is handled through tactical battles on the world map. Once hostilites start an area of the map is sectioned off to be used as the battle field, allowing you to know the terrain beforehand. though exploiting that is a little difficult. Rather then precise commands you give broad directions or targets in combat, which makes battles quick and brutal compared to other 4x games with tactical combat.Towns hold a territory/province stopping town clustering though town placement is very important since the town only gathers resources from ajacent tiles, though extractors can be built on far away strategic or luxury resources. Additionally provinces have minor factions who can be convinced to join you via quests or bribes, or wiped out and built back up. These minor factions provide free workers and can be incorporated into the empire to give faction wide bonuses along with new units.Units are quite customizable. You can choose from a few different armor and weapon types that vary depending on the type of units. The factions only get a few types of units which can then be customized to fit different roles and more unit types can be gained from the minor factions.The factions themselves have quite a bit of variety from some factions which don't take food, to others that can't declare war, to another that cannot not be at war and even one that can only build one super town. Factions can also be customized, though the default factions seem to use more points then you get. Additionally the factions have interesting backstories that are fleshed out more on their faction specific quests.So far the only real complaint I have is that the game is not balanced towards large maps. Expanding is punishing until high level techs are researched making much of a larger map unused. Otherwise this is probably the best 4x game I have played in awhile.			"

												I'm pretty wary of Early Access these days, but having played and enjoyed Endless Space, I decided to go for it and was not disappointed. Even in the Early Access stage, the polish and promise of this game was unusual. Graphics? Gorgeous. Sound? Beautiful. Gameplay? So much fun. Difficult, but fun. (Maybe it's just the way I play, but I found the Newbie difficulty level to be similar to Civ 5's normal difficulty. It's very easy to fall behind, so get started early and don't waste turns if you can help it!) It's also got some features that make it stand out from other 4X fare. The light RPG elements (similar to Endless Space, but more in depth), which include quests, are plentiful enough to keep you from getting bored, but not so deep that they bog down the game too much. Tech researching is also a little more involved and interesting than your standard 4X. Unlike in most 4X games, researching is a little more free-form. Instead of tech trees, there are more like tech levels. To get to the next level (which the game calls Eras), you have to research a certain number of technologies, which can be from any of the main categories (science/production, culture/influence, military, and agriculture/economics). So, if you like, you can choose not to research any low-level (Era I) agriculture/economic technologies and still be able to research Era II agriculture/economic technologies once you've unlocked that level. The anomalies and wide variety of hex benefits (e.g. 1 food, 2 dust, 3 production output if one of your cities extends to that hex) also spice up the game, adding extra elements to consider when making strategic decisions. The only quibble I have is with the manual battles. While they're enjoyable enough, I've found the system a bit clunky and my units occasionally ignore my orders completely for no apparent reason (not even a terrain reason). Not sure if that's a pathfinding issue or what, but it can make manual battles a little frustrating at times. I've found that you're less likely to lose units in manual battles than the automatic ones (or at least that's what I've seen in my limited experience), so I wish they would take a look at that or somehow make it more clear why units are sometimes like ""Oh, was that an order? You wanted me to do something/go somewhere that might preserve my health or life? How cute. I'm going to go get myself murdered now. kthxbye!"" That said, that's not a huge part of the game and you can absolutely let the computer take care of it if you prefer.Anyway, this is a great game overall and shows that Amplitude Studios is becoming one of those rare Developers You Can Trust To Make Amazing Games That Are Worth Your Money And Will Probably Not F--- You Over With Early Access. (The DYCTTMAGTAWYMAWPNFYOWEA club is an admirable and exclusive one, but I think we can all agree that they need a little help with that acronym.) 9.5/10 "

												only complaint is the combat system. You don't really get to make any decisions when you go into the tactical battle screen and it seems to serve no other purpose than to provide a stage upon which to watch the units display their individual animations. I would really like to see a patch that allows for more manual control of each battle, otherwise I'll continue to hit auto resolve each time for the sake of saving time. other than that the game is fun. the quests offer a good distraction from the typical empire building and city management of a 4X game, and reminds me of other titles in the genre like Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Hero's but with more style. The backstory and world-building is compelling as well, and the diplomacy system is one of the best I've seen in this genre.  "

												This caught me by surprise - I rarely feel engaged by 4x games (outside of Civ), but this title really has merit.Let's get the basics out of the way - it looks great. The artistry is top-notch. The UI is fluid, and importantly doesn't waste your time with animations that freeze your ability to navigate. Everything is responsive and satisfying.The minor factions are a great addition - something Civ struggled with all the way through 5 (with the city-states). Endless manages to make the minor factions feel ""just right"", and conquering/parlaying/bribing them is a huge part of the game. Plus it's just plain fun to sometimes gain their trust through quests, and sometimes through conquest. Every option feels equally viable, you can't use just one strategy to get what you want.The major factions are varied and (again) satisfying. Each one plays entirely differently, but not so differently that you feel like you're stuck re-learning the wheel. Some games with multiple factions make it seem as if one or two factions got all the developer's attention, but these factions are well-rounded.I could go on, but overall the game is remarkably well thought-out, well-executed, and engaging. I don't often play 4x games, but I'd feel comfortable suggesting this to anyone.			"

												If you like 4x games, Amplitude deserves your money. Heck, if you don't know if you like 4x games, Amplitude games are a great place to start. Amplitude is a great studio that is highly responsive to its users and makes fun, engaging games to boot. Endless Legend is a fresh take on the genre and combines relative (for the genre) ease of entry with satisfying depth and engaging systems. Highly recommended.			"

												If you like 4x games in the tradition of Civ, you should easily like this game. It isn't a clone by any means- the city district, 1/city per region, and quest system are all quite distinct- but an easy reccommend if you enjoyed Civ. (The Devs also have this habit of adding free content from time to time, which is hard to view negatively.)			"

												It took me around three tries to get into this game as at first coming from Civ V it was a little too , over complicated, different and strange but then bam, I seemed to get the hang of it and now I love the mechanics of the game...You just have to give it a go, experiment and make mistakes and you will do that very much so in the beginning. The tech tree is quite complicated and daunting at first, the quest system can be very distracting and it is slower paced game than Civ V. You have heros who can either lead an army or govern a city and all this takes management. There is some similarities with Civ but also big differences. You have heros to level up as well as troops and this is more comlicated than army upgrades in Civ V. You have districts to upgrade. Apart from that you send settlers out to start cities, you can take over enemy cities with armies and you have diplomacy which is different from Civ V.All the races play differently and each has its own quest line. All in all a very good addictive game which once again like civ is one more turn!!!			"

												Endless Space was a work of art. But with limited competition in terms of modern space-based 4x games, it had the luxury of an easier benchmark to surpass. Endless Legend is Amplitudes leap into the world of land-based 4x, of which competition is more plentiful; and yet despite having bigger opponants to defeat, such as the dominating Civilization series, Endless Legend is showing signs that it just might set itself in stone as a game to be remembered.Despite still having a few rough edges (mostly typos or grammar errors in text), Endless Legend shows promise; and that promise is the promise to dazzle us with beautiful artwork, breath-taking fantasy themes and action-packed gameplay. Stunning visuals, magnificent music and diverse factions truly make Auriga a world you want to get to know. A world you want to explore. A world you want to conquer. Be it as woodland-dwelling builders, powerful animated suits of armour, mysterious spellcasters or corpse-eating insectoids.So think of it as Civilization mixed in with Endless Space with improved visuals, a fantasy settings and tactical combat. In fact, don't, because that doesn't do it justice. The only way to truly understand the charm and beauty of this game is to play it.I recommend.			"

												8/10I love the concept behind this game. It's kind of like playing Civilisation V but it has so many unique features that it does kind of feel like a different game altogether. At first, going in with this perspective - I have to admit, I didn't like it. It felt a bit like a poor rip off of the game. Delving into it and giving it a chance anyway, I found that actually I like it quite alot. There are certain aspects from the whole territory dividing feature which gives it a unique twist, a restriction that can be described as welcome (otherwise acquiring resources would be not nearly as challenging) to things like being able to customise your own race. This feature is probably one that is not liked by others, and I can't imagine how it would fare if you played for serious competitivity but between friends - feels like a nice little charm seeing the different strategies that your friends will implement to succeed, whether it be from the quite commonly seen choice of tweaking a class that has already been described by the game itself as Broken or from doing something slightly creative and creating a peace loving clan that unites itself in peace with all bar one to single that clan out and abolish them from the game.(Note to Creators should you ever read this: Please don't ever balance this. I don't mind that it is clear that some races have a typical advantage because that creates creative solutions as to how to overcome them - and I always have found games where balancing happens too frequently to become very bland and lack excitement. That moment when you discover something really cool about a race that gives you a clear advantage over others can really contribute to that feeling of something special when playing any game).The music is brilliant, and has an atmospheric aura that only contributes to the game - I am a fan of the originally created audio in most games, my friends however - not so much. But even they have stated that this game doesn't have one of those repetitive audio tracks that begin to get on your nerves after a while but actually can be listened to and enjoyed throughout the playthrough of the game.The graphics are a lovely touch as well, they update every time you re-tab into the game which is great and they look and feel great. They really contribute again to the atmosphere that you're playing in a war as opposed to some kind of arcade themed strategy game. They clearly have had quite some time put into them too and it's a nice touch - even better that you can play the game with these graphics even on a lower spec computer like my own without experiencing too many issues.One problem I do have with the game though (well actually two, a minor and a major). The syncing issue in multiplayer (being the minor problem) can be a little annoying sometime. I have recently learned that this is likely due to the spec of my computer and so isn't too great an issue but I've noticed for some reason it flags off as unsynced but we can still play for ages anyway. I don't mind ignoring and haven't rated the score I gave accordingly - but thought I'd mention it anyway.The problem that I marked the score down for was the way the game is mapped? I don't know if that's the correct terminology but basically when you try to assign the moves of some of your units, sometimes you'll have to remouse over the tile you want a few times (only happens sometimes, so not unbearable). I'm not sure if this is related to terrain mapping but it's a little annoying and has caused me to make a few poor choices by accident. The problem with this is it does contribute to giving the game a little bit of a laggy feel sometimes (also noticeable in the main menu selection as well by the way) which is a shame because it's a tiny feature which lets the game down a tiny bit - especially on first impressions, which if I was a different type of gamer, could have caused me to simply reject the game on that impression alone.Overall, the game is amazing though. I don't want to end on a bad note and I only rated it two lower in the hope for an aspiration for improvement from the developers. The game is great and I'm really enjoying it so far. I would like to see more classes, units and technologies, as well as more factions but I guess that's what DLC is for. I eagerly await the expansions.Great game Devs.-DNChaos.			"

												I picked up Endless Legend during a Steam Sale around the same time as Sid Meier's Beyond Earth, without expecting very much. Unfortunately, Beyond Earth was a bit of a letdown and I grew bored of it within a few days, deciding to give Endless Legend a try, and discovered a truly great 4X game.Endless Legend takes a lot of familiar 4X concepts, adds a few new and interesting features, and polishes the whole package beautifully. Some of the more unique features are;*Heroes & Quests - Your leaders are powerful combat units themselves (or alternately can become strong governers for your cities), and you can level them up with unique skill trees, and equip them with items to specialise them in certain ways.*Upgradable/Customised Units - In much the same way that your Heroes can acquire gear, so too do all your standard units. Each faction only gets a handful of different units throughout the game, but because of the way you can customise them, it never feels like there is a lack of choice.*Factions - In Endless Legend, the different factions play extremely differently. From a tribe who can move their cities around at-will, to one who are limited to only one city, to one whe are utterly incapable of any sort of diplomacy with other factions and is instead in a constant state of war with everyone. Every faction is unique and different, giving the game a lot of replay value compared with others of the genre. If this wasnt enough, you can create your own custom faction, loading it out with unique perks and weaknesses.Endless Legend is a gem of a game in a pretty fiercely contested genre. It combines the core elements of successful franchises such as Civ, and integrates its own features and additions. Well worth getting for any fan of the genre.			"

												One of the best 4x's in recent years. If you like turn based strategy at all then you ower it to yourself to get this. Has everything the you could possibly want out of a 4x delivered in spades in spectacular fashion. The only thing slightly lacking is tehcnology depth but the balance with what they do have is perfect. If there were 1-2 more in each Age then it would make the decisions on what to research before moving on way more difficult. Combat is fantastic and the best out of any 4x game in memory. Only way it could be better is if you ordered directly rather than just ordering movements.			"

But sometimes while outnumbered or with Healing Heroes, I play them manually. "

												Endless Legend is the 3rd game in the Endless series, and as they say, 3rd Time's the Charm!  Though my next words won't really convey that well.This game is unfinished.Everything feels pretty loosely connected (that was the only way I could describe things).  The UI feels weak and seems too small.  Sometimes enemy armies will come out of nowhere and destroy your city in one turn.  These are problems that can be patched out or updated.  (The camera doesn't move to show you important things like enemy movement etc., so you can feel like you're being left in the dark to vitally important things.)  Also, randomly the game will say a huge error has occured, give you a feedback log for you to do nothing with, and then continues running as normal (unless it then decides your next turn will never start, but a quick Save/Reload solves this).However, despite these faults, compared to Beyond Earth, this is the better game.The 9 factions are all fantastic, look wonderful and have great, unique effects, and each one feels very different!  From the Necrophage which are quite literally incapable of learning any form of peaceful diplomacy and feast on the flesh of the living to the Drakken, draconic beings who adore peace and start the game knowing everyone (and everyone knowing them), it's truly wonderful.  You can even make your own factions from scratch!  Of course, in old Endless-4X style, you can customise your armies with equipment that improves over the course of the game (making your units take longer to produce to compensate), it all balances out very well.  Minor Factions you can assimilate into your army also make for important choices on which lands you take and which places you destroy, for each grants you a passive bonus along with a new unit for you to make (and considering each army can only make 3 different military units, this is vitally important).This game is good, you should buy it, but it does have some rough edges, but nothing you can't fix or get over.  Get ready to learn a lot of new stuff and have plenty of fun!			"

												Endless Legend is a lot of fun, but I definitely don't recommend it for folks who are new to 4x games. I feel bad drawing such a blunt comparison, but Endless Legend is basically like Civ 5 if Civ were set in a fantasy-themed universe rather than the ""real"" world. While I am truly in love with EL's music, art, and lore, the actual game mechanics it can be a bit tiresome and over-complicated; especially when you are new to the game. Even though I enjoyed my time with EL, it's not really a game that I return to often, and things feel a bit...empty, particularly in late-game. Still, though, I recommend this game. It's a bold departure from the themes a lot of 4x games try to use and it's a good continuation of the Endless franchise/story. And it's definitely a lot of fun to play in multiplayer mode! Having a friend or three with you for the ride makes this game a lot more enjoyable. (As opposed to Civ, where I find the addition of other players to generally be cumbersome)			"

								Excellent product for an Early Access.  Despite a few missing features it plays like a finished product.  Players will have to get used to the concept of not having as direct control over their troops in combat, but this actually helps the game flow as it means you aren't so afraid to use Autocombat since the results will be close to what you could have managed manually, which keeps the game moving fast.Research moves at an excellent pace and the story quests behind each faction remain interesting.  Games play fairly fast but replayability is fine.All in all, an excellent purchase that I'm glad to have done, continuing the fine examples the Studio has already released.			"

								There are a lot of people on the fence of buying 'Early Access' games. They fear it could be a wasted investment, money thrown down in the toliet because the Company went bust, or the game lost interest. This is not a game you should fear. Endless Legends while in it's pre-alpha stage still has the ability to be fun, interesting, and challenging. Pros: Beautiful Graphics, Fantastic Combat System (Even in Alpha, remember, still more to come!)Minor Factions. Note: These can either be your best friends, or your worst enemies.Diplomacy.Cons: Research System - This is really my main concern. The research system is mostly a 'point and wait', For example, I can select any Era I research, and I can select others and they get tasked. Meaning, just click away, and wait for research to be done. This MAY just be A early access thing. So, again. Hold your horses and wait.Like it says here, on Steam, and you even have to ACKNOWLEDGE when you first play the game:IT'S A EARLY ACCESS GAME. You're paying for it, so you can play now, and help the Developers make the game.Yes, this means bugs. Yes, this means crashing, Yes, this means you can't play with your friends just yet. But this game is worth the hassle.Got all my Towns burned, my Hero was slain, the mighty Broken Lord's empire fell silent with a swift blow.11/10. Would play again.  "

												often overlooked because it seems to be a civ knock-off, but actually contains so much more content than civ games do. the way the map is designed could be improved, but overall very fun, every faction has its own unique gameplay and each dlc is worth it. The art style is probs my favorite thing about it and it amazes me that the devs are still pouring in their time to support the game even making new dlcs and stuff.			"

												Endless Legend took me by surprise. I have been a huge Civilization 5 player, with 263 hours on file at the moment, and my heart had always belonged with that game. I recently found interest in Endless Legend and purchased it and I think its a game that every fan of the 4x genre should play or at least look into. Pros:1. Beautiful, intriguing world. Tons of inventive lore infused throughout the game.2. Emphasis on effective empire management. City-building, economy balancing, and researching the tech-circles are really fun. There is also a great emphasis on resource management, each worker you unlock can be placed in different points of emphasis for more resource gain. If you are play a science victory you may want more workers placed in science production to research quickly. If you are playing a supremacy race you may be more interested in placing your workers in industry so you can build units/city expansions quicker, etc...3. Combat is done nicely. You can choose to tactically face your opponent in a way that sort of reminds me of Heroes of Might and Magic. It is turn-based and there may be some strategy. If you don't like that you can choose to spectate and watch the computer make your moves for you or you can just auto-resolve and move on. If you auto-resolve or spectate, you can choose for the computer to be aggressive or passive as well. You can also upgrade units with new weapons that you can craft through the research tree, or find in quests.4. Different factions that actually play quite differently. Some factions just simply cannot do certain things. Such as the necrophage, they can't create peace treaties. They are simply a faction that is meant to kill everything. Playing as the necrophage you may want to push all your workers into industry in order to build your improvements/milita quicker. Playing as the ardent mages you may want to move your workers into science production so that you can rush through the research tree and race to a science victory. There is even a faction that relies solely upon Dust (the games gold currency).4. Some innovative features that haven't been seen in 4x genre. For example: race-specific quest lines that actually serve as a unique victory condition, seasonal effects (summer/winter), the concept of regions limiting city placement, reinforcements, how heroes are handled (as generals or governors), etc., etc.5. The seasonal affects may actually impact some factions play. I know that whenever I enter the winter my production slows greatly. I end up losing roughly 60 gold per turn and most of the units can only move 1 space or so. 6. You can assimilate with minor factions and build/upgrade their units once you acquire them. They also have bonuses that they will provide to your city once you control them.7. The artstyle is very intriguing.8. It isn't like other 4x titles. In fact it does a very good job at seperating itself from other 4x titles (civ 5, age of wonders, etc..)9. You can create your own factions with all the different perks and army units that are provided in the base game. So if you don't like the factions that are in the game you can customize your own from the bottom up.Cons:1. A.I. is kind of bad with certain factions. With the Drakken they are really strong but with some of the other factions they act kind of stupid. This is the game's greatest downfall. But with the modding community helping this out and patches still being worked on (i think) this will come to an end hopefully.2. It would be cool if there were more factions. I'm sure there are other factions you can download through mods but it would've been cool to see more than just 9 factions in the base game.3. To some this is a con: The game is not as easily learned as something like Civ 5. Each turn you have to remember where your units were, you have to remember which direction they were heading, and what they were doing. There is more micromanaging in this game with emphasis on what workers produce which things. There are some things you may even have to wiki as well. There is a lot of things you will just learn the more you play considering the game doesn't really hold your hand at all. Even the tutorial is very basic and doesn't quite go over everything you will face in the game itself.Summary:When i play this game i instantly compare this game to an RPG. There are very many RPG like elements that are fused with the 4x style and this game does it VERY well. The artstyle is very unique and the way it plays is somewhat similar to what HeroScape was like back in the day. In my opinion it is more smooth that Civ 5 and there is more thought that is required within each turn. There aren't many situtations where you will just sit there and continuously hit the end-turn button. There is always a goal in each turn whether it is working towards the factions quests, trying to parley and assimilate with a minor faction, or expand. Yes, the AI needs improvement, but overall I think this is a great game. I wouldn't even say that the AIs mistakes are as noticeable as some of the other strategy games that exist. Playing on higher difficulties even create a loss more often than not so I think that creates a nice challenge sometimes.			"

												a little on the easy side, they are currently refurbishing the diplomacy system, and will change the battle AI (which is kinda dumb at the moment).Best fantasy 4x 2014, I see myself wasting a lot of time in it.Every race feels and play different to some extent-necrophages are really slowed down by not fighting-broken lords don't use food, only money-wild walkers are the most standard-vaulters can teleport from city to city (awesoooome)-cultists can only have one city (super tricky early game, but at least you don't have to strech your defenses, right?)-roving clans can move their city, oh and also prevent people to trade. they rely a lot on munay-drakens are solid, but are really focused on diplomacy (good for mp i'd say, not my taste)-haven't tested the ardent mages yet, but god DAMN their unit hit super hard-mezari are just a reskin of the vaulters at the moment, we're all waiting for a change in their gameplay and main questsQUESTS. ARE. AWESOME!some are fetch quests, granted, but no quest is pointless, some just give you disapointing rewards.Graphics are super cute, units feel all differents. lots of min-maxing and micro-management			"

												One of my favorite 4x games. I actually prefer this game over the Civ games (Civ 6 not included, yet). The game is visually and mechanically appealing. Each faction plays very differently, meaning that you can experience the game in a variety of ways. You're bound to find something that suits your playstyle. With each of the basic victory conditions covered by an existing faction, there's still some other options. You've got a faction for espionage and a ""one-city"" faction to play as. If the game has a weakness, it's that the Diplomacy feels hollow. While, I do like the diplomatic currency idea, you're basically interacting with a spreadsheet.			"

												Endless Legend is a 4x turnbased strategy game with that plays similar to civ5. Just because it plays like the basics of civ5 mean it is civ5, there is in my opinion many more things that this game has then civ5 does. Each faction is totaly unique and plays completly different then the others, they each have their own lore and each unit looks and acts different from another. Each faction has 4 unique units that have different strengths and weaknesses. Also players start with a ""hero"" which is basically a general from civ5 but that does way more then adding a buff to a unit. There are tons of heros from each faction and each one looks different(heros from same faction has small differences but have different uses) and plays differnetly, one may be used for leading a army by giving it +2 damage while one could be used to govern and town and give it +6 industry. Also every unit can be customized with different equipment to make them stronger as the game goes by, this is simmilar to civ but instead of the unit become a differnet teir(as a musketer becomes and rifleman) the units in this game stay the same except their equipment changes and you can see the difference in appearance do to this change. Also like civ5 there is small factions that are ran by ai, you can add these to your empire by either attacking and defeating them, bribing them, or by completeing quests given by them. Once they join you then you can assimilate them into your empire and then produce their unit that can only be used by assimilating them. The unit is based off that small faction and its appearance is completely differnet to any of the playable factions, there are lots of these small factions that can be conquered by the player. I recomend this game to anyone that loves the Civ games, fantasy or just 4x turnbased strategy game in general.			"

												My very first 4X game, Endless Legend grabbed my attention above Civ V and Beyond Earth by forgoing a real life setting in favor of a fantasy one. In that regard, EL surprassed my initial expectations. The world of Auriga is fleshed out,  rich with lore. and full of curious races and factions to cross.Each of the playable factions contain a seperate story campaign to accomplish, and each play quite differently. Your playthrough with the peacful and democractic Drakken will prove very different from your playthrough with the aggressive Necrophages.Gameplay in EL is saturated, but not to a fault (I'm still learning after all!). There's a decent tutorial, but to really sink your teeth into it you'll need to sit down for a campaign. Fortunately there's plenty of ways to personalize a campaign's difficulty and world. Unfortunately, it can become a chore to learn, as there's an abundance of sciences and unit customization. Some unit passives and build paths can be poorly explained, and it'll take some digging on your part to really understand how you should be playing a faction to its potential.Fortunately there's plenty of guides available. The online experience varies, but the community's proven friendly and helpful through many of my matches.If you've ever been curious to try a 4x strategy game, and are prepared to sink in the time to learn, Endless Legend's distinguished high fantasy setting, easy to grasp mechanics, and variety of campaigns/playstyles will keep you engaged for a long while. Easily worth it while on sale, still a good buy without, this'll eat up dozens of hours before you've experienced all it has to offer.			"

												Quite honestly I was on the fence on whether or not to make the purchase on this game.  The screenshots and overall favorable reviews is what sold it to me.  I'm a huge fan of the 4x strategy games and with that being said, I was NOT disappionted in the slightest way with Endless Legend.Some of the pros with this game include the graphics.  Great graphics, especially when compared to games like Civ and Fallen Enchantress.  The units and factions are also completely fresh.   There are your typical archers and melee units which are both essential to any 4x game but take my word for it, a lot of units are at least slightly different and most are really cool (Especially on your first few play throughs when you first encounter them).  Another pro for me is the added involvement regarding the city building aspect of the game.  Each time your city gains population you gain a ""Worker"" that you can place in specific parts of the building/production within your cities.  If you need buildings or units produced more quickly put more of your ""Workers"" in the production.  Technologies not getting researched fast enough place them into the science slot etc.  With this being said, the game isn't without it's downfalls (In my opinion).  I prefer to have more control over my units during combat.  I would rather control each unit for each move.  This isn't the case in Endless Legend.  When your units are involved in a a battle you basically follow the certain steps.  First off, the battle map is basically a zoomed in portion of the current location of the map that unit is currently on (This for me is actually a plus and definitely a welcomed change).  However, the battle sequence leaves a bit to be desired.  To start you basically have to place your units.  Then you select what you want them to do whether it be to attack a specific unit or if you have a healing unit etc. you decide who you want them heal etc.  The battle then ensues until the next turn where you have the option to change your strategies and the battle sequence proceeds as previously mentioned.  Some may prefer this method as it is simplified but I prefer battle sequences like Age of Wonders 3.The modifications also leave a little to be desired for me as well.  Personally I love that fact in Fallen Enchantress where you can outfit your heroes with anything and it shows on the character, not only on the character screen but when you see them in the world too.  With Endless Legends this portion is true in regards to the weapon and Shield only.  Any new armor etc can be equipped but you will not see them.Overall I do recommend the game and it has kept me busy for about 16hrs since purchase and I'll be busy for many more hours because of the differences it offers to the genre.  It is fun and when I want a slight change in units/factions/city buidling I'll be starting this one up!			"

												Great game with great mechanics. I was a bit unhappy at first when I learned each race only had three race-specific units, but the customization of units and minor faction units more than makes up for the lack of diverse race-specific modeling.The game does a great job of keeping development and technology moving forward, while maintaining a medieval, fantasy world.All in all, if you're tired of Civ V, and disappointed in Warlock, this just might be for you.

												I've sunk many hours into this game ever since I had to take a few days off after getting sick. I've played through several full games as the different factions and found that each of them is very unique. I'd say that this is the biggest thing that the game has over Civilization V. If you're at all interested I recommend you read up on each of these because it would take too long to explain here. The other two big differences are a quest and combat systems. Unlike Civ5's city state quests, they don't involve racing other factions or killing another city state(there are none). They're a bit more interesting and present some semblance of a story for each of the factions. Of course, there's not much depth to be expected of quests in a 4X game, but they do make the game a bit more interesting. The combat system, on the other hand, isn't very good and is kind of tedious, especially because of the slow animations. So I wouldn't recommend picking this game up just becasuse you like turn-based combat. But still, it's there and does add SOME depth to combat which would otherwise just be RNG-based. I recommend this game, but I'm also not sure if it feels done yet. I've been playing on the 'Hard' difficulty and I've found that diplomacy and other AI behaviors are a bit irrational. I hope this is something that will be addressed in a future patch. I expect it to be.			"

												I didn't know that i like 4x games until i played Endless Legend. This game doses 3 things really well. 1. Gameplay and Factions. There are 8 different factions in this game. Each faction plays different than the others. For example there is a faction that can not make peace with others ever. Or there is a factionthat gets a cut off of the market, because it controlls the market (lorewise). 2. Lore and GameplayWhat leads me to my second point. The gameplay is connected to the lore of the game. The lore itsself is very rich and for fans it is also connected to the other Endless games, likeEndless Space and Dungeon of Endless. 3. Gameplay mechanicsIts interface and game design is simple and complex at the same time. But it is simple enough to be able to learn the complex stuff as you play the game over and over. I never got into CiV 5. I just didn't get it. Now that i played Endless Legend i finally know what these 4x games are all about. That game got to be my game of the year 2014 period.			"

												Amplitude Studios is on a roll with this and Dungeon of the Endless. Endless Legend really sucked me in whereas I bounced off of Civ 5 and Endless Space for the most part. With EL they've made the world really come to life. Their use of faction quests, writing, and lore is brilliant in the way it marries a traditional campaign mode with your standard random map skirmish mode. The combat is one of the better approaches for 4x games - just enough player input and control to make it interesting and it never drags so much that you feel like auto-skipping all of it by mid to late game. There's also lots of RPG elements in levelling up and perking up your heros and kitting out your troops with advanced weaponry, items, armour, etc. Tons of customization options.The factions themselves all have their own unique story and playstyle - some of them, like the Cultists and Roving Clans play radically different than most 4x factions. The economy and tech tree and city management has huge depth. Tons of strategic possibilities and paths to victory. It is a bit of a slow burn but the music and artstyle and UI all make it a place you don't mind losing hours to.			"

												This game is pretty great yo. If you've played Civilization and think ""damn if only there were games like this but with beautiful art, highly varied factions, engrossing stories, hero units, meaningful resource management and (apart from a few exceptions) balanced and non-buggy multiplayer then pick this one up. Hell, pick it up anyway.			"

												Played Civ since Civ 1. Countless 1000's of hours throughtout the series. I will say that with a strong AI (and not just ""cheat buffs""), a bit more techs, and maybe some minor UI touch ups this game would surpass Civ.I would call Civ V with all DLC and some mods the gold standard of 4X. 10/10As it stand right now I would give this game a 9/10.

												This game lives up to my own expectation. As a ""hesitant"" buyer of games I always take my time and generally come in late when it comes to actually purchasing.I've followed a number of gameplay video's and read many of the reviews. Thankfully I managed to get this on special!It's worth every cent, even at full price - which is a really reasonable price for what you're getting.The game is in-depth, with many different facets and the strategy behind all areas are really good.Also, where else can you design your own individual units with different armour, items and other rpg-ish elements to use inside a fantasy based grand strategy simulation, and create an empire to dwarf all others.10/10.

												As  a long time Civ player, i was looking for a new 4X to scratch my itch after the somewhat lackluster Civ: Beyond Earth. Endless Legend is a whole other beast from Civ. So while they are botrh 4X, do not buy thinking it'll just be a fantasy Civ game. That being said, it is an extremely satisfying game, with a complexity that i feel is much deeper than most recent Civ games. From the variety in the factions playstyle, to the absolutely beautiful graphics, the game hits on most points in a unique style not seen in any 4X games.It does have it's flaws such as the heroes who seem similar across the board, to the lackluster AI. The AI is forgiveable due to most 4X games lacking a challenging AI. The Heroes will be addressed at some point as well i'm sure as the devs, seem to always be tinkering with little bits here and there.Overall a very enjoyable experience, and IMO the 4X release of the year. If 4X is your type of game, Endless Legend is worth your time to get to know. Learning curve is steep but worth it.			"

												It's called endless legend, but ends at 300 turns. xDI really want to love this game.  I love playing it.  There are just so many bugs.  If it's not your army getting stuck , it's the round getting glitched out.  After 300 turns it crashes every 3-4 turns.  It would be nice to play once it works better.  I'll check it out again in a few months.  It's utterally un-playable in its current state.The non-stop winter after 300 turns is annoying as well.Wish there was a maybe on the recommend button.Example.The crash report folder names ""2015-1-10_122026"" net to game excutable.The crash report folder names ""2015-1-10_122720"" net to game excutable.The crash report folder names ""2015-1-10_124734"" net to game excutable.The crash report folder names ""2015-1-10_125312"" net to game excutable.

The unit count is a bit on the short side (4 different units per faction) but the storyline and depth more than make up for this.			"

												Not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't exactly it (more ""meh"" than ""positive"" review)... The visuals are probably gorgeous (which would be one of the major selling points), however, my computer isn't built to handle this at its finest; that being said it does run smoothly on the lowest quality filter and still looks pretty. The city building aspect of this game is simple, but effective. What killed this game for me is the combat... it just plays so clunkily. You tell a unit to hold position and then they run two spaces away into range of the enemy, but not into their own range? I don't really understand anything except that I can't control my units how I want to and it's cost me more than a few victories in my limited play time. That and there's no way to disengage from a battle, so if you happen to click on an enemy party that displays 2 units and they have 12 units of reinforcements, you can't back down. Good luck surviving six turns of reinforcements. The units and mini-factions are even more diverse and unique than the major factions; I would argue that the strongest selling point of this game is the ability to experiment with so many different unit (through various faction assimilations) combinations. However, the individual major factions, to make up for all this diversity, really only give you three units each, which is a bit disappointing. The heroes for each major faction (thankfully you can recruit outside your faction) are essentially all the same, too... also disappointing. It's worth dinking around with if you're a big RTS fan, but nothing every gamer must own. Game plays a little too slowly for me, even for an RTS. It's probably gorgeous, if graphics attract you, but the combat is awful and hard to control. Oh, and the clicking in this game drives you bonkers after awhile. Have to click on things four to five times occasionally to select it.EDIT: There is a retreat button, but it only seems to appear if you have a distinct unit advantage... at least, that's the only time I've seen it. Also, the soundtrack is pretty, but gets repetitive quickly.			"

												This and Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes are the fantasy 4x games of my dreams. FE:LH is both easier to get into and deeper, but also far more random and easier to break. EL has some strange city development ideas that I don't agree with (burroughs and their use of a city ""level up"" mechanic are a bad idea, I said it) but once you learn it you can work around it. Aside from that, you have hero units, you can assign them to a town or an army, they and their armies can level up.A first word of warning: build burroughs OFTEN. And EARLY. Yes burroughs reduce the happiness of your people by 10 for each built in a city, but they also increase your yield of Food, Industry, Dust, Science, and maybe Influence, in a way that is often more useful and tangible than real buildings early on. Always make sure your city is at happy or better as there are severe economic drawbacks to having people at content or lower. Whether or not you decide to stretch your burroughs to reach for a tile with the FIDSI you're looking for, or to use attached ""districts"" to ""level up"" whatever they are attached to is usually a game of ""how much happiness can I afford to lose?"" which early game, is not much.Often I would hover over something and see something in the tooltip that popped up that I wanted to know more about, but couldn't. There's an item that gives guardians less of a cooldown on their skills, but it calls it ""army action cooldown"" instead. One of your opponents will suddenly light up some dust towers in the world and you're told they're getting close to some kind of victory, but no clue is given to the player as to how to stop or prevent their winning, nor what victory condition it is. There's no preview for you to see which unit might be able to do what amount of damage to what other unit when moving or placing them on the battlefield, but it's all there clear as day during the actual attack. What does leveling up units actually do? How do I tell what the next unit level up will give that unit? There's a lot of information missing in this game that would make it easier to play.Also forget the sick nidya quest, it is the worst one in the game, no matter when you encounter it; too many steps for a too-often bad reward, usually a technology you would have researched in 3 turns anyway. What a waste of time.All that said, I do like this game. It's not finished yet, and time will tell if they ever do, but I would definitely recommend it to those who don't need/want to know all the information required to play this on a very challenging setting without a near-obsessive amount of inside baseball knowledge that the game never tells you.I'm still having fun with it as of this review.EDIT: 8 months later, still enjoying it, and updating my review for this purpose. I don't know what the problems all the other people are having are about, nor do I care. I play this game single player, with mods, and custom factions. I have never had any interest in playing a turn-based 4x game with other players. Aside from the recently introduced utterly broken diplomacy, it's still the same beautiful game it always was, for better or worse depending on how you look at it.			"

												Do you like CIV games, but it feels like every faction is the same?Do you want to play a faction that all has different play styles, but can bassicly do what other empires can, and still stay original?Do you want to create your Very own faction, with the buffs of the pre-made faction you like, but want to give it diffrent proprerties?Then look no further, cause this game is amazing, even with its flaws.Endless legend is probably one of the best CIV type games out there, bringing more Originality to the game, Then Sid Meyers´s games self.every faction has their own strengths, and weaknesses.For example: the roving clans can build a city, and then move it where ever they want, and have full control over the market place, but they cant start a war.The necrophages have one of the strongest units in the game, and get food for their kingdom from killing armies, but can´t have peace with anyone (unless its the drakken who can force peace).like any CIV game, this game has a big science tree, but every kingdom has ENTIRE diffrent science treesunlike in Civilization, in wich case every one has the same science tree.Every faction ( even the minor factions) have unique units, and perks wich you can get, via customization, or by conquring minor factions, wich give you even more unique units.This game is also alot more easyer then other civ games, giving you a hero who is really powerfull, and has GREATLY increased stats and buffs, and also can´t be permanantly killed, and every landscape specialty, like whine, salt, spices, are all easy to understand.it´s a really easy game to get started in, when you want to try a CIV game for the first time ever.However this game does has its flaws, but they are minor flaws, and more nidpicksFor startrers Late game Can get REALLY boring sometimes, but thats with every CIV game kinda.When you win at a game you just get a picture of the faction you where playing as, with the background being the goal you got.And some of the technologies are MANDOTORY, if you want to expand your kingdom (but then again, it would be too easy to get an expansion victory that way).But that are the only problems i can think of (even though i dont play the game too much, and i am not the best at civ games, other then destroying everything i see)Its a great game, and the DLC, altough a bit Expansive, they add quite alot.The guardians DLC adds giants to the game wich are like SUPER units, and buildings wich give HUGE BUFFS to science, production, ETC.And the shadows DLC adds a new faction, PLUS the new spying system, to steal someones reasearches.I know i might have been praising this game a bit too much, i just HAVE to reccomand this game.Its fun, easy to learn, and also very interesting.But just wait when it goes on sale first, or wait for a free weekend to try it maybe.

												For TLDR: Great game. Better than Civ. Buy.Let's start with the most important thing, the gameplay. For me, the features in this game are a lot more interesting than Civ. The factions are all so different, in a good way, each with their own completely different positives and negatives. Also, as of writing this review I have about 50 hours of game time and there are still cool little features that I am picking up along the way thanks to how different all the factions are. As a result of this, I feel like I am still playing a brand new game.The game is smooth. I have an average build PC and I have never yet experienced lag or crashing, which I had to deal with on a regular basis with Civ. I play multiplayer a lot with friends, and yes the turns slow down as the game gets longer, but not by a huge amount.Graphics are great, the lore is brilliant for anyone who is into it, but you can also ignore the lore completely if you choose to do so, you are not forced either way and it won't affect your gameplay. --------------------------------There are a few small negatives. Not enough to give the game a bad review, but things that could be improved on.The tutorial is usless and a complete waste of time. I tried to learn aspects of the game using it but the amount of features is so overwhelming and not explained well in the tutorial. I jumped straight into a game with a friend and learned the hard (but more fun) way.The AI can be really good or really bad. Sometimes they perform an attack at a certain time or in a certain area (for example a faction that gets boost from forest specifically using a forested route to attack me, or settling their cities in forested areas) but then the AI can also be really dumb, mainly when it comes to researching techs. I keep seeing science tech factions not even bothering to researched the Age 1 science techs, or the economy based factions not even researching trade routes. Needs to be sorted.--------------------------Overall, I would recommend the game as it is. The current price is 30 pound which is worth it. If it goes on sale I would definitely buy it. However improve AI please.8.5/10			"

												I picked up Endless Legend during a Steam Sale around the same time as Sid Meier's Beyond Earth, without expecting very much. Unfortunately, Beyond Earth was a bit of a letdown and I grew bored of it within a few days, deciding to give Endless Legend a try, and discovered a truly great 4X game.Endless Legend takes a lot of familiar 4X concepts, adds a few new and interesting features, and polishes the whole package beautifully. Some of the more unique features are;*Heroes & Quests - Your leaders are powerful combat units themselves (or alternately can become strong governers for your cities), and you can level them up with unique skill trees, and equip them with items to specialise them in certain ways.*Upgradable/Customised Units - In much the same way that your Heroes can acquire gear, so too do all your standard units. Each faction only gets a handful of different units throughout the game, but because of the way you can customise them, it never feels like there is a lack of choice.*Factions - In Endless Legend, the different factions play extremely differently. From a tribe who can move their cities around at-will, to one who are limited to only one city, to one whe are utterly incapable of any sort of diplomacy with other factions and is instead in a constant state of war with everyone. Every faction is unique and different, giving the game a lot of replay value compared with others of the genre. If this wasnt enough, you can create your own custom faction, loading it out with unique perks and weaknesses.Endless Legend is a gem of a game in a pretty fiercely contested genre. It combines the core elements of successful franchises such as Civ, and integrates its own features and additions. Well worth getting for any fan of the genre.			"

												This is probably my favorite turn based strategy I've ever played.  Its not usually my favorite genre though I do like Heroes of Might & Magic well enough.  And of course, Civ 5.  Endless Legend feels like it takes the best ideas of those and then makes it way more aggressive.  On top of that it has a great mix of science fiction and fantasy ideas all mixed together.  You want an Alien™ that functions as a cleric?  This game delivers.  Orcs cosplaying as Warcraft trolls with tusks and everything?  Indeed.  Violent tree-huggers who wanna art you to death?  Indubitably.			"

												This game is much more interesting than Civilizations Beyond earth and also deserves a lot more attention.I managed to think of 14 positives, 1 neutral and 6 negatives.The Positive:+ Eight different races that are really completely different and also feel different. They also have different styles to obtain victory+ The possibility to make custom races based on pre-existing ones.+ Every race has their own, interesting storyline.+ More victory types than in Civilizations V+ Beautiful graphics style+ Amazing music with a unique sound to it+ The pace of the game is quicker than in Civilization. You do not have to wait for ages (literally) for just a monument to be built.+ Immersive fantasy-world + Unit customization+ The game has in-game quests that grant you rewards upon completing them. Also, each faction itself has its own main quest and they are really rewarding since the benefits they give you can be quite large.+ The combat system is interesting and actually challenging and although it may feel you have little influence at first, there is really a lot you can do to influence it. It is more like telling your units what to do instead of controlling them perfectly.  + Made by a developer that continues to add new content. For free. Yes. Here, you do not have to buy a ton of silly downloadable content or expansions to make the game more fun. *Winks to Firaxis*+ Good city building style and management+ Conquered cities do not lose 75% of the existing buildings like in Civilizations, the same with population. Because of this a conquered city still has value. Also the cities that are founded later in the game are not necessarily behind in the development, because you can buy buildings from the early game for a relatively low price and so the new city can quickly go to the same level of  your older cities. -+ Science. It is interesting and also non-linear. But it feels a little weird for me. Also, most researches are often focused on just one type of advantage. So, things that purely give you more food, or more Dust (= money), or purely militairy things.Some negative:- May be overwhelming in the beginning. Because it can be a little complicated and the game itself provides few explanations.- The game can get a little laggy near the end of the game. Especially when the winter comes. - If you compare waging wars in this game to waging wars in Civilization V, then I must say that in Civilization V it was better. Because an army was not a single entity like in this game. There was also nothing more satisfying than rolling several catapults supported by a ton of swordsmen and archers up to an enemy's city and than bombarding the hell out of it. It was rather satisfying. Although sieges in Endless Legend are also good (and I like the idea with units being granted extra health points for defending in a siege) it is simply less exhilerating.- In continuation of the above. War music. Declaring war on someone and then getting to hear adrenaline-filled songs may be one of the reasons why I always ended up being called the ''warmongering menace'' in Civ V, unfortunately these war/peace themes are not as present as in Endless Legend or do not exist.- Small variety of units- No naval combat. The seas are not used for anything more than transporting troops.I cannot think of more negatives.In short, I would say that this game is rather innovative and beats Civ Beyond earth any day in the history of mankind, or the future for that matter.Too long; did not read: simply buy this game.

												What can I say, this game is all I was looking for in a 4X game: Amazing theme - Fantasy Sci-Fi Great graphics & sound Complex, but not overwhelming Interesting and innovative mechanics - different to other standard 4X games Factions actually feel unique and have different fundamental concepts It's funNow I'm just gonna throw this out there right now, I'm not at all a 4X player. I barely play strategy games. I had a strategy itch so I played this and Age of Wonders 3, and I prefer this to be very honest. It's just a more rounded experience. AoW3 seems to be heavily focused on the combat, and a barely on the empire building aspect. Just two very different games.What can I say, it's good. Watch some videos if you are not convinced.

												This games is what happens with Civilization has a baby with Fallen Enchantress.  One of those lovingly created created 4x games that mixes armies/heroes, sane research/city systems, and a dangerous living world that you must balance both living in and bending it to your will.As nothing in the game is deep, and this makes the games pieces fit better together.  Fighting, faction/city/hero management, and diplomacy are streamlined, which makes it a better game for strategists rather than micro managers.  Going into games, players need to realize that it is impossible to be the best at everything.

												Clean interface, interesting mechanics, and unique setting for this highly innovative Civ-style strategy game.  Tactical combat has many interesting elements (elevation, morale, terrain bonuses) and the city building is the most fun I've had in this kind of game in a long time.  Luxury and strategic resources are handled very well and the balance of power between tall/wide empires is quite well done.  Setting is a very unique blend of Fantasy/Sci-Fi magi-tech where lost technology is essentially a form of 'magic'.			"

												Endless Legend is a 4x turnbased strategy game with that plays similar to civ5. Just because it plays like the basics of civ5 mean it is civ5, there is in my opinion many more things that this game has then civ5 does. Each faction is totaly unique and plays completly different then the others, they each have their own lore and each unit looks and acts different from another. Each faction has 4 unique units that have different strengths and weaknesses. Also players start with a ""hero"" which is basically a general from civ5 but that does way more then adding a buff to a unit. There are tons of heros from each faction and each one looks different(heros from same faction has small differences but have different uses) and plays differnetly, one may be used for leading a army by giving it +2 damage while one could be used to govern and town and give it +6 industry. Also every unit can be customized with different equipment to make them stronger as the game goes by, this is simmilar to civ but instead of the unit become a differnet teir(as a musketer becomes and rifleman) the units in this game stay the same except their equipment changes and you can see the difference in appearance do to this change. Also like civ5 there is small factions that are ran by ai, you can add these to your empire by either attacking and defeating them, bribing them, or by completeing quests given by them. Once they join you then you can assimilate them into your empire and then produce their unit that can only be used by assimilating them. The unit is based off that small faction and its appearance is completely differnet to any of the playable factions, there are lots of these small factions that can be conquered by the player. I recomend this game to anyone that loves the Civ games, fantasy or just 4x turnbased strategy game in general.			"

												It is always a treat to come across a rare gem like Endless Legend. I applaud the persons responsible for this game. It's a interesting mix of Endless Space, Age of Wonders III and Civilization rolled into one, while managing to find it's own niche and not simply be a clone of any of it's predecessors. They call it 4X strategy, but I believe that title doesn't do it justice, as, again it feels to me more like a hybrid who's creators learned the lessons they needed to learn and built on them.Bit of a learning curve, but if you enjoy the type of game, you'll pick it up quick enough.

												One of my favorite 4x games. I actually prefer this game over the Civ games (Civ 6 not included, yet). The game is visually and mechanically appealing. Each faction plays very differently, meaning that you can experience the game in a variety of ways. You're bound to find something that suits your playstyle. With each of the basic victory conditions covered by an existing faction, there's still some other options. You've got a faction for espionage and a ""one-city"" faction to play as. If the game has a weakness, it's that the Diplomacy feels hollow. While, I do like the diplomatic currency idea, you're basically interacting with a spreadsheet.			"

												About a year ago I bought Civ 5 and fell in love with the game. I found myself playing all the time and seeming to never get bored with it. Eventually though I managed to play it into the ground and had to set it aside. Beyond Earth did not evoke the same feelings that Civ 5 did and I have stayed away from the whole genre until now. Let me say this: Endless Legend looks like what I had always hoped the successor of Civ 5 would look like. If you took Civ 5 and expanded on and improved every aspect you would get something very much like this game. The world is beautiful, the combat is tactical and far more dynamic than civ because of fully customizable units, the different factions are actually DIFFERENT with their own units and distinct playstyles. The only thing that is a little disappointing to me is the lack of noticable difference in gameplay as you advance through the tech trees. Your economy gets much stronger and unit stats go up but you are still using the same units, whereas in civ you go all the way from crude stoneage weapons to a modern military with an airforce and nuclear weapons. I suppose that is the result of having a game take place in a fantasy universe. That aside, however, the game is very fun and any fan of the civ series shouldn't think twice about buying it.			"

												My very first 4X game, Endless Legend grabbed my attention above Civ V and Beyond Earth by forgoing a real life setting in favor of a fantasy one. In that regard, EL surprassed my initial expectations. The world of Auriga is fleshed out,  rich with lore. and full of curious races and factions to cross.Each of the playable factions contain a seperate story campaign to accomplish, and each play quite differently. Your playthrough with the peacful and democractic Drakken will prove very different from your playthrough with the aggressive Necrophages.Gameplay in EL is saturated, but not to a fault (I'm still learning after all!). There's a decent tutorial, but to really sink your teeth into it you'll need to sit down for a campaign. Fortunately there's plenty of ways to personalize a campaign's difficulty and world. Unfortunately, it can become a chore to learn, as there's an abundance of sciences and unit customization. Some unit passives and build paths can be poorly explained, and it'll take some digging on your part to really understand how you should be playing a faction to its potential.Fortunately there's plenty of guides available. The online experience varies, but the community's proven friendly and helpful through many of my matches.If you've ever been curious to try a 4x strategy game, and are prepared to sink in the time to learn, Endless Legend's distinguished high fantasy setting, easy to grasp mechanics, and variety of campaigns/playstyles will keep you engaged for a long while. Easily worth it while on sale, still a good buy without, this'll eat up dozens of hours before you've experienced all it has to offer.			"

The closest I've ever gotten was Sins of solar empire, and even that was techinically an RTS. Endless legend however really nails the happy medium for me between incredibly deep/intricate gameplay, and ease of access for newcomers.What's even better are asymmetrical factions. They play completely different from each other, instead of different flavors of the same meal. I won't go into detail about how the factions are different from each other, because there are some many other game review sites that do it better than i can. Just buy the game.

												It's hard to believe that despite having played 55 hours of the game (which is a lot for me, I tend to set games aside at the 25-30 hours mark), I've only tried two of the factions so far. But if you like science-fantasy and Civ-like games, this is a must-play; it sucked me in in a way that Civ 5 didn't. The setting is amazing (I'd love to play this as a tabletop RPG) and most of the factions feel like they have a unique gameplay of their own rather than just having their specialties. My only complaint is the AI opponents who feel a bit week and often make incoherent decisions (Galactic Civilizations II set the bar really high for me; also devs say fine-tuning the AI is high on their priority list for updates), but the game remains deeply engrossing even in single player (and there is a multiplayer mode I haven't tried yet). My opinion is that this is the 4X game to play right now.			"

												Let me explain why I bought this game : I was hoping to do multiplayer matches with friends for Civilization V. As it turns out, CivV grows slow the longer you play, and online connection with friends fails over and over again. That's why I started looking for an alternative.With Endless Legend I've had none of those problems so far. Excellent for multiplayer, never lost any connection, very neat UI, and no slowdown symtoms thus far (and I've put 18+ hours into it already). So far so good.Gameplay itself : the game does play much like CivV (that was a good thing for me, as I was simply looking for something better). It's refreshing to have diverse factions though, some play very differently from others. Supports different kinds of endings, so not just military ones, and I find the trading & diplomacy a lot more natural. Plays a bit faster too, for example, you can send units through tiles twice as fast. The tutorial sadly enough does not cover everything there is to know (so check out city planning online!) but everything is there. Combat is improved compared to CivV : there's either auto-battle (instant fights) or small Age-of-Wonders like sessions. The wonderful thing about it is that these fights occur on the world map itself : if you can reach through the fog of war you can actually see your neighboor doing these little battles, but all battles are executed asynchronously so there's no rapid switching from one to another (which occurs in civV if you enable animated fights during multiplayer). Combat animations are good enough, nothing too fancy, nothing too short. Soundtrack is ok, you get the mp3 files with the game, which is very nice. The graphics are very nice (although I did read somewhere they are out-dated, they are not, in 'fantastic' settings they are very beautiful). Which brings me to the conclusion this game is great, I find it better than CivV or CivBE (which did not improve CivV that much alas) so definately recommended! "

												Genre Fusing DesignBooting up Endless Legend for the first time I knew I was in for something special. I had previously played the 4x Space Civ Simulator, Endless Space, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Both are made by Amplitude Studios and are part of their multiple-game and multiple genre universe spanning series that have been released in rapid succession over the last few years. Endless Space, Endless Legend, and Endless Dungeon, are the three games currently released from Amplitude. All giving their own slightly varied experience. Endless Legend is the most recent iteration of the endless universe. Starting the game up I was surprised to find a very sparse menu. This is something common between all of the Amplitude games. A minimalistic styled menu that gives you little to do but jump right into their game and get started. That's exactly what I was eager to do.What the Endless series also excels at is punishing mistakes. The first few times I played I was decimated by nearly every other civilization in the game. Still though, each time I played I made progress. This is one of my favorite parts about civilization builders. Failing and returning to re-build my civilization stronger and more robust. After about 4 times playing through, I finally conquered the world and won. In total this took about 20 hours just to give you an idea of how long it takes to become proficient. Personally I won by taking the military route after I began falling behind other civilizations in points, however it caused my people endless unhappiness to be ruled by a dictatorial warlord. Still though it was a win even though it wasn't by the conditions I had originally intended. Most of the civilizations have conditions they are better suited to winning with, but every option is always open. The science ""ladder"" you climb while playing brings you into several era as you play. Each era increases the power available to units and the technology but also increases the production requirements of each city. This adds a depth that includes time as a measurable resource that must be managed. After playing Civilization games I have to say that this is a small change but makes a large difference in how quickly you may want to uncover new technologies. This combined with the happiness mechanic makes even advancing in production and technology a balancing act. Destroying facilities and units that require upkeep from previous eras can actually help you in the short run to recover and quickly produce more powerful units. Other regular resources are provided in the same way most are in 4x turn based games. They are however more difficult to balance and utilize properly. Running short on resources is common and so is having to make hard decisions. The biggest draw that I saw in the game was combat, and the turn based mechanics. As far as I could tell, 2 people would take turns at 1 time. Which means you would be moving units at the same time and so there is at least a bit of real-time attention needed as if you are paying little attention to what your units are doing they can be attacked easily. Prioritizing movement over building can save or ruin opportunities. Combat between units is played out simultaneously on your turn between armies in a tiled strategy turn-based format. I know that this type of combat has gotten a lot of flak in reviews as a negative aspect to the game, but I consider it a positive. Consider for a moment that the entire ""default"" game takes place over 300 turns, the combat helps break up the repetition of the turns with something different and stimulating in a different way. Everything Endless Legend does seems fresh even though it utilizes formulas from many previous games. The fusion of turn based civ building and combat works perfectly with the way the game is paced in my opinion. I for one am eagerly awaiting the further release of games in the endless series. I can't wait to see what Amplitude studios comes up with next.You'll like this game if: You like fully fleshed out universes with full stories for each faction that include an over-arcing mission to allow for victory. Highlights include great combat, wonderfully balanced civ building and well integrated mechanics that don't allow for much exploitation. From my blog at: bigdadgamer.blogspot.com "

												I can see myself ending up putting a lot of time into this game. After being disappointed by Civilization: Beyond Earth, I feel like Endless Legend scratches all the itches that Beyond Earth should have. It borrows a lot of the good things from Civilization V, and fixes a lot of the bad things. Combat consists of tactical battles between two armies of multiple units and possible reinforcement from other units in the area. Where Civ 5's combat is cramped and tight, Endless Legend has found a decent compromise between ""one unit per tile"" and the ridiculous stacked armies of Civ IV. At the same time, walls and cliffs between tiles adds more tactical variation to the maps.The world is beautiful. Where Civ:BE all feels a little bland and samey, this game has individual regions which each have their own visually spectacular biome. Also unlike Civ:BE, the factions in Endless Legend all feel distinct and interesting. Leader portraits are animated in this really cool oil painting style. Even the hexes have variance to them, looking like randomized, striking geographical shapes rather than identical hexagonal tiles. This game may not have the greatest graphics of all time, but the excellent art direction and attention to detail more than make up for it. It does seem a little barebones compared to games like Civ in terms of sheer numbers of factions, units, and technologies. In the end though, everything combines to create quite a deep experience. My only real complaints are that a few parts of the user interface are counter-intuitive, and that it can be difficult to find your units in the clutter sometimes. It can be annoying, but I've mostly gotten used to it. I recommend Endless Legend for anybody who enjoyed Civ V. Just play the tutorial and it'll be simple to figure this game out.			"

												Endless legends is a game unlike any I have played before. It begins much in the way a game of civilizaiton would, you place a capital and branch out to new cities through the use of settlers, conquests, bribes, and even an intriguing quest system. If you enjoy games like civilization revolution then you will love this unique twist and style that endless legends brings to the genre.While this game is one of the best games of the genre it does have its draw backs. Throughout my play through I began to notice a few irritating things that I feel are necessary to understand about this game before purchase. My first point would be to say that this game is not one that encourages variety. Every faction has three basic units that are unlocked fairly early on, and then they are allowed to assimilate a few minor factions along the way in order to broaden their unit scope. While this may not seem like a big deal to many people it does put certain factions at a major disadvantage against experienced players. My most recent encounter with this is that the Mezari start the game with ranged units that are able to move and shoot all in the same turn, this allows them to kite early game fights and put almost all other factions into the dirt early game. While this may seem like something that many people see as counterable you have to realize that certain factions such as the drakken and the broken lords have no way of countering a ranged unit as they have no late game ranged units of their own without using a valuable assimilation slot.While this game does have its flaws, it is almost impossible to pass up. Its unique quest system sets it apart from the other titles in this genre, as you now no longer have to build a final building but instead with each faction you are encouraged to follow a specific path that will also allow you win the game. Knowing these paths for each faction you are offered a very interesting way of now denying your allies victory, without having to declare war. We also see the hero system in this game help to further its path to the top of my list of most played games. This game rewards those who use its heroes correctly, offering multiple skill tree paths and roles for heroes. A fully leveled hero in this game could be the difference maker in a battle, as a support hero might be what is needed to keep one militia group alive against multiple titans.I strongly recommend this game to any lovers of the civilization series, it sticks to the basic city building aspect of the civ series, all the while giving a unique spin on the battle system and diplomacy system.

								This game haunts my dreams...Keep in mind that i have played 70+ hours off line (in office,hope i'll not lose my job) and only ONE faction because i simply cannot get them out of my mind...Greatest pros.The world.Its an alien world,one you have not encounter in any other game (except for those who own endless space).The factions are unique,from my favorite lich knights,fighting between honor and,vital for their survival,soul consuming,to the adept mages or ""pain""mages and tech loving vaulters,all factions are more or less unique.The world itself have some very strange ""anomalies"" aka resources and some even more strange neutral tribes,like barbarians in civs,with the exception that after you conquer them,or bride them,or even do some quests for them you can add them to your army!In short the game world resemble Alpha Centauri after playing Civ.Alien,strange,unique and disturbing beautiful.The map resemble the game of thrones intro map,with more details.There are hills,mountains,rivers,forests,swamps that add tactical value in battle and city building-planing.As you can see from the screenshots the world map is like nothing you have ever met in any other game!Tactical combat may seem somewhat ""hollow"",as you can only deploy your troops and then choose their targets or the tile to move on,but after some battles you'll realize that its not that simple as it seems.There are many parameters that count in battle such as height,wooded areas,swamps,capabilities a unit can have such as soul liching.And you can change the armour and the weapons of your units to make even stronger,more defensive or more aggressive etc.The downside effect from equiping your units with the latest and heaviest armour possible,its an initiative value decrease and more turns to build it.Combat take place on the map tiles you meet the enemy,so its imperative to choose the battlefield wisely,even more if the enemy outnumbers your army.The values that count ingame are quite common,dust for coinage,materials for building/training,food and research.There are many luxury resources,that keep your population happy,and more important military resources that allow you to build stronger armours and deadliest weapons to outfit your units.Diplomacy is still under costruction,but there are many options other from war and peace,such as alliances,trade pacts and many more.One faction which is trade oriented cannot declare war (although they have strong defencive armies and a trade embargo capability that can be really pain in the #%@#!?) and another faction is in a costant war mode (necrophages) because of their all consuming or die nature.The market.You can hire heroes,units,trade resources that your areas lack or have in abundance (military resources to build that shining new armour),all these options are quite common.BUT you can hire privateers,mercenary units that bare no banners and attack your enemies without declaring war.An option quite unique,that is quite useful in certain circumstances.The game is still in a beta face,there are many features still missing,but its quite stable (never had a crash),it can run on a low-middle spec machine really nice (mine is i5,8gb ram,int.graph.card) and the immersion is its greatest value.Great story,unique factions and neutrals and a world you have never met before.9.555559/10If only my boss could take some extra vacation time....

												This game is everything I had hoped Warlock: Master of the Arcane and Elements would be.The game at it's core is a 4x strategy game. You build towns and armies, develop them and conquer the world or become the world's leader through the several other victory types. However the implementation is better, with clever changes to many of the mechanics: Combat is handled through tactical battles on the world map. Once hostilites start an area of the map is sectioned off to be used as the battle field, allowing you to know the terrain beforehand. though exploiting that is a little difficult. Rather then precise commands you give broad directions or targets in combat, which makes battles quick and brutal compared to other 4x games with tactical combat.Towns hold a territory/province stopping town clustering though town placement is very important since the town only gathers resources from ajacent tiles, though extractors can be built on far away strategic or luxury resources. Additionally provinces have minor factions who can be convinced to join you via quests or bribes, or wiped out and built back up. These minor factions provide free workers and can be incorporated into the empire to give faction wide bonuses along with new units.Units are quite customizable. You can choose from a few different armor and weapon types that vary depending on the type of units. The factions only get a few types of units which can then be customized to fit different roles and more unit types can be gained from the minor factions.The factions themselves have quite a bit of variety from some factions which don't take food, to others that can't declare war, to another that cannot not be at war and even one that can only build one super town. Factions can also be customized, though the default factions seem to use more points then you get. Additionally the factions have interesting backstories that are fleshed out more on their faction specific quests.So far the only real complaint I have is that the game is not balanced towards large maps. Expanding is punishing until high level techs are researched making much of a larger map unused. Otherwise this is probably the best 4x game I have played in awhile.			"

												Plays like a more in depth Civilization.  Which is awesome!  Consider any Civ game to be your pretutorial, then play the tutorial included with the game, and then you're all set!  So far I am absolutely loving it!  Barbarians and citystates have been fused to make ""minor factions"".  You can either use diplomacy and do some stuff to gain their favor or use military might to subjugate them.  The factions seem quite diverse, though I have only played with the Necrophague.  The terrain plays a large role in warfare, and battles can be micromanaged whereas you decide which unit does what.  I really can't recommend this game enough if you enjoy strategy games.  If you don't, I'm not sure this will win you over.  Then again, I doubt any strategy game would.  For: people who like Risk, Civilization, Heroes of Might and Magic          Not for: people who do not have patience			"

												only complaint is the combat system. You don't really get to make any decisions when you go into the tactical battle screen and it seems to serve no other purpose than to provide a stage upon which to watch the units display their individual animations. I would really like to see a patch that allows for more manual control of each battle, otherwise I'll continue to hit auto resolve each time for the sake of saving time. other than that the game is fun. the quests offer a good distraction from the typical empire building and city management of a 4X game, and reminds me of other titles in the genre like Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Hero's but with more style. The backstory and world-building is compelling as well, and the diplomacy system is one of the best I've seen in this genre.  "

												This caught me by surprise - I rarely feel engaged by 4x games (outside of Civ), but this title really has merit.Let's get the basics out of the way - it looks great. The artistry is top-notch. The UI is fluid, and importantly doesn't waste your time with animations that freeze your ability to navigate. Everything is responsive and satisfying.The minor factions are a great addition - something Civ struggled with all the way through 5 (with the city-states). Endless manages to make the minor factions feel ""just right"", and conquering/parlaying/bribing them is a huge part of the game. Plus it's just plain fun to sometimes gain their trust through quests, and sometimes through conquest. Every option feels equally viable, you can't use just one strategy to get what you want.The major factions are varied and (again) satisfying. Each one plays entirely differently, but not so differently that you feel like you're stuck re-learning the wheel. Some games with multiple factions make it seem as if one or two factions got all the developer's attention, but these factions are well-rounded.I could go on, but overall the game is remarkably well thought-out, well-executed, and engaging. I don't often play 4x games, but I'd feel comfortable suggesting this to anyone.			"

I wish all ""version 1"" could be just as well polished and stable as this one. Highly recommended. You like 4x? a Fantasy setup? Don't hesitate. I even recommend to go for the founders pack for the little etras and higher support to this great studio.A must in any steam collection.			"

												Amplitude Studios strikes again! With a universe created in Endless Space (go check that out too), they bring the 4X turn-based strategy to a single planet with eight unique and interesting factions all readyto do whatever it takes to survive. The art style across the game from the anamoly-filled landscape to each factions' buildings, units, and their abilities are superb and enhanced by an enjoyable soundtrack. Hours have come and gone with this game and I highly recommend it.			"

												I'm pretty wary of Early Access these days, but having played and enjoyed Endless Space, I decided to go for it and was not disappointed. Even in the Early Access stage, the polish and promise of this game was unusual. Graphics? Gorgeous. Sound? Beautiful. Gameplay? So much fun. Difficult, but fun. (Maybe it's just the way I play, but I found the Newbie difficulty level to be similar to Civ 5's normal difficulty. It's very easy to fall behind, so get started early and don't waste turns if you can help it!) It's also got some features that make it stand out from other 4X fare. The light RPG elements (similar to Endless Space, but more in depth), which include quests, are plentiful enough to keep you from getting bored, but not so deep that they bog down the game too much. Tech researching is also a little more involved and interesting than your standard 4X. Unlike in most 4X games, researching is a little more free-form. Instead of tech trees, there are more like tech levels. To get to the next level (which the game calls Eras), you have to research a certain number of technologies, which can be from any of the main categories (science/production, culture/influence, military, and agriculture/economics). So, if you like, you can choose not to research any low-level (Era I) agriculture/economic technologies and still be able to research Era II agriculture/economic technologies once you've unlocked that level. The anomalies and wide variety of hex benefits (e.g. 1 food, 2 dust, 3 production output if one of your cities extends to that hex) also spice up the game, adding extra elements to consider when making strategic decisions. The only quibble I have is with the manual battles. While they're enjoyable enough, I've found the system a bit clunky and my units occasionally ignore my orders completely for no apparent reason (not even a terrain reason). Not sure if that's a pathfinding issue or what, but it can make manual battles a little frustrating at times. I've found that you're less likely to lose units in manual battles than the automatic ones (or at least that's what I've seen in my limited experience), so I wish they would take a look at that or somehow make it more clear why units are sometimes like ""Oh, was that an order? You wanted me to do something/go somewhere that might preserve my health or life? How cute. I'm going to go get myself murdered now. kthxbye!"" That said, that's not a huge part of the game and you can absolutely let the computer take care of it if you prefer.Anyway, this is a great game overall and shows that Amplitude Studios is becoming one of those rare Developers You Can Trust To Make Amazing Games That Are Worth Your Money And Will Probably Not F--- You Over With Early Access. (The DYCTTMAGTAWYMAWPNFYOWEA club is an admirable and exclusive one, but I think we can all agree that they need a little help with that acronym.) 9.5/10 "

												My first impression of this game was stunning.°°° Is this review too long or are you too la.. eager to buy/play? ;-) Scroll down for a summary. °°°A good tutorial that covers everything you need to know while being as short as possible, so you can jump right into the real action, something I really appreciate in this kind of games.Excellent UI, canceling out of menus by right-clicking, all menus are automatically centered on your screen. All infos you need to know are either blent into the HUD or can be toggled. (However, the UI doesn't accept shortcuts, you must navigate it with the mouse)Overall, Endless Legend plays like a fantasy Civilization with a combat system similar to Heroes of Might and Magic, though, kept as simple as possible (starting combat will form a battlefield directly on the world map and will begin with a tactical phase in where you can place your units strategically on the terrain while showing you the starting area of your enemies. The area both armies can place their units is affected by hero abilities). Combat can be fought manually, automatically or in a semi-automatic fashion. Nice touch: you can choose this in every turn of the combat, giving you the option to change commands for each unit in every turn if you feel that it's necessary.Very short turns, most of the time shorter than to the comparable Civilization 5.Heroes can be used as generals for your army or as mayors and can be specialized and equipped accordingly to enhance their abilities for their chosen position.The most interesting resource in Endless Legend is influence, unlike other strategy games, diplomacy in Endless Legend needs influence for all actions. Declaring war or forming alliances costs influence.Even if an AI is traitorous and tends to backstabbing, it can only do so if it isn't wasting its influence, making diplomatic predictions possible.Your overall relation to other factions is cathegorized and can be seen in a 3D (rather 2,5D) UI, hovering over one of those cathegories, displayed as concentric areas will tell you the conditions and costs for actions you can take, and which there are. Entering one of those cathegories through diplomacy or actions will add penalties for violating them.You swore localty to your allies? Well, you better stick to your words or you will lose influence! Awesome feature and the best solution for an immersive diplomacy I have seen so far.**One of the best features of this game is the creation of your own units. By conquering neutral factions on the map, you gain their unit-designs, from which you can create your OWN units, e.g. you talk some valkyr-styled, female knights into joining your empire, then take their standard unit and create a unit-template with their model and abilities as basics and now equip them with weapons, armor and accessoires according to your wishes, the accumulated cost for this will further be the cost for reproducing this unit - You can even name this new unit!**Graphically, this game can easily compete with its competitors. However, on max details, Endless Legend only reaches the average settings of AAA titles. To be more precise, there are no fancy shaders, no max-zoom - high-detail clouds for eye-candy and the basic textures for hex fields are low-res, however, this does not apply to resources on those hex tiles. The visual art style for buildings, ruins and everything else is absolutely fitting and marvellous. (You can, however, zoom out very far to see whole world where the map changes into an actual ""map"" with borders and region names, this has a very nice and immersive feeling to it!)Fog of war covered areas are flat and rise from the ground level, like structures in the Game of Thrones intro, when explored.Voiced intros for all factions, compact lore-information for everything you discover, directly in the interaction menu.### For German players: Deutsche Lokalisation ist sehr gut. Keine uns so verhasste 1-zu-1 Übersetzung sondern mit ""Flare"". Gute Grammatik, Rechtschreibfehler fast keine vorhanden. Kein Text der über die Ränder hinaus geht. Sprachausgabe ist durchgehend Englisch, dafür aber von guter Qualität, Untertitel auf Deutsch und tadellos.TL;DRSummary:+++ Every 20 turns, you can assign your influence resource to a masterplan, which can be shaped the way you want it, to grant your empire bonuses for 20 turns, this is an extremely nice feature.+++ Research and building of strucutes and units can be queued and when finished are shown in a pop-up at the start if each round. For each finished unit/bulding/research, this pop-up will also list the next one in line, very clever feature! (no need to check your queues every time)++ Good tutorial++ Excellent UI and HUD++ Nice unitdesign++ Perfect hybrid of CIV and HoMM++ Seasons that can have a heavy impact on your strategy (marching into enemy territory just as winter arrives, can be catastrophic for your invasion)+ Good music+ Nice artstyle+ Short turns+ Seemingless blend into battles+ short loading times, excellent engine+ UI can be toggled between standard and big, making it easy on the eyes for big screens. (scaling instead of toggling would be nice, though)+ automatic naming of saves (like this: faction - turn >>> Imperium - Turn 1)--- no shortcuts, this is a mouse-heavy game-- Music, though nice, feels a little out of place | pauses and sudden start of music are slightly irritating NOTE: The pause can be adjusted. The standard setting is just absurdly long.- The art design for the units and heroes is slightly too cartoonish, which is unecessary for a this kind of game. NOTE: VERY subjective opinion - This is also barely noticable for models on the world map and doesn't affect immersion at all.- opaque UI in white and grey shades, not adjustable. Doesn't feel right for a fantasy setting. (Making the transparecy adjust- and toggable would further improve performance and make it more friendly on the eyes)Overall I'll rate this game 9 of 10, or 4.5 of 5 stars if you prefer.This is a first impression review and I will update this after testing for lasting motivation, tactical deepness, A.I. and of course loading times with more units onscreen.

												the Endless franchise (which, through sheer persistence it must be called now) is a wondersome beast, really. I never really played Endless Space because the shallow battle system bored me, but I guess the 4x elements were decent. this one is a similar case. the battle system is turn based, fairly shallow, and every of the eight faction has only three units, as well as other ones depending on the assimilated minor factions.so far so unspectacular. BUT - and this is so surprising because the same thing goes for DUngeon of the Endless: this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beautiful. from head to toe, from UI to artwork. its not only very well executed - its innovative, which is really rare. look up some pictures of ""cult of the eternal end"" units for instance. the art direction reminds me of Rackham tabletop models. its vibrantly colored, diverse, stylish, functional in its UI design. and it crashes, a lot. and is a fairly boring game, so far at least, but it might feel like that because I didnt delve too deeply into it, and, like Endless Space, this seems to value the three other X's higher than xterminate, the combat. as I said, a strange and very beautiful beast. just like Dungeon, which has one of the most brilliant pixel-y art styles I ve seen in a long time.

												The game is very good overall. It looks beautiful each race is very thematic and it seems like your story is going to be awesome. The only complaint I have with the game is some of it may be too tedious. You have to micromanage the battles enough to where its annoying, but not enough to where you can be certain who will attack where. I am probably just not good enough to fully understand the combat and in reality there is nothing wrong. The game is still amazingly fun and beautifully designed.			"

												A very solid 4x game.  Each race plays COMPLETELY different from each other, combat is terrain dependent and requires tactical positioning, and each method of victory is achievable.  Questing and exploration allows very unique and replayable experiences.  Custom races are possible, allowing you to cherry pick which race attributes and technologies you like to start with.			"

												Endless Legend is the 3rd game in the Endless series, and as they say, 3rd Time's the Charm!  Though my next words won't really convey that well.This game is unfinished.Everything feels pretty loosely connected (that was the only way I could describe things).  The UI feels weak and seems too small.  Sometimes enemy armies will come out of nowhere and destroy your city in one turn.  These are problems that can be patched out or updated.  (The camera doesn't move to show you important things like enemy movement etc., so you can feel like you're being left in the dark to vitally important things.)  Also, randomly the game will say a huge error has occured, give you a feedback log for you to do nothing with, and then continues running as normal (unless it then decides your next turn will never start, but a quick Save/Reload solves this).However, despite these faults, compared to Beyond Earth, this is the better game.The 9 factions are all fantastic, look wonderful and have great, unique effects, and each one feels very different!  From the Necrophage which are quite literally incapable of learning any form of peaceful diplomacy and feast on the flesh of the living to the Drakken, draconic beings who adore peace and start the game knowing everyone (and everyone knowing them), it's truly wonderful.  You can even make your own factions from scratch!  Of course, in old Endless-4X style, you can customise your armies with equipment that improves over the course of the game (making your units take longer to produce to compensate), it all balances out very well.  Minor Factions you can assimilate into your army also make for important choices on which lands you take and which places you destroy, for each grants you a passive bonus along with a new unit for you to make (and considering each army can only make 3 different military units, this is vitally important).This game is good, you should buy it, but it does have some rough edges, but nothing you can't fix or get over.  Get ready to learn a lot of new stuff and have plenty of fun!			"

												I have to say that this is the only 4x strategy game that I have really gotten into, and it is seriously worth it!Here's the shortened version:pros:- different races to play as that actually give a lot of diverse gameplay options- each race has its own (interesting) quest-line and (vibrant) history - quests really give you a purpose and a bit of story to drive you forward and keep you engaged with your faction.- combat system takes the best of Civ V and Total War to create a really fun system!- seasons!- relatively simple interface (you probably need to play the tutorial to fully understand it though)- customise your army units- very sassy AI!- beautiful graphicscons:- you can't see exactly how strong an enemy is before you attack (at least, i havent found a way yet)- tutorial is quite heavy, but also worth it so....- cities are a little hard to see clearly as there is a lot of stuff going on...- it is a little buggy and often crashes when I play multiplayer, but not enough to deter me from the game!The long version:What I like most about this game is the sense of real diversity between each 'culture/races/people'. They each have very specific and drastically different ways of playing them. For example you have a race that is a cult - they can't build extra cities so conquering by force is useless, so instead of soldiers they have preachers who spread their influence and 'take over' other players' settlements through spreading their cult. Another clan is basically vermin zombies who don't even have the option of diplomacy - all they can do is attack other players and eat them or turn their enemies into zombies which they can then control. Or a third one is a bunch of metal armours with souls inside them so they don't require any food resources! There is much more than that but they all have advantages and disadvantages that are really well balanced and truly FEEL different and diverse!On top of that the combat system is really interesting. First of all, each race only gets 4 different base units. That's it. But wait for it..... you get to customise them! As you level them up you get access to tier 2, 3 etc items like armour, weapons, and jewelery which all give you different stats which means you can create different units tailored to your own style of play or needs. For example I'm playing with the woodsland people (not their official name) and i have access only to archers at first. But I have created 2 different types of archers through this system - some are better at fighting infantry units whereas my second class is stronger against flying units. And now I also spent a while upgrading all my unit designs so that I can manufacture better units. There aren't THAT many different options, but there are enough to make it diverse and you can have a lot of fun with it. I also just like the ability to upgrade your units instead of simply receiving new units and you don't really know what they do. This way, I really am getting to know my army for once.Secondly, it's not like in Civ V where your units throw javelins from one hexagon to another hexagon or something like that. In battle you have your little units and they each take up 1 square, so you can control each of them individually, at first you need to decide where to place them (they get advantages or disadvantages based on terrain) and then you decide which enemies they attack. It's the same basic concept as in total war, but with less units and turn-based. You're also able to see the stats of your opponents and so can strategise pretty nicely without it taking forever or being overly complicated.The only down side is that you can't really tell the strength of an enemy army until you have engaged in battle with it (which has meant that 1 and a half of my armies has been accidentally wiped out because of that. But i think that is mostly because i had only archers. Because i didn't have access to anything else at that point because i was focusing on production instead of armies.)Finally, quests. I haven't play that many 4x strategy games but I haven't seen quests like these before. And I love them. I tend to play mostly RPGs because I like story and my main concern with 4x games such as Civ V was that I didn't really care about my people. But not in Endless Legend. Oh no. The quests and bits of story you get gives you motivation and a purpose and that is what is keeping me playing this game! And I don't even have time for it! It feels like there is a story happening - you're not just developing your community for nothing, you've got a purpose and i love that!Basically, it's complex, but simple enough to understand - just the way i like my games.

												8/10I love the concept behind this game. It's kind of like playing Civilisation V but it has so many unique features that it does kind of feel like a different game altogether. At first, going in with this perspective - I have to admit, I didn't like it. It felt a bit like a poor rip off of the game. Delving into it and giving it a chance anyway, I found that actually I like it quite alot. There are certain aspects from the whole territory dividing feature which gives it a unique twist, a restriction that can be described as welcome (otherwise acquiring resources would be not nearly as challenging) to things like being able to customise your own race. This feature is probably one that is not liked by others, and I can't imagine how it would fare if you played for serious competitivity but between friends - feels like a nice little charm seeing the different strategies that your friends will implement to succeed, whether it be from the quite commonly seen choice of tweaking a class that has already been described by the game itself as Broken or from doing something slightly creative and creating a peace loving clan that unites itself in peace with all bar one to single that clan out and abolish them from the game.(Note to Creators should you ever read this: Please don't ever balance this. I don't mind that it is clear that some races have a typical advantage because that creates creative solutions as to how to overcome them - and I always have found games where balancing happens too frequently to become very bland and lack excitement. That moment when you discover something really cool about a race that gives you a clear advantage over others can really contribute to that feeling of something special when playing any game).The music is brilliant, and has an atmospheric aura that only contributes to the game - I am a fan of the originally created audio in most games, my friends however - not so much. But even they have stated that this game doesn't have one of those repetitive audio tracks that begin to get on your nerves after a while but actually can be listened to and enjoyed throughout the playthrough of the game.The graphics are a lovely touch as well, they update every time you re-tab into the game which is great and they look and feel great. They really contribute again to the atmosphere that you're playing in a war as opposed to some kind of arcade themed strategy game. They clearly have had quite some time put into them too and it's a nice touch - even better that you can play the game with these graphics even on a lower spec computer like my own without experiencing too many issues.One problem I do have with the game though (well actually two, a minor and a major). The syncing issue in multiplayer (being the minor problem) can be a little annoying sometime. I have recently learned that this is likely due to the spec of my computer and so isn't too great an issue but I've noticed for some reason it flags off as unsynced but we can still play for ages anyway. I don't mind ignoring and haven't rated the score I gave accordingly - but thought I'd mention it anyway.The problem that I marked the score down for was the way the game is mapped? I don't know if that's the correct terminology but basically when you try to assign the moves of some of your units, sometimes you'll have to remouse over the tile you want a few times (only happens sometimes, so not unbearable). I'm not sure if this is related to terrain mapping but it's a little annoying and has caused me to make a few poor choices by accident. The problem with this is it does contribute to giving the game a little bit of a laggy feel sometimes (also noticeable in the main menu selection as well by the way) which is a shame because it's a tiny feature which lets the game down a tiny bit - especially on first impressions, which if I was a different type of gamer, could have caused me to simply reject the game on that impression alone.Overall, the game is amazing though. I don't want to end on a bad note and I only rated it two lower in the hope for an aspiration for improvement from the developers. The game is great and I'm really enjoying it so far. I would like to see more classes, units and technologies, as well as more factions but I guess that's what DLC is for. I eagerly await the expansions.Great game Devs.-DNChaos.			"

												For TLDR: Great game. Better than Civ. Buy.Let's start with the most important thing, the gameplay. For me, the features in this game are a lot more interesting than Civ. The factions are all so different, in a good way, each with their own completely different positives and negatives. Also, as of writing this review I have about 50 hours of game time and there are still cool little features that I am picking up along the way thanks to how different all the factions are. As a result of this, I feel like I am still playing a brand new game.The game is smooth. I have an average build PC and I have never yet experienced lag or crashing, which I had to deal with on a regular basis with Civ. I play multiplayer a lot with friends, and yes the turns slow down as the game gets longer, but not by a huge amount.Graphics are great, the lore is brilliant for anyone who is into it, but you can also ignore the lore completely if you choose to do so, you are not forced either way and it won't affect your gameplay. --------------------------------There are a few small negatives. Not enough to give the game a bad review, but things that could be improved on.The tutorial is usless and a complete waste of time. I tried to learn aspects of the game using it but the amount of features is so overwhelming and not explained well in the tutorial. I jumped straight into a game with a friend and learned the hard (but more fun) way.The AI can be really good or really bad. Sometimes they perform an attack at a certain time or in a certain area (for example a faction that gets boost from forest specifically using a forested route to attack me, or settling their cities in forested areas) but then the AI can also be really dumb, mainly when it comes to researching techs. I keep seeing science tech factions not even bothering to researched the Age 1 science techs, or the economy based factions not even researching trade routes. Needs to be sorted.--------------------------Overall, I would recommend the game as it is. The current price is 30 pound which is worth it. If it goes on sale I would definitely buy it. However improve AI please.8.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								This shaping up to the be the 4X game of the year. It's by the same guys who did Endless Space; their experience with the genre really shines through and it's sort of set in the same universe with similar mechanics. There are some areas they struggled with in the previous game; namely diplomacy and procedurally generated areas. The combat is vastly improved over the original Endless Space, and while there are glaring issues still with balance (AIs getting whupped by minor factions) it's all fairly simple to resolve. There's also a superb choice of playstyles, including factions which cannot go to war but have access to anonymous mercaneries, a faction which cannot be ""at peace"" with anyone, some which are literalyl powered by magical dust and so forth. Worth every penny if version 1 is half the game v0.581 is so far.			"

												Even in its very early stages in Early Access this game is a wonderful experience that tries new things with the 4X strategy genre (and succeeds!). What is here already such as the very interesting combat system and the world region system are enough already to set this game apart from the rest of the pack. Skeptics might want to wait for the game to be a little more fleshed out (namely a friggin diplomacy system!!! Looking at you devs!), but for those who love the genre will not be disappointed with what the game offers at this point. Also if you have played Endless Space (also created by the same people) then you will love and be right at home with Endless Legend. It can only get better from here and I look forward to enjoying the full game!UPDATE: Now that the game is in beta it runs more smoothly than ever before and has a bunch of new content. Diplomacy system is now in place as well as improved AI and multiplayer plus new factions. Getting very close to being amazing!Final UPDATE: Now that this game has seen its full release it is easily my most favorite 4X strategy game beating out Endless Space and Civ V. The game handles extremely well technically and gameplay wise thanks to many optimizations and buig fixes compared to when it was in early access. It also is an increadibly beautiful and atmospheric game on the highest settings and at 60+ fps and does not require the beefiest of graphics cards to achieve this which is a major plus. Above all the gameplay is a diverse and rich playground for any RTS/4X fan to enjoy and I would be hard pressed to imagine that any RTS/4X would be disappointed by this game.			"

												If you like civ5 you might like this, in some areas it's not as polished and definetly not as high budget but when it comes to having fun this isn't far off, only thing that it might be lacking is voice overs during play. Another thing this game could benefit from would be scenario type games, skirmishes with very special conditions and goals, as it is now you are limited to the normal ""skirmish"" type, that said you have alot to tweak and choose from.In short 4/5 considering it's price.

												Hopelessly addictive! 8 wonderfully unique factions that all seek to win the game in different ways. Has a relatively steep learning curve since the tutorial does not teach you everything. I've already put 25+ hours into the game (in the past two days, no less) and there are still things I don't understand or know how to do (trading has baffled me).But the game is immensely fun with both tried and true traditional 4X game play mechanics and a bunch of new ones. Haven't played Endless Space, so I can't compare the two, but I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for when it goes on sale.			"

												Endless Legend is very much in the vein of civilisation but with a fantasy setting.It has more depth than many games of its ilk with a wide range of troops, minor factions and resources.Unlike many modern games the factions are very different with unique play mechanics that making using a different faction a very different experience.Recommended for fans of fantasy strategy games.Added after 23 hours play:Having played this for longer there are game crashing bugs and occasional errors. Autosaves happen every turn to rescue you from this. If you get errors without a crash then it is best to exit the game as re-opening the game can fix the errors. Hopefully these issues will be fixed in a future patch but be warned if you see an error the game may crash in a future turn but your save is probably fine if you restart.Some of the features I like from this game:Seasons mean winter suddenly drops your food and other production, poorly designed empires can find them selves starved. Troops move slowly in winter and it gives a sensible pause in war efforts. Once you have troops with winter resistence via high level skills you can gain advantages in the winter.Diplomacy has a default state of cold war, one step from peace or war. Peace and Alliances must be researched before being offered and military players can not only ignore diplomacy but also ignore chunks of the research options.Troops can be edited to give them the latest equipment, then troops built on those original builds can be retrofitted to the current build.Heroes stationed in cities earn experience as quickly or faster than combat Heroes. The earn experience for everything built at the city so defensive and peaceful empires can still build powerful heroes. Heroes also have a whole chain of skills focused on city boosting.Each faction has a recommended victory type to aim for.Cultists for example can only build one city and expand through village conversion instead. Each village gives them resouces, an extra city worker and troops are generated for free in the village. The city can grow a level higher than any other faction and numbers of workers in the end game can be very high due to all the villages converted.To play each faction to the full you need to embrace there game mechanic and just playing each faction gives a lot of replay.Difficulty is simpler than other games in the ilk as long as you follow the correct playstyle for your faction and utilise your heroes fully. Anything below normal should be treated as training and normal may be to easy if you play a lot of strategy games.My first playthroughs with the Wind Walkers took 15+ hours and my second play with Cultists taking less than 8 hours. If you ignore the story line quests and focus on a quick win on maps other than huge you could do this in a much shorter time.Playing the remaining factions I expect to spend another 30-60 hours trying out the other 6 main factions.

												This game is one of the better 4x games that I've ever played. Each faction that I have played has been very different from the ones that came before it, both in aesthetics and gameplay. The world is gorgeous, the art is gorgeous, the diplomacy screens are gorgeous. The game has this unique techno-fantasy feeling going on.Focus of the game seems to be more on the building than on the heroes, so on the 4x spectrum I would place it closer to civilization than to something like HOMM. The game is a fantasy setting, but there is barely any magic so it also doesn't exactly have the feel of Master of Magic or other fantasy 4x games. Large cities sprawl across the land in a satisfying way, reminding me of what Elemental tried to do but failed at.Combat is different than other 4x games I've played. It is kind of a tactical/real time hybrid. Each fight is six rounds of issuing orders to your units and then watching the orders resolve. Sometimes the way things play out make slower units unable to carry out their planned orders, so a wrench can be thrown into your movement/attack orders.I've been playing on standard settings and each game takes about six hours or so. The time just flies away. It's just so damned immersive.			"

												Played the game for a few hours yesterday, and while I'll readily admit, 7.8 hours is not really enough to get a true feel for the game, I have seen enough to know that the developers have put a lot of thought into this game.  The atmosphere seems right, difficulty may be set a tad high for people new to the 4X genre of games (either that or I'm just terrible at this game haha).  There are a few bugs that need fixing, they're mainly game crashes.  Suffered a fair number of them yesterday while playing Multiplayer with my friend, either desyncing or just plainly dropping us both out the game and leaving us with a window saying the other person closed the game....  If you're considering buying this game, don't let these little blips put you off, the game is well worth a purchase if you're looking for a 4X game you can get your teeth into.Price for this game is just right IMO			"

												I've played a lot of strategy games over the years and this is one of the better ones. A lot of 4x games (not including space 4x) tend to be heavily modeled after the Civilization series, not Endless Legend though. This game is very much its own game.Pros:Each Faction plays very differently from each other. Necrophages can't have peace or alliances, Broken Lords don't need food. Drakken can force peace upon another player, Roving Clans can't declare war etc. Each faction truly is a vastly different playstyle.The game is beautiful. A minor thing that just makes it more enjoyable.The battle system is interesting. More in depth than Civ's smack two units against each other, but not as in depth as Age of Wonders 3 where you control each unit on the battle field.The world is very diverse and there are quests, ruins, minor factions etc. that make exploring both profitable and enjoyable.Unit Customization. You can alter your units with different armor, weapons and trinkets to suit your needs. You take a basic unit from your faction (or assimilated minor factions) and equip them with different equipment to make them stronger or more specialized. For instance you could have a lance weilding Stalwart that does a lot of damage, or one that can take as much damage as you throw at it.Heroes: Strong units that lead armies or govern cities. Very useful and very cool.Mixed:The region system is somewhat strange. When you settle a region with a city, you own that whole region. However, only the tiles directly around your city are worked. You also can only found a single city per region. This means that many areas that would make excellent cities are wasted. On the other hand all the strategic and luxury resources in the region can be harvested by the single city. You also don't get AI settling right next to your city to steal a resource like in Civ.Cons:Limited number of Units. Each faction only has 4 base units. You can assimilate different minor factions for their units but there is a limited number of slots to do this. Compared to other games there aren't many units around. However each faction has three unique units (the settler is common to almost all the factions).AI can travel into your territory automatically and can attack your units outside of your territory without declaring war. You have to declare peace for them not to be able to attack your units and declare closed borders to keep them out of your territory. Both of which cost influence.Declaring war costs influence. Severely annoying and pointless. The other diplomatic stuff makes sense. This does not. You don't need to influece someone to declare war, you just attack them.			"

												This is a great 4x game concept if still a bit rough around the edges.The good:* The map is divided into regions, with no more than 1 city/region, with that city having access to all resources in the region--this eliminates city spam.* Units are grouped into armies, but armies have a max number of units based on current technology--prevents stacks of doom.* Cities exploit tiles around them by building districts that must be next to the city center or another district--the city gradually works more and more tiles in it's region under player control.* Armies have something to do even when not at war, exploring ruins, fighting with other factions in neutral regions, and conducting quests.* Battles are resolved with a decent--but skippable--tactical combat system.* Tech is non-linear and varied.* Units are customizable, with new base patterns acquired by assimulating minor factions.* A number of different paths to victory--military, science, and quest.* Different factions have huge differences that making playing them basically a completely different game.The bad:* Still some significant bugs, including ones that make it impossible to finish a game even from saves.* No real documentation or tutorial for a lot of the good new concepts--you just have to figure out a lot of things by trial and error.  Though this can also be fun--""Oh, *that's* how that works....""* The notification system--that a city is not producing anything, or that you aren't researching any tech, is easy to miss, leading to turns of no production and no research unless you remember to check it every turn.* The AI is pretty weak, and probably always will be, due to the complexity of the options available.* The UI can be frustrating and confusing.If you're willing to learn by trial and error as you go, and have a high tolerance for bugs, there are some really good new concepts here.  If not, you might wait a couple of months until some good beginner's guides are written and the game is more stable.If you do play it now--notifications appear as icons on the right side of the screen.  Make sure you click on every one every turn--they disappear as soon as you hit End Turn.  And the circle around End Turn has an arrow circle icon next to it--click on that every turn to move your armies, or they'll just sit where they are doing nothing.  And use the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom out far enough that you get the strategic map--that shows you region bondaries, resources, unexplored ruins, etc.			"

The inferface is a more polished version of Endless Space, the combat can take a little bit of time to complete but i liked the unique design put into the combat on a 4x game.  The visuals are amasing but in the longer games i have noticed that it can slow down the game a tad bit.  Over all i am very satisfied with this game.			"

												I have endless space and although I liked it I didn't really give enough time to fully enjoy it. Lots of people say this is endless space in a fantasy setting. I disagree. Although some of the mechanics are similar this game is different. Its also different and a lot more fun than many other fantasy based 4X titles. So far I am into my first game and practically did not stop for 14 hours. Yes this game does an excellent job of keeping you in it. The game has a brief tutorial which does a great job of familiarising you with the basics. At first the game does appear a bit daunting with so many options and things to remember. After a couple of hours I became comfortable and then everything just seem to get better as my Empire slowly came to life. Breaking my 4x tradition I decided to start with a faction thats focus is on economy. I have to say  its really been good. It makes a change to buy your way to success instead of relying on churning out a constant army. With this faction I buy my army and its ready in an instant. The game consists of several varied and interesting major factions and then you have numerous minor factions.  Whichever major faction you choose they will have their own unique background story and quests.Units vary but are basically broken down into heroes, support, infantry, cavalry, ranged and flying. You can even make your own units. To conquer regions you need cities and growing your city is a long process. In fact as your research grows you will enter several different ages unlocking even more ablities for the city. As well as battles this game is very much about resource management. I love the way every single hex in the game produces some kind of resource in different quantities. This makes it especially important when deciding where to place your city.This game is pretty much all about time and planning. I really like it that at the beginning of the game you will be in whats known as a 'cold war' with all the other factions. At this stage there can be no peace treaties and you are quite exposed if you end up next door to an aggressive neighbour. Diplomacy in endless legends takes a long time to bear fruit. One thing I do like about the AI on easier settings is that it doesn't tend to attack you the moment it stumbles across you. I've played too many 4X's in the past where you literally get jumped on by the AI before you have started. The great thing about endless is that you start off with a limited number of diplomatic options. The others only come later if you research them. All the other AI factions in the game behave in a specific way. Some are expansionists while others are pacifists. This becomes apparent over time when you see how the factions behave towards each other and the size of their territory.On to the map. Its one of the best and most intuitive I've seen in a 4x. Randomly generated hex landscapes with varied environments from cold wastes to desert. Each will effect how units interact with it. Scattered across the landscape are numerous weird anomalies, exploitable resources, explorable ruins and minor factions. At any point you can smoothly zoom right in and out of the map to get an overview of the empires. The map is big and takes a long time to fully explore. Minor factions play a role in that you need to pacify them early or they will become a threat with their wandering armies. You can even assimilate a limited number of pacified factions which will give you access to one of their units.Battles are fought on a zoomed in version of the region it takes place on. Then its a simple turned based hex battle which goes through a number of phases before the outcome is decided. The environment your units are in at the time will have an effect. Some may think the battles are too simplified with limited options and no spell books like with HoMM games. To be honest I think it works just fine for endless. After a battle if you win your units will earn experience points and gradually level up. This makes keeping veteran armies alive essential for the later game.The music score is superb and blends into the game perfectly.There is a lot more to this game than what I have touched on in this review. Be sure that once its got your attention you will be sinking endless hours into it.10/10			"

								Awesome game so far. Only negative thing I have to say is the AI can be a bit annoying when it comes to manually fighting battles. Once you set up your troops and give your orders they normally carry out the first set of orders. Then after the first round of fighting, all of your troops begin attacking the troops that have full health instead of fighting the troops they just weakened so they end up losing. Fortunately, the hero is strong enough to finish off most of the troops. Not sure if my experience is universally agreed upon. But I'm just giving my own opinion regardless.Otherwise, this game is dope and I can't wait to play the finished product. Not sure if they plan on putting a tutorial in but I think they should.			"

								It's not finished. It's far from finished actually, though it already looks polished. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's still in Alpha as of writing this.However, the game has already seen a lot of growth and looks good enough to play anyways. There are parts of the game that still need balancing, such as military numbers, happiness, and well... a good number of things basically. However, it is very clear that the team behind this game is in it for the long haul, and it is evident they care a lot about their customers, including updates about ongoing progress to future updates to the game.I don't expect updates every four weeks. I expect updates that have meat behind them and that builds onto the game, especially for an Early Access Game. Even though I haven't played it for hours on end, I can feel it. Even before this game goes into final release, I will be fully addicted to it by Beta.For those who are looking for fast paced gameplay or a simplified tactical play, this is not your game. For those looking for a magitech take on Civilization with turn based tactical combat, story mode, and even RPG elements including upgrading heroes with weaponry and abilities, this is the game you should keep a very close eye on during development.

												Endless Legend took me by surprise. I have been a huge Civilization 5 player, with 263 hours on file at the moment, and my heart had always belonged with that game. I recently found interest in Endless Legend and purchased it and I think its a game that every fan of the 4x genre should play or at least look into. Pros:1. Beautiful, intriguing world. Tons of inventive lore infused throughout the game.2. Emphasis on effective empire management. City-building, economy balancing, and researching the tech-circles are really fun. There is also a great emphasis on resource management, each worker you unlock can be placed in different points of emphasis for more resource gain. If you are play a science victory you may want more workers placed in science production to research quickly. If you are playing a supremacy race you may be more interested in placing your workers in industry so you can build units/city expansions quicker, etc...3. Combat is done nicely. You can choose to tactically face your opponent in a way that sort of reminds me of Heroes of Might and Magic. It is turn-based and there may be some strategy. If you don't like that you can choose to spectate and watch the computer make your moves for you or you can just auto-resolve and move on. If you auto-resolve or spectate, you can choose for the computer to be aggressive or passive as well. You can also upgrade units with new weapons that you can craft through the research tree, or find in quests.4. Different factions that actually play quite differently. Some factions just simply cannot do certain things. Such as the necrophage, they can't create peace treaties. They are simply a faction that is meant to kill everything. Playing as the necrophage you may want to push all your workers into industry in order to build your improvements/milita quicker. Playing as the ardent mages you may want to move your workers into science production so that you can rush through the research tree and race to a science victory. There is even a faction that relies solely upon Dust (the games gold currency).4. Some innovative features that haven't been seen in 4x genre. For example: race-specific quest lines that actually serve as a unique victory condition, seasonal effects (summer/winter), the concept of regions limiting city placement, reinforcements, how heroes are handled (as generals or governors), etc., etc.5. The seasonal affects may actually impact some factions play. I know that whenever I enter the winter my production slows greatly. I end up losing roughly 60 gold per turn and most of the units can only move 1 space or so. 6. You can assimilate with minor factions and build/upgrade their units once you acquire them. They also have bonuses that they will provide to your city once you control them.7. The artstyle is very intriguing.8. It isn't like other 4x titles. In fact it does a very good job at seperating itself from other 4x titles (civ 5, age of wonders, etc..)9. You can create your own factions with all the different perks and army units that are provided in the base game. So if you don't like the factions that are in the game you can customize your own from the bottom up.Cons:1. A.I. is kind of bad with certain factions. With the Drakken they are really strong but with some of the other factions they act kind of stupid. This is the game's greatest downfall. But with the modding community helping this out and patches still being worked on (i think) this will come to an end hopefully.2. It would be cool if there were more factions. I'm sure there are other factions you can download through mods but it would've been cool to see more than just 9 factions in the base game.3. To some this is a con: The game is not as easily learned as something like Civ 5. Each turn you have to remember where your units were, you have to remember which direction they were heading, and what they were doing. There is more micromanaging in this game with emphasis on what workers produce which things. There are some things you may even have to wiki as well. There is a lot of things you will just learn the more you play considering the game doesn't really hold your hand at all. Even the tutorial is very basic and doesn't quite go over everything you will face in the game itself.Summary:When i play this game i instantly compare this game to an RPG. There are very many RPG like elements that are fused with the 4x style and this game does it VERY well. The artstyle is very unique and the way it plays is somewhat similar to what HeroScape was like back in the day. In my opinion it is more smooth that Civ 5 and there is more thought that is required within each turn. There aren't many situtations where you will just sit there and continuously hit the end-turn button. There is always a goal in each turn whether it is working towards the factions quests, trying to parley and assimilate with a minor faction, or expand. Yes, the AI needs improvement, but overall I think this is a great game. I wouldn't even say that the AIs mistakes are as noticeable as some of the other strategy games that exist. Playing on higher difficulties even create a loss more often than not so I think that creates a nice challenge sometimes.			"

												What can I say, this game is all I was looking for in a 4X game: Amazing theme - Fantasy Sci-Fi Great graphics & sound Complex, but not overwhelming Interesting and innovative mechanics - different to other standard 4X games Factions actually feel unique and have different fundamental concepts It's funNow I'm just gonna throw this out there right now, I'm not at all a 4X player. I barely play strategy games. I had a strategy itch so I played this and Age of Wonders 3, and I prefer this to be very honest. It's just a more rounded experience. AoW3 seems to be heavily focused on the combat, and a barely on the empire building aspect. Just two very different games.What can I say, it's good. Watch some videos if you are not convinced. Did I mention that every time you zoom in on the map it looks like a Game of Thrones intro? "

												Endless Legend is a lot of fun, but I definitely don't recommend it for folks who are new to 4x games. I feel bad drawing such a blunt comparison, but Endless Legend is basically like Civ 5 if Civ were set in a fantasy-themed universe rather than the ""real"" world. While I am truly in love with EL's music, art, and lore, the actual game mechanics it can be a bit tiresome and over-complicated; especially when you are new to the game. Even though I enjoyed my time with EL, it's not really a game that I return to often, and things feel a bit...empty, particularly in late-game. Still, though, I recommend this game. It's a bold departure from the themes a lot of 4x games try to use and it's a good continuation of the Endless franchise/story. And it's definitely a lot of fun to play in multiplayer mode! Having a friend or three with you for the ride makes this game a lot more enjoyable. (As opposed to Civ, where I find the addition of other players to generally be cumbersome)			"

												This game lives up to my own expectation. As a ""hesitant"" buyer of games I always take my time and generally come in late when it comes to actually purchasing.I've followed a number of gameplay video's and read many of the reviews. Thankfully I managed to get this on special!It's worth every cent, even at full price - which is a really reasonable price for what you're getting.The game is in-depth, with many different facets and the strategy behind all areas are really good.Also, where else can you design your own individual units with different armour, items and other rpg-ish elements to use inside a fantasy based grand strategy simulation, and create an empire to dwarf all others.10/10.

												Amplitude Studios is on a roll with this and Dungeon of the Endless. Endless Legend really sucked me in whereas I bounced off of Civ 5 and Endless Space for the most part. With EL they've made the world really come to life. Their use of faction quests, writing, and lore is brilliant in the way it marries a traditional campaign mode with your standard random map skirmish mode. The combat is one of the better approaches for 4x games - just enough player input and control to make it interesting and it never drags so much that you feel like auto-skipping all of it by mid to late game. There's also lots of RPG elements in levelling up and perking up your heros and kitting out your troops with advanced weaponry, items, armour, etc. Tons of customization options.The factions themselves all have their own unique story and playstyle - some of them, like the Cultists and Roving Clans play radically different than most 4x factions. The economy and tech tree and city management has huge depth. Tons of strategic possibilities and paths to victory. It is a bit of a slow burn but the music and artstyle and UI all make it a place you don't mind losing hours to.			"

												I didn't know that i like 4x games until i played Endless Legend. This game doses 3 things really well. 1. Gameplay and Factions. There are 8 different factions in this game. Each faction plays different than the others. For example there is a faction that can not make peace with others ever. Or there is a factionthat gets a cut off of the market, because it controlls the market (lorewise). 2. Lore and GameplayWhat leads me to my second point. The gameplay is connected to the lore of the game. The lore itsself is very rich and for fans it is also connected to the other Endless games, likeEndless Space and Dungeon of Endless. 3. Gameplay mechanicsIts interface and game design is simple and complex at the same time. But it is simple enough to be able to learn the complex stuff as you play the game over and over. I never got into CiV 5. I just didn't get it. Now that i played Endless Legend i finally know what these 4x games are all about. That game got to be my game of the year 2014 period.			"

												Endless legends is a game unlike any I have played before. It begins much in the way a game of civilizaiton would, you place a capital and branch out to new cities through the use of settlers, conquests, bribes, and even an intriguing quest system. If you enjoy games like civilization revolution then you will love this unique twist and style that endless legends brings to the genre.While this game is one of the best games of the genre it does have its draw backs. Throughout my play through I began to notice a few irritating things that I feel are necessary to understand about this game before purchase. My first point would be to say that this game is not one that encourages variety. Every faction has three basic units that are unlocked fairly early on, and then they are allowed to assimilate a few minor factions along the way in order to broaden their unit scope. While this may not seem like a big deal to many people it does put certain factions at a major disadvantage against experienced players. My most recent encounter with this is that the Mezari start the game with ranged units that are able to move and shoot all in the same turn, this allows them to kite early game fights and put almost all other factions into the dirt early game. While this may seem like something that many people see as counterable you have to realize that certain factions such as the drakken and the broken lords have no way of countering a ranged unit as they have no late game ranged units of their own without using a valuable assimilation slot.While this game does have its flaws, it is almost impossible to pass up. Its unique quest system sets it apart from the other titles in this genre, as you now no longer have to build a final building but instead with each faction you are encouraged to follow a specific path that will also allow you win the game. Knowing these paths for each faction you are offered a very interesting way of now denying your allies victory, without having to declare war. We also see the hero system in this game help to further its path to the top of my list of most played games. This game rewards those who use its heroes correctly, offering multiple skill tree paths and roles for heroes. A fully leveled hero in this game could be the difference maker in a battle, as a support hero might be what is needed to keep one militia group alive against multiple titans.I strongly recommend this game to any lovers of the civilization series, it sticks to the basic city building aspect of the civ series, all the while giving a unique spin on the battle system and diplomacy system.

												8/10I love the concept behind this game. It's kind of like playing Civilisation V but it has so many unique features that it does kind of feel like a different game altogether. At first, going in with this perspective - I have to admit, I didn't like it. It felt a bit like a poor rip off of the game. Delving into it and giving it a chance anyway, I found that actually I like it quite alot. There are certain aspects from the whole territory dividing feature which gives it a unique twist, a restriction that can be described as welcome (otherwise acquiring resources would be not nearly as challenging) to things like being able to customise your own race. This feature is probably one that is not liked by others, and I can't imagine how it would fare if you played for serious competitivity but between friends - feels like a nice little charm seeing the different strategies that your friends will implement to succeed, whether it be from the quite commonly seen choice of tweaking a class that has already been described by the game itself as Broken or from doing something slightly creative and creating a peace loving clan that unites itself in peace with all bar one to single that clan out and abolish them from the game.(Note to Creators should you ever read this: Please don't ever balance this. I don't mind that it is clear that some races have a typical advantage because that creates creative solutions as to how to overcome them - and I always have found games where balancing happens too frequently to become very bland and lack excitement. That moment when you discover something really cool about a race that gives you a clear advantage over others can really contribute to that feeling of something special when playing any game).The music is brilliant, and has an atmospheric aura that only contributes to the game - I am a fan of the originally created audio in most games, my friends however - not so much. But even they have stated that this game doesn't have one of those repetitive audio tracks that begin to get on your nerves after a while but actually can be listened to and enjoyed throughout the playthrough of the game.The graphics are a lovely touch as well, they update every time you re-tab into the game which is great and they look and feel great. They really contribute again to the atmosphere that you're playing in a war as opposed to some kind of arcade themed strategy game. They clearly have had quite some time put into them too and it's a nice touch - even better that you can play the game with these graphics even on a lower spec computer like my own without experiencing too many issues.One problem I do have with the game though (well actually two, a minor and a major). The syncing issue in multiplayer (being the minor problem) can be a little annoying sometime. I have recently learned that this is likely due to the spec of my computer and so isn't too great an issue but I've noticed for some reason it flags off as unsynced but we can still play for ages anyway. I don't mind ignoring and haven't rated the score I gave accordingly - but thought I'd mention it anyway.The problem that I marked the score down for was the way the game is mapped? I don't know if that's the correct terminology but basically when you try to assign the moves of some of your units, sometimes you'll have to remouse over the tile you want a few times (only happens sometimes, so not unbearable). I'm not sure if this is related to terrain mapping but it's a little annoying and has caused me to make a few poor choices by accident. The problem with this is it does contribute to giving the game a little bit of a laggy feel sometimes (also noticeable in the main menu selection as well by the way) which is a shame because it's a tiny feature which lets the game down a tiny bit - especially on first impressions, which if I was a different type of gamer, could have caused me to simply reject the game on that impression alone.Overall, the game is amazing though. I don't want to end on a bad note and I only rated it two lower in the hope for an aspiration for improvement from the developers. The game is great and I'm really enjoying it so far. I would like to see more classes, units and technologies, as well as more factions but I guess that's what DLC is for. I eagerly await the expansions.Great game Devs.-DNChaos.			"

												It took me around three tries to get into this game as at first coming from Civ V it was a little too , over complicated, different and strange but then bam, I seemed to get the hang of it and now I love the mechanics of the game...You just have to give it a go, experiment and make mistakes and you will do that very much so in the beginning. The tech tree is quite complicated and daunting at first, the quest system can be very distracting and it is slower paced game than Civ V. You have heros who can either lead an army or govern a city and all this takes management. There is some similarities with Civ but also big differences. You have heros to level up as well as troops and this is more comlicated than army upgrades in Civ V. You have districts to upgrade. Apart from that you send settlers out to start cities, you can take over enemy cities with armies and you have diplomacy which is different from Civ V.All the races play differently and each has its own quest line. All in all a very good addictive game which once again like civ is one more turn!!!			"

Posted: January 14, 2015
												Before I type anything else, let me preface this review by saying that the thumbs up I give this game is a very, very hesitant one. Right. Endless Legend is a game by Iceberg Interactive, the strapping folks behind Endless Space. The general consensus for that is while it was a competent 4X with a very good interface, there was very little actual ""meat"" to be had. And honestly, that's how it feels here. The game itself is like any familiar 4X: you start out with a hero (who can settle your first town), along with a few token soldiers to help you explore the world. Bigger cities mean more gold, and more production, and more research. However, Endless Legend throws a few other things into the mix. Some work, some don't. First, there's the quest system. Every race has their own unique quests, along with rather generic ones that anyone can get. And honestly, most of the quests are rather dull. Usually some iteration of ""go to X"". Most of them just feel plain unsatisfying to complete, and feel like a chore. Second, there's the Empire Plan mechanic. 20 turns into the game, you get to set an Empire Plan, which gives your civilization buffs depending how many infulence points you have to spare towards the investments. Once again, it was good to see Iceberg experiment with something new in a 4X, but implementation was lacking. The one thing I did really like was the villager system. Villages are small settlements that belong to minor races, and you can recruit their special units through either defeating them in battle or bribing them. It was something that really made me feel like I was building an empire through a foundation of alliances and trade, which is always nice. The biggest problem this game has, and it's something that's hard to quantify, is that the game just feels *slow*. And not because of its demands on the computer, but just the pace of the game itself. Characters, even on the fastest setting, still take forever to lumber across the map and use up their move points, the battle system is largely the same, and there's just no 'snap' like you'd feel in Civ IV, or Gal Civ II, or hell, even Fallen Enchantress.And this last one is a personal thing, but I've always hated the ""magic is actually forgotten technology"" setting. It just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.You might notice I've said a lot of bad things about this game, but I'm still recommending it. Well, despite its flaws, it's still a rather addictive and competent 4X. It's got its problems, very avoidable ones, but it has a very solid base. If Iceberg's willing to make the effort, they could turn this from a mediocre 4X to one of the greats.			"

												If you found Civilization Beyond Earth to be bland and uninspired, get this game, it's just so much better all around. I haven't played Beyond Earth at all since I got this during the Winter Sale.The design choices are just really good, as they are able to eliminate a lot of the little annoyances that traditionally plague 4x games. There are multiple different ways to play and different strategies to try, just a rich game overall.			"

At the higher difficulty levels though I still find it more difficult than it should be.Overal a very good game!			"

												If you are on the fence about buying this game I'm going to say a couple things first. 1. Check to see if your computer meets the requirements. Double check and triple check it even. I neglected to thinking my computer could run it since it can run a lot of more demanding stuff but turns out it can't so the game crashes a lot at random. I can still play the game but it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to have to watch for crashes and restart the game. 2. You'll get much more enjoyment out of this game if you are already familiar with the Endless Space universe and lore. It's still a fine 4X strategy game but it's not too special if you don't appreciate the Endless Space lore.That being said here's some pro con action.Pros: Excellent soundtrack, keeping in tradition with Endless Space the game is has a very comfy atmosphere with it's musicIt's damn pretty for a 4X game even on low end settings I'm impressed, I'm not sure there's another game out there that compares to this game on the graphics level in the same genre.The AI is challenging but fair, it tends to make some really petty decisions though like ""oh I see your army has visited my lands! you're banned from the market now lol"" but each enemy empire has unique personalities a la the civilzation gamesAs mentioned earlier the lore and universe of Endless Space is important here and if you can appreciate it you'll get more out of the individual faction quests. The quests overall add something unique to the 4X genre and even though all of the sidequests tend to be random the main quests for each faction adds something cool to do when you're not doing other 4X activities.Also keeping in tradition with Endless Space each of your units are completely customizable, well as far as weapons,  armor and accesories affecting unit stats goes.The cons: AI is basically cheating at higher difficulties, this could be considered a pro depending on how you look at it but I don't really like it.The combat, when you aren't auto-resolving, is a bit shallow. It basically boils down to changing positioning and firing orders each turn and watching two armies' numbers roll against eachother. Also if you build ranged units with maxed out initiative you can't lose really it's kind of disappointing. The only counter to this being beefing up the HP of your units so they can survive a couple combat rounds to get in close. You have all these other stats but really it boils down to initiative vs HP. Overall I really like this game. 7/10 would be higher without the crashes.			"

												Wow! I love this genre. 4x strategy and fantasy. There are other reviews that go over some of the details that make this the best 4X game to come out in ages but let me sun it up in one sentense. If you are looking for a 4X game that gives you that 'Just One More Turn' feeling than look no further.Just one bit of advice. Even if you have played games like this before don't go thinking you can skip the tutorial and dive right in. There are so many fresh new game mechanics and concepts in this beauty that you will have no idea what is going on.It's so good that I won't be playing anything else for quite a while. There isn't a game on Steam that gives you more value for the price. I would have gladly paid 'Blue Chip' prices just to support such great indie game developers. Congratulations, Guys. I wish you all the success in the world :) Now get back to work on some DLC so I can que up!			"

												I've been very sceptical towards this game because I'm a fan of Civ and, well, almost every Civ-like game ever made deserved the word ""mediocre"" at best, being a complete clone with boring mechanics.But, god damn, after I've finally convinced myself to buy and try Endless Legend I did not regret for a minute! This is something I've been waiting for ages — fantasy 4X game with a bunch of fresh ideas and mechanics, which does NOT look like a Civ clone.(It still got a lot of things derived from Endless Space though and noone likes self-repeating, but I will forgive and forget about that since this game is a real breath of fresh air in the genre!)

												This game is one of the better 4x games that I've ever played. Each faction that I have played has been very different from the ones that came before it, both in aesthetics and gameplay. The world is gorgeous, the art is gorgeous, the diplomacy screens are gorgeous. The game has this unique techno-fantasy feeling going on.Focus of the game seems to be more on the building than on the heroes, so on the 4x spectrum I would place it closer to civilization than to something like HOMM. The game is a fantasy setting, but there is barely any magic so it also doesn't exactly have the feel of Master of Magic or other fantasy 4x games. Large cities sprawl across the land in a satisfying way, reminding me of what Elemental tried to do but failed at.Combat is different than other 4x games I've played. It is kind of a tactical/real time hybrid. Each fight is six rounds of issuing orders to your units and then watching the orders resolve. Sometimes the way things play out make slower units unable to carry out their planned orders, so a wrench can be thrown into your movement/attack orders.I've been playing on standard settings and each game takes about six hours or so. The time just flies away. It's just so damned immersive.			"

												I've played a lot of strategy games over the years and this is one of the better ones. A lot of 4x games (not including space 4x) tend to be heavily modeled after the Civilization series, not Endless Legend though. This game is very much its own game.Pros:Each Faction plays very differently from each other. Necrophages can't have peace or alliances, Broken Lords don't need food. Drakken can force peace upon another player, Roving Clans can't declare war etc. Each faction truly is a vastly different playstyle.The game is beautiful. A minor thing that just makes it more enjoyable.The battle system is interesting. More in depth than Civ's smack two units against each other, but not as in depth as Age of Wonders 3 where you control each unit on the battle field.The world is very diverse and there are quests, ruins, minor factions etc. that make exploring both profitable and enjoyable.Unit Customization. You can alter your units with different armor, weapons and trinkets to suit your needs. You take a basic unit from your faction (or assimilated minor factions) and equip them with different equipment to make them stronger or more specialized. For instance you could have a lance weilding Stalwart that does a lot of damage, or one that can take as much damage as you throw at it.Heroes: Strong units that lead armies or govern cities. Very useful and very cool.Mixed:The region system is somewhat strange. When you settle a region with a city, you own that whole region. However, only the tiles directly around your city are worked. You also can only found a single city per region. This means that many areas that would make excellent cities are wasted. On the other hand all the strategic and luxury resources in the region can be harvested by the single city. You also don't get AI settling right next to your city to steal a resource like in Civ.Cons:Limited number of Units. Each faction only has 4 base units. You can assimilate different minor factions for their units but there is a limited number of slots to do this. Compared to other games there aren't many units around. However each faction has three unique units (the settler is common to almost all the factions).AI can travel into your territory automatically and can attack your units outside of your territory without declaring war. You have to declare peace for them not to be able to attack your units and declare closed borders to keep them out of your territory. Both of which cost influence.Declaring war costs influence. Severely annoying and pointless. The other diplomatic stuff makes sense. This does not. You don't need to influece someone to declare war, you just attack them.			"

												About a year ago I bought Civ 5 and fell in love with the game. I found myself playing all the time and seeming to never get bored with it. Eventually though I managed to play it into the ground and had to set it aside. Beyond Earth did not evoke the same feelings that Civ 5 did and I have stayed away from the whole genre until now. Let me say this: Endless Legend looks like what I had always hoped the successor of Civ 5 would look like. If you took Civ 5 and expanded on and improved every aspect you would get something very much like this game. The world is beautiful, the combat is tactical and far more dynamic than civ because of fully customizable units, the different factions are actually DIFFERENT with their own units and distinct playstyles. The only thing that is a little disappointing to me is the lack of noticable difference in gameplay as you advance through the tech trees. Your economy gets much stronger and unit stats go up but you are still using the same units, whereas in civ you go all the way from crude stoneage weapons to a modern military with an airforce and nuclear weapons. I suppose that is the result of having a game take place in a fantasy universe. That aside, however, the game is very fun and any fan of the civ series shouldn't think twice about buying it.			"

												My very first 4X game, Endless Legend grabbed my attention above Civ V and Beyond Earth by forgoing a real life setting in favor of a fantasy one. In that regard, EL surprassed my initial expectations. The world of Auriga is fleshed out,  rich with lore. and full of curious races and factions to cross.Each of the playable factions contain a seperate story campaign to accomplish, and each play quite differently. Your playthrough with the peacful and democractic Drakken will prove very different from your playthrough with the aggressive Necrophages.Gameplay in EL is saturated, but not to a fault (I'm still learning after all!). There's a decent tutorial, but to really sink your teeth into it you'll need to sit down for a campaign. Fortunately there's plenty of ways to personalize a campaign's difficulty and world. Unfortunately, it can become a chore to learn, as there's an abundance of sciences and unit customization. Some unit passives and build paths can be poorly explained, and it'll take some digging on your part to really understand how you should be playing a faction to its potential.Fortunately there's plenty of guides available. The online experience varies, but the community's proven friendly and helpful through many of my matches.If you've ever been curious to try a 4x strategy game, and are prepared to sink in the time to learn, Endless Legend's distinguished high fantasy setting, easy to grasp mechanics, and variety of campaigns/playstyles will keep you engaged for a long while. Easily worth it while on sale, still a good buy without, this'll eat up dozens of hours before you've experienced all it has to offer.			"

												Endless Legend is a 4x turnbased strategy game with that plays similar to civ5. Just because it plays like the basics of civ5 mean it is civ5, there is in my opinion many more things that this game has then civ5 does. Each faction is totaly unique and plays completly different then the others, they each have their own lore and each unit looks and acts different from another. Each faction has 4 unique units that have different strengths and weaknesses. Also players start with a ""hero"" which is basically a general from civ5 but that does way more then adding a buff to a unit. There are tons of heros from each faction and each one looks different(heros from same faction has small differences but have different uses) and plays differnetly, one may be used for leading a army by giving it +2 damage while one could be used to govern and town and give it +6 industry. Also every unit can be customized with different equipment to make them stronger as the game goes by, this is simmilar to civ but instead of the unit become a differnet teir(as a musketer becomes and rifleman) the units in this game stay the same except their equipment changes and you can see the difference in appearance do to this change. Also like civ5 there is small factions that are ran by ai, you can add these to your empire by either attacking and defeating them, bribing them, or by completeing quests given by them. Once they join you then you can assimilate them into your empire and then produce their unit that can only be used by assimilating them. The unit is based off that small faction and its appearance is completely differnet to any of the playable factions, there are lots of these small factions that can be conquered by the player. I recomend this game to anyone that loves the Civ games, fantasy or just 4x turnbased strategy game in general.			"

												I've sunk many hours into this game ever since I had to take a few days off after getting sick. I've played through several full games as the different factions and found that each of them is very unique. I'd say that this is the biggest thing that the game has over Civilization V. If you're at all interested I recommend you read up on each of these because it would take too long to explain here. The other two big differences are a quest and combat systems. Unlike Civ5's city state quests, they don't involve racing other factions or killing another city state(there are none). They're a bit more interesting and present some semblance of a story for each of the factions. Of course, there's not much depth to be expected of quests in a 4X game, but they do make the game a bit more interesting. The combat system, on the other hand, isn't very good and is kind of tedious, especially because of the slow animations. So I wouldn't recommend picking this game up just becasuse you like turn-based combat. But still, it's there and does add SOME depth to combat which would otherwise just be RNG-based. I recommend this game, but I'm also not sure if it feels done yet. I've been playing on the 'Hard' difficulty and I've found that diplomacy and other AI behaviors are a bit irrational. I hope this is something that will be addressed in a future patch. I expect it to be.			"

												One of, if not, THE BEST 4X games ever created. So addictive.Pros:-Wonderfully diverse factions each with their own unique style of gameplay.-Amazing UI and detailed maps-Top notch music-Easy to learn but with plenty of nuances to master-Map generator has never dissapointed me-Combat system is much more in-depth compared to Civ. You can beat the odds by careful planning and using your head in most situationsCons:-AI could use some work, normal difficulty feels very easy-Combat can drag out turns in the later game when you have multiple armies on different battlefronts (luckily theres an auto comabt option for those times when you are confident)-End-game could use a little more variety. All of your units are researched by mid game.In the end, all the good parts of this game definitely outshine the bad parts. I'm sure we'll see more content released in the future to further cement this games place in the 4X history books.10/10 "

												If you are on the fence about buying this game I'm going to say a couple things first. 1. Check to see if your computer meets the requirements. Double check and triple check it even. I neglected to thinking my computer could run it since it can run a lot of more demanding stuff but turns out it can't so the game crashes a lot at random. I can still play the game but it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to have to watch for crashes and restart the game. 2. You'll get much more enjoyment out of this game if you are already familiar with the Endless Space universe and lore. It's still a fine 4X strategy game but it's not too special if you don't appreciate the Endless Space lore.That being said here's some pro con action.Pros: Excellent soundtrack, keeping in tradition with Endless Space the game is has a very comfy atmosphere with it's musicIt's damn pretty for a 4X game even on low end settings I'm impressed, I'm not sure there's another game out there that compares to this game on the graphics level in the same genre.The AI is challenging but fair, it tends to make some really petty decisions though like ""oh I see your army has visited my lands! you're banned from the market now lol"" but each enemy empire has unique personalities a la the civilzation gamesAs mentioned earlier the lore and universe of Endless Space is important here and if you can appreciate it you'll get more out of the individual faction quests. The quests overall add something unique to the 4X genre and even though all of the sidequests tend to be random the main quests for each faction adds something cool to do when you're not doing other 4X activities.Also keeping in tradition with Endless Space each of your units are completely customizable, well as far as weapons,  armor and accesories affecting unit stats goes.The cons: AI is basically cheating at higher difficulties, this could be considered a pro depending on how you look at it but I don't really like it.The combat, when you aren't auto-resolving, is a bit shallow. It basically boils down to changing positioning and firing orders each turn and watching two armies' numbers roll against eachother. Also if you build ranged units with maxed out initiative you can't lose really it's kind of disappointing. The only counter to this being beefing up the HP of your units so they can survive a couple combat rounds to get in close. You have all these other stats but really it boils down to initiative vs HP. Overall I really like this game. 7/10 would be higher without the crashes.			"

												I have to say that this is the only 4x strategy game that I have really gotten into, and it is seriously worth it!Here's the shortened version:pros:- different races to play as that actually give a lot of diverse gameplay options- each race has its own (interesting) quest-line and (vibrant) history - quests really give you a purpose and a bit of story to drive you forward and keep you engaged with your faction.- combat system takes the best of Civ V and Total War to create a really fun system!- seasons!- relatively simple interface (you probably need to play the tutorial to fully understand it though)- customise your army units- very sassy AI!- beautiful graphicscons:- you can't see exactly how strong an enemy is before you attack (at least, i havent found a way yet)- tutorial is quite heavy, but also worth it so....- cities are a little hard to see clearly as there is a lot of stuff going on...- it is a little buggy and often crashes when I play multiplayer, but not enough to deter me from the game!The long version:What I like most about this game is the sense of real diversity between each 'culture/races/people'. They each have very specific and drastically different ways of playing them. For example you have a race that is a cult - they can't build extra cities so conquering by force is useless, so instead of soldiers they have preachers who spread their influence and 'take over' other players' settlements through spreading their cult. Another clan is basically vermin zombies who don't even have the option of diplomacy - all they can do is attack other players and eat them or turn their enemies into zombies which they can then control. Or a third one is a bunch of metal armours with souls inside them so they don't require any food resources! There is much more than that but they all have advantages and disadvantages that are really well balanced and truly FEEL different and diverse!On top of that the combat system is really interesting. First of all, each race only gets 4 different base units. That's it. But wait for it..... you get to customise them! As you level them up you get access to tier 2, 3 etc items like armour, weapons, and jewelery which all give you different stats which means you can create different units tailored to your own style of play or needs. For example I'm playing with the woodsland people (not their official name) and i have access only to archers at first. But I have created 2 different types of archers through this system - some are better at fighting infantry units whereas my second class is stronger against flying units. And now I also spent a while upgrading all my unit designs so that I can manufacture better units. There aren't THAT many different options, but there are enough to make it diverse and you can have a lot of fun with it. I also just like the ability to upgrade your units instead of simply receiving new units and you don't really know what they do. This way, I really am getting to know my army for once.Secondly, it's not like in Civ V where your units throw javelins from one hexagon to another hexagon or something like that. In battle you have your little units and they each take up 1 square, so you can control each of them individually, at first you need to decide where to place them (they get advantages or disadvantages based on terrain) and then you decide which enemies they attack. It's the same basic concept as in total war, but with less units and turn-based. You're also able to see the stats of your opponents and so can strategise pretty nicely without it taking forever or being overly complicated.The only down side is that you can't really tell the strength of an enemy army until you have engaged in battle with it (which has meant that 1 and a half of my armies has been accidentally wiped out because of that. But i think that is mostly because i had only archers. Because i didn't have access to anything else at that point because i was focusing on production instead of armies.)Finally, quests. I haven't play that many 4x strategy games but I haven't seen quests like these before. And I love them. I tend to play mostly RPGs because I like story and my main concern with 4x games such as Civ V was that I didn't really care about my people. But not in Endless Legend. Oh no. The quests and bits of story you get gives you motivation and a purpose and that is what is keeping me playing this game! And I don't even have time for it! It feels like there is a story happening - you're not just developing your community for nothing, you've got a purpose and i love that!Basically, it's complex, but simple enough to understand - just the way i like my games.

Early Access Review
								This shaping up to the be the 4X game of the year. It's by the same guys who did Endless Space; their experience with the genre really shines through and it's sort of set in the same universe with similar mechanics. There are some areas they struggled with in the previous game; namely diplomacy and procedurally generated areas. The combat is vastly improved over the original Endless Space, and while there are glaring issues still with balance (AIs getting whupped by minor factions) it's all fairly simple to resolve. There's also a superb choice of playstyles, including factions which cannot go to war but have access to anonymous mercaneries, a faction which cannot be ""at peace"" with anyone, some which are literalyl powered by magical dust and so forth. Worth every penny if version 1 is half the game v0.581 is so far.			"

												I like the game, you should try it.The look is nice, the map system is fun, great ambiant soundtrack.A bit of CIV (science eras progression, diplomacy, city management), a feeling of Heroes of Might and Magic (heroes and armies, building units, improvements, battles on a map).I like the region control, it makes things easier for the ressource extractions and scroring, while still being strategic.I have not tested all the victory conditions, and got raided badly on the first games.The battles are a bit boring, I mostly play them in auto. But sometimes while outnumbered or with Healing Heroes, I play them manually. "

												As  a long time Civ player, i was looking for a new 4X to scratch my itch after the somewhat lackluster Civ: Beyond Earth. Endless Legend is a whole other beast from Civ. So while they are botrh 4X, do not buy thinking it'll just be a fantasy Civ game. That being said, it is an extremely satisfying game, with a complexity that i feel is much deeper than most recent Civ games. From the variety in the factions playstyle, to the absolutely beautiful graphics, the game hits on most points in a unique style not seen in any 4X games.It does have it's flaws such as the heroes who seem similar across the board, to the lackluster AI. The AI is forgiveable due to most 4X games lacking a challenging AI. The Heroes will be addressed at some point as well i'm sure as the devs, seem to always be tinkering with little bits here and there.Overall a very enjoyable experience, and IMO the 4X release of the year. If 4X is your type of game, Endless Legend is worth your time to get to know. Learning curve is steep but worth it.			"

The unit count is a bit on the short side (4 different units per faction) but the storyline and depth more than make up for this.			"

												It's called endless legend, but ends at 300 turns. xDI really want to love this game.  I love playing it.  There are just so many bugs.  If it's not your army getting stuck , it's the round getting glitched out.  After 300 turns it crashes every 3-4 turns.  It would be nice to play once it works better.  I'll check it out again in a few months.  It's utterally un-playable in its current state.The non-stop winter after 300 turns is annoying as well.Wish there was a maybe on the recommend button.Example.The crash report folder names ""2015-1-10_122026"" net to game excutable.The crash report folder names ""2015-1-10_122720"" net to game excutable.The crash report folder names ""2015-1-10_124734"" net to game excutable.The crash report folder names ""2015-1-10_125312"" net to game excutable.

												Very fun to play and is a fresh breath of air after playing many hours of Civ 5. I love the fantasy genre and this has done a good job of placing a 4X game within this genre. Love the quests and the hero system as well as the ability to upgrade and ""create"" your own units by changing their equipment and effectively giving them different passive abilities. However, I would caution new buyers as of right now, the game does suffer from crashes. I had to look up several different workarounds to get it to work on my potato of a computer. Hopefully in the future, a patch will come that will fix all the problems this game has. Overlooking that, this is an excellent 4X game and I will probably log in just as many hours as I did in Civ 5.			"

												Endless Legend is the 3rd game in the Endless series, and as they say, 3rd Time's the Charm!  Though my next words won't really convey that well.This game is unfinished.Everything feels pretty loosely connected (that was the only way I could describe things).  The UI feels weak and seems too small.  Sometimes enemy armies will come out of nowhere and destroy your city in one turn.  These are problems that can be patched out or updated.  (The camera doesn't move to show you important things like enemy movement etc., so you can feel like you're being left in the dark to vitally important things.)  Also, randomly the game will say a huge error has occured, give you a feedback log for you to do nothing with, and then continues running as normal (unless it then decides your next turn will never start, but a quick Save/Reload solves this).However, despite these faults, compared to Beyond Earth, this is the better game.The 9 factions are all fantastic, look wonderful and have great, unique effects, and each one feels very different!  From the Necrophage which are quite literally incapable of learning any form of peaceful diplomacy and feast on the flesh of the living to the Drakken, draconic beings who adore peace and start the game knowing everyone (and everyone knowing them), it's truly wonderful.  You can even make your own factions from scratch!  Of course, in old Endless-4X style, you can customise your armies with equipment that improves over the course of the game (making your units take longer to produce to compensate), it all balances out very well.  Minor Factions you can assimilate into your army also make for important choices on which lands you take and which places you destroy, for each grants you a passive bonus along with a new unit for you to make (and considering each army can only make 3 different military units, this is vitally important).This game is good, you should buy it, but it does have some rough edges, but nothing you can't fix or get over.  Get ready to learn a lot of new stuff and have plenty of fun!			"

												At first, Endless Legend looks like Civ 5 put into a fantasy world. While they have several things in common, mostly building an empire through diplomacy, conquest, and expansion, Endless Legend has several features that separates it from Civ 5.First is how different each of the factions feel and how they are played. In Civ 5, the difference between playing differentfactions generally boils down to small percentages. While these can drastically affect the game, you will mostly play the way everyone else does. In Endless Legend, each faction has its own distinctive traits as well as playstyles. One faction can force peace on other factions while another can teleport their units to cities. These differences become even more interesting as you start creating your own factions. In short, if you find yourself playing the Roving Clans after finishing a game with the Necrophages, you probably won't be using the same strategy.Second is the winter season. Periodically, winter rolls around and generally makes the game harder. Exactly what it does varies from game to game, which can provide a whole new set of challenges with each individual game. It also adds a good bit of difficulty. In Civ 5, the only thing that usually keeps your armies at bay are mountains and other rough terrain. While rough terrain is also in Endless Legend, winter will drastically slow an army down and effectively make combat a fairly rare occurence during winters (at least until the mid to late game as you find ways to become immune to winter's effects). As the winters get longer, the game becomes more difficult, with the actions you take during the summer becoming much more important when the next winter rolls around.Third is unit customization. In Civ 5, your units become better as you advance through the research tree and they are generally static throughout save for the upgrades they get when they level up. In Endless Legend, your units each have their own equipment set that you can customize to your liking. If you're looking to make your ranged unit zip across the map while hitting hard, you can give them the equipment they need to do that (after you research it, anyway). Unit customization also allows your army to adapt to the situation at hand. If you find that your army is equipped to handle flyers while the enemy sent in melee and ranged units, you can retrofit your army accordingly (provided they weren't killed off before you got the chance).These are only a handful of the differences between Civ 5 and Endless Legend. Ultimately, if you're looking for a 4X game with some fresh ideas, you'll probably find it in Endless Legend.			"

												Endless Legend is a nice take on the 4X genre, and I could summarize it as the child of the Civilization and Age of Wonders series. It's focused on tech research and city building and administration like Civilization but still has the very interesting tactical aspect of combat of AoW; moreover, you still have the possibility to upgrade your current units and heroes with the latest weapons, armor and artifacts you have researched -- a bit like what you can do in Stardock's Fallen Enchantress or in the classic Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.A novel aspect of EL with respect of all the games I've mentioned is that the game map is divided into regions and each region can host upto one town only; this makes things a bit more interesting as the town has to be placed strategically in accordance with which resources the single region has to offer.The graphics style is really appealing to me, and the music (that you get also in MP3 format bundled with the game download for free) really nails the mood and tempo of the game.The only bad thing that I can say about EL is that the AI isn't very challenging at all; sometimes it could just stay idle in its initial territory for the most part of the match -- that's what happened to the Mezari in my first ever game. If this one issue is fixed, EL can become a true classic gem of the genre.My vote: 8.5/10PS: I'm still waiting for the Linux release!			"

												8/10I love the concept behind this game. It's kind of like playing Civilisation V but it has so many unique features that it does kind of feel like a different game altogether. At first, going in with this perspective - I have to admit, I didn't like it. It felt a bit like a poor rip off of the game. Delving into it and giving it a chance anyway, I found that actually I like it quite alot. There are certain aspects from the whole territory dividing feature which gives it a unique twist, a restriction that can be described as welcome (otherwise acquiring resources would be not nearly as challenging) to things like being able to customise your own race. This feature is probably one that is not liked by others, and I can't imagine how it would fare if you played for serious competitivity but between friends - feels like a nice little charm seeing the different strategies that your friends will implement to succeed, whether it be from the quite commonly seen choice of tweaking a class that has already been described by the game itself as Broken or from doing something slightly creative and creating a peace loving clan that unites itself in peace with all bar one to single that clan out and abolish them from the game.(Note to Creators should you ever read this: Please don't ever balance this. I don't mind that it is clear that some races have a typical advantage because that creates creative solutions as to how to overcome them - and I always have found games where balancing happens too frequently to become very bland and lack excitement. That moment when you discover something really cool about a race that gives you a clear advantage over others can really contribute to that feeling of something special when playing any game).The music is brilliant, and has an atmospheric aura that only contributes to the game - I am a fan of the originally created audio in most games, my friends however - not so much. But even they have stated that this game doesn't have one of those repetitive audio tracks that begin to get on your nerves after a while but actually can be listened to and enjoyed throughout the playthrough of the game.The graphics are a lovely touch as well, they update every time you re-tab into the game which is great and they look and feel great. They really contribute again to the atmosphere that you're playing in a war as opposed to some kind of arcade themed strategy game. They clearly have had quite some time put into them too and it's a nice touch - even better that you can play the game with these graphics even on a lower spec computer like my own without experiencing too many issues.One problem I do have with the game though (well actually two, a minor and a major). The syncing issue in multiplayer (being the minor problem) can be a little annoying sometime. I have recently learned that this is likely due to the spec of my computer and so isn't too great an issue but I've noticed for some reason it flags off as unsynced but we can still play for ages anyway. I don't mind ignoring and haven't rated the score I gave accordingly - but thought I'd mention it anyway.The problem that I marked the score down for was the way the game is mapped? I don't know if that's the correct terminology but basically when you try to assign the moves of some of your units, sometimes you'll have to remouse over the tile you want a few times (only happens sometimes, so not unbearable). I'm not sure if this is related to terrain mapping but it's a little annoying and has caused me to make a few poor choices by accident. The problem with this is it does contribute to giving the game a little bit of a laggy feel sometimes (also noticeable in the main menu selection as well by the way) which is a shame because it's a tiny feature which lets the game down a tiny bit - especially on first impressions, which if I was a different type of gamer, could have caused me to simply reject the game on that impression alone.Overall, the game is amazing though. I don't want to end on a bad note and I only rated it two lower in the hope for an aspiration for improvement from the developers. The game is great and I'm really enjoying it so far. I would like to see more classes, units and technologies, as well as more factions but I guess that's what DLC is for. I eagerly await the expansions.Great game Devs.-DNChaos.			"

												This game is an interesting one for sure. The base game is entertaining to a degree, with it's own uniqueness to similar games of the type. It is set apart by atmosphere provided by an amazing soundtrack, beautiful visuals, and mystical or enchanted events. Once the dlc's come into play; however, Endless legend takes on several new dimensions of gameplay, lore, and frontiers. They add interesting new empires and gamechanging mechanics. They may be perhaps a bit pricy if you have a small budget like me, but it is made up for by the fact that only the host needs the dlc for the entire game to enjoy it's effects and play the expanded game. Definitely worth the money for all the dlc if you end up enjoying the base game alone.			"

												As a big Civ fan, I was expecting this to be a worse, fantasy take on the series. My first impression didn't do much to change that.However, stick with it. The learning curve is nowhere near as steep as it looks, and the reward is a game that plays like the sort of take on Civ 5 that you wished Beyond Earth would have been. There's depth in areas that Civ is shallow in (specifically, the tactical combat system), and some of the more tacked-on feeling mechanics of Civ have been stripped down to the basics or left on the cutting room floor. It's a leaner, tighter game.Better than Civ? I don't know that I'd go that far. But it's very different, and it's absolutely worth a try.			"

												Innovated the only mechanic that really set Sid Meier's Civ 6 apart from its predecessor: District mechanics. Combined with factions, a deep world that merges science fiction and fantasy, campaign narratives that motivate the development of your empire, and RPG style unit customization, you have a game that, historical♥♥♥♥♥♥aside, knocked Civilization down from the pinnacle of the 4X genre.Now that Civ 6 has implemented this same special mechanic, it's really just a matter of price. I highly recommend Endless Legend if you can get it on the cheap!			"

												It's a good strategy game.  Also, the surge of negative reviews about this game have nothing to do with its quality.  They are the result of a bunch of Chinese players who are angry that the game developers took down a Chinese translation mod.  However, the only reason the developers took down the mod was because it linked to a pirated version of the game, and the mod creator refused to remove the link.  I'm sure it sucks not to be able to play the game in your native language, but due to the circumstances surrounding that unfortunate result it's really not a valid reason to negatively review the game.

												This one's a bit of a tough recommendation. If youo're looking for a 4x game with a really intriguing story and a neat take on the 4x formula, this is a great game. Also, be prepared to do a lot of micro managing. If you're into that (as I am) you'll have a lot more fun with it. The story behind each of the 8 playable factions is deep enough to get invested in, but open enough for the player to make their own story out of it. However, there are some very frustrating things with the quest system. Quests are a very important part of the game, but they are by far the weakest part. There are many quests whose completion requirements are overly specific in what is required, and yet strangely general in how they are told. Many times I thought I completed a quest and hadn't because of some minor detail which wasn't fully recounted. For example, one quest required me to grow a city to the size of 8. The city was already at a size of 14, but the quest didn't complete. I had to starve the city down to 7 population, and then re-grow it to get the completion on the quest. Possibly that was intentional, but it was extremely frustrating. Twice, the game actually bugged in such a way that completing a quest was impossible.There have also been more than a few crashes, but the game autosaves every turn so it's not that much of a problem, and with luck that will get fixed in a later patch. Overall, mostly great 4x game that could use a few patches. If the quests are fixed and the crash bugs are removed, this game is very solid.			"

												GOOD:- Pretty. Sparkly.- Factions play quite differently from each other.- Frequently updated, with an expansion coming soon.- Customizable factions, and lots of world generation options.- Minor factions (think city states) can give you passive bonuses and unique units.- Lots of win conditions.- Reinforces my opinion that winter is the worst season.MIXED:- The combat is weird. You assemble military units into armies, which can be moved around as a group, so you don't have to give orders to each of your fifteen thousand units. Then you smash your armies into other armies. You have very little control over actual fighting, which can be annoying, but if one army is much stronger than the other, you can just auto-resolve the fight to save time.BAD:- UI is too busy, and the text is too small.- No mini-map or strategic mode.- Diplomacy needs major changes, as any agreements you make can be broken immediately. (Market ban rage!!)- Almost nobody is playing multiplayer.- There's no way to tell a city to produce nothing (or just gold/science like Civ). It will nag you every turn.- The AI is mega stupid and unfriendly, even on the easiest difficulty.- The world is split into pre-defined regions, and you can only have one city per region.- Quests are too strict. I've had to raze several of my own cities in order to re-do stuff the quest demanded.- Certain sounds don't behave according to volume settings.- I have a good computer, and yet a duel between me and an AI lags worse than a six person Civ multiplayer game.- No steam workshop at the moment.- Very few characters for city/army names.This sounds like a lot of complaining, but I actually like the game. It just hurts my eyeballs after a while. It's not better than Civ 5, however. If you've never played this sort of game before, seriously get Civ 5 instead. If you've already played Civ and want something new, this is a decent pick up.			"

												Cookie cutter, copy paste, same-same.These are all words that have been used to describe many, many 4x strategy games in recent years.For those few that are not in the ""know"", 4x stands ""eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate"". In the past the 4x genre was an interesting and innovative hybrid of strategy games. Unfortunately many have been taking the ""safe"" route. (Read UNinteresting and UNinnovative.)Then Endless Legend walked into the room like a boss, announced that it didn't like the tried and true. It told us that it didn't care what people thought of it.And it truly doesn't, and I love it for that.It brought us many new or semi new features, some that it came up with on it's own, some that it borrowed.The first thing that comes to mind, is the region system.Gone are the days of spamming cities on every open piece of dirt, whether valuable or not, (Cough-Civ series-Cough) Now every section of the vast continents of land is divided up by regions in which only one city may settle upon. Certain factions are even penalized for expanding onto them too quickly.It creates an atmosphere that makes each and every one of the cities in your kingdom seem more unique and important.Instead of thinking of it as just another city, now I think of it by its name and history.Speaking of regions, there are a wealth of resources in them, both strategic and luxury that can implemented in different manners. Sell and trade them or use them as boost for different affects. They apply different bonuses for your cities, troops and for you kingdom overall.Resources not enough for you? How about natives? Each region has different native populations that can be assimilated, either by force, bribery or peaceful means. Different species bring interesting boosts to the region and can even be recruited. Ever felt like fielding an army of wolf/human hybrids? Now you can.---All layers of the standard 4x are here, diplomacy, economy, expansion and combat. All are done well.I really enjoyed the diplomacy, and that happens to be a vastly overlooked feature in most strategy games.But not here. My only wish is that many of the features were not locked behind technology research.Now that I mentioned technology, Endless Legends has its own view on research trees. It is rather standard with only a few minor twists, there being 6 different ages, all bringing new technologies to research.Sometimes it seems cluttered and sometimes big decisions must be made. I'm not a huge fan and I hope they rework it through patches.But it's not big enough of a problem to really detract from the game overall.---That's racist.With only 8 different races to choose from, it may sound like their aren't a-lot of options there.But instead of 40 different copy-paste races with a few minor bonuses to switch things up with, Endless legends 8 races all play vastly different from each-other and make each play-through seem like you're playing a different game altogether.In the wise wise words of Lloyd Christmas, ""I like it alot"".---Troops and heroes. The backbone of every 4x, at first glance it appears that this is one of the down failings of Endless Legend, when in fact it is a strong point.Your standard kingdom only has 4 different soldiers, which sounds like a bummer. That is until you realize that they can be upgraded in many different ways and the aforementioned native and independent troops that can be bought, traded or assimilated into you kingdom. All customizable.True, they aren't as customizable as some games have striven to make theirs, but in Endless Legends, your choices on each piece of gear is strategically important.My only complaint here is that upon equipping a new piece of armor, one cant visibly see a difference in the character sprite, that is slightly disappointing and will hopefully be patched later on.On to heroes! While they can be leveled up, perks and bonuses chosen, extra gear and and gadgets equipped, they seem rather dull.Don't get me wrong, they are very important to a successful army, just the heroes themselves have no real personalities or real distinctiveness, which in a unique game full of personality, it really sticks out like a sore thumb.---Music and graphics.While these two are less important for a strategy game, they really do need mentioning.Rarely have I seen or heard such a beautiful game. The graphics are georgeus and relay a real sense of immersion. I believe this may be the most graphically lush 4x I've ever played.The music is phenomenal. I've never bought a game's soundtrack before, but I will this one.The music is rendered in the up-most quality, I can't say I've heard such a soundtrack since Arcanum. and that is the biggest complement I can fathom.---Overall, I give this game a high recommendation for any fan of 4x strategy games. It managed to pull me deeper than many of its peers in the gaming market. I do not regret this purchase in the slightest, and that coming from a poor man, well that means a-lot.There are some balancing issues here and there, but with Amplitude-Studios track record, it's safe to say that they will be fixed shortly. That and the addition of modding support, the only direction this game is going, is up.I've seen what dedicated moders can do with the proper support and that has the potential to add years and years of playability.If your into 4x and you want something that doesn't come from an assembly line, you couldn't do better than Endless Legends especially for the price.For those poorer gamers like myself, Christmas time at Steam is coming!

												This game got some recent backlash from the Chinese userbase. More details here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/289130/discussions/0/355043117503038170/tl;dr No negative changes to the game itself. Chinese translation mod has pirate link in description, user refuses to remove pirate link, Amplitude utilize Steam TOS to remove mod. Chinese users mad.Phoey to that. I'm excited for the upcoming Tempest expansion, so here's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, brief, said-before review of the game in it's current state: the Shifters expansion.8/10 would recommend.Some good: * Races have mechanical differences. From as simple as starting with certain research techs for free (which goes further than I'd have thought to giving each faction their own feel), to being completely unable to utilize a resource with the trade off of being more adept at exploiting another.* Custom factions. ""Oh boy, I wish I could play as the Vaulters but get the ability to assimilate minor factions like the Cultists!"" You can! You're given a point budget, a pool of bonuses / penalties (base faction abilities & more generic options), Getting that Cultist ability will cost you points, but if you also adopt penalties, such as a generic hit to a resource, or a race specific such as Dust Lords being unable to utilize Food, you can points back to spend on more bonuses -- probably something to increase your Dust, since now you need to buy your population. And since you can't use Food, you may as well get some points back by penalizing your Food gain .... Some meh:* Combat can take some adjustment, and is sometimes a chore. Each team takes their turn simultaneously, and even though YOUR army gets 'stuck' when an enemy army decides to walk into you, you'll find yourself chasing after a wont-stop-and-engage npc army -- hopefully not running out of movement points before them. Workable, but bothersome. Same for the manual combat - there's a great depth to be found in the different outfitting of your units and compositions of your army, but you'll need to adjust to ordering your troops around. Tip: only give complex orders to units who have initiative higher than the enemy units.* Visibility. This one pains me, because it is so important. If you leave FIDSI (food, industry, dust, science, influence) gains showing all the time, you'll have a lot of trouble seeing the terrain. When you're deploying for manual combat, you might have trouble seeing what tiles you can deploy to. When you're trying to see the borders of your cities exploitations, colors might blend together in a bothersome fashion, and your own city name-plate might get in your way.			"

												If you are new to 4X games i would not recommend this, as the learning curve is quite large. However, if you are a veteran of games like Civ 5, then you can easily transition into this. You may have to watch a few hours of youtube learning the traits of the faction your playing though.But it's worth it, the gameplay, graphics and music are amazing. The battle system is very creative, allowing you to stack units in a roaming army, and when in battle mode it enables more strategic placement of units, such as melee, ranged and support. You can have a hero that levels up overtime (same as your units) equip them with various types of armour to increase different desirable stats. There are heros that are more suitable for army generals, governors of cities, or spies.Every faction is vastly different to eachother, having their own preference for victory types, others prefer war or peace, economy or science. There are 10 vastly different factions, with unique gameplay traits and personalities.tis good			"

Pros- Innovative (looks like Civ VI is taking some pointers from this game)- Satisfying city building (the district system is great)- Beautiful Graphics- Wildly different factions/civs- Interesting combat- Meaningful diplomacyCons- Manual combat is slow and while very interesting, feels unpolished.- Notable learning curve (provides for a lot of potential skill, but it takes some getting used to. Nowhere near as bad as dwarf fortress but way more severe than Civ)- Multi-player is even slower (Sometimes you need to use manual combat and this kills the multi player experience. I would recommend this for solo play. Muli-player just takes too long.)On the whole, I'd recommend this game to fans of strategy games. It may not be the most polished game in some ways, but it is unique, innovative and fun so it's well worth checking out.			"

												A fantastic take on the 4x turn based genre, Endless Legend offers an incredible amount of play time for a reasonable price. Mind you, I got it for twenty bucks.Take Civ 5 or similar games, and boost the amount of depth and number of features, then throw in some fantasy elements and you've got Endless Legend. Yeah, it is missing some gameplay features such as naval combat and all that, but the game is still being developed and new expansions are being released.All in all, the game is truely a gem.			"

												Endless Legend is not just another 4x game or Civilization (V) rip off. In fact it is a beautiful piece of art that, as oppose to other Games, does not only offer a more challenging gameplay, but thanks to the soundtrack and story, an outstanding atmosphere. While playing Endless Legend you do not only feel the 'need' to win, but to survive. Auriga is dying and you can feel it the more you play it, the more time you spend on the planet and the more winters you outlive. The whole game is being underlined by an excellent soundtrack that perfectly fits into the world where you have to solve quests which might award you with huge advantages towards the other races and change a combats outcome. Speaking of which, it is a bit different to fight your enemies. It is somewhere in between the battles of the Civilization series and Age of Wonders as you have a hero with an army that you can move through the map, but while you are in combat these units are taking their positions on it instead of dragging you into a completely different map. It makes the battles more tactical than in Civilization, but not as overdrawn as in Age of Wonders.The units' design fits perfectly into each faction and they can be modified with new weapons while you explore new technologies, but it does not change their appearance and the units are usually limited to 4 different kinds per race. Every faction offers a unique gameplay. They have various motives (which are usually comprehensible), storylines and therefore individual quests. The heroes of each race have, instead of the ordinary units, different artworks and some of them might only be obtained by finishing quests.The game itself is getting a bit more difficult the more winters you survive as they keep on lasting longer, dropping your production and limiting your units' movement. It is especially outlined by different and beautiful terrains that also offer variant gains. The games' design may remind some players of Endless Space and might confuse you at the first look, but as you spend more time playing it, you learn more things about the resources, units, and advantages as well as disadvantages that come along with every tactical choise you make. Overall this game adds a surprisingly refreshing gameplay which stands out from other 4x games with its charm, beauty, tempo and atmosphere, but cannot completely satisfy with its battles and poor number of units and their slight customization. I would definitely recommend this game to every 4x or strategy games fan.			"

												This game is awesome, takes an extremely long time though. If the developers used this games story, scene, and all of it's metals and resources, they could make a badass MMORPG.7/10 Vaulters ftw.			"

												4x game focused more on emire building. Diverse factions, intresting stories, lots of room for cutomization of maps and units. Battle system isn't the greatest, but it is fair. Closest thing to a Civ game with a rich fantasy world.			"

												This is a great game.   The graphics are fantastic.  The maps are beautiful and the gameplay is solid and fun.  I am a fan of empire management and tactical combat .. this game combines both very well.  This is part RPG, part RTS, and part 4X ... its new and fresh in its approach.   Pick this one up!It's a BIg Chewy - 8/10			"

												This one's a bit of a tough recommendation. If youo're looking for a 4x game with a really intriguing story and a neat take on the 4x formula, this is a great game. Also, be prepared to do a lot of micro managing. If you're into that (as I am) you'll have a lot more fun with it. The story behind each of the 8 playable factions is deep enough to get invested in, but open enough for the player to make their own story out of it. However, there are some very frustrating things with the quest system. Quests are a very important part of the game, but they are by far the weakest part. There are many quests whose completion requirements are overly specific in what is required, and yet strangely general in how they are told. Many times I thought I completed a quest and hadn't because of some minor detail which wasn't fully recounted. For example, one quest required me to grow a city to the size of 8. The city was already at a size of 14, but the quest didn't complete. I had to starve the city down to 7 population, and then re-grow it to get the completion on the quest. Possibly that was intentional, but it was extremely frustrating. Twice, the game actually bugged in such a way that completing a quest was impossible.There have also been more than a few crashes, but the game autosaves every turn so it's not that much of a problem, and with luck that will get fixed in a later patch. Overall, mostly great 4x game that could use a few patches. If the quests are fixed and the crash bugs are removed, this game is very solid.			"

												This game is really good. It looks like art. I love it.My friend and I played it and I had an issue joining our saved game. We had to use a previous save file for the game to work. When it did work it ran smoothly and even has settings to enlarge the UI for big-screen setups along with a lot of other options to fiddle with.I think this would be a good purchase if you enjoy resource management and RPG elements in a fantasy setting. Definately satisfied with my experience.			"

												This is a superb 4xLite game, New ideas keep the traditional 4x model moving forward preventing being stuck with the ever present ideas in a lot of similar games. The unique factions and their benefits and deficits makes experiementing with all factions a very appealing proposition.The visuals are where this game really soars past all of it's competitors, It is simply stunning to look at with a very distinct and wonderfully coloured enviroment to play in, If you're a fan of 4x or strategy games in general this game is a must.

								I was playing a game on easy, I was the Vaulters and I where going for thier recommended victory of science to the max! Later inbt eh game after I and another faction derstroyed the bug faction leaving 2 bots and me to race for victory, by now my empire was on two large islands with another empire in the middle due to me having killed the bug feaction that was on another continent, now I only have one army that runs around killing roaming neutral units one day a ♥♥♥♥ing hug as army of neutral units spawned in the area of my empire where my army was not precent. I only have one army since all of the remaning factions are going for economic science of democratic victory, so I was no prepared to be assaulted by and army of homocidal demons... scuffice to say I lost a third of my empire.But it's early access and I assume the spawn was a bug, the game was GREAT, and I was only expecting it to be okay... the combat is a bit meh but the auto resolve seems to be doing a fair job so it's cool. If you like CIV or AoW you will probably like this one, though you might want to wait for the release because they promise a tutorial by then and I still get confused by things after 4 games all which I left unfinished because I played easy to learn and when you play easy and get ahead there is no real threat except for weird♥♥♥♥♥spawns.

												A fun strategey game reminsciant of Warlords for the Amiga. Calm soundtrack and serene visuals, and calmly sucking the life out of those that oppose you so your civilization's vast armies can tread into opposing lands and crush them, and drain their lives too. Great game, and I recommend buying it when its on sale.			"
