												Majestic Nights is a flawed gem. In terms of issues, the combat and AI are clunky and very easy to take advantage of, once you understand the system. Technically speaking, the graphics look like something that would be home on a tablet rather than your desktop PC.If you can look past these issues, the game has a lot to offer. The focus on stealth is refreshing. The writing is solid, giving you just enough information to keep you interested, while also keeping you (mostly) in the dark. The references to real world conspiracies and plots are well done, presuming you are at least familiar with the subject material. The atmosphere is arguably the strong point of Majestic Nights. Stylistically, the visuals are bright and bold and oozing with 80s flair. The soundtrack is phenomenal. The season pass offers pretty good value. The soundtrack is probably worth the $20 alone. There is also a Pen and Paper RPG on the way, which is not something you see offered everyday. It's not a game for everyone, but it certainly has its merits.			"

A flawed work with a cool vision. In the neon-soaked noir of the 1980s, every conspiracy is true, and John Q. Cardholder and private investigator Callie (Cal) are knee-deep in weird. Despite appearances, gameplay is more like a real-time Shadowrun Returns than Hotline Miami. Combat is pretty primitive and mostly consists of sneaking, stealth, assassinations, and brief moments where you clear out several baddies at a time by exploiting their primitive AI to lead them right around a corner and straight into your waiting assault rifle.Things are a bit buggy and/or kludgy, but hopefully that'll get ironed out as the series progresses through the rest of its episodes. The cool story hook and awesome music were enough to get me in on a season pass.			"

												This RPG would appeal to fans of the RPG Shadowrun Returns. It has a very similar feel and gives off that same vibe. The combat is live action, but FEELS like it should be turn based. The controls are pretty straight forward, although 360 controller users might get confused at first, particularly while using the gun(Right stick aims).The game takes place in an alternate 80's. In this reality conspiracy theories and cover ups are all real. It's full of nostalgic references for those of us who called the decadent decade home, and is a fascinating glimpse into the 80s paranoia fueled mindset that would eventually spawn the 90's hit series X-Files.This game is everything an RPG fan could ask for, and the only real downside is that it's taken so long for episode 2 to release.

												Has potential. It really does.But it's buggy, the controls are floaty and sometimes don't even respond, and stealth just does not work at all.The music is great, the story is interesting, and the graphics are perfectly fine.But it's the little things, like spelling and grammar errors that make this game look awfully amateurish.This is a game that needs a little bit of an overhaul.

												--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT: Episode One ReviewEpisode one picks up where Episode Zero left off and has you playing as Cal - a private investigator who has been hired by a shadowy figure called ""The Suit"". The Suit has tasked you with tracking down Cardholder for him. Episode One is for all intents and purposes an extension of the prologue and plays very similarly. You'll go to different locations, gather intelligence on your target and wind up in a secret location, hot on their trail. Some of the issues i mentioned in my previous preview are much more pronounced in episode one, such as janky, aggrivating shooting mechanics and confusing plot. They do make it a chore to play the game at times, but overall things are still enjoyable.Overall I gave Episode one a 7/10. You can read my full review of Episode One here:http://criticalindiegamer.com/2014/11/majestic-knights-chapter-one-covert-genesis-review-pc/Having just complete the Chapter Zero prologue, I'm impressed...if a little confused. ButI am sure all will make sense in due course.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Episode Zero Majestic Nights transports you back to an alternate reality 1980s and puts you in the shoes of an enigmatic character called ""Cardholder"". In Chapter Zero you'll find yourself interrupting your neighbour while he is on the toilet, you'll beat up a bouncer at a nightclub, and gun down lots of secret agents.I couldn't really make sense of the story, but I think that's intentional. There's lots of talk about faked moon landings, MK Ultra, Illuminati and various other conspiracies. If you are into that kind of thing you'll have a blast.The game plays out a bit like Shadowrun, except with realtime gun battles instead of turn based. You are given various different dialogue choices for every conversation, and you can choose to play the nice guy or be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you so please.Gunplay is a little finicky but still rewarding. Holding the RMB brings up your gun with an accompanying laser sight so you can aim accurately. Clicking the LMB fires the gun. Action sequences revolve mostly around cover shooting, and you'll have to brace yourself up against something to stay out of the line of fire.With Chapter Zero set to release for free, you might as well pick it up and give it a go. It's short at around 1 hour long, but there's lots here for fans of cover shooters, stealth games , or conspiracy theories.For a more in- depth write up, check out my preview at:http://criticalindiegamer.com/2014/10/majestic-nights-preview-pc/ "

												This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess so far. While I like the dialogue (what little there is,) the art style, and the music, the majority of this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stealth mechanics, frustrating combat, and bugginess. The AI is alternately dumb as a bag of rocks or clairvoyant - capable of shooting you through walls or thwarted easily by waiting for them to lose interest in the gun wielding, big haired assassin they just saw running past them. Your character can generally only take a few hits before dying in a ten second long slo-mo death animation (which you'll be seeing a lot if you play on hard mode - here's a hint; don't) and your enemies either go down with a single hit or as much as three bullets / katana swipes. When you die, you get to do the whole sequence over again! I was having fun with this game until the second chapter - Cardholder's story is generally a bit less actiony-shooty, although after a certain point the investigative adventure game aspect of the game is seemingly tossed out the window in favor of horrendous stealth and fighting with Cal's second chapter. It's also buggy. The AI can often see you through walls and shoot you through them. You will get objectives you've already completed. You will see conversations that have already happened happen again. You will not be able to talk to certain characters despite their being highlighted. Enemies will somehow vanish between loading screens. What's good? I -sorta- like the story, though I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what's going on with it. You're basically thrust into the plot with absolutely zero lead up or introduction, no idea who you're playing as, what their motivations are, what's at stake, who the bad guys are... is this one of those rare games that would benefit from a narrative text dump? Yes, probably. Or, y'know, a cutscene, something to establish what's even happening. I also like the art. The dialogue is witty and very 80s, which is exactly what you should expect. Music's also fine - I have a softness for techno and electronica. To be honest, I'm disappointed so far in what I've seen. I was really looking forward to playing a game with this sort of concept, but the shortfalls in gameplay and story make it nigh intolerable right now. However, since Majestic Nights is coming out in installments, I imagine there's plenty of time for the developers to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and iron out the terrible aspects of this game. Hopefully. Right now, it's a waste of 20 bucks - stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from a season pass until they improve on this.			"

												The reviewer who compared the feel to Shadowrun Returns has it exactly right. For my money this means Majestic Nights is darned good fun: full of good humour, fun action, great atmosphere and some fascinating over-arching conspiracy stuff to tie it all together. Makes me glad I picked up a Season Pass just in time for Episode 2. It's not without its flaws -- in particular that this engine, like SRR's, isn't super well suited to stealth mechanics -- but the fun outweighed the flaws for me by a comfortable margin. Worth getting.			"

												Majestic Nights. 10/10 would push it to the limit.80's L.A. , Synch-pop music, stoners , gangsters, CIA , Conspiracy and a badass cop.Great Atmosphere similar to Hotline-Miami but also includes great RPG system and choices how you deal with your objectives. Stealth system is quite fine, until you draw your gun and shoot your way out like Clint Eastwood or like James ""Sonny"" Crockett from Miami-Vice. I must say, I am a 80's lover, so I really enjoyed the game.Bad things about this game? Dialog speed during cutscenes and in-game. They are going too fast to read and are disturbing. And also, game has different mission / scenarios , that you need to buy as dlc or with a season-pass , sadly I felt like I was kinda ripped-off a little bit.If you are an indie-game lover or 80's lover like me. Buy this game, dont wait and push it to the limit!			"

												Not bad. Its worth $5. Its a point&Click without really pointing and clicking. More like walking and then clicking. The music fits, the scenes look just like they should for the story line and premise. Some of the dialogue feels a little cheesy but then again, the 80's was cheesy.My only real complaint is with the aiming system on the gun. It almost seems as if it fights you. I think they couldve done better with a free floating, mouse controller crosshair. And for some reason in the bar/club scene (Whisky) a lot of the patrons that are sittings are cut in half (torso on the floor) until I enter the area. then they correct themselves.Overall its good way to kill some time and $5. I thought it was going to be a little more action intense but thats ok. Just know that its more of an adventure/easy puzzler/story-driven game. Its also a little easier to play with a controller. So if you have one, plug it in.			"

Dont get why they say that it wants to look like Hotline miami (complete different game). The music is nice, did not find so many bugs(Its been updated). Usually is 5 euros now its 3.....the price is hilarious for more than a couple hours of gameplay with a ""to be continued"" ending (its one chapter and a half). I think it should be re-reviewed to be more fair also with the creators. Its funny and entertaining but short (for now).....maybe when all chapters are released can be recommended more generally.

												Majestic Nights' mechanics are still a little rough around the edges, but it gets full marks for flair and atmosphere. The smooth neon aesthetic, the synth cheese soundtrack and the gritty action dialogue of the first episode's protagonist are pure joy for anyone who is into 80's nostalgia bombs and more than make up for the little flaws in execution of the gameplay.Combat is a little bit clunky, being mainly stealth mechanics with some basic cover and shoot that doesn't leave a huge amount of room for clever tactics, but I get the feeling that the combat will never be the first focus of this series; it's all about the story, characters, dialogue choices and delightfully cheese-y 80's setting.Anyone who is into the 80's or who enjoys fun Indie projects should consider giving Majestic Nights a closer look.

												From playing the prologue I can see this game does have potentional, the base mechanics are there they just need to branch them out a lot more, they need to span out on things you can interact with, reward the player with exploring different places rather than, ""Go to point A, do this at point B, and exit at point C"". the game is interesting I can't deny that, they just need to polish it up more and put more features within the game. Also I did notice with playing the prologue there we're a lot of bugs nothing game breaking but just things such as NPC's clipping into objects such as seats and tables when ever I moved around they would change positions at times. Also only 2 chapters? I completed chapter zero very quickly it seemed really short I even went through it again to see what other dialogue I could find. Overall it's an alright game nothing amazingly special they can expand it on a lot more and i'm sure it will turn out to be a great game maybe add some voice acting for the future? Id give this game in its current state a      6/10			"

												There are negative comments that compare this $5 title to full price major titles like Deus Ex Machinma. So for $5 you are getting good bang for your buck. FFS it's an indie title that is the price of a cup of coffee. It has a good 80's retro art style simmilar to Borderlands. An off the beaten track gameplay, which can only be a good thing, unless you like playing the same game over and over. Cool story and it is episodic. So you get more story later on. Yes the humor and story are high brow, so if you aint real good with words and stuff maybe skip it. If you like wit and thought it's hard to go past.			"

												This game gets a lot of flack and I don't see why.EPISODE 0 REVIEW I just finished Episode 0 of Majestic Nights, an episodic game available on Steam for £3.99 for the first episode and 'Episode 0' which is a prelude to the main game, and you can buy the season pass with the other 4 episodes (which are coming at a later date) for £14.99.So, it was alright as a prelude episode. It took about 40 minutes to complete and seeing as it was a free bonus and not a main episode, I hope the first episode of the game isn't this short. It's entertaining and clearly wants to be Hotline Miami, with a similar theme, soundtrack and visual style to HM. The gunplay was a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥and I felt invincible but it was exciting to kill enemies the first few times around.There's multiple-choice sequences in the game in the form of speech and it really allows you to complete the missions multiple ways which I like and the writing was pretty decent and made me laugh a few times.I'm gonna go play Episode 1 now but Episode 0 was a 7/10.EPISODE 1 REVIEWFinished Episode 1 of Majestic Nights. It was also short, but was really fun and playing as a different character while on the search for the previous character was a cool way of twisting things around. A lot more action in this episode and if the Season Pass ever goes on sale, I'll pick up the rest of the episodes. Pretty fun game.7/10 so far. "

												I was really excited. I thought this game was going to be a call back to Fallout and other classic RPGs. I loved the concept and the art style to pieces. However, what it really turned out being was a buggy, underdeveloped, and repetitive mess. I don't even think that a good dab of polish could fix this. You're either talking to people (which is more simplistic than I've seen it in just about any other RPG), or you're doing cover based shooting. Hell, the only thing that seperates this from a generic cover based shooter like ""Gears of War"" is the vaguely isometric perspective. It's a dull and watery game wearing an older and more complex game's hat.I can only hope that the developers take this criticism to heart and improve upon their product, because I think with the right tweaks and craftsmanship this game could become really great, instead of the amateurish product it is now. The game is far from irredeemable. If the team really pulled through and made some stellar later chapters, and perhaps thoroughly patched out these ones, then I might feel like it's worth recommending. As of now however, I can not, in good faith, recommend this game.			"

Can come off as challenging but once a basic understanding of a given level is understood it can be completed in minutes.

Use the money to do something nice for someone you know. And if you don't know anyone then spend the money to make a new friend. It's better spent this way and you'll have a much funner adventure.

There are some disturbing truths to be uncovered under the iconic Whiskey-A-Go-Go bar located on the seedy streets of L.A and he will speak, sneak, and shoot (the important three S’s) his way through to get his answers...For the rest of the review please visit, http://www.gamershonesttruth.com/majestic-nights/ "

												In one sentence, the creators of  Majestic Nights aimed for the ground and missed. The basic premise of an action-adventure game in a setting where all conpiracy theories being true sounds interesting, or did when Deus Ex and the Secret World used it anyway, but this thing is too buggy, unfiinished, and plain shoddy to even be put up for sale. The worst part is, even if it worked properly it would still be nothing but a plot made entirely of vague and uninformative references to cosnpiracy theories split up by repetitive shooting sequences.Just save your money. Even if you want to play this game because you're hoping to enjoy how bad it is, you should realize this is exactly the kind of game that exists to pad out mediocre bundles. By next month you'll be able to get it along with five or six shoddy mobile ports for a dollar.			"

												Cool little game. It's like a spiritual prequel to Deus Ex. The dialog is fairly amusing, and the locations are delightfully seedy hotbeds of crime and conspiracy. The stealth leaves a little to be desired because it's not easy to stay in cover, and you can't pan the camera so it's hard to tell when the coast is clear, but it's good enough that you don't need to spend the whole game shooting people. It's neat how many places you can get through by talking your way in too. Not a high budget AAA extravaganza by any means, but one of the better indie action adventures i've played. Looking forward to the next chapters.			"

												The best way to compare this game to something is to compare it to hotline miami, only done less arcady and with dialogs which matter little, but it adds to the game. Now unfortunately the game has a way less intense and way more bland soundtrack, making the experience worse then it could have been. But as it is the case with many games it should be judged on its own, not compared to other games.It has its own feel of the '80s', however the cars used seem to be from 50s-60s, the streets are as good as modern detroit, and its supposed to be somewhere near los angeles by the looks of it. Its minor details which dont make too much difference anyway.Now the gameplay isnt perfect, the shooting system is pretty bad, there are game glitches  like shooting through walls, ai having very limited behaviour and moonsliding, ignoring the corpses, bugs and gameplay errors. But none of them are fatal, every single bug can be ignored. For an indie game, this is fantastic work. And for the price they are asking its decent. Now the issue im having is the game is heavily centered around dlc, with it pretty much having x3.5 pricetag of the engine of the game + chapter 0 and 1. I would recommend trying the demo 1st to see if you like the game, or if you are willing to play and support indie developer, get the game. Could use more polish, especially in the sound department and ai behaviour.Overall solid 5/10. *and 7-8 for indie - there are better games, but this one is not bad by all means.*Gameplay: 7/10Graphics 3/10Plot 7.5/10Sound 1/10			"

												This game is a messTo start with the Gameplay and gameplay loop is repetitive, boring and filled with bugs. Story 0 and 1 start with a item gathering part that is just click on glowing objects to get items after that you are teleported to the next map and a boring stealth sequence. When that is done you get transported to the combat part. The game does a bad job of establish its rules clearly, like why are enemies shooting at me in this room but talking to me in here, why does cover work this time but not last time. The Combat is really bad with wonky controls both on gamepad and mouse/keyboard, bad AI, weird wonky cover system that functions 33% of the time. It's like if the developer wanted to make a adventure game and then realised one third in that writing is hard so they instead padded out the rest of the game with unfinished combat system. Story is shallow and badly written relying on name dropping big conspiracy theories without giving them any context/background or even information on what they are. I would love to have something positive to say about this or even be more passionate in the problems of this game. But it feels so unfinished in every aspect that there isn't much to point at.50 lines of dialog isn't a story, the stealth and combat is so wonky that you can't be ""good"" or ""bad"" at it as it's so random if it works or not. It's not expensive so check it out if you feel like it, but it's not ""funny bad"" just wonky, buggy and boring.			"

												Great concpet the dev has really done their research into the conspiracy theorys. It is a great adventure game which is both gripping and fun, I purcheased this earlier today and finished the prolouge and both episodes in around 2-4 hours in total. At this stage it is short but offers some replayability, things get a little weird in episode two towards the end but its all a part of the overall adventure which is planned out as a six part episodic game. This game is worth the $4.99 USD in my opinion. Retro gameplay and music add to the overall feel of this niche adventure .			"

												Having played through the chapters available as of the time this review was written (seasons 0 through 2), I have to say that Majestic Nights scratches all the itches I expected.While the graphics are not great (but more than adequate) and the gameplay is a bit sketchy at times (but not aggravating), the theme is great. You are a renegade secret agent (or a detective, depending on the season) that gets knee-deep in the world of conspiracy facts (rather than theory). In short, let's just say that if you grew up in the 80s and experienced the best the Internet had to offer in the early to mid 90s, you'll feel right at home. If you didn't, there are in-game dossiers that will bring you up to speed without being too lengthy.Speaking about the writing, not only is it great but there are different conversational ways (non-evident most of the time) of accomplishing objectives, which warrants replayability, kind of a big deal for a game that's not too long at the moment.The music is spot-on for the atmosphere of the game (in the style of 80s synthwave revival) and is included with the game at no extra cost, in MP3 and FLAC - bonus points for a game when so many others sell the OST separately.

												The long and short of this so far is that the concept slated out is something that I dreamt of for a long time. I love the whole 80s tone laced with various other intriguing conspiracy, with this classic 80s, almost b-movie tone to it.Execution? It seems kinda sloppy and rough around the edges. Engine and gameplay can be a little finnicky, and while the writing is pretty good, it has that cheese to it you'd expect from an 80s film, which may be a tad distasteful to some, not taking itself too seriously.Does it justify a buy so far in it's current state, with Barbary Heat finally released (which I am yet to play)?If you absolutely love the story and tone it puts forward, then even then, think about it. The gameplay is shodding and writing could live a tad little to be desired.If not, hold off a little bit. Play Deus Ex or Shadowrun, or maybe even Hotline Miami.I wouldn't personally buy it full price, though. Unless the devs really start putting out more episodes and start polishing up their writing and gameplay, seriously reconsider this purchase.The game isn't BAD, per se, but it's not worth it's price. The project is ambitious and it can be executed well, but not a whole lot is coming of it.			"

												Majestic Nights First Impressions 8-16-2015I've written not only a first impressions review, but also ways the developer could improve their game.This game isn't terrible, but it's such a massive disappointment!I was hoping the mission design, and game design, were more ""fun"", and with a little extra freedom too.I started with Chapter 0, where the game starts off with you playing as John Cardholder, ex-government agent, meeting with an old partner as far as I can tell. After you make your way through the character dialogue and gather your things, you then proceed to a stealth level where you must get your silenced pistol and access codes from your house. Stealth isn't too bad, you hide in the dark and AI have pre-determined patrol paths, pretty easy for me. Not sure why everyone else had so much trouble, though I haven't played much! These are just my first impressions.Upon starting this mission, I realize that this game more linear than I thought! I was disappointed to find this out, as from the screenshots and trailer, the game had large maps, and it really looked like an open world RPG in the style of the old fallout games! While playing this mission, I went to the wrong house, to find an overweight man who is supposed to be John's neighbor, being interrogated by a female police officer while he is trying to take a♥♥♥♥♥♥What the hell. After waiting for the officer to leave the house, I then talk to 'my' neighbor (I'm playing as John), and then say that I'm here to collect my spare house keys. Perhaps if you go through the dialogue correctly, you could obtain an item that allows you to use the back door and further avoid police officers roaming your house? I couldn't exactly find out.If you walk next to two bushes (Which are very deliciously stylized btw, like Deathspank meets Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us) a mediocre scripted sequence occurs, where two officers guarding the front entrance to your house start gossiping and then leave. I hated this! I would have rather had a more dynamic event, where you can move about as they gossip and leave, instead of just waiting for a cutscene to play out. Very frustrating design choice!I then make it into my house, and then proceed to get my pistol and access codes, or atleast try to..I had to restart this mission as I was spotted and then shot to death in my house. When you restart a level, you restart from the beginning. This is terrible! Though these missions are fairly short, but still very frustrating design.I made it back to the inside of my house, i get my pistol and my access codes, and then I pop the 3 officers roaming my house who were looking for me and were trying to kill me, then I complete the level! This level was alright, could be much better.To improve: More emergent design: How about allowing me to distract the cops by triggering a car alarm on one of the cars parked outside my house, allowing the player time to get in and get out, and perhaps if cops are coming back into the house, the player could leave through the back door or a window you can go through, perhaps with a vaulting mechanic?Stealth Kills: Choke holds and neck snapping.Extra Infiltration options: Allow me to get into my house through something like a window or a back door, or from a side door inside a garage or something, some homes have garages attached to the homes themselves with doors inside them that allow you to get into your home after exiting your car and closing the garage doors, that would have been interesting.-Next mission you have to make it inside of a nightclub, I kick a bouncer in the scrotum, make my way inside to ask people annoying questions, and try to avoid getting knocked out by the same bouncer I kicked in the family jewels.I make it to the basement floor to meet ""Mystery"" who then claims to know who I am, I then go through the dialogue and Mystery wants me to buy them a shirly temple from the bar, I get suckerpunched multiple times by the angered bouncer, whom I bashed in the balls with my boot. This was extremely aggrivating, I'm quite a distance away from this guy and his haymakers have ridiculous range! I also could not equip my silenced pistol and deal with this bouncer after luring the AI character to the bathroom or something to avoid making a scene, certainly no cool emergent design choices like that! To improve:More emergent design: Allow the player to lure AI (which are seeking the player and trying to kill them) into a discrete area (Like the bathroom of the nightclub) and deal with them there, either with a stealth kill or by allowing them to equip items like the silenced pistol (It is in the inventory and I can see this VERY clearly) if the player is willing to get their hands a little dirty when dealing with bad guys.Extra Infiltration options: Is there a back door to the nightclub? Maybe a window leading to the basement area or the bathroom? Maybe an airvent of some kind? That would be cool, allow me to avoid kicking a bouncer in the ballsack.-I had to stop playing at this point, as all this flawed design really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, but I wouldn't say that this game is terrible, just not my cup of tea. I was hoping for more of an Open World Realtime Action RPG, but alas, it was not. I don't really know how to feel about it, I wish I could select ""Maybe"" instead of Yes/No, because it's not like this game is completely bad! The stealth segment was kinda fun (Same with the shooting) and I was able to choose what my favorite conspiracy theory was at the beginning of the game. (IE: Area 51, and the Kennedy Assassination are selectable dialogue choices in the introduction level, I got a kick out of this.)I would have loved a more open freeroaming action RPG game with multiple methods of approach to each objective, but unfortunately this game does not, or atleast not yet. I'll get around to playing the next chapter.			"

												A promissing game, but very disaponiting. This isn't enough, buggy as hell and poorly animated (motion captures buy on the net+ lot of cycling problems). The storyline isn't enough well written for rising up the level. Stealth game play?  cannot takedown enemies from behind, no silencer on your gun, what kind of agent is that? Less than an hour per chapter...come on guys, you can do better than that... it's not even a prototype quality.lousy job. "

												Looked good, plot seems fun...but I haven't been able to play past an hour because of bugs.  Buttons on the controller just stop working, until I pressed all of them, moved the mouse, tried using the keyoard--then controller started working again.  Until it didn't, and when faced with the first combat scenario I try to press the right trigger to fire as it instructs me, but instead the character just stands there and three or four new prompts to press the right trigger show up over the original one.  I don't expect AAA production values from smaller developers but I expect the game to be playable for at least 45 minutes.  This game is a lemon.			"

												Doesn't even have the courtesy to be hilariously bad, it's just broken and boring on a fundamental level. Making halfway decent screenshots with its stylized graphics and being less of a chore to play than the worst of the worst games that show up on Steam are the best things that can be said about it.Completed chapter 1 in less than one hour without even knowing where the Run button was. Terrible enemy AI and overpowered Shotgun weapon make the game's final stages far too easy. And that's just one problem of a great many. Shoddy collision detection, being able to interact with objects through walls, and glitchy floaty animation are just some of the others.A mishmash of good ideas with absolutely terrible execution on all of them.

												Unfortunately Majestic Nights is not a good game, in fact it's very poor. The game mechanics are awful - the characters glide around the small environments (especially comical in the awkward crouch/sneak posture) of which only a few objects can be interacted with - which are so obviously highlighted there's no need to search. Combat is unwieldy and unsatisfying, while the stealth sections are astonishing in their awfulness.The plot has the potential to be interesting but just ends up being a case of throw all conspiracy theories in a bowl, stir and hope something good comes out - but it just ends up as a mess. The graphics can occasionally look OK, and there are a couple of good music tracks but a lot of the time it's very mediocre music which is a shame as there's no spoken audio either. There are still a lot of bugs, glitches and bad gameplay designs and overall it's not an enjoyable experience. Each chapter is very brief, although once you've played through the first couple you won't want to continue anyway.			"

Note: This review was written in November 2014Majestic Nights is a classic case of a game promising far more than it can deliver. While it’s based on a fascinating idea, the game itself leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. With so many flaws in so many areas, I simply can’t recommend buying the game in its current state.It’s worth noting, though, that there are still five episodes to come, and the developers appear to be taking a healthy interest in patching the game’s many problems. Some time down the line, Majestic Nights might be a game worth picking up, but for now it’s one conspiracy that should remain buried.Read my full review here: http://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/majestic_nights/review/article-1371.html "

												I don't like Dancing Penguins, I don't like Jet packs or joy rides and I certainly don't see the sense on Ninjas cutting up fruit like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ imbecile. One could go clone some sharks and make a race game, kinda rip off existing designs and claim innovation. If your into that kind of thing, great don't play this game. You probably won’t like it as it takes concepts and elements of political, social issues that concern our world today, not to mention situations that influence our existence as a species and ties them all together in a cocktail of entertainment.Majestic nights is the first solid attempt I have seen from an ""Australian"" studio that are trying to create content for serious hard-core gamers that don't have the intellectual capacity of a flee. ""Look at me I'm indie man"". No your not, your♥♥♥♥♥♥and the reason why I have to justify to overseas Developers why the country I was born in is known for the creative signature of a three year old.Majestic Nights is a cult classic with allot of personality, Deep storyline, solid level design and allot of personality. A kind of X-Files meets Hotline Miami Majestic might not be a long game but it's certainly fun and immersive. The Art could have been a little more polished but it fits right in with the slap stick humour within the games narrative. As a bonus Majestic Nights has a fantastic soundtrack that is the key to really swinging your thing.If you’re a Hip new age guy, Don't buy this game, grab your crayons go play with Xcode in your mums tuperwear room and call yourself a Developer. If you’re a Hard-core gamer and Love Thick plot elements, adult concepts, Aliens with a dash of dark humour. Then grab a hold of Majestic nights. "
