												Finishing the game, I have left with mixed, yet largely positive, feelings.In Aztaka, you are the chosen warrior of the Tenochthitlan, or something. See, it's an action RPG platformer based on Aztec mythology, of which I admittedly am not an expert on. Because of this special setting, every name and event feels unique and at the same time rather confusing, for it can be difficult to remember who is who when you're dealing with a culture with a complicated spelling vastly different from yours.You are actually playing two characters: the chosen warrior of the gods and a cursed wizard of sorts who is in the form of a hummingbird. Warrior handles the fighting and surviving, while the wizard-bird can cast protecting and attacking spells and get taunted by the antagonists. Both gain levels and become stronger by equipping special stuff.Action part is the combat, of which there is a lot. At the beginning, combat is very clunky: your only attack is to thrust forward with the spear. You can also roll around and jump, but those do you little good, when the enemies do damage by simple touch and there's no invulnerability time involved with either. Combined with the fact many of them are evasive, jumpy or have blocks makes fighting some enemies a pain. But it gets better! Once (maybe two-three hours in the game) you will learn an upward strike to attack enemies in the air and even better, a jump strike, making your jumps damage enemies in return. This makes the combat tremendously simpler and more enjoyable.There's also magic part to combat. You basically choose a spell and click on the boxes that appear to complete the incantation: missing one will ruin the spell. During this time the game is slowed down, so you simply have to be fast to avoid getting hit. The more complicated the spell, the more clicks are required. It's quite alright a magic system for a platformer.So there is also a platforming part. This couples with the magic system, that also incorporates a use of magical energies that are dropped by enemies and used to interact with the world. For example, in the beginning you can grow branches into certain trees (it's not exactly a freeform ability), opening a route onward. There are four energy types, all of which have their own special powers in addition to their world interaction: for example, the green life energy doubles effectively as a bandage. Along the way you'll learn more skills akin to other platformers, like double jumps and wall jumps. Aztaka actually has one of the most powerful wall-jumping abilities I've seen, used many times to get to some hard-to-reach places.Finally, there's the RPG aspect. You earn experience and levels by killing monsters and doing quests. At the same time you can increase your health and mana by finding bonus artefacts. There are 3 attributes per character and each level grants you one point to allocate. All the attributes are useful, though I found Agility to be a bit vague (the more you have, the more you'll inflict critical strikes). You may also increase the stats by quaffing stat-increasing potions, dropping randomly from enemies and you can even buy them later on. You'll also get a skill point every level. For the warrior skill points are very useful, but for the wizard it could have been useful to know that the spells become more expensive the more skill points they have.It's not a true RPG though. There are no decisions to make, only a story to follow and the dialogue advancing without your concern. You can (and will) return to earlier places to look for missed loot and quest opportunities though. Sometimes, you might even be lost on what to do next: then the quest screen usually helps.Music and graphics are fine and fit the setting. I did experience some fatal bugs along the way: some sprites would turn into black boxes, and shortly afterwards the game would crash (my card is AMD Radeon 5700 series, run on Win7 64-bit). This was mostly inconvenient, since restarting the game would fix the problems for several hours.All in all, Aztaka is an alright platformer. It also reminds me of The Battle Of Olympus and Zelda II games on Nes. I played the game through on brutal difficulty (I suppose that's the most difficult one) and got 14 hours of game time along the way, dying quite a lot due to bad early decisions. After learning the jump attack skill I advanced a lot faster, and I reckon that's when the combat became more entertaining than a chore. So I'd wager to prepare for a slow start. The end game was very fast and easy because you can avoid any enemies by jumping over them, and the warrior becomes practically immortal before facing the final boss.Too bad Aztaka has no achievements and that seems to be final. I could have squeezed a few extra hours out of it, but I doubt I'll return to it now. As a one-time quest, especially if received from a bundle or on a decent discount, it's certainly worth a buy and play-through. Just give it some time, bear with the clumsy combat of the beginning and try not to lose yourself within the quirky Aztek names.			"

												It pains me to give this a game a thumbs-down, it really does, but after 10 hours in, there is just so much fundamentally broken about this game that I can only recommend that people give it a wide berth until the developer finally sorts out the myriad problems with it.It's a shame, really, because the game's handdrawn graphics are astoundingly beautiful, the soundtrack is wonderful, and its setting is startlingly original. Seriously, how many games do you see set in Aztec-era Mexico?For the first 10 levels, you tend to be tolerant with the game, because the bugs don't manifest themselves, progression is fairly linear, you expect the somewhat sloppy combat system to improve as you gain skills, and it's just so damn beautiful. The problem is that after that, things start going downhill very quickly.The game has a hair-tearingly annoying autosave system that saves after each level, and also records quest errors and bugs that cause you to fall into an infinitely deep hole. The combat is atrocious, and eventually devolves into using somersaults to scrape past powerful opponents in a desperate attempt to maintain some kind of combat strategy. Quest texts are misleading and often lead into dead ends, which you often cannot find your way out of without much backtracking, trial and error and - in some cases - a walkthrough.Compounding these problems is an appallingly bad energy system, which requires you to go hunting for various types of 'energy' to pass certain obstacles. Some - the green 'vital' energy and the white 'divine' energy - are fairly regular occurrences - the others, like the gold 'elemental' energy, force you on an arduous wild goose chase with only a vague idea of how to find said energy.And that's not to mention some of the possibly worst design decisions ever to be committed to a game - I will simply say ""monkey cave"" and ""gap"", which will probably evoke similar traumatic memories in fellow players.

												I enjoyed Aztaka.  The graphics, music, and setting were all quite good.Overall, the game play was good, too, so long as you don't use your spear to attack anything.  Attacking with your spear is slow, clunky, and nearly pointless once you get the air attack.  Because of how worthless the spear attack is, two skills were also useless and I never once used them in the game after trying them out the moment I got them.  They are just too slow and too difficult to even activate, let alone use effectively if they did decent damage or didn't leave you completely vulnerable.Jumping was surprisingly responsive and is the most effective means of attack in the game later on in most situations, even trumping magic for most enemies.The magic system was unique and I rather enjoyed the difficulty it added.  However, you will not want to use two of the spells too often later in the game, as they have a tendency to crash the game at random.Stability is a severe issue in Aztaka.  It crashed regularly for me, sometimes when doing nothing but walking along, but usually when trying to use the two attack spells you don't start with.  It will just freeze for a few seconds, then go to Not Responding(in windows 7) and finally just give up and die.  Save often.It is somewhat short, but I enjoyed it and am not sorry to have bought and played it.			"

												I remember playing this game for a short while back when it was released. To be honest, I never really gave it a chance. It looked boring. So I recently decided to give this one another try. And guess what  ? It's a lovely game. The graphics are detailed and the animations are fluent. It looks great in motion. The sound fits the theme and the gameplay is a combination of platforming and role playing, a genre that is rarely seen these days. You level up your character by killing enemies and completing quests. During the game you will find (better) items and gain spells to aid you in your quest. They will also help you complete some small puzzles in order to find certain items. The combat is, so far, also simple and fun. I really can't believe I didn't give this one a proper chance back then. What a wonderful game ![Rating: 80/100]			"

GeneralI've just finished playing this. It took me about 11 hours to finish the game, which I suppose indicates that this is a relatively short game. However it was very enjoyable and satisfied my thriftiness need of paying a rate of $1 per hour of gaming entertainment.I fully enjoyed this beautifully drawn game and was drawn into the imaginative world that it brings to life. It does require the player to exercise their own imagination to appreciate everything.You just need a little bit of patience, to be somewhat observant, and to enjoy older sorts of sidescrollers to like this game. It doesn't hold your hand, so one of the most refreshing things was that I was able to explore everything for myself.GameplayYour character is fairly basic in my opinion. You run around and stab things with your spear whilst collecting energy and casting a few spells. The abilities that you gather on your journey didn't strike me as particularly exciting or interesting, and were more along the lines of getting something that you need in order to get to a new level.The energy system was interesting and enjoyable because I felt it was a different way of approaching things. You collect different sorts of energy, you can store it, and then you use it. Though I found that my primary useage of energy was either to heal myself or simply to progress through the game by opening a new area up. It did get a little frustrating having to backtrack and hang around dangerous areas trying to collect enough energy in order to progress.Lastly, a short comment that the combat slowly builds to become more interesting and complicated as the game goes on. It can get quite tricky when you find yourself needing to cast spells at the same time as dodging enemies and generally just trying to stay alive. Luckily there are ample checkpoint saves.ControlsNothing out of the ordinary, move left, right, and jump. There are abilities and spells to cast as well. Unfortunately in order to cast the spells you must use your mouse, and the targets you need to hit can be quite difficult to do due to fast timing and other things needing your attention at the same time.StorylineAlthough the story feels extremely traditional and familiar - you're the hero, do stuff and save the world - it is set in a very different and unfamiliar world. It was interesting to have many unfamiliar names which I had no idea how to pronounce (could have wished for some narration).SoundAs I said, the game could have been greatly enhanced if it had included a little bit of narration here and there. However, I found the music to be very enjoyable and had it on the entire time. I was also particularly enamoured with the different footfall sounds which helped you to understand what sort of terrain you were traversing.GraphicsThe art style was charming and helped to immerse you in an Aztec world. I have a real soft spot for hand-drawn art styles, and this game has some exceptional art. It feels loved.Pros+ doesn't spoon feed you+ exercises your imagination a little+ lots of checkpoints+ exquisite art+ interesting energy systemCons- exploration is limited- combat is awkward and takes time- a bit too much backtracking trying to figure out what to do nextHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

												Aztaka is one of those games that really surprised me. Mainly I was interested in it because there aren't many games based on or even inspired by the Aztec empire, or for that matter any ancient civilization of the Americas. I was also taken by the beautifully crafted backdrops and sprites, however before playing the game I was unsure how the combat would pull through. Once I got around to playing the game I soon found myself entranced and rather enjoying myself as I played through Aztaka. My worries had been banished leaving me to marvel at the many successful elements in this game. First and foremost I must attest to the game's visual representation of an Aztec inspired world. I'm not knowledgeable enough about Aztec culture and architecture to speak on the game's accuracy of it's depiction, but what I can say is that they managed to make sidescroller that is as immersive as they come. The settings and the scenery are well done, filled with masterfully drawn backdrops and detailed sprites. The game of course is set in a world reminiscent of Central America. The developers did a great job with adding variety to the settings. You travel through dense jungles, lush forests, barren mountain passes, underground caverns, Aztecan cities, and massive temples. Accompanying the excellent visuals is a soundtrack that is also inspired by early Americas Indians, think panflutes/wood flutes, hide drums, and the like. It's actually quite a soothing and enjoyable soundtrack to listen to, in-game or by itself.If you play this game expecting a story that is typical for a small indie production, you shouldn't be displeased. I think the story is just about where it needs to be. What's important is that it it'll keep you immersed in this Aztecan world, even if you won't come away with some of feelings that story driven games inspire, such as identifying and relating to characters and becoming engrossed in the deep emotional relationships between characters. Speaking of keeping you immersed in an Aztecan the world, the UI is designed in just such a way. If you take a look at the store page you'll quickly see what I mean, Aztecan designs and decor abound! The UI is quite simple and straightforward to use, however one of my few criticisms is how the UI isn't a lay on top UI, but instead a UI that limits the viewport of the game.And finally, the combat. Admittedly this was what I was least unsure about what to expect going into the game. I can't recall if I've ever played a platformer RPG hybrid before. The game does a good job of offering variety in two different ways. In one way you have a small variety of spells, and  in the other way you have a variety of ways to attack. Being a platformer there are of course ways to attack the enemies by jumping and of course other physical attacks. Spells also consume a certain type of energy, an energy you can only hold so much of at any given time and is gathered from killing certain types of enemies. This makes spellcasting an active decision making process, making the player conserve their energy for when it's most needed and using the most appropriate spell for any given situation. This also means you'll be using physical/melee attacks a lot. The only danger overall is that the attacks aren't perfectly balanced, and I found myself using one attack more than the rest (a basic jump attack) which can make the combat seem one dimensional if you find yourself relying one one attack as well. On that note, the game was a bit on the easy side, not to say there weren't challenging spots. Of course I played on the default setting and there are harder difficulty settings then what I played.If one thing can be said about Aztaka, is that it's unique. So many aspects are original and rarely seen in video games. I think this is one reason why I like the game so much. I play as many games as I can so that I can enjoy the many different experiences each offers. The experience I came away with from Aztaka was fresh and original. The other reason I connected so well with this game is that overall it's a well executed game. The art and the music is very lovely, and the gameplay and combat is engaging.Soundtrack sample:

												Shortly a wonderful and unique game idea gets hamstrung by bad game play design decisionsCombat: You start of with a spear and none to little abilities. Shield and a relatively weak magic projectile is your main magical weapons.  This is actually the best part of the game. As you progress you get more advanced enemies against you that do cheap shots at you. How do you counter? with cheap shots of your own. Heard of the somersault 'touch' attack that does massive damage? or what about the  'pogo stick on their head' -attack? World: Love it how devs bravely use names and stuff from the Aztec cultures. Feeling lost at first? that's a good thing. this game does not feel ashamed of it's origin.  Would have loved to see more everyday content in villages and people. Now it seems major characters are fleshed out but villages only contain the same faces who say the few lines they do. Put quite many hours into this but just could not bother to get to the proper end. Late game abilities and combat is a chore. The red wire about what you are here actually doing gets lost. 5/10. Not a hopeless game at all. For some it might be better but for me farming for gold souls and running around in ant caves did not help.  Hard to decide if this is a recommendable game or not.  I'd say no as combat gameplay dominates in the end and it's not that good. The unique cultural aspect is a big plus but it does not carry far enough as there is not that much adventure elements and game instead relies more on action.			"

												This is actually a pretty decent game--a nice slow paced casual adventure. It's mostly a platformer game, but includes some basic RPG elements. A unique story with complementary music, very intuitive controls, and a good amount of leveling skills keep it interesting. On the downside, there isn't a whole lot of action, fighting is one dimensional, and casting spells is a little awkward. The sale price is a good bargain--there's definitely 10+ hours of gameplay here.			"

												Was really hoping I won't have to give this game a thumbs down, but I just can't recommend it. It's not a bad game at all. The visuals are stunning and the music is pretty great, and together they give each location a nice atmosphere. There are also some interesting ideas, like the way the skill levelling is handled, as well as your familiar being in charge of magic and levelling magic stats, whereas you only level up the brawn attributes.The combat is very so-so. You learn some nice new moves along the way, such as being able to hurt enemies whilst performing air flips, but overall it's very tedious and most enemies seem to be damage sponges that take forever to die, not to mention shrugging off your hits whilst you're attacking them, meaning you'll always be getting hit back whilst attacking.And as you go, you keep meeting the same 2-3 enemies per area again and again and again. Eventually you stop fighting them and just flip over them, because some of the latter levels are just way too long and convoluted. I got fed up when I ended up in some ant cave full of giant ants everywhere. The level went on forever and I just kept getting lost, and when I died, I'd just start back in it because the game autosaved (and you can't save manually). So I'm essentially stuck there and can't go back.It's really a shame, because some other levels, like Ehecalk Temple, were designed pretty well and were fun to explore. It's as if the devs ran out of ideas at some point and just started throwing in really long and repetitive levels with dozens of enemies everywhere.I also don't quite understand some of the enemy choices. Whereas Jaguar warriors and haunted masks were quite fitting to the Aztec setting, on the other hand Centauri were out of place. Don't expect to find much of a story in the game either. Although it starts as though you're on someone's trail, eventually it just boils down to ""go and collect these 7 phonograms all over the world"".Overall I am quite disappointed. It started off as a promising game, but then lost its footing very quickly and turned into a very average sidescroller with gameplay issues. If you're really curious to try the game still, I'd suggest to just get it when it's on sale.			"

												Aztaka...What can i say,its a great game featuring an interesting story,has a decent combat system,but you need to grind a bit. Has an unique spell casting system. I have encountered few bugs in the game like glitching through the world and falling,but eventually you would get teleported back up and be good to go, another bug items falling through the world if they are dropped on diagnal paths and again, another bug was when you are entering/getting out of some places through doors,mobs on the other side would hit you without being able to move for a second,but not counting these bugs i am really enjoying this game. It has quite a few interesting side quests that i had pleasure doing. If you like 2D side scrollers,action packed games with aztec theme,grab the game			"

												An average side scroller with non-linear gameplay. I like the power ups and abilities scattered throughout the game that enable you return to places that were out of your reach previously. I also like the optional alternate quests that earn you gifts.Unfortunately the moves are rather limited and you can't defend yourself against attackers; you have to attack, time their attacks and move away to dodge. So far all I can do is poke at enemies with a spear which gets repetitive fast. Edit: The combat improves somewhat later in the game, still rather boring though.When you return to a place, all the enemies will have re-spawned and you get to kill them again... did I mention it is repetitive?I can't get how the protection and attack spells work. I click on myself or the enemy and all that seems to happen is the enemy movements slow down, I still take the same amount of damage using protection spells & it doesn't look like they take any damage when I use an attack spell. Edit: You have to click on the spell icons that appear on yourself or the enemy in quick succession to complete the spell. Also, dragging and dropping energy on yourself to heal gets difficult when you're fighting off enemies. That bit clearly wasn't well thought out.Another quirk is that it only saves at fixed locations which are spaced far apart. This is annoying since the game crashes frequently (I'm running Windows 7) forcing me to start over. 6.5/10			"

Short Verdict: It pains me to do this, but I have to give this game thumbs down. Aztaka is an action platformer with a lot of RPG elements that takes place in the Aztec civilization. You play as an Aztec who's trying to recover artifacts for his leader, while being helped by the magic of someone who's been transformed into a humming bird. While it has a lot of potential, the execution falls short and the gameplay ends up being almost no fun at all. Unless you really wanna play a game revolved by Aztec culture and can get over the awful controllers, don't bother playing this one. I wish Citeremis could get a nice team of devs to really be able to bring their ideas into a fun game to play.Pros: Nice atmosphere, and great, fresh Aztec theme The BGM is good, too A lot of character customization, since this platformer has strong RPG elements, like levelling up (you and your bird friend), allocating skill points, equipping items that improve your stats etc. You'll also get money, buy/sell stuff from/to peddlers, complete (main and side) quests--in sum, all you need in an RPG Beautiful hand-drawn worldCons: First and foremost, the gameplay sucks. And that's the downfall of this game. Jumping is annoying, attacking with the spear (the basic attack) is very clumsy, magic takes too long to recharge to be able to compensate for the terrible spear attack, hit area is a bit of a mess and there's no invincibility window after being hit, which might lead to an almost instant death when you face an enemy running around like crazy. Basically, it's not fun to fight and move around, and that's what you do 95% of the time. No controller support. It would change the gameplay a bit, but it is doable, contrary to what some argue. Equipment/inventory interface is really confusing, making shopping and equipping a task a lot harder than it should be. While I think the humans' graphics were passable, monsters (and their animations) are very ugly and do not really match the beautiful background No map? Really? That was especially annoying in the first cave, where you fall down to lower levels from time to time.Bought on / for: I got it really cheap from TG, so no much harm done.			"

												The game was fun at times, challenging at times, boring and tedious at times, a real mix.   While it is an RPG, and you can buy/sell equipment, you can't buy or sell armour or weapons (except for bracers) which felt incomplete.  You can buy/sell rings and charms but rarely do you bother or need to as the loot you pick up often ends up being far better.There are places in the game where you can take advantage of the nature of enemies respawning, in particular enemies that give loot drops that include potions that increase your strength or other attributes by one point permanently, simply by staying in the area and continuing to kill the same enemies as they respawn over and over, then hoarding up a nice supply of stat point potions and bumping your character up significantly.  Likewise, there are places where enemies drop a lot of loot, and once you've fully completed the potion guy's 3 quests and unlocked all of the potions he makes, you can just go raid high-money-loot enemies for a while, return to the potion guy and buy stat point potions and bump your character up significantly again.  It doesn't even take that long to do, but gives a significant advantage that somewhat debalances the game.The game crashes very often, and you lose everything that has happened since the last progress auto-save which can be frustrating.  There are other bugs in the game where large blocky areas go completely black and you generally have to exit the area to a save point then restart the game to continue.Throughout the first 90% of the game, casting spells is extremely tedious especially while in battle, having to hit a number key or click an icon, then click on either yourself or an enemy, then click 3-6 more times in a pattern to make the spell cast, I found that annoying so I didn't use spells very much at all in the early game.  In fact, I didn't even understand how to use them until I did it by accident then tinkered and figured out the awkward spell casting mechanic.Overall the game had long stretches where it was fun, but it also had long stretches where it was rather tedious, or where you had to figure out some extremely complex jumping manoeuver that was not immediately obvious either in order to proceed at all, or to collect some special beneficial item.If someone really likes Metroid/Castlevania platformer semi-RPG type games then they might like this if they can handle it crashing every few hours and messed up graphics on occasion requiring a restart.  Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it as the story was kind of weak.Final rating:  5/10 "

												Aztaka is a classic Metroidvania (as much as I hate that word, it does describe its own genre sufficiently). If you're not sure what that means, a Metroidvania game is a side-scrolling action/platformer in which you can travel freely through the world, and instead of moving through the game in a linear fashion, you go back and forth between areas, gaining powers, items, or weapons that allow you to unlock previous areas you were unable to explore. A hallmark of Metroidvania games is that you may see an enticing ""thing"" in the very beginning of the game that seems impossible to get to; that's because it is... at your current level. When you progress through the game and get more abilities and items, you return to the beginning and suddenly find yourself able to get the thing with ease.At any rate, Aztaka is a game like this. There are many unopenable doors, locked areas, and inaccessible power-ups to be had but you must return when you have the correct ability or item to progress. There is a lot of satisfaction in doing this. When you return to an old area and are able to plow through enemies with your upgraded strength and abilities, you feel a lot more powerful and it gives a great sense of progress.Aztaka is very heavy on Aztec lore. The names, music, and art are all taken straight from the era and you can tell the writers are in love with the lore. The hero's name is Huitzilo and your trusty companion is the spellcasting hummingbird Ayohpa. Expect names such as Axayacalk, Hualahci, and Calpollalpan. Don't worry, I couldn't read them either.The graphics seem a bit dated and you can tell that the dev toolkit was low-budget for the sprites but the background artwork is all hand-drawn and excellent. The music is phenomenal and some of the soundtrack is truly depressing but extremely good at setting the mood of each area. The game mechanics are a bit stiff and hard to get used to but once you master the forced keyboard-and-mouse combo it gets better. There are a lot of frustrating jumping and puzzling mechanics, however. The wall-jump, in particular, is maddening in that you have to run towards a wall with the A or D keys (left or right), jump with W, then let go of A or D and quickly hit W rapidly to start leaping. There were several points at which I felt like giving up on the game because of a near-impossible jump. Still, I got better at it and was able to carry on.There's also one point in the game that has what appears to be an impossible jump... and it's required. I had to go to an online guide to finally figure out that you have to use a special ability to bounce off a flying enemy to get enough air to make the jump. It's the only point in the entire game where you have to use this mechanic so it's a little unexpected and off-putting.The control scheme is unique. You use the mouse to control a ""hand"" on the screen and with the hand you can grab energy of various types (elemental, life, spiritual, divine) and drag it to different things to do stuff. For example, when you kill many enemies, life energy drops. You grab the life energy with the mouse and drag it onto Huitzilo to heal. You can drag spirit energy onto Ayohpa to give him spellcasting power, and so forth. There are many objects in the game that require interaction in this way and sometimes you have to grab energy and drag it with you through a level to drop it on a certain object. It adds a pretty neat in-depth puzzling aspect to the game.The combat is challenging and there are several bosses that are quite difficult but nothing impossible to overcome. The game took me 10 hours to beat. I did enjoy myself so I'm willing to recommend this game despite its shortcomings.			"

												If you like side-scrolling adventure games with Metroidvania elements then you will like this game.  The combat is a bit clunky at times, but if you actually take the time to backtrack and find all the hidden goodies then you'll be so overpowered by the end it won't really matter.  My biggest criticism of the game would be that the later levels are a real slog - I often found myself rushing through the areas rather than fighting the suddenly super-durable enemies.  There also isn't really any replayability, but it's not like this an expensive game and sometimes it's nice to finish a one-and-done kind of game.			"

												6/10While the game has many flaws, it's still quite fun!The biggest problems I've found with the game were mostly technical (setup doesn't work for me, crashes and graphic problems). Besides that, the game has some problems like badly defined hitboxes and some graphic flaws.Apart from that, while it's not an outstanding game, I definitely had fun with it. The game has some interesting mechanics for casting spells and using energy ""dropped"" by enemies.Skills are interesting even if there are only a few of them and there's enough exploration to keep the game going for a while.Could be a lot better, but still, worth playing.

												I would first like to say this game was amazing I had alot of fun with it. I beat the game to almost the end where I ran into a major glitch in which I could not recieve the last phonogram like needed. I beat the final boss picked up the second to last phonogram and it glitched out and permantly says I only got 5. I think the issue stemmed from the butterflies during the final boss glitched and continously come out to no end. The music is great the platforming is challenging. Heck even the combat is pretty difficult and it makes for a great game and adventure but until this glitch is fixed or patched the score will be a 4/10 just because I can't beat the game that I beat. Once it gets patched the game is great fun and well worth the money.			"

												Aztaka is a nice sample case for the rapid development and, connected with it, the growing significance of indie games in the last 4-5 years. It came out in 2009, around the time Braid topped the charts, when indie movement was in its foetal stage and back then I remember thinking it was the hottest thing one could whish for. Nowadays though, one can easily dismiss it as yet another jump'n'slash game with clancky platforming mechanics, dated, unoptimized and unwieldy UI and noticably poor production values. So why did I give it positive, rather than negative recommendation?Well exactly because it so precisely embodies so much of the now standard indie charactersitics. It depicts original and fairly unique setting - Astec culture, names, iconography, mythology; interesting and, agin, original magic-casting mechanic, (still) nice visual style; and last but not least, beautiful music. We can now say Aztaka is somewhat mediocre because there was surge of inovative and selfsufficient games before the Kickstarter boom, before the major industry creatives managed to bring back entusiasm for scrapped genres, breathe fresh life into them and, not to forget, raise millions of funding for their new/old games. Is Aztaka great? No.But does it provide overall fun platforming time? Yes it does! In no way can I claim it's bad. And if you want to enjoy a story in Aztec setting? I think there still isn't any meaningfull other such game out there. I'd say current price of 7€ (or equivalent) is just a bit too steep, but if you manage to snatch it in some bundle or sale (like I did), and you already went through all the other more modern platformers, like Rayman's revived franchise, you won't be sorry.

												A very nice game, especially for the price.  It takes a big of thought to get through completely, and some backtracking is required.  Combat starts off fun but once you get the aerial attack it gets way too easy.  Graphics are simplistic but appealing, although there does seem to be some loading errors to be found where the backrounds turn completely black.  Definitely a fun platformer though.			"

												Not bad, not bad at all. I don't often see games with an Aztec-themed setting, and this one is nicely done.The game sets you as a young descendant of the sun god, and with the help of a spell-caster trapped in hummingbird form, you set out to recover seven phonograms and destroy an evil god that is causing havok in the area. The writing isn't too deep, but it's decent and enjoyable, as is the gameplay. Aztaka is a sidescrolling RPG platformer, meaning you're going to be doing a lot of running left and right and jumping on things, with the addition of buying or otherwise acquiring skills, spells, and equipment. The spells themselves are kind of interesting as they are not cast with a button press. You have to select the spell and then click a series of buttons in a patterned sequence to set it off. In addition, there are four types of energy that can be collected and used to heal yourself, replenish MP, or interact with the world in certain ways. For example, the one that heals you can also grow tree limbs, which you can use to access higher places or equipment and skill drops just out of reach.The rate at which you gain new skills and spells is pretty well-balanced, coming in at a decent rate, though to be honest I found most of them to be of limited use. Certainly by the end I was pretty much Superman; any damage I took healed almost as soon as I got it, allowing me to practically curb-stomp everything up to and including the final boss. However, that was near the end and was quite fun by that point.As for artistic design, the painted backgrounds are gorgeously detailed, and the 3D characters and enemies generally work well and don't clash badly, outside of flies which look a bit more pasted in. The music is fantastic, the perfect feel, blending everything together.There are a few complaints, though nothing horrible. The biggest is certainly wall-jumping, an acquired skill that is needed to access crucial parts of the game. The help description is inadequate at best, leading to a great deal of frustration until you either figure it out on your own or someone walks you through it (hint: jump at and touch the wall, then jump without using directional keys, hitting jump as you touch each successive wall).The text-only game ending was also a little bit of a letdown, though to be honest what it described would have probably taken a good deal more resources to show.All in all, this was for me a quite enjoyable game I don't have problems recommending.

												Aztaka boldly combines classic side-scrolling mechanics with basic rpg features like questing, loot, and action oriented combat. The graphics are very stylized so it won’t lose appeal over time. Unlike other side-scrollers that use puzzles to wall off progression. Aztaka uses a very in-depth and intertwining quest system to guide you through the game. This game also includes a gear check, so if you happen to rush ahead without getting proper gear you will get stomped by the natives of Aztaka. Aztaka’s combat system and stupidly difficult jump puzzles may act as a deterrent for some gamers, but if you stick with it, the game rewards you with a decent storyline and epic boss fights.			"

I love what the designers did with theme, and the art is fantastic.  I really disliked how you click and drag in the interactive screen.  Feels like you are moving a layer in Photoshop, rather than doing physics.  I didn't like that you can't jump attack, but if you take away the idea of an adjility side scroller, and think of it in RPG terms, this is fine.

Aztaka is a beautiful game but it simply wasn't fun enough for me that I could recommend it.

												This game has great gameplay and I like the visual style. It's a platformer where you can find upgrades that increase your moveset. It might drag on a bit at times but for the most part I had a great time playing it.So why can I not recommend it? Because near the end of the game, you encounter a chasm that's too wide to jump even with all your powers combined. The only way to get past it is to be very lucky, you're basicly dependend on enemies appearing at the exact right moment. Note that this is not a matter of right timing on your part.Edit: I've been told that you can get past the chasm reliably. But do be prepared for jumping puzzles that may seem impossible at first glance and don't have an intuitive solution.			"

												Welcome to the bizarre world of Aztaka, where you will be challenged by such elements as:* Crappy 2D platformer* Plants* Terrible control scheme* Plants At least they didn't go full Downs Syndrome and go pixel.  They hired an artist, so the game at least doesn't feel like you're being stabbed in the eyes.  Shame about the uncompelling gameplay.   If you really like 2D platformers, go find a decent one, this isn't it. Also make sure you run the config program before you launch the game.  The game doesn't run properly with default settings on 99.999% of PCs.  Is it hard to write responsive hardware detection config? No.  Unless you're the developer of Aztaka, apparently. Buy this if you don't like the good 2D platformers and you like the developer to treat you like crap.			"

												Metroid/Metroidvania con algo de saborcillo Diablo y ambientación azteca. Engancha ... mucho. :P			"

												Unforgettable theme and hand-drawn design.My first indie metroidvania, back in 2009.Still one of my favourites after a second time through it.Memorable sound design and soundtrack.  A spell casting delight.There's a trick to the CQC combat you better learn early on, else you perish.Grind and overcome.Beware, the vendor has a quick finger.			"

												It's a fun little game that is pretty simple to play but you know what would make it even simpler?  USING A CONTROLLER!!!!  Everything else aside it's quite a nice little game with a lot of nice gameplay in a setting that hasn't been really done to death (Aztec world/gods).  Still some bugs (having items disappear the moment you pick them up is quite annoying) but overall a fun game that doesn't really require a massive learning curve.			"

												More action rpg than a metroidvania game in my opinion, still really similar game play, i usualy like those kind of game but this one is just bad, quest information is sometime misleading, combat is bad, i first i though it would get better when my ""hero"" would get better but it did not, add a few bugs to that and it is quite boring too(story and gameplay), i never finished it and i never will. It a shame really, the handdraw graphic are really good looking and made the game feel somewhat diferent but because of what i said before: stay away.			"
