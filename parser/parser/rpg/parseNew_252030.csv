												Valdis Story: Abyssal City is one of the best games i've played so far, i've been so hooked on to it that i have yet to become bored of doing the game over and over, it feels like each playthrough is a challenge and the hardest difficulty which is unlocked after your first playthrough really puts your skills to the test.The storyline is quite a fun turn of events as neither hell or heaven is the good guy here!You start off on a ship with your crew then some giant monster comes and crashes your ship and you all sink and end up in Abyssal City which is deep under the sea, it turns out that you have been caught up in the middle of a war between angels and demons and your only way out is to battle your way through hordes of angels and demons as you search for your missing crew!Currently there are 2 playable characters out of 4 which will be available in an upcoming patch. The 2 currently available characters have very different playstyles, one of them is a monk which starts by using only fists while the other starts with a sword, both have their strengths and weaknesses which makes it really fun to play through the game a second time.I started out playing the swords man in the hardest difficulty and finished the game and it was quite rewarding as i had to put some effort in to it, later i decided i was going to try out the monk and oh my did i get a surprise, it was like playing a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME! i died a couple of times to bosses here and there which i had considered mastered, but because of the different playstyle and spells it really shook me up and made me have another blast through the game!The game also features a leveling system and a talent tree system which is pretty rare for a sidescroller, it brings out allot of possibilities while leveling on what path you wish to take and what  stats you require for your skill tree... Want to be a MONK MAGE?! no problem... Want to be a barehanded swordsman!? again no problem... the game is very well built to give you the different options of choosing what ever path suites you best!The item system in the game is very pleasing, it's not to complex and not to simple, you will grind enemies along your travels and they will drop a variation of items for you, later in the game you will be able to use the items obtained to upgrade your weapons or armor as you see fit or even expand your mana or health pool.This really brought out the good old RPG feeling in me and made me want to try to obtain all the items in the game in my first playthrough, i then realised that there are some items in the game that are only obtainable from chests and you will have to think wisely before you upgrade your weapons or armors as you may not be able to upgrade any other weapon or armor in your current playthrough!While gliding through the game you will fight vicious bosses that will show you no mercy at all, you will struggle and enjoy the sensation of progressing them til you finally deliver the final blow! you will be required to try out various combinations of armors or spells in order to find out what the best possible way to kill the bosses are. Every boss in the game has some sort of weakness and it's yours to figure out!The game it self is well designed, the story is great, has beautiful graphics which are all hand drawn as well as amazing music that really puts you in the zone when fighting bosses or while you are exploring the world of Valdis Story!Pros:- Playable multiple times- Very fun combat system- Challenging boss fights- Multiple characters to choose from- Great leveling system with a unique leveling tree- Difficulties made to please the average player to hardcore player- Upgrading systemCons:- Map can be frustrating for beginners who have not played the game yet- You will become hooked to the game and not want to leave your computer!My Ratings:Graphics: 94/100Combat System: 91/100Storyline: 89:100Music: 95/100Overall: 92/100I highly recommend this game to everyone and if you have any questions, feel free to hit me up on twitch.tv/icyd3mon even if im not streaming, i'm usually in the chat channel!

												I Kickstarted this one and it finally got Greenlit on Steam.  This game is tough and I'm playing it on normal.  It hearkens more to the mega man days where movement is very stop and go, and taking damage will completely destroy your momentum.   The non-combat timed puzzles are brutal and require nothing less than perfection.  I spent a lot of time repeating them over and over to get them right.Combat is pretty complex, combining light and heavy attacks, along with a block, dodge (cancel), and parry system.  It takes a bit to get used to, learning when to heavy attack to break a block, or block yourself.  There's a lot of trial and error in discovering exactly which attacks can even be blocked or which ones you should use the ""Cancel"" dodge.  But like the non-combat puzzles, every boss or enemy has a pattern, and this is one of those games that gives you warm fuzzies when you finally get the pattern and beat the boss after the tenth time.  Until you figure it out, expect frustration and what will feel like cheap hits.  Also, it keeps things fresh when you backtrack through previous areas because the enemies level with you and gain new abilities to attack you with as your progress through the game.  Along with that is a fairly deep magic system and your customization through both stat increases and a talent tree, that definitely changes the way you play your character in many places.The graphics have a nice retro sprite feel, without reverting to the overdone 8-Bit style so prevalent, lately, falling somewhere between the quality of the PS1 and PS2.  The soundtrack is superb, combining a lot of retro synth, metal guitars, and symphonic instruments and spans something like four hours.This is one of those games that will challenge you, but reward you when you succeed and I'm really digging it.  It really does feel more like the toughness of the original Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night to me than most games in the genre have presented lately.  And I'm just playing it on the easiest of four modes... O_O			"

												Valdis Story is one of these rare metroidvania-alike games that actually incorporates all the attributes of metroidvania-alike games  which properly used and combined. Decent story? Well-developed and complex battle system? RPG elements? Exploration aspects and secrets? Beautiful 2D visuals and animations? All check.It took almost 7 years for the game to crawl out of the concept cradle but it sure worth it. And the result? Unique combination of old-school gameplay core ideas with a modern approach.Personal score; 8.5/10UPD: nominated			"

												Having to wait for what felt an eternity for this update i yet again find myself replying this game all over again. This has been my best purchase to date on steam and i dont say that lightly. i feel there is a real art to the fighting system in which sometimes through my frantic button bashing at times i hear in my head a little voice telling me ""what you just did there, was AWESOME"". My only problem with the game is it leaves me wanting to know so much more about the lore, the history of this game as the story itself is great, but leaves me asking more questions then i got answers. Not really something major with issues but its the characters you meet along the game that look interesting and quirky that make me feel that way. im begging for a sequel or even a prequel.Endless fluff if you do this for me i will get a tattoo of Wyatt in honour of this!

												To me Castlevania: Symphony of the Night rates as #2 greatest game of all time, bested only by Unreal Tournament 2004. It started the entire metroidvania subgenre and made a rather large impact on many people, including me. This game is made by someone who no doubt shares great love of SotN and metroidvania in general. If you are one of those fans you don't need to read any further, this is as good as it gets, the finest metroidvania I played since SotN. For those not familiar, this game is set in a large two dimensional world where to progress to new areas you need to acquire keys and abilities (metroid style), but at the same time you procure new equipment, level up and specialize. The biggest strength of this game lies in it's combat system. This is a perfect mix of min max stat gameplay with skill based reactive 2d brawler. What this means is that you will have to take great care of how you invest your stat points, skill points what you upgrade, what you use and most importantly how well you understand and play the game. The combat system is simple at overlook: light attack, heavy attack, block, cancel dash and magic, but undrneeth there is a whole deep level that will make fans of stylish action games rejoice. There are lifters, slams, blocks, parries, force blocks, secret techniques, stealth, backstabs, criticals, magic oriented attacks, stuns,assists, crazy combos etc etc. In all honesty this game is rather overwhelming how much there is to the actual combat. To someone who invested time it's second nature but the sheer amount taken into consideration when creating a build for your character far exceeds what I ever thought a game like this would offer.Currently there are two characters (there will be two more with a forthcoming free update). Each character has their own three skill trees to spend points on. Each character has different weapons to use and completely different playstyles. There are four main stats (strength, agility, inteligence and luck), you get to put a point in this as well as picking a skill when leveling up. It opens up a tremendous amount of specialization and replaybility for each character. Upgrading gear needs to be done wisely because the materials needed are finite, and for certain item types you will only be able to upgrade one item to maximum (weapon for example). Choose wisely which weapon, armor or spell you upgrade.  Speaking of gear, everything is a sidegrade. There are no upgrades in this game, each piece of armor, accessory or even weapon is suited for a specific build or playstyle. Each armor has special properties and unique benefit. This alone expands the amount of possible play styles and builds significantly.The game's combat challange is done correctly. The more I play the better I am. I started and i would get thrashed by every boss I'd encounter, barely able to finish it. Now I'll get an S rank on every boss encounter(tip, better rank on bosses gives permenant stat increases). It feels like Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, where the game teaches you the hard way to play well. On the other hand the platforming portion of the game is not so ideal. If I had any setbacks for this game it's that platforming does not work as well as combat does. Sure after some time it becomes trivial because you get used to it, but at first the platforming will be a chore, mostly because the way movement works. It's difficult to pinpoint your character, don't expect perfect pixel platformer controls like in Mega Man. Though after time it goes away and you learn it like it happened with the combat. A very minor setback to overall fantastic experience otherwise.So yes, I absolutely endorse this title. For the amount of replaybility and content this game offers, along with free future updates to come this game is an absolute steal even for it's full price. For you metroidvania fans, I swear you will get that feeling that SotN had you as you explored, grinded and fought in Dracula's castle. Just an absolute blast of a game.			"

'Go on warrior, your story shall be written in the corpses of your enemies.'Moira Goibniu__________________________________________Introduction'In a world where demons and angels fight each other it’s humanity that suffers as their souls get devoured by both sides to form their armies. There is no end for the war and only a small group of outcasts, renegades and cursed ones takes the adventure to stop this madness once and for all, not knowing what awaits them in heaven, hell and in between.' The story is more than just solid and comes up with different twists, fantastic ideas and a cast of crazy-but-interesting characters and leads the (Anti-)Hero(es) through a lot of different environments and areas. Exploring is truly satisfying as the player can explore a huge map with lots of dead ends, hidden items, forgotten treasures and several optional bosses and areas to stumble upon.The positive aspects go on with an exquisite design with a love for details, a great soundtrack and a surprisingly deep fighting system that allows the player to create some really badass battles. The level of difficulty is definitely quite high and even in 'Easy Mode' you will die a lot at first. Though as you progress you can see how you get stronger and better, creating long and devastating combos to annihilate hundreds of enemies in no time. There are four different characters with slight changes in the story and unique weapons, skills and attacks available, an additional 'Arena Mode', the insane 'Goibniu Mode' for the mad players and a deep character system with skill trees and lots of equipment options, weapons and spells. Your first run will need approximately 8 up to 10 hours but all the different characters, hidden secrets, the difficulty levels, a ranking system, the leaderboards as well as some quite hard achievements can keep the fun up for a long time. Especially as there are several viable builds per character, e.g. a „Minion & Dark Magic“ Vladyn or a „Shot’em up“ version with focus on his Shotgun and Agility, or how about a „100 Demon Arm (Melee)“ build? Fight the enemies the way you prefer it.__________________________________________ConsCertainly there is also some shadow among all this light, but from my point of view all the negative points can be listed quite shortly: the variety of enemies could have been bigger, the difficulty changes sometimes to a quite frustrating level and some platforming passages are annoyingly difficult and require perfect timing – but all this is complaining on a level that most games I’ve played have never achieved.__________________________________________ConclusionFrom my point of view this game is a hidden gem that really shines brightly among so many average titles as it showed me how wrong several of the prejudices for Indie games (e.g. lack of polishing, mediocre gameplay elements, missing updates and abandonment from the devs…) can be: Some superb Metroidvania-mechanics with lots of areas and content get combined with an 'Easy to learn but hard to Master‘-fighting system, deep RPG elements and an interesting story with likeable characters. This is a fantastic overall package that entertained me for more than 60 hours, but there is still enough stuff left to do for several more runs in the future.Definitely at least an 8.5 out of 10 - and in regard to the fact that all of this was created by only two persons and it brings honor to a genre long forgotten by the huge publishers I’ll happily add another bonus point (…Yes, I absolutely love this game!) and recommend it for everyone who likes some good 2D-Action-RPG full of fighting and exploring – just like in the good old times with lots of Metroidvanias.

Posted: November 5, 2015
												TL;DR --> I'm ashamed about how many people downvoted this game just because it's stronger than you. This is an incredible Metroidvania (one of the bests I've ever played) with a very deep and complex combat system that should not disappoint any old-school gamer nor new challenge-seekers. ______________________________________________________And now that I've played this game so much to the point that I literally know the whole map, enemies, items and secrets by heart, I can review it properly.This is one of those games that reminds you and the gaming industry that games used to be mercyless as hell, right at the beginning. You want a tutorial? Test what you've learnt with a godlike boss! Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a pure Metroidvania game, with the most remarkable features of the genre: 2D exploration platformer; RPG elements based on stats, skill tree, weapons, armors, accs, etc.; tons of bosses; materials to upgrading and crafting; the classic square-like zone map; tons of bosses. This game was built with one goal in purpose: create an RPG platformer with a complex battle and combat system. But did it succeed? Before focusing on pros and cons, let me just summarise the main story: The game is placed in a world where both Gods of Darkness and Light (which happen to be sisters) are in war, sending never-ending troups of angels/demons. As usual, the ones suffering the colateral damage are humans, and some people are just against this whole mess and purpose to kill both Goddesses. You take hand of one of those tripulations who suddenly gets attacked by some giant monsters. Your ship sinks and you end up in the lost city of Sitheil, a civilization underwater protected by a mysterious mana barrier.And that's all until you start playing it. Now the important stuff:COMBAT SYSTEM - 9.5/10Since this is the most important fact about the game, I'm starting with it. The combat system is basically INCREDIBLE. There's so much to learn with every character and you can effectively play with lots of different playstyles and strategies. A very interesting thing is that some bosses are way easier to deal with if you use an specific strategy, even if it's one you're not used to.  There are 4 characters in this game. Two of them are more melee/close range based, while the other 2 are ranged. Nevertheless all characters have different weapons that allow you to play on any style so the amount of possibilities are huge. The damage and combo system are surprisingly complex, to the point that you might even need to read guides in order to fully understand how it works. Once you do, and if you plan yourself properly, you'll end up by dealing with breaking strategies. When that happens, trust me, the feeling is AWESOME, like ""hell yeah, I nailed it"". The main stats are the typical Strength, Agility, Intelligence and Luck, but those take care of other deeper stats that might make you consider how you're gonna play. The Skill Trees look limited at a first glance (3 skill trees), but don't get fooled. How you place your points can be crucial and some of the later skills, if used properly, are totally breakers. Expect to find all the important stuff like dodging, parrying, guardbreaking, spellbreaking, and so on. The combat mechanics... I can see a lot of work progamming it. All those features I pointed out in the previous paragraphs could only conclude in an almost perfect feeling of a true fight even against the weakest foe. SOUNDTRACK - 8.5/10The sountrack is amazing as well. You'll get in love with it very quickly. A music combining epic/symphonic with some metal guitar sound will keep you estimulated for the big amount of hours you will be playing this game. Expect a lot of internal hype with boss themes. LENGTH - 8.5/10For a Metroidvania, the game is surprisingly long. It might take you about 15h to beat the game for the first time (if you spend some time exploring of course). The map is pretty big (specially now after the free update) and there's many stuff to uncover and secrets to find, even in places where you firstly thought you fully explored. You will be facing over 20 bosses that will keep you stressed and held until you master their patterns. Also, you need to beat the game several times in order to unlock everything so if you are a completionist you will be putting over 50h into this game for sure.ART - 8/10I totally love the concept art of the game and it also looks pretty decent in the game itself. The menus and the text look kind weird though. DIFFICULTY - 9/10I'll spend some time explaining this:This game is pretty brutal and mercyless. Even on Normal difficulty if you're not very used to these games you might struggle with enemies and specially bosses. Not to mention that the game has Normal Difficulty, Hard, Veteran, God Slayer, Goibniu Mode (God Slayer with 1 life + no saves + time limit). But... is the difficulty artificial?HELL NO.This game was crafted to be played on God Slayer difficulty. Every other difficulty is just a weakened version of this, not the opposite. If you wanna fully experience Valdis Story, you better play this game on the hardest settings, and you might not regret it. PLEASE keep that in mind: this game was meant to be hard and it succeeds on what it's aiming. So don't start yelling ""huehuehue this is so hard huehuehue"" because yes, you're right! You've just entered Valdis Story! Will you keep it and try to beat the challenge or will you give up like a scrub?By this time I've already stated that the combat system is amazing. Well, remember that enemies can also fight so be ready to face some very skillful enemies, able to do amazing and long combos to your butt. Unless you flawlessly learn how to deal with them, you're gonna die. A lot. And of course, the major feature: BOSSES. Bosses in this game are extremely lethal and varied. You will fight them over and over and over and over until you basically reach a point you can predict every single move they make. Doesn't that remember you the kind of stuff we usually do on fighting games? ACHIEVEMENTS - 9/10Most of the achievements are made for the hardcore and uber-hardcore audience and that's something I always appreciate since achievements should be ACHIEVEMENTS in my opinion. And yes, there's an achievement for beating the game in Goibniu Mode. Good luck!However, I cannot put a 10/10 in this section since completing this game involves A LOT of playthroughs. Be ready, completionist, as you will have to beat this game like 8-9 times without counting failed runs, with different styles and purposes. I think that was unnecessary. OVERALL - 9.25/10I've always been bad in Metroidvanias and it's a genre that despite enjoying, I get easily frustrated and therefore I usually avoid. But Valdis Story completely changed that and gave me some hope to both myself and the industry. This game is simply amazing and resulted into an incredible experience to me as a gamer. It was so addictive once I started it I couldn't let it go until I did everything. I will remember this title for a long time and it's definately gonna be one of my first references when recommending a Metroidvania game.			"

												It's like a combination of Dark Souls and Metroidvania!  A side scrolling action game with RPG elements and an occasional wicked difficulty curve.  There was one boss I encountered that I spent two hours on, memorizing patterns and learning how to exploit gaps in their attack pattern.  I whittle them down one sliver of health at a time... it was great.  Of course, I then watched somebody wreck that same boss in 30 seconds at a lower level then I was thanks to careful planning and exploitation of their abilities!  So it's a game with lots of depth, and it will give you whatever you want to put into it.			"

												The game says I'm at around the ~60% completion mark at about 6 hours in; I feel I've had enough exposure to at least make a Yes/No recommendation.  While there are certainly some frustrating elements of the design (which I'll list out below), I couldn't help but feel compelled to keep playing, albeit it after a little break.  All-in-all, to draw a topical analogy, I keep thinking of the game as ""Dark Souls-vania""; feels like a Metroidvania style game, with difficult (but often fair) enemies, and often unexplained elements.Personal Cons List (with objective commentary): -- Not much indication of where to go.  This often lead to retreading the same areas over again hoping to find the little thing I missed the first couple of times (to advance the story/progression), etc.  -- -- The map seems arbitrarily color-coded (though I imagine there's some logic to it, that's not explained in any way that I noticed in the game).-- -- The very brief ""objective"" listed on the on-screen minimap has no context, and there is often no way to have NPCs, who just explained some cryptic event you need to particpate in to advance, repeat themselves of that key information.-- Stumbled into some seemingly impossible boss fights that I'd later discover were optional (and had to load my game out of to ""recover"").-- Encountered a brutally difficult ""escape"" sequence in the game that was on a timer -- it was so easy to fall/be blocked into a pit that could be rendered inescapable, that I'd either have to let myself get killed, or wait for the 80-second timer to countdown before I could retry again -- this took me several (probably 6?) attempts before I made it through.  Was extremely frustrating.-- -- I see what the designer was going for, but being pushed into a pit with no way out, forced to suicide/wait felt like poor design.  At the same time, I could've very well gotten lucky on my first attempt, and never thought anything of it... but I just got stuck in one of those ruts where I kept failing over and over again, and it took a lot out of me.-- There's a little climbing animation whenever you grab the ledge of a platform/wall, which feels a little lengthy.  The locked animation frames remove your control for a period of time that can sometimes be frustrating when you're trying to navigate the environments over and over again, especially when there are enemies in ""strategic"" places that seem positioned ONLY to knock you off of them -- frequently.-- I'm personally having a hard time following the story.  It's all dialogue-driven, so keeping track of all of the various odd-sounding names and places can feel a little overwhelming sometimes.  There are times when events or dialogue feels so abstract that I can't tell if I just encountered a random secondary scene, or if the main story is progressing.-- The menus / interface feel a little clunky, but are servicable.-- -- The focus meter has nice little light particle effects that shower into the screen -- this is sometimes distracting, as I think something is happening in the world, then realize it's just the interface.  Distracts me more often than I would expect...Personal Pros List (with objective commentary):-- I find the combat to be fun, deep, and reasonably responsive (in terms of controls).  There are definitely some engaging combat systems in the game -- which, after several hours, I finally feel like I have some control over.-- -- There are some cases of personal frustration when I get locked into a juggle or a damage loop where I lose control, but invoking my ""skill cancel"" ability often seems to get me out of it -- not always, but it helps.  There were a number of times where I got stuck in a damage / locked animation loop only to die because I couldn't regain control.-- Seems to be good potential for replayability with the multiple characters and, from what I've seen, nuanced differences in the story for each.  I started a second game, and played the monk character for about 60 minutes, which did immediately feel different in combat, and seemed to have a good number of unique spells available as well.-- There are some interesting exploration / backtracking mechanics (in the vain of a Metroidvania game).  Even though I do end up having to sometimes arbitrarily explore while trying to happen upon the next objective/event, there do seem to be enough games that I found myself discovering something previously blocked often enough that my interest doesn't wane too quickly.-- The spell system is interesting, though a bit cumbersome when it comes to changing stuff.  You can hold RT+B to get access to a paused ""quick menu"" for adjusting spells, which is useful, but you do end up having to scroll through up to 6 spells in each of four categories to change things around -- can feel a little jarring, especially when some of those spells really don't get used often (if they have a specific utility, etc.).  However, the variety and functionality in spells is cool and interesting -- I do find myself mixing it up fairly often to make good use of all those tools, so having to switch this way, while annoying at times, is usually worthwhile.  However, getting stuck repeating a boss fight until you learn the patterns means having to adjust to the desired combination of spells each time you start anew.Anyway, I think that's about it.  I do plan on continuing and hopefully finishing this game.  I wouldn't call myself talented at games, though I've been playing for a long time, so I would say I'm skilled.  In most games, I tend to pick one difficulty higher than ""Normal"", which is about where I usually feel comfortable -- right amount of challenge, etc.  This game I'm playing on Normal, and I find it brutally difficult in places.  There are bosses I've had to try a half-dozen times before getting the patterns and puzzle figured out to win, but it did feel fairly satisfying (and relieving) to do so.  Those are the moments when the game felt so akin to Dark Souls.  :)			"

												In summary, this game is so much fun and so impressive that I can't recommend it more.I played through this game once, and MAN did I love it.  There are so many different styles of play: rush in like a barbarian, use melee attacks, take time to plan things out, use magic, attack from a distance, run away in fear, or any combination of those.  The gameplay is so well made and the design so spot-on that there was never a dull moment.  There's quite a lot of optional paths and bosses too.  I really like how whether or not you defeat certain optional bosses determines what happens later in the game.  Some of them change the story, some change the ending, and some even change how future bosses act.  Plus the bosses were all unique and unbelieveably intense.It's a really pretty game, too.And don't even get me started on the music.Ooooh god, the music.  It's so good.  I legitimately feel that this game has my favorite soundtrack of any game I've ever played.  Zack Parish is now my God.  I've never bought a video game soundtrack before, but I HAVE to buy this one.I did notice that if there was more than one or two lasers on-screen at once, and during the final boss, I would experience framerate issues, but I also had a recording software running, and I'm sure everything would've been smooth if I hadn't been recording.  In the end, I turned down the graphical settings for the final boss (which is a super intense experience and takes a little while to beat) and everything was fine.  I have a really hard time saying that this is any fault of the game, but I wouldn't know.As I mentioned above, I did play through this game on YouTube (youtube.com/Frozelar), if you'd like to see some more gameplay before buying it.  I really hate to self-advertise but maybe it'll give people a better idea of just how great the game is before they buy it.Easily my favorite Let's Play of all time.  Looking forward to playing through it again.  And possibly again and again and again.			"

												Ever since I got into ametuer game design myself about 5-6 years ago, I always wanted to make a game that combined some of my favourite genres: Platformer, Action/Adventure and RPG (with a little touch of Fighting a la Smash Bros). Monsters, bosses, weapons, party members, stores, collectibles and TIGHT combat controls. Obviously, since games are hard to make (let along by yourself) that never happened. But I would happen across Valdis Story, which I think is the closest I've ever seen a game be to my ""dream game."" Side scrolling action platforming at its finest since Symphony of the Night! If you liked SoTN or any of the other Metroidvania games (including Metroid itself) you will highly enjoy this game just like I did. Fun bosses, high skill cap and rewards the skilled with bonouses from bosses encouraging you to learn the bosses' patterns and improve yourself.  After you beat the game your first time, why not play again? On a harder difficulty? And its not just the numbers that get harder with the difficulties either, some bosses mechanically change in terms of how they are fought (albiet minorly, but still) and the best part is, THIS GAME ISNT EVEN DONE YET. There is more to come! It's good enough as it is, but knowing that there are other characters and items and possibly bosses planned in future updates just makes me rock hard. GG EndlessFluff. You did good.VLADYN AND GILDA PATCH UPDATE:The final two characters have been added and a total of 4 new bosses with some new and remixed areas make the game still pretty fresh for those of use that have played it a bunch until this point. The game supports 16 different saves now to compensate for the new characters allowing you to essentially have 4 saves for each characters if you want. Vladyn is SUPER FUN to play, he is now my favourite character taking the place of Reina. He is the only primary ranged character is the game and it makes everything so different and fresh. Gilda is really complex but can be VERY rewarding if you play her correctly. Many bosses are weak to a certain element and all of Gilda's attacks utilize each of the elements in a substantial way meaning you can really exploit bosses weaknesses if you play it right. For example, Magus takes MAD damage from poison, up to and probably beyond 250 PER TICK, which is a LOT of damage believe me. She also starts out with a double jump when everyone else needs to wait a while until they get access to it allowing her to grab some items and equipment early.The new bosses are all very challenging and interesting and the new areas have interesting mechanics as well that I felt added to the challenge in a good way rather than being cheap.All in all, this update added a LOT of great stuff and I am still VERY happy with my purchase. GG EndlessFluff. You did good. (again)			"

												I backed Valdis Story on Kickstarter because it looked like the kind of game I'd want to play: a side-scrolling action RPG. The truth is that it's really closer to a Metroidvania platformer with some RPG elements. Despite its short length I had it installed for a year and a half before I got around to beating it. I just wasn't that motivated to ever play it, for reasons I'll go into.It is fundamentally a good game though. The soundtrack is amazing, the animations are smooth (though there was considerable slow down when there was a lot of stuff on the screen), and the special effects are much better than you'd expect from an indie crew with hardly any experience. The story leaves something to be desired, but it picks up later on and it's not bad, just lacking in emotion. It does make up for that in epicness and scale though.The single biggest problem is the controls. Playing on a keyboard my hands would start cramping after just a few minutes of play. If the game were slower-paced I'd say that switching the right hand to mouse controls might be better, but it's too much of a twitch experience for that. And that's the crux of the issue: there's some very tight jumps and timings that have to be made and given that the controls can be glitchy and are just generally a pain to use, the puzzles and fights that depend on those split-second key presses should really have been a lot more forgiving.The combat itself isn't too hard, especially if you bother to level up at all. When I could forget the pain of the controls it was genuinely fun if I wasn't in the middle of a frustrating boss fight. The game also follows the usual steps of getting easier as it progresses because you have access to more skills and spells and equipment. So the most rage-inducing moments are generally early on.There's a crafting aspect I didn't get into, but you don't really need to. It seems sort of superfluous and confusing.The other major issue is just finding the next objective. There is a fast travel system, but it doesn't go to nearly enough places. And when your destination is just a name that doesn't appear on a map anywhere it can take a long time to find where you're supposed to go. Some sort of objective pointer or even a global map would've helped me a ton (there is only a very small local map without any names on it). As it is, the bulk of my play time was probably spent wandering around trying to figure out where to go next.So if you want an action platformer with RPG elements that depends on twitch skills, I'd highly recommend Valdis Story. It's the best you're going to see in that genre from an indie team. But for the sake of your hands and sanity, bring a controller instead of relying on the keyboard.			"

												Genre - Fantasy 2D Platform/Action/RPGThis game is brilliant. It is single player but gives you a large world to explore. You have items to craft and spells to choose. You will find the combat both fun and rewarding. It has a Japnese anime feel to it. It is much like Rogue Legacy but without the Rogue element.			"

												This is a Metroidvania style action-adventure with an emphasis on combat, crafting, and RPG elements.PROS:- Fast-paced, fluid action- Solid controls- Great animation and visuals- Lots of unique skills to learn- Lots of items/weapons/gear- Great music- Engaging story- Lots of allied NPCsCONS:- Insane difficulty spikes when facing certain bosses- All enemies become stronger/more skilled as you level up, effectively dulling the impact of levelling altogether- Hazards and enemies often trap you in stunlock while your health is whittled away- Timed platforming segments are incredibly frustrating That last point is my major problem with Valdis Story, and it was enough to discourage me from playing anymore.  The player is frequently required to traverse gauntlets of environmental hazards, narrow moving platforms, crumbling footholds, relentless attacking enemies, and strictly-timed doors in order to progress and/or obtain certain items, all without committing a SINGLE mistake or mistimed action, otherwise it's back to square one all over again.The design of these segments often requires several repetitions to pass (on the order of dozens, in some cases), and more often than not saps all forward momentum from the experience.  I'm all for a good platforming challenge, but one that takes 15-30 solid minutes to complete through arduous trial-and-error seems woefully misplaced in what is otherwise a stellar, fast-paced adventure game.Not to mention the rewards for completing these platforming challenges don't seem to adequately compensate the effort involved in obtaining them (either it's a rare material that can be found elsewhere as an enemy drop, or it's an armor item that I most likely won't wear, because the one I already have fits my playstyle just fine).I really want to be able to recommend this game; the love and attention to detail invested in it are plainly evident.  But the frustration bred by all the awful timed platforming bits totally disrupts this game's rhythm, and if you're anything like me, you'll soon find yourself avoiding the game to save yourself the headache.

												An action-oriented Metroidvania that heavily rewards mastery, encouraging replayability. The game is fairly difficult, but players that aren't willing to learn how to actually play don't give it a fair shake.Having four characters and multiple weapons for each allows you to try out a multitude of fighting styles.Overall a very fun game, provided you take the effort to get good at it.

												One of the best game I've played in 2013, Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a Metroidvania gem that you don't want to miss. So, what's so good about it you ask?- Challenging, old school style bosses (a lot of them), you really need to rely on your skill and pattern recognition. No QTEs here.- Great combo based combat with multiple magic type attacks and a skill cancel/dodge system.- Good RPG based stats, skill tree and equipment system to customize your heroes with.- Multiple characters with really different play style.It really is the best Metroidvania type game available on Steam so far. So if you like games like Dust, Cave Story+, Guacamelee or Aquaria you should pick this up ASAP, for me it's way better than those games and takes me back to a time when all I care about gaming is the pure fun and challenging aspect of it.

												Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a RPG, side-scrolling platformer game and I can tell you know, It's definately one of the best ones I have played!At the beginning of the game you have a choice between 2 unique characters (building up to 4 once you have completed the story mode) which you can play to progress through the story. They each have their own different skills and attacks that they use.The game uses a simple spell casting system where you just hold a button and press a certain direction and it casts the spell you have binded onto it. Aside from the spells, the game enables you to use dashes, varying comboes between weak and strong attacks, wall jumps and more!Each character has their own unique skill tree that you can use to enhance the characters performance. eg, Increase attack damage by 5%. It follows the basic RPG skill tree (Attack, Defense, Magic).The boss fights in this game are my favourite out of all the platformers and RPGs. Each boss you encounter have different attacks and each have their own special moves. Not only are they challenging, they are also EXTREMELY fun to fight! You won't simply beat a boss with just luck! They also look really cool :3The game's graphics and music are just straight up AMAZING! The anime-like art style really does pull a lot of audience in, and I am not suprised. The devs really know what people like!Overall, I would give this game a 9.5/10 for all of the reasons I have mentioned above. The only thing I find that this game is lacking the Quest log or Objective menu. When you speak to an NPC and you take a quest, at some points I found it frustrating because I could not find the desired place I needed to go, simply because I had no clue where it was. That being said, I am sure the devs will add this in the future since they seem to be updating the game very often.			"

												It's very rare for me to go back and play a game for a second full playthrough, but thats exactly what I've done with Valdis Story.My first playthrough of the game was more than enough to justify a full price purchase of the game, but the most recent update that was pushed out in August is just icing on the cake.  With so many unfulfilled promises that have been thrown to us by developers, its quite refreshing to see one that actually delivers on their word.The highlights of the update are the 2 new playable characters, new zones, and the addition of arena mode.  I should also add that the gameplay experience felt completely different between both of the characters that i tried.  The difference was noticeable enough that I may consider playing it for a 3rd, or even 4th, time!  If you are a fan of the genre and have not played this game yet, you are doing yourself a horrible disservice. This is EASILY one of the best Metroidvania games on Steam, and perhaps one of the best of all time imo...10/10 - have played again, and will most likely play even more			"

												If you enjoy Metroidvania games then this is definitely for you, the game is really fun to play!Story is alright, nothing mind blowing but it kept me interested. I personally had the most fun trying to figure out all the different boss patterns, and it feels pretty satisfying when you do finally manage to kill one of them after a certain number of retries.Don't expect the higher difficulties in this game to be easy, they are actually quite tough(which is a good thing!)I got used to the default controls fairly quick and ran into no issues with them. That said if you don't like them both keyboard and gamepad is fully rebindable. (Worth noting that I played through the game with a wired Xbox 360 controller.)I did run into one minor bug at one point during a cutscene before a boss battle took place and had to reset to my last save (there is always a save shrine near the boss area so it wasn't a big deal.) But other than that I experienced no other bugs whatsoever.The soundtrack for this game is really good, my favorite has to be the music that plays during the Frozen Crypts level, it's sooo good.Overall, good game, good soundtrack, solid controls and tons of fun!

												Those craving those Metroid-like games and Castlevania, this will satisfy you. This feels like a game I'd make if I knew how to do so. Even after completing the game I just wanna play more. Those who enjoy a challenge and different ways to play will enjoy it.This game has one of my favorite things in games today, that being a timed dodge and parry mechanic. It always feels so satisfying to know you timed your block just right and counterattack. Games like Batman Arkham series, Guacamelee, and somewhat Dark Souls come to mind in terms of timed presses.Few problems with the game though. Feel the biggest is the boss reward Rank system. Part of me likes that but another part is like, way to stress me out to try and do a near flawless fight. The rewards tend to be stats and if you get the best rank, you get the best stat reward. So for those who are like me and get kinda OCD when it comes to wanting best possible stats, items, outcome and so forth... that may hinder some enjoyment. What makes it worse is that there is this hat you get later in game to DOUBLE those rewards. Seems cool, right? Well there is a chance it will break upon being hit so... not only do you have to worry about reaching the boss without it breaking but now you have to hope it doesn't break during the boss either. Could be having a good S rank boss fight but then see it break... constant restarting more than usual. It would be better if the Hats were timed.I guess that is the issue I have most with the game. To a minor extent, needed better puzzles and work on the platforming a bit. Can't obtain every piece of gear and for those who like to collect everything on a single file might find that a bother. Though that is just another OCD factor, but don't bother me as much as the stats. And the map needed better indication and be able to see the whole world... but not too big a problem, though I did get lost a good while my first play.Overall this game is fun and satisfying. I suppose that rank mechanic forces you to get better at fights even if it can get crazy at times with too much things flying about on screen to keep up with. Those who enjoy the explore, upgrades to explore more, rpg elements and fun combo combat... then this is for you.I feel this genre of games are pretty rare since forever ago, to why referred to as Metroid-likes because they were the only ones back then until Castlevania did the same. So you are missing out by not playing.Edit: This game actually taught me to get better. I still think the Boss Reward Rank system is bogus but it also pushed me to improve. I play on God Slayer difficulty just fine now, something I thought impossible. Then I went ahead and got all achievements, something I thought I would never do after my 1st playthrough and saw some crazy ones.			"

												This is my favorite game ever, si don't expect objectivity here.VS : Abyssal City is a Metroidvania with old-school difficulty, tight controls, and RPG elements, but oozing with charm.What impressed me the most at first was the quality of the animations, just swinging my weapon or fist made me impatient to try to hit an ennemy, as I noticed right away the depth of the moves available : light attacks, heavy, launchers, aerial, combo with recovery at the end (and I'm not even talking about Spells, summons called Assits, Focus Mode and Focus Finishers...), it felt like a really good mix between Artistic design, and Game design. And this impression only got confirmed later on.The Art in this game is beautifull, the drawings have their own style, the backgrounds are detailed, and the music is one of the best I've ever heard in a video game, and all this gives to Valdis Story a very solid identity, that of an epic tale of a war between gods and mortals, of a fantasy world with a grim and not-so-simple story.What about the controls? Yes, they're tight, precision in your inputs is needed, be it for the fights or the platforming sections of the game. The game has a special feel to it, and you'll need to get used to it and understand why it behaves that way if you want to succeed. Mashing buttons will get you killed, as ennemies can block, dash, and combo you, and they only improve in the higher difficulties.That being said, with RPG-elements, you character can gain up to 20 levels, unlock weapons, armors and accessories with huge effects on the gameplay (one more dash, or more magic power, etc, etc), a wide array of tools that can be combined in powerfull builds, capable of maching even the most difficult optional bosses the game throws at you.And those Bosses are hard at first, you'll have to be patient, learn their patterns, in order to beat them, or even better, get the maximum rank as you fight them. Because yes, your performance will be evaluated, with noticable rewards coming with the highest ranks.With the latest big update being released the 4th of may 2015, the content is huge. 5 difficulty modes, 4 characters with their own playstyle, each one of them having even more sub-playstyles depending on your equipement, and drastic choices to make in your progression, as you cannot upgrade every item to max level in one playthrough. There are also a few secret events and ennemies that will keep you on your toes if you want to find them by yourself.Having played and followed that game since launch, I'm also impressed by the work of the devs, and the tweaks they've made, listening to both positive and negative feedback to always improve their game again and again. Not only bug fixes, but also tweaking some encounters, some rooms, some controls, adding the possibility to rebind your keys for exemple, and many many else that you won't even notice, all that while still staying true to their core design choices.No game is perfect. But for me, Valdis Story : Abyssal City is darn close. I recommend it, purely and simply.			"

												I had to really work at liking this game, and almost ragequit at least half a dozen times before I finished. I did like it enough to finish, but there's almost equal parts really fun verses stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  I would probably recommend it to metroidvania fans who've played most other stuff in the genre, or people who like fighting games, but maybe not most casual fans just yet.It does a few things well: Most combat is executed well and is more challenging than most games in the genre. The stage design and art is nice, and the music is pretty great. Combat feels much more satisfying than stuff like Dust: An Elysian Tale  or Castlevania: SoTN most of the time, because it's pretty precise in how it makes you block, dodge and parry, and it feels more like a 2d character action game in that regard.But where it missed the mark for me it was almost enough to quit it before the end.  The first thing you need to know to enjoy this game is that the ""cancel"" skill is absolutely critical. Everything in this game hits you with irritating status effects like freezing you, poisoning , and most annoyingly, enemies often juggle you into the air constantly, and even the most slight of grazes inflict a really annoying knockback. To some people that will be part of the charm, but I got sick of that♥♥♥♥♥♥back when 8-bit was still all the rage. I had cases where I was juggled like a ping pong ball across the screen, and inflicted with every status under the sun in the process. This was usually combined with precision platforming of some sort. I hate losing control of my character like that, and it is one of my personal nerdrage triggers. There's no invincibility frame after you get hit, so you just keep getting juggled until you use the all-important cancel skill. Learn it early and use it often. Also, remap it because for 3/4 of the game I had it on the default ""down"" and this made it pretty hard to play.The other thing I hate is that I don't feel like the diablo2 style skill trees were done well. They locked really basic abilities like parrying behind skill points, so if you decided to go up the offense tree or magic verses defensive, you missed out on that ability. I just kind of feel like that's something I should have from the start rather than having to spend multiple level-ups in a specific tree to get.Controls is the final gripe I have. I feel like I usually master controls in games pretty fast, but I was fighting with them the entire game. Switching magic was super cumbersome, and you had to stop and change basic moves like double jump or ice pillar in a menu to access new areas, then switch back to your preferred spells when you're done and then probably 20 seconds later you run into a situation where you need to use a mobility spell again. equipping and unequipping items on the fly was also pretty terrible. During the last boss fight I had an item that drained life but did high damage on the boss, but it was filled with lots of mooks I had to kill, so I had to constantly go into the menu and equip/unequip things, and they somehow even made that a chore, since I had to navigate across the equip menu every time to remove an item. Ledge controls are a whole 'nother can of worms that people need to really practice, because they're counter-intuitive, but pretty precise.So: The good is that it's a cool, challenging metroidvania with passable aesthetics. The bad is that there is some seriously annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥that may or may not bother you depending on your tolerances for platforming and the controls and menus. I think it's worth a shot if you like metroidvanias. If you don't, I would maybe play something more accessible, first.			"

												   One of the best Metroidvania game I've played. I still have to try the 2 newer playable characters ... so I'll come back a third time to this game in the future... and maybe a fourth time after that.    Strangely the second time I played the game (maybe 60h out of my 90) I used the keyboard. The controls are really responsive (maybe a bit hard to adapt to) both with keyboard and controller.   Lots of secrets and cool possible builds per character with the alignment system and different weapons. 9.5/10 would rage quit again after finding out my build is trash for optional end game bosses.

												(Quick note: my playtime displays as 0 hours because I played this game offline. It is actually about 10 hours.)While I am generally a sucker for Metroidvania games, this one fell short for me. It has all the makings of an excellent game, but its unreliable mechanics and punishing design are often too much for it.It's too bad; Valdis Story looks like it might be amazing from the start. Everything you see is lovely- the environments and enemies are beautifully designed, and aside from a few really ugly characters (just look at Wyatt's perpetual insomniac face), the human sprites are up there too.Likewise, the music and sound design are equally lovely, if a tiny bit generic. And from the initial story hints the characters drop, you sense that a decent amount of creativity went into the story. So artistically speaking, the potential is there.But the mechanics don't bear it out. And I could make a bullet-point list of every aspect I find frusrtating, but it can basically be summarized thusly: this is not a true Metroidvania game because it wants you to perform and fight instead of explore. It wants to see how fast you can platform and how many infinite stun-lock combos you can dodge, but cares very little about discovery. I can think of no successful title in the genre that has taken this route, and there's a reason for that. The core impulse of Metroidvania games is exploration. Take that away, and it's just an awkward, ill-conceived juxtaposition of a platformer and a fighter.So, will you get worthwhile secrets to find? No, you'll get infinite tiny crafting items hidden behind frustrating timed switches. Will you get a decent map to explore the world with? No, you'll get a rather pale substitute that only shows your local surroundings with no way to check what you missed or unlocked in other places. Distinct, compelling upgrades? No, just keys. Well, maybe at least some decent battles?No, you don't really get that either. At first I thought the game was just challenging enough, asking a lot of me but never being unfair, but Valdis Story quickly deviates from that. There are just too many eccentricities of the combat system. For instance, why is it that everything is trying to stun-lock you into long combos that gouge out half or more of your health at once, even on the lowest difficulty? Why are enemies placed on ledges sometimes near-impossible to approach as they repel you with instantaneous, unblockable attacks? Why does being hit cause you to fall completely helplessly until you hit the ground? Can you imagine trying to play a Metroid game if Samus tumbled like a ragdoll every time an attack grazed her? It wouldn't be much fun. Most fights wind up feeling that way after the first couple of hours- a chore, not a thrill, especially since enemies only drop the most banal, meaningless ""loot."" When every crafting recipe requires 8-10 different types of ingredients, a single bar of steel feels almost worthless.But, truth be told, I might have put up with this if the story was proving to be half-decent. This game's approach to storytelling is, in many ways, the inverse of Cave Story's: it dumps hundreds of little insignificant worldbuilding details on you, but never constructs anything meaningful out of them. About ten hours in, a village elder is polite enough to give you a staggering exposition dump; this is the first time the plot shows up. And it is not much of a plot. You're trying to find a relic of power before the other two factions. That's it. There you go. All that talk of angels and demons and the goddess Abghababa and freeing humanity literally comes down to that. Again, there's visible creativity at work here, but it's scattered and misdirected. You can read all about the individual ranks of demon and angel in the lore entries, but none of it is ever put together in a way that matters. And frankly, it's all just half-baked enough to make me feel silly reading about it.There's some interplay of light and dark going on, which is normally another thing I am an absolute sucker for, but it, too, is absolutely meanigless. It might have some obscure gameplay impact, but mostly it just makes your outline glow red or blue. And the ease with which you switch from dark to light serves to undermine any meaning or finality that your choice of alignments might have had. And the game barely indicates what the light/angelic side and dark/demonic side even represent. Perhaps it wants you to just assume that they stand for their absolute most generic interpretations.And the story was not a selling point for me- but you need to get either gameplay or story right to keep me going. Valdis Story got neither.But, if you've stuck with me this far, let me tell you what actually made me put down the game- what made me finally give up on it. It wasn't the story or the combat, as such. It was when the game offered me a choice- upon defeating a boss, spare him or finish him off. I chose to spare him, curious as to what would happen. And what happened is that the game punished me for it with a nearly-unwinnable boss fight.You're meant to fight a demon captain of some sort (you've met him before by this point, but again, he's just a little sack of details and backstory with no clear relevance to anything), and he's already challenging enough with his massive waves of minions and irritating dash-spam. But no, as punishment for letting that earlier boss live, the game throws him into this battle, too. He's a member of the angel faction, so I figured it would just be an interesting three-way fight. But instead, both sides focus on you and only you. They make only the most half-hearted attempt to attack each other, and they each summon their own legion of minions. And then, whichever boss you kill first, the other gains back all his health and gets powered up, Smaug and Ornstein style. (Except Dark Souls had the depth and refinement to back it up.)Given the game's strong tendency towards stun-locking you, a screen full of minions and bosses all focused on you is not a good situation. I did beat the battle by using exploitative techniques, but it shattered any illusions of immersion I might have had. because A: your choices don't have logical or interesting outcomes in this world. B: for all that talk of angels and demons fighting, they really are just sprites on the screen who only know to attack you. And C: the whole fight reeks of an attempt at being climactic, but it just doesn't MATTER. Who are these people? Why do I care? All I've done is fetch items for village elders. I would just as soon run from the boss fight because fighting this stooge means nothing to me.But just take note of this, guys: sure, if you want to make choices meaningful, then yes, they have to have consequences. But this was an utterly arbitrary, meaningless decision made without any context. And its consequences were almost too harsh to overcome. This is the WRONG way to offer choices to a player. It does nothing for them.I guess that almost sums up my feelings on Valdis Story. It's trying to do all the right things, but with no understanding of how they should work. It has a concept and a backstory, but no ability to hold a plot together. It has complex combat mechanics, but not the refinement to make them satisfying. It has rooms and hidden items and upgrades, but implements them in a way that makes the very thought of trying to explore this world unpalatable. (If I see one more timed switch...)So I cannot recommend this game in good faith. If you want a Metroidvania game, go play Cave Story instead. Or Dust AET, if you  want something that feels kind of similar to this except done better. (Its plot is a bit wishy-washy too, but at least it isn't obnoxious.) Or really, play conceivably anything, but don't play Valdis Story.			"

												This game aims to be challenging, but doesn't give you the tools to make this challenge fair. Timed platforming puzzles require extreme precision and perfect execution with mechanics such as dash cancel, jump, walljump and platform hanging which are very unreliable, to not say random. You have to fight enemies on tiny platforms but you make a huge step forward every time you swing your sword. Every time an enemy coughs in your general direction, you're stunned for an absurd amount of time, so if there are several enemies (or worse, a flamethrower) any hit will lead to a stunlock, then death.You can block a boss' special attack from front four times in a row, but the fifth time it might count as if you were hit from behind (which means extra damage and stun, thus death) because the hitboxes are glitchy. Speaking of hitboxes, sometimes you jump over a projectile and still get hit because hitboxes are much bigger than the visuals. I could go on, there are dozens of nitpicks that make the game feel really unpolished. You can't expect perfection from players if your game doesn't respond perfectly itself.Among other problems, the map doesn't show any useful information (doors, treasures, shops, save points...) so navigating is really tedious, a major flaw for a Metroidvania game. The skills seem unbalanced, I had a lot of trouble with bosses until I unlocked perfect guard, then they became really easy (but still very long ; a boss took me over 20 minutes because of his ridiculous HP bar and teleport spam).On a positive note, the art (sprites and music) are really nice. Way too many recolors though, there are only about 10-15 different enemies that you will see in every dungeon in a different color.			"

												I wasn't ready for this.I didn't know what to expect when I installed the game but I definitely wasn't ready for this. But for me, this is like 2D Dark Souls - it pushes you in terms of difficulty, there are no quest log kinda stuff so you have to travel around and explore, parry system etc...There are two main problems for me though:1- Controls are not as fluid as it should be considering this game requires good reflexes.2- There aren't a lot of enemies so far (and my friend told me that it doesn't get any better)If you like Castlevania buy this. If you don't but like 2D fighting games, buy this. If you are a CoD kinda gamer who likes linear storytelling, kinda easy gameplay and first person viewpoint, I'm sorry but the princess is at another castle.			"

												A kickstarter success!Pros:+ Solid control. 2 attack button - light and heavy attack, 6 magic element each with 4 different spells, one dash button. The default controls is a bit awkward, but it can be remapped to your preference.+ Dark, light and neutral affinity adds the depth of RPG element.+ Numerous armor and accessories for different build.+ 2 playable character with another extra 2 planned as a free update in the near future.+ Boss fights are great.Cons:- I can't think of any. Only two minor thing that really bugs me is the armor/accessories descriptions in the game that can be reworked to make things easier and more elegant and not bland. The other is the in game text font.Each boss fights are ranked, higher rank rewards you with more experience and better stats bonus. Defeating a boss is not a difficult task. The real deal is trying to achieve S rank. Fights are ranked by 3 factors : time, combo and hit taken. Bosses do not have a specific weakness, only more vulnerable to some element.As a Megaman series fan, I recommend this title.			"

												A 1080p60 video review of Valdis Story: Abyssal City:


YouTube™ Video: Valdis Story: Abyssal City (2015) Review 

			Views: 839		

			Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a metroidvania-style platformer that was released a while ago, but recently saw some big new content updates.		

Valdis Story: Abyssal City is an intense platformer that lets you play one of four very different characters. Valdis Story has outstanding balance between tight platforming and fast-paced combat, but also contains RPG and adventure game elements. As you explore the game's underwater city you can slowly shape your character according to your play style with attributes, skills, spells, items and various other upgrades. All the while you're fighting all sorts of creatures and of course many different challenging bosses with their own unique mechanics.The most notable thing about Valdis Story is its immense replayability factor. Each character has unique skills and items they can use, as well as a different slant on the overarching storyline. On top of that they can be build in many different ways, there are many hidden items and bosses, and there are four difficulty settings. The lowest difficulty setting, Normal, can already be a severe challenge to anyone unused to metroidvania-style platformers. So there's a lot to see and do in this game, even after the initial playthrough.See my video review above for more details and of course footage of the game in action.RecommendationIf you're looking for a good metroidvania-style platformer then Valdis Story: Abyssal City is your game. It's made for fans of the genre with some (recent) experience and approaches difficulty similar to Dark Souls by letting you figure things out yourself. If you have less experience with games in this genre: prepare for a challenge, but a healthy one that'll ultimately be worth it. Valdis Story is also among the most free-form and replayable games I've seen in years, so it can keep you entertained for a long time to come.Technical Droning60FPS - Yes120Hz - NoFullscreen - YesBorderless Window - NoGraphics Options - MinimalTexture Quality - OkayKey Rebinding - Yes, but no gamepad sensitivity settings---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												I typically enjoy Metroidvania games. But let me be perfectly clear here when I say that ""enjoy"" does not describe how much I actually love this game. It has the perfect mix of platforming, combat, exploration, and RPG elements all woven into one great game with some beautiful artwork and soundtracks. One of the best features in my opinion is the choice of 4 unique characters, all of which get their own unique playstyle and weapons. I find that this highly increases the diversity of the game because you'll find yourself able to approach each situation the game has to throw at you in different ways. Whether you prefer to focus on spellcasting, ranged combat, close range melee combat, or really want to hone in on lengthy combo's, this game has a character for you.The customization of playstyle doesn't even stop there, as the RPG type levelling system allows you to pick skills from different skill trees, and level up in different stats to further customize that character to your own unique niche, which will be further complimented with the character exclusive weapons that you'll be able to pick up along the way and use from the getgo in your next playthrough.The replayability factor is incredible, and the combat is fun meaning that I do not find it a chore to start a game fresh. Even on normal difficulty, you'll probably find yourself challenged in the same way that classic games did. Challenging enough to not be boring, but not so difficult that you'll want to fling the game across the room. If by the sound of this review, you feel that this game suits your interests, I highly recommend that you pick it up. It will not disappoint.			"

												Summary: Castlevania without duckingMultiplayer: NoCompletion: 8-16 hrs?Cards: YesCloud: YesNote: Gamepad recommended. A GOOD one, with a d-pad that isn't circular.This game is, in a nutshell, a post Igarashi-era Castlevania. It's a very beautiful game, both graphically and musically, with soothing piano scores. In many regards, it's a well done game. But there's just so much I have to nitpick.Valdis Story tells the story of a young man fighting the likes of angels and demons. His ship is destroyed and he sets out to rescue his homies. I actually liked the setting and story elements, I just wish there was more of it. There wasn't really enough dialogue to develop any characters.The boss battles are intense and in many cases, gimmicky. These were great. Though if you completely lacked certain things, like spell upgrades, some bosses were perhaps way too hard.Here are some features I would have liked to see or change.-The inability to duck is baffling, and my number one complaint. Hitting down is defaulted to slide/cancel. While you can unbind this, on more than one occasion I find myself unintentionally moving forward while ""crouching forward"" because I expect the ability to duck to halt horizontal movement.-There are a few leaps of faith in the game, where you cannot guess where you will land with no way to get back up the same way. Some means to see a little further ahead would help.-Having attacks lunge my character forward tends to make me move all over the place, which is problematic on certain bosses that I try to fight near ledges.-The prevalence of near-perfect timed jumps is overkill. A few jump puzzles are great, but not every area needs one, let alone two.-The lack of a unified world map makes navigation surprisingly difficult, despite the fantastic mini-map. Even after beating it twice, I still don't really have a feel for the layout.-Related to the above, backtracking is somewhat high because it's difficult to tell where to go.-Bouncing back when hit is fine, but the extremely short invulnerability period makes this problem outstanding. The repeated loss of control is aggravating.-Status afflictions such as stun last a long time, considering this is a solo real-time adventure.-Normal difficulty is still too punishing. Yeah it's doable, but it's not nice at all to new players to the genre. An easier difficulty would be a welcome addition.-A high-speed movement ability would be nice for end-game exploration, given the large amount of backtracking.-Inability to block heavy attacks by default seems counter-intuitive. It's not like players automatically know what a heavy attack looks like.-A curious amount of grinding is required for a completionist type player who wants every item upgraded. By the end of the game I had very few things upgraded.-The library, which seems like it'd be the perfect hub to hang out and reach other areas, is oddly out-of-the-way of just about everything.-Certain crew members are almost too important to miss out on, such as every upgrader. These characters should instead be unable to be missed.-Boss battles are completely unannounced. If you walked into that next room with next to no health and a far away save point, good luck beating it.-Also there's no quick option to restart bosses. You must resort to suicide or returning to the menu.Valdis Story is a very commendable game to be accomplished with such a small team. It looks great, it sounds great, it plays okayish. In the end, all i'm really asking for is a more forgiving easy diffulty. There's a pretty good amount of replay value, with several unlockable characters who play quite differently, but I couldn't bring myself to sit through the game one more time. I feel this game deserves a 7.5. Thanks chicago!EDIT: Fixed the cards/cloud info.			"

												I love the music, the art, and the setting, and I usually like Metroidvania games.  But try as I might, I cannot bring myself to enjoy Valdis Story.  The controls are horrible and unintuitive.  Your character doesn't get any invincibility frames when you take damage, so large groups of enemies (which are everywhere) can easily juggle you to death if you slip up and get in a tight spot.  This is supposedly not a problem because you are temporarily invincible while you dash, but I've found plenty of situations where it seems like that just doesn't help.Bonus experience for your character is doled out based on the rank you obtain while fighting bosses.  Bonus experience is vital in Valdis Story because, while you technically can grind, normal enemies give so little experience that it will be an incredible slog to catch up.  Getting good equipment often requires the completion of time-based puzzles, several of which are incredibly frustrating because the controls suck.To give this game a fair shot, I restarted after learning more about it so I could gather more bonus experience from bosses.  I will admit the gameplay can be smooth, but even when I was doing really well in the first part of the game, I still hated the controls and fought against them the whole time.  Obviously, it's possible to completely master the game and get an S-Rank on all bosses, and I know some people will enjoy this game enough to get that good.  I won't deny that it has the makings of a great game, I just feel poor design decisions mar it too much for me to recommend (or even finish myself).			"

												Amazing! I can't remember the last time that I devoured a game like I am doing with Valdis Story (Probably it was The Witcher 3). I beated the game with Reina, the cute Monk, on hard. Immediately I started my playthrough with Wyatt, the badass fella with a big sword, on Godslayer mode. It is AWESOME! It really tests your player skills. This is a game that you need to master the mecanics to be good. It doesn't care if you grind your entire life to get stronger. You will be humiliated if you do not master the gameplay. It's not a smash button hack n slash. And you fight against freaking Demons and Angels! The best part (at least for me) is mastering the Boss battles to get S rank. Of course, you don't need to be a hardcore gamer to enjoy. You can play the normal mode and just be happy. It will be fun as well. If you are into it Metrodvania games, Get It!Gameplay - 9.5Music - 9History - 8.5 (It is simple, but I kinda liked the script)9/10 "

												Amazing game, and well crafted. Story was ok, it's not the greatest nor is it something that i would hate. But the true joy of the game is the action and platforming! Exactly what was I looking for in my purchase minus one thing. It has RPG mechanics so thus there is grinding involved, didn't want to do grinding really but it's not that bad most of the time. The positive aspect of the RPG mechanics is the loot and build customization that comes with it! Very enjoyable and engaging to be able to do that in an action platformer! There is a great combo system, however i feel the game is paced too fast to actually feel like you're doing combos rather than mashing frantically to connect your hits in time. Despite that, I'm sure it's possible to get used to it and do some sick combos outside of basic ones.  9/10 game well worth my cash cuz i got for 50% off! Pros: great art, gameplay, and very fun and engaging. Multiple chars for multiple playthroughs as well.Cons: Have to grind if you want your phat loot, backtracking for treasures due to new abilities acquired (i hate having to do this)			"

Amazing artwork with a beautiful land to explore, quick pace and skill based game play with several different ways to play each of the Four unique characters accompanied with solid controls I keep coming back to play more.  This game should not be passed up by anyone who's a fan of the ""metroidvania"" style games, there's plenty of ways to play each character focusing on different builds and spells.  Mastering Valdis story's game play is a great challenge with even the normal difficulty setting posing a hardy threat, higher difficulty settings are not for the meek.			"

												This game suffers from some unfortunate design decisions. While the art is wonderful and the characters are interesting, the gameplay has some very serious flaws which drag the whole experience down with increasing magnitude as the game progresses.Firstly, spell slots are used for mobility abilities - meaning you have to switch slots up to move around. These mobility powers still use MP, so during the many boss fights later, where you will never have MP (because so many bosses drain mana with many attacks) you effectively lose all of your special abilities, including critical things like double jump.Secondly, many aspects of the game,  from puzzles to boss fights, seem designed soley to be frustrating and bothersome. Timed puzzles where the slightest wrong move forces you to retry the long, boring chain of switches and jumps again and again, and enemies that have stun attacks-o-plenty.The boss fights are at first quite easy, save that the boss fight rank system actually affects what stats your character gets - meaning that if you don't beat most bosses using nearly perfect technique (which requires lots of memorization and blind luck in later cases), your character suffers for it.The later boss fights become absurd. One boss bombards you with a dizzying array of attacks from all angles, nearly all of which freeze or stun your character. It also drains your mana, hampers normal movement (independently of freezes and stuns), regenerates its own health and employs a mechanic that nullifies almost all character abilities that increase damage output, making many of the possible character builds useless for that encounter. There were moments during later fights where I would have been better served going to make coffee rather than waiting for the stun juggles to end so I could move again. Needless to say, if you aren't very, very well practiced with your dodges, look forward to a lot of cheap deaths.This game was at first very appealing, and I think that it has a lot of potential, but frustrating mechanics in the late game make it hard to enjoy for all but the most hard-core platformers who really want a punishing challenge.

												Alright, I BARELY scratched the surface with my single playthrough with just ONE char; Wyatt.I'm a little bit burned (or burnt) with the game so I'd like to pause the other 3 possible chars.Here's the TL;DR version:- I LOVE the art style, the animations or sprites!- I LOVE the music and sfx too, it's really good and I think I'd never feel tired of it!- The controls weren't exactly perfect, I had trouble with the jumping and edge detection/box collisions. It wasn't BAD just fell so many times because the char wouldn't grab, or it just jumped before or after, sigh..- Combat, well it's dynamic, it's engaging and hard! mobs will give you a though fight, most times! haha. I played it entirely with a xboxone gamepad, tho when I first tried it I didn't have one so used one of those generics with the x360ce emu driver and worked fine, all you have to do is remap a few buttons and you're golden :)Steam says I've played for about 23hs which seems little compared to the other games or that it felt much much longer, I left a bunch of survivors to save, crew members to rescue, map to uncover and a whole lotta items to pick up and upgrade, which leads me to the AMAZING amount of customization that you can create and adjust to your preferred play style.Most achievements (if you're into those) are to be unlocked in hard and posterior difficulty modes, plus they're divided by chars too, so you'd be doing these for quite a while! :DOk, think I have most things covered up.If you're into platforming, Castlevanian/Metroidvania genres, you're up for a challenge and also enjoy a good story (yeah, it has an interesting plot too) then Valdis Story Abyssal City is for you.Endlessfluff Games took such a long time and did great effort while creating this jewel, that we gamers owe to them to spread the word and give them support and deserved praises so they and others know there's an appreciative market niche here for these awesome kind of games!

												Well, by the first 15 minutes of the game you will remember Castlevania SOTN wich has similars comands and almost same style of battle. There is no ""easy mode"" that makes the game even more interesting and fun. I recomend to start at the hard mode and grow up some levels before go further in the game. You choose where you wantt to put your points that you gain at each level up, just like Diablo. By the start you have only two characters to choose, one is normal gameplay and the other is to advanced players. The story is a little confuse but ""im ok with that"" The bosses are so anger and hard as beating Galamoth* without the right itens (hehehe)And im playing im a low specs notebook: Intel graphics (r) 2012, 2GB ram and a Dual Core 1.1ghz (Celeron) and no lags to reportIf you want a game of action with elements of RPG ""THIS GAME IS FIT TO YOU"" I recomend for sure!*From Castlevania SOTNBem, pelos primeiros 15 minutos de jogo você irá perceber a semelhança com Castlevania SOTN com comandos similares e quase o mesmo estilo de batalha. Não existe modo fácil, o que torna o jogo ainda mais interessante e divertido. Recomendo que jogue no Hard e upe alguns níveis para prosseguir no game. A cada level up você ganha pontos e pode escolher onde distribuí-los como no clássico Diablo. De começo só tem 2 personagens para escolher dos 4 existentes. Um para iniciantes e outra para jogadores avançados acostumados com esse tipo de controle.A história é confusa pra k7 mas ""im ok with that"" Os chefes são tão difíceis como tentar derrotar o Galamoth* sem os itens certos (hahaha)Estou jogando num notebook bem fraco: Intel graphics (r) 2012, 2GB ram e um Dual Core 1.1ghz (Celeron) e nenhum lag a reportar.Se você procura um jogo de ação com elementos de RPG ""ESSE JOGO FOI FEITO PARA VOCÊ""Recomendo com certeza amiguinhos! :3 *Galamoth é um chefe de Castlevania SOTN			"

												I would consider this sort of like a 2D Bastion, which, for me, is high praise. It doesn't have quite the uniquely immersive experience that Bastion does, but the gameplay is a bit more varied and enjoyable. Though it's RPG-ish, it also has platforming and arcade-like combos and boss rankings. There are two playable characters, Wyatt and Reina, and I've found both to be lots of fun. Another two character will be patched in later. With the decent campaign length and many build options for each character, there seems to be a lot of replayability.The story has a pretty broad cast of characters for what it is, though admittedly, outside of the main characters, they don't have much depth. Many of the characters are evidently named and designed by backers, which is a thing that concerns me about Kickstarter projects generally (backer perks bogging down the creative process), but it seems to ""work"" in this case. The main plotline is decent, and not quite as generic as you might think from the synopsis about a struggle between gods of light and dark. The way you fight both angels and demons also reminds me of Darksiders, while we're on the topic of specific game comparisons. The music is awesome. I was actually surprised at how much of it there was and how creative and well-developed some of the melodies were. The art style is your typical cartoony indie game art. Both have a slight JRPG flair to them, which to me is a good thing, but YMMV.The dialog could use a proofreader. That's another thing that reminds me of Darksiders, heh. It's the little things, like a comma where there should be a period, or no comma where there should be one, etc. And please, for the love of God, stop putting exclamatory dialog in all caps. It looks amateurish. Still, some of the dialog manages to be pretty clever, IMO. ""You know, instead of giving you these books I could just punch you in the face."" Maybe I'm easily amused.Overall, it's quite a fun game, so anyone thinking about picking it up should think about picking it up a little harder than they did before, because I think they should pick it up too. That's how a drill works.			"

												*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*While reading this review I suggest you to hear this (and why not more) song, part of the soundtrack of Valdis Story: Abyssal City:


YouTube™ Video: Valdis Story AC OST - Blut Durst 

			Views: 3,290		

			Valdis Story AC: 28.Blut Durst Zack Parrish, Akhorahil of Thorngoth Buy the OST here: http://zackparrish.bandcamp.com/album/valdis-story-abyssal-city		

Let's begin.Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a 2D Action RPG ""a la"" Metroidvania style with some touch here and there of Beat em' Up, the story is quite interesting from the beginning to end though it never gets to deep or complicated but is good enough to keep you entertained trough the entire journey.The game features some simple status and equipment customization nothing to deep luckly, everything is simple to get at first read.The best part of the game is its gameplay simple but entertaining, you have two attack buttons (Normal and strong), 3 magic spells on ground and one on air with lots of enemy to tear apart, you can also guard/parry your enemies or dodge their attacks with ""skill cancels"" which let you cancel your combos to keep doing more or every action you make you can also escape from enemies attacks with it, though there isn't a great variety of enemies there are enough to keep the game far from boring.There's also a lot of obtainables very well hidden, for some you'll need certain magics so backtracking is a must if you want to get stronger or you want a 100% completition rateSomething that has to be mentioned its the dificulty level, I played on God Slayer and it was brutal, even normal enemies could beat you badly if you fight lightly with them, so if you select over veteran, beware.My only complaint to this game is the balance of the status, Luck and Agility are way much better than magic and strengh, some magics are almost useless and the level desing though not bad it could have been much better.In short:*The good:Decent customizationGood and responsive controlsSolid GameplayVery good musicGood boss fights*The Bad:Unbalanced statusUnnecesary Magic spellsCharmeless level desingScore:84/100I hope you like my simple review, if you found any grammar mistake please tell me so I can correct it and better my english			"

												An amazing metroidvania, quite deep and very entertaining. There's a good grade of freedom and not essential bosses, four completely different characters (with different weapons, skill trees, gamplay style and some even start in different locations!), and each of the characters can be played differently as is!It's been a while since I've been so addicted to a game, so this game gets a whole 10/10 from me, and I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes 2D arcades and enjoys searching for optimal character builds/gameplays. There are a lot of achievements for achievement hunters, but even game itself rewards players who can play well, and that is something I haven't seen in a while.Difficulty is something that a lot of other reviewers mention, sayig that it's excessive, and that even stopped me from buying the game for several months, but I was pleasantly surprised by it - difficulty in this game is completely fair, almost every boss have tactic that allows you to beat it even if you're not very good at games like these. Such tactics aren't well rewarded, yes, but it's possible. And getting an S rank with majority of the bossess on ""hard"" difficulty setting isn't anything special, as long as soon as you understand game mechanics and learn how to parry.I've already beaten the game 4 times, and I will continue, it has high replayability value. Deffinitelly worth its price!			"

												People love to call games ""Metroidvania"" any time you have to backtrack, like it's some kind of accomplishment. VS:AC goes beyond this and actually captures a lot of the fun that I had playing Symphony of the Night. But on top of that, it adds in combat that is a little deeper. I've only played one of the characters you can play as, but the skill tree looks to be pretty thoughtful, and I wonder how they differ over the different options. Also, the magic system gets a big thumbs up from me: initially I thought ""This seems complicated, I probably won't use it,"" but the game forces you to delve into it, and I'm glad that it did. It is a bit overwhelming at first, but once you get it, it becomes second nature. I'm not sure how long it is, but I'm enjoying it a great deal up through now.FOLLOW-UP -- Having returned to this game a over a year later, they have finished adding in the other characters and the devs have done an awesome job of substantially differentiating the four playable characters from each other in fundamental ways.

												Personal Rating: 7.5 of 10This game reminds me so much of Maple Story and Mega Man. For a side scrolling platformer, this game offers tonnes of contents, replayablity and challenges. The story is rather typical and nothing to shout about but it keeps things interesting enough to get you through. However what motivates me are the items, skills and unlockables the game has.Unlike any generic RPG game, items you find will gradually increase in potential as you discard the old ones. In this game, items equipment you find will stay in your inventory and you change your equipment anytime base on your play style or environment. You can find rare items to upgrade these equipment via NPC found in towns. Weapons offers different offensive strategy and different heroes comes with 4 to 5 sets of weapons. So you can imagine the possibility gameplay style you can have. Accessories are rare items that you can equipt to give you certain edge but comes with a slight unfavorable stat so you need to use them wisely. On top of that you can also choose to have a companion which you can summon to aid you in combat. Each companion has different ways of aiding you, directly or indirectly.Spells in this game is rather different as you unlocks a set them as you progress through the game. Each set has 4 spells that you can equipt and change at anytime. Each spell is unique and behaves differently so again, you need to pick the right combination spells that suits your strategy.Combat, like the old days, are not head to head and potion mashing style. Each enemies behaves differently so you need to time your attack or exploit their weakness to minimize the damage taken although it isn't that punishing. However, some fights can be difficult especially boss fights can be really challenging. To put it in short, dying in this game is not the end of the world.The game has several towns that offers different styles and you can quick travel between them. Each town serve as the main entry point to its theme dungeon. Each dungeon has different types of enemies and bosses and the size of each dungeon is just nice for you to explore. You will constantly need to revisit areas since some are only accessible with the right key or skills which are obtained elsewhere.In certain areas, there are puzzles that you can solve in order to get access to loots or to proceed to the next area. These puzzle requires you to activate certain mechanism within the same map and there is a actually a time limit for you to get to the designated place. This can be rather frustrating at times because you might need to execute the puzzle flawlessly.So there you go, generally all that mashed up you have Valdis Story. I do recommend this game to people who loves platformer and a challenge. By far, this is one of the most satisfying game in this genre I've played.			"

												Do you like Iga's Metroidvania's? Then you will eat this game up. its oozing with similar game design and style, and has an impressive amount of polish. its the closest thing to having an Iga game on steam, similar titles don't compare,  The writting is a bit lacking, but that doesn't really detract from the experiance. Aditional difficulties really push the skills of the player harder than most castlevani titles too.			"

												Valdis Story: Abyssal City's fun as hell. It's akin to one of the later Castlevanias - open world, exploration gated by abilities/items, RPG elements in levelling and character development, you know the drill. If you want that, this is a competent one, although a little on the short side. (Some of the achievements will make this clearer - beat the game under 3 hours, complete it all without saving, etc.) Got a lot of replay value though - 2* characters, multiple difficulties, and some branching of the world based on your actions (some characters die/vanish, entire optional bosses - got replay value is what I'm saying).I want to point out, before this next part: I wholeheartedly endorse this game. I kickstarted the sucker and I enjoy the pair of titles I've played from the developers (they were also behind Tetris Attack Puzzle Quest, aka Legend of Fae). If you are even remotely interested by the description above, buy and play VS:AC. The below is a caveat I point out for honesty's sake.This game is not finished as I write this. Not in a ""it's broken and buggy"" fashion or anything, no, but in a ""The game itself tells you more NPCs and quests are 'Coming Soon'"" way. The ""2* characters"" above? Yeah, very clearly two others are going to be playable, they're greyed out on the character select screen and currently no achievements reference playing as them. They also show up in various cutscenes/throughout the game. I'll try and edit this at some point if I notice this changing (hell, I'll probably replay it again when that happens!), but as of the end of 2013, you're not getting the ""full"" package. There's still a full-featured game here worth your time. Give it a go.			"

												I should preface this by pointing out that this game is rife with flaws that just cannot be ignored, so I'll start with them as a leadup to why you should give this game a chance.The artstyle is serviceable. The characters are just... chibi anime bobble heads. The bosses and enemies are quite good but yeah.. you're playing an anime bobblehead. It neither thrills nor repels me. It's just there.The story is pretty forgettable and there honestly isn't much to say about it because it's quite simple. You're shipwrecked in a magical lost atlantis analogue and are trying to locate your crew and dealing with the crossfire from an overarching otherworldly conflict. The only truly black mark I'd ascribe to the game isn't really relevant to its plot but rather its lore. The game's exposition is rife with references to far off events and lands and characters and historic things and various parents and miscellaneous ancestors in a way that's blatantly just teasing the player over this stuff likely being addressed in a theoretical future sequel. I point this out because it feels like this emphasis on wider world expositon comes at the expense of the setting the characters actually find themselves in: the underwater city. Truth be told the setup for it is pretty engaging at first, but it's rarely utilized besides offhand mention of scavenging supplies, npcs in towns not trusting you for all of 5 seconds when you first turn up, and a handful of times you interact with mana-heaters.All that said about the plot the gameplay must be absolutely 10/10 in every regard right? Well the exploration is ok. It's no symphony of the night or super metroid it's just serviceable. This isn't a game that's going to convert people for whom the metroidvania style holds no real charm. The level design is pretty simple. The enemies have an interesting enough variety (especially since they updated the game and added variants everywhere) but are usually dealt with fairly similarly.So what's the draw?Well it's the boss fights. The boss fights in this game, with perhaps 2 exceptions, are all extremely good. There's probably only one that's outright reused and palette swapped (and maybe another that turns up again as a degraded miniboss) but the boss variety here is just through the roof, and is really enough to be a selling point for people who already enjoy metroidvanias in general. If you enjoy the genre the rest of the game is simply passable enough. It's what you're used to. But the boss fights will thrill you, in both a challenge sense and a strategy sense. The game has four characters all with 5 different weapon styles, multiple spell schools to choose from, branching skill trees that actually allow for some real build variation and not just some linear progression bar you'll inevitably fill up completely, no... you have to plan out your build and focus on a playstyle. There's even an alignment system that you can pendulum back and forth at will and even the alignment system wildly changes as it's influenced by which stats are your primaries.In short this game just spoils  you in the amount of fun it lets you have with the bosses. So many options, so many playstyles. It's not for nothing that the bonus arena gamemode is essentially a boss survival run. The bosses are the main star. If a 2d platformer with mild exploration and a big emphasis on boss battles sounds like what you kinda already play...  caus this sure ain't a limited genre... then why not this one?			"

												I'm so torn on whether I'd recommend this game because there is so much to like. The art design and music is beautiful, the controls are great, and the environments are incredible. Unfortunately I can't recommend it because it just isn't a satisfying game. The combat system is fun but the enemies feel cheap. I'm used to hard as balls Castlevania games but I've never raged as hard as at this game.To start, while the combos are fun to pull off it feels pointless when enemies can just disregard them if they need to. There's a handful of great boss fights but most of them feel like cheap ""to do"" lists. I appreciate that the bosses get harder as you weaken them, but in practice it sometimes becomes absurd. The fact that many of the bosses spawn enemies during the fight is a total cop-out in character design. Bosses are where you should be showing off and challenging the player, but the game continually throws out arbitrary tasks like wailing on a crystal, beat these minor enemies. It really detracts from the finished product.The good news is that this game seems like it could be great with a little more fine-tuning, but for right now it's a game that has a lot of potential, but for me is unsatisfying on nearly every level.

												This game can be both challenging and frustrating, but it's a very fun experience. I would pay for it and play it again. I hope you try it and enjoy it as much as I did!Pros+ Graphics/animation + Music - Fair.+ Story - Interesting, simple in a classic sense, unique mythology.+ Gameplay - Fast fighting with a fun mixture of magic and striking. + Features -  The RPG elements are fantastic! A great variety of powers, equipment/upgrades, and customizable stats/skills.Cons- Story - Disinteresting dialogue at times, underdeveloped, weak ending.- Gameplay - Frustrating platforming, nonexistent/poor tutorials for key gameplay features.- Features - The last skill tree sets and ""ultimate"" weapons are dissappointing.(I recommend using a guide to learn skills and find items or skills that will make this game more enjoyable at the beginning. Find the double jump as soon as possible and use skill cancel to get behind enemies. The double jump will make platforming, battling, and getting new items easier. I learned the hard way and it's frustrating.)			"

												For years, now, I have been looking for a game that played and felt like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  Not only did this title satisfy my love of side-scrolling action and a sense of discovery, but it held a special place in my heart for being the most highly detailed and exceptionally artistic approach to the genre for its time.  As a spriter myself, SotN looked and felt amazing.Valdis Story has absolutely scratched this itch for me.  Many of the game's mechanics feel highly fleshed out and leveling up gives the player a real sense of accomplishment.  Gameplay is challenging, even on normal difficulty, but highly enjoyable.  In a lot of Indie Metroidvania games, I feel like I'm fighting more with the sloppy or often-times clunky character movements than I am with enemies.  Valdis Story plays smoothly and movement feels polished and natural, with just enough friction to add a real sense of accomplishment when you traverse an expertly-crafted navigation puzzle (which this game is full of!).Enemies are challenging, so far I have not found myself coming into a situation where I've out-leveled a region of the map where enemies are so far below you that they pose as completely unthreatening.  In the right combinations, even simple enemies that stand little chance individually have been paired together to make an otherwise simple foe become a more exciting engagement.In short, I love this game and it does the Metroidvania genre justice in both visual appeal and clean, professional-quality side scrolling action goodness.

												While I enjoyed the older Metroid games (especially the GBA ones), I would not consider myself a devotee of the ""Metroidvania"" genre; Dust - An Elysian Tail was the first game I played in years.But still I enjoy it when a game does so many things right like Valdis Story:The melee focused combat is highly rewarding as you learn to master the ""Skill Cancel"" ability and start to weave in magics to your combos. The exploring in the sunken city makes you backtrack for upgrades but never feels like it forces you to do so. While it does not look as gorgeous as Dust did, it is still charming with fluid animations and diverse looking zones.The story starts of a bit weak, but the more cities you discover and lost crewmen you find the more compelling it gets. I like that the male protagonist (you can also play a female one and unlock others) is no knight in shining armor but more of a brutal anti hero - with a warm heart for his crew.			"

												Very rewarding game but beginners need to be VERY PATIENT.Love every single bit of this game. Plot was not too complicated but still gave the game a nice atmosphere. Gameplay was fun and challenging, great soundtracks. The design and personality of characters are super lovable, and the conversations in the game were very interesting. The only problem with this game is that it has been here for quite a while and went through several updates and changes, so it would be hard for a beginer to explore the world of VSAC. I think the game originally wasn't as complex as it currently is. Though after the first run and things started to make sense, the game became irresistible for me.I have never felt like the game alone had provided player with enough instructions. The map, especially, is a nightmare and it took me a long time to figure out which area was where, where I had to go next, where I was, etc. and I had to visit forums a few times to figure out what was happening.   Some of the important locations in the game got cleared out if I didn't take certain actions, but there was hardly any hint about what action to take at all.	 But the few outwieghted drawbacks didn't stop me from spending a couple hundred hours here and this is still among the top of my favourite list. In short, worth the money!			"

												Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a good example of drawing quality out of a game through a well-oiled grounded combat system. Fighting in it rewards learning enemy patterns and conscious battling and its skill tree system doesn't hold your hand on what to get but satisfies those who like to create builds. While length might feel a little short, two playable characters with different skills and weapons (with two more on the way) help hold you for your dollar's worth. Art style is great and leaves character easily recognizable though the story comes across as a tad cliche with its angels and demons angle. At times, the dialogue and backstory veers into teenagers-RPing-on-GaiaOnline levels of corniness but it ultimately doesn't choke you with it.To sum it up, Valdis Story is definitely worth the fifteen dollars and while it might have needed a bit of reining in on the creators' parts with dialogue and story, it's really a labor of love, shown in its well built combat system, an essential in this type of genre.

												If you have any interest at all in the Metroidvania genre, this is the game for you. Since the most recent update, there are now 4 playable characters, each of whom has distinct play styles - not only from each other, but even with different builds of the same character, via the various weapons which you can use. This game rewards perfection - after you kill a boss, you'll be judged on how well you did, with combat (amount of damage taken), time, and potions (did you run out of health/mana) all tallied up. If you're good enough to get an S or A rank, bosses will award extra skillpoints or stats, which will make your character that much more deadly. In contrast, if you barely squeak by a fight with a C, D, or F rank, you'll get a handful of XP, barely more then you would killing some no-name minion.Each character has 4 stats (strength, agility, intelligence, and luck) and 3 separate skill trees which you can invest in, all of which can give bonuses and unlock new abilities. In addition to the different weapons which I've already mentioned, you can also get about a dozen different kinds of armor, all of which have different bonuses; accessories, which tend to be very powerful, but all have some kind of tradeoff; and assistants, other characters who you team up with during the game who can be called into battle to fire off an attack and often give bonuses as well. Oh, and your weapons, armor, and assistants can all be leveled up, improving their stats and often giving better/bigger/more attacks. If I had to name some negatives, one would be that trying to max out everything (which isn't needed to complete the game) takes a lot of grinding, and that some bosses (especially some of the optional ones) are exceptionally difficult (to beat - let alone get a good rank on). Minion respawning (which takes place whenever you leave a screen) can also be a pain, although it can be used to help collect more materials for upgrading and/or gain levels.In conclusion, an extremely strong game which has seen amazing support from the developer.

												Great metroidvania game. Both exploration and action are awesome. Bosses especially, they have nice variety. Platforming sometimes requires great precision but I feel the controls do not back up such requirements so I can see someone finding those platforming bits frustrating. But most of the time they are optional as they are about reaching some treasures. With that in mind, I really wouldn't recommend playing this game without a controler. Graphics are beautiful and the soundtrack is great so give it a go if you have a controller.			"

												Since picking up this game I have not been able to put it down, and I would love to express my appreciation over this. The game is a very well-constructed package - from the balance between light/dark/neutral themes to the variety of gameplay options given to the player.The story is very serviceable (Endless Fluff, in fact) and I particularly enjoyed the style and setting.What really hooked me was the depth of the stats, skills, and equipment (Let alone how fun the combat is) The gameplay options per character because of the acknowledgement of hybrid builds and magic-melee is so spice, I love it.I feel like the game holds something for Srankers/Speedrunners AND a more casual player who likes to get everything but also take their time. I like Retry being a relatively painless option to master boss fights, and I like Goibniu mode being the ultimate test with its own leaderboards that only a single steam achievement is tied to.The soundtrack? Amazing. The aesthetic? Beautiful.   My biggest problem? I wish A-S-S didn't spell S rank for me.			"

												I'm not a review-writing person, but this game deserves my effort at it. :PFrom the art to the OST, to the freedom you have to play as you see fit and explore, what i can say about this game is that its incredibly well made. First of all, you can select one of two characters from the start, with the remaining ones being unlocked after you beat the game for the first time. The story is about said group and its ship crew, who see themselves trapped on an underwater city, filled with Angels, Demons and Ferals. And the war between them.Each character has their own journey and their own playstyles, which are highly customizable through weapon variety and a skill tree.While dynamic, the gameplay can be really challenging at the start, because of how fast paced it can be. But damn, once you learn it, it sure is rewarding. The boss battles are fun and unique from each other, even fights against normal monsters is something enjoyable (except those flying ice things, ♥♥♥♥ those).Also, if you're a Dio (or at least have heard Holy Diver once) fan, you will have a little surprise. :P			"

												Valdis story:Abyssal city is an experience, and with a plethora of 4 characters, rich story, plenty of items, collectables, and just enough replayabilty with gobinu mode [Leaderboards!] And the high capability to speedrun the game [With an achievement incentivizing this] This game is a must buy to those metroidvania purists out there for sure.EDIT: I am now the person who runs the Valdis story abyssal city speedrun thread on speedrun.comhttp://www.speedrun.com/Valdis_Story_Abyssal_City I also wrote a guide as to how to speedrun as vladyn on speedrun.com check it out, we could use more runners for this amazing game			"

												A game with lovely visuals and outstanding soundtrack that is marred by some of the worst game design decisions I have ever seen. There is a difference between challenge and artificial difficulty and the issue that I seem to find the most glaring is already quite fixable in the game. Basically the combat is built around comboing your enemies and continuing said combo with a Skill Cancel which breaks you out of your animation and acts as a sort of invulnerability to dodge or get behind your foe and allow you to resume your combo anew, unfortunately you have a limited amount of these cancels and for some reason when you are in combat you cannot regenerate them unless you are completely inactive in a fight. Even a character who can summon minions is penalized for them attacking an enemy by not being able to regenerate. This probably wouldn't even be an issue if you had an alternative way of being defensive but unless you build specificially for blocking and parrying, a non defensive build character will not be able to block strong physical or any magical attack whatsoever, so you're stuck taking damage from an attack that you might not be able to dodge if you are out of cancels and cannot block without eating some heavy damage because any sort of attack no matter how weak will send you into a stunned animation that every enemy in the game will take advantage of. You're not even allowed to break out of a stunlock like you should be able to until an almost arbitrary number of hits.What's worse is that with these flaws is that the game expects you to be perfect with a ranking system in bossfights that at first seems pretty neat, until you release later on that perfect ranking is very heavily out of your favor. You're ranked on how fast you kill the boss, how well you attacked without taking hits and finally by not using any life potions or essentially never losing all your health. This is fine but you soon learn that bosses become damage sponges who love to prolong fights by either constantly running or even blocking your attacks midcombo, can easily stunlock you out of cancels in their usually cramped arenas that they take up a good chunk of, and in later game do high damage that you can hardly seem to mitigate so getting downed is probably likely if you're not aware of their patterns, if they even have any. Its just an amount of perfection required that seems outlandish even for people that love this sort of unforgiving ""challenge.""I want to love this game but damn was the magic gone when I saw just how unenjoyable it was at times.

												Pros: * Pretty visuals * Unique character designs * Good soundtrack* Tight controls Cons: * Combat is tough and unforgiving (not my cup of tea, ymmv)* For a metroid-vania style game (which this kind of is) the map leaves a lot to be desired. * Interface is a bit cluttered* Sometimes feel directionless* Story is good, but it can be tough to follow at times. If you can get past its faults and like hard games, you might love this one. Not for me.			"

												Traversing through the Abyssal City is no easy task. In fact, Valdis Story is perhaps best described as the intersection between Dark Souls and MapleStory. At times it may feel like a test of patience, but the game thrives on its depth of gameplay and dependency on skill, allowing players to choose the way they want to hack and slash through the game's many colorful locales. While the lore is easily forgettable, the amount of love and passion that went into creating this game is obvious. 8.0/10.			"

Nice 2D graphics and animation easily pair with fun exploration for upgrades and a great fighting system.Starting with 2 seperate characters that play nothing alike and being able to unlock 2 more that are even more differents gameplay-wise only crank up the replayability.The game control well, look great and sound good too.

												I'll keep this short - if you need a Metroidvania game with some brutal gameplay and some fairly solid story, then Valdis Story is a winner.  If you can't handle games that will destroy you again and again on the lowest difficulty, then move along.  Seriously, not for the weak of heart.			"

												If you enjoy the 2D Metroids and the SotN/Gameboy Advanced Castlevanias, then you are going to fall in love with Valdis Story: Abyssal City. Given life through Kickstarter, the Devs really created something special which will certainly provide you with a longing for more.With 4 difficulties and 2 characters to choose from right off the bat, the option of choice is quickly acknowledged. Play as hardened warrior Wyatt or the swift monk Reina in an Atlantis-esque landscape where Angels and Demons fight for control. All the while a neutral party has appeared, fearls...neither Light or Dark have become to run rampant in the underwater world and has been causing townsfolk to be wary of strangers. As Wyatt or Reina explore the world, you'll slowly uncover why this abyssal city has become a battle ground of the gods.At its core, Valdis Story can be described as a Tactical Hack n' Slash RPG. Combat being the main focus, involves a light attack and heavy attack with combos being performed as multiple inputs are given. Combined with the ability to strike in the air, cancel your animation in order to seamlessly meld into another combo, and cast 4 different types of magic, one can imagine the styling of Valdis Story's combat can be quite the visual. The game may be overwhelming at first due to the immense amount of status effects, buffs, and items...but soon transforms into a short but dense experience like no other.The art style is fantastic and the environments each have their own unique spin. The combat, spells, and animations are all top notch and fit the mood of the locale perfectly. The soundtrack is on the same level as the rest of the game as I found myself just leaving the game paused and taking in the hauntingly lulling pieces.Some aspects may appear frustrating such as some timed platforming and I would have liked to see the character change in appearance depending on what armor is worn but that is completely understandable considering the the dev team makes up less room than a nuclear family.I could go on but hopefully you can see why this is a must own game if you enjoy Hack n' Slash/RPG/2D Exploration games and if you long to play another Castleroid then this is close as you'll get!

												8/10The Good:- Combat is like a 2D Devil May Cry, done well- Metroidvania aspects just enough to cure the itch- Equipment progression based on gameplay decisions rather than flat upgradesThe Bad:- Poor enemy variety- Platforming sections may not be for everyoneLove Metroidvania?  Join the club.  Valdis Story is currently easily my favorite of the PC Metroidvanias I've played in recent years.  It features excellent, tight combat mechanics that feel somewhat like Devil May Cry thanks to the mobility and attack options from the game's spell system.  The world is mostly a joy to explore and new travel skills are given at just the right pace to keep the player interested in exploring more.  Furthermore, there are two characters (with two more upcoming, but in very slow development) and some impactful storyline changes that can add a lot to the replayability of the game.One of my main complaints about the game is the lack of enemy diversity,  It's not a huge issue, and the game does change it up by giving existing enemies new abilities as you level up, but one of my favorite things about Castlevania SOTN was that just about every zone had its unique monsters that each added to the atmosphere of the zone.  In this game, it just feels like you're fighting those angelic monk dudes all the time except in different places.  Also, the game has a number of difficult platforming sections which can be very frustrating to some players.  Thankfully, not all of them are required. "

												This game was a hidden gem that I bought during one of the holiday sales last year I think. Man o man, was I surprised to find such a fun and charming game.Taking from the Metroidvania style of layout and combat similar to that of devil may cry, this game makes out for some fun times. The music is great, the combat is great, the platforming is great...for the most part. I say the most part because there are some tedious level designs that require a lot of attempts due to nearly impossible requirements in speed and platforming. Other than that the game is amazing and easily has become one of my most fun and memorable games of all. Given that there are two charcters, both with their own stories, the game begs for a second playthrough; which I am working on now :DI sincerely hope the developers decide to make a sequel or another game in this same style.Easily a 8.5/10Update: After finishing the game with Reina and playing throught the new content, I have to say, STUN LOCKING is a HUGE problem with this game!!!!!!!! It is frustrating an infuriating!!!! I still stand by that this is an over all great game but the two GLARING flaws in the game design are some of the platforming and definitly the stun locking that some of the enemies put you in and definitely the eye of Myrgato and the final boss.......wow, I have never been more frustrated with a game. I just hope the sequel, if there is one, will not fall victim to these design flaws.			"

												Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a metroidvania type action game. You can play a total of four different characters, with two unlocked at the start and the other coming soon as free DLC. Each character has a unique play style, with skills and abilities you can level up. Wyatt Goibniu uses swords and has a muted form of magic, while Reina is a monk with unarmed combat and stronger magic. Levels are designed so you need to backtrack to access new areas, so you get past obstacles after you find keys or gain new skills. The game runs in a strange resolution, but offers both windowed and full screen modes. This is a solid metroidvania with a good character leveling system and wonderful level design.Watch the full video review on ShotGaming.com Steam Shots EP125 "

												This game is absolutely brilliant. I'm not too into the art direction of the whole game, but the quality of animations, the INSANE depth of combat and platforming are just so incredibly tight and responsive that I cannot resist.Apart from having 4 completely different characters with varying playstyles (and each having 4 kinds of weapons that vary it up even more) you got a sizeable game with a lot of replayability and an extra boss rush-ish mode, complete with beautiful soundtrack. if you like leitmotif stuff, you are going to love fighting the bosses and repeatedly dying while listening to some awesome tunes.This is by far my top 1 favorite indie game of all time. I can't even think of a proper way to praise this game. There is but a single caveat that I struggled with, and that is the in game map, it really is kinda♥♥♥♥♥and not all that helpful (icons for NPCs and a worldmap would have been nice).I love this game.

												One hre is faced with one of the best metroidvanias since ages. The game has tight controls, an immsersives gameplay and TONS of things to do. It's a shame, tho, that the MC is so much worse compared to the other 3. Hell, I wouldn't recommend him to anyone even if my life depened on it. If you stick with the other 3, though, the game will be really really great. The map, like in any respectable metroidvania is big, but not so much that you actually get intimidated by it. This makes side scrolling, killing and leveling up much better.LEVELING UPA whole different level of complexity lies here. I mean, it's not like diablo 2 or POE and its infinite options, but it still is VERY POSSIBLE to do AN ASSLOAD of combinations. You get 3 trees for each char and eahc of them differ A LOT from each other. Besides that, youg et to feel the RPG element of it. You want a Monk-ish Reina with a cane? You got it. You want a Brawler? You got it. You want a devilish-sexy girl doing an assload of damage while triple (YES, TRIPLE) jumping? You Got it. You want a Van Hesling kinda of guy? you got it. There so many things to explore you get the feeling one playthorugh wont be enough. Well, it really wont, which means the replayability is IMMENSE.THE ONLY DISAPOINTMENT FOR A CASTLEVANIA SOTN LOVERWould be the lack of extra equipment or equipment variety. I mean, you have 4 weapons and all, but you will probably stick with one of them depending on your playstyle. That sole wepaon is really complex and has the ability to sahpe your entire gaming exprience which means your tree will have to combine with it. That alone is the complain I would have, since this means I'm somewhat limited. SinceI'm not the one to love infinite possibilities, this is not exactly a problem, but I like the idea of changing on the fly. Overall a great gaming experience, a solid 8.2, if you want a number.

												This is a great game for anyone who likes action games and metroidvanias.  It is good in nearly every respect.The gameplay is very well-done. Focus is on combos and you have a good variety of moves, but you are punished severely if you don't prioritze not getting hit (especially by bosses). So it doesn't feel like button mashing. And earning S ranks on bosses (which gets you better rewards) will test your skill no matter what difficulty you set it to.Levels are large and well-designed. Bosses are also well-designed and quite varied. Graphics are respectable and music is great. The unlockable characters play differently enough to justify beating it multiple times, and it's pretty long to start with. Plot is above average for this kind of game. Chracter customization is pretty strong, and you can change it later in the game for a small fee.The only gripe I have is that the game somewhat punishes you for playing unspoiled.1. Boss rooms are usually indistinguishable from normal rooms until you're already in them, and sometimes far from save points. The game provides a ""continue"" feature if you die, but doing that hurts your boss rating so you'll still have to load your game if you want the best rewards but stumbled into a boss unprepared.2. There's events that will kill all the NPCs in three out of the four towns unless you do X before Y point in the game. One of those is on a timer.3. One boss and a few items can be missed forever, and there's not enough of certain fixed-quantity items to craft all armors or spells.			"

The abilities you have generally didn't do much to actually make me want to use them regularly.3. There were times when I felt like my button presses were being registered. It didn't happen often but it was frustrating when it did.This is a pretty solid game that I loved right of the bat. However, I liked it a little less as time went on due to the above mentioned cons. Nonetheless, I do recommend this game. 8/10			"

												A catchy and charming side scrolling battle platformer. Pretty art, interesting combat system with melee, spells, and a good mix of spells and items. Not the least bit shy about ramping challenge up to frisky levels that remind me of the glory days. I spent over an hour of intense almost-frustration learning a boss... but I felt my skills ramping up to meet it. A few situations border on punishing, especially toward the end- but that does make your victory even sweeter.There is a neat cast of characters, lots of secrets to find, and an interesting overall story about the fall of the goddesses who made the world.  I definitely enjoyed my time in Valdis Story.			"

												This is a very good game marred by some poor design choices. I really enjoy free-exploration games, but missable content immediately shatters a relaxing gaming experiences with the looming specter of ""did I just inadvertantly lock some content for the entire playthrough?"" Don't do that. That means I need a guide to enjoy your game. Speaking of, none of the maps online are up-to-date. The Hollow and the Mine, and a few other places are incomplete.Also, some of the controls are wonky. Grab a ledge. Now, jump off the ledge. I bet you guessed that would be the jump button. No, that makes you climb up. Press the directional button opposite the ledge. THAT makes you jump. Unintuitive. Also, the Magic controls use a modifier-button system, but don't require the modifier to be pressed prior to accepting input. So, something like (holding up)->RB(hold)->right will actually probably result in the Magic bound to UP being cast, rather than waiting for a keypress after holding the modifier key. So you really have to think of it differently. The direction is the modifier, and the trigger is ""cast something."" This isn't exactly how the game introduces the concept, and it definitely takes some getting used to.The overall game flow is pretty good, once you get past the unnecessary hurdles.The story is a bit of a mixed bag. The core concepts of the world are cool, but the worldbuilding with names and such is a complete mess. Everything from pseudo-Latinate to pseudo-Norse pseudo-Japanese is represented in a way that is distracting. If they'd have at least mapped these different phoneme-sets to the various races of Angels, Humans, and Demons, they could have probably come out with something resembling cohesive. As it is, it sounds too much like nonsense words.As for the art, that, too is a little mixed. It's mostly great. Smooth animation, detail where it counts, that sort of thing. It's not without problems, though, like the rest of the game. For one, backgrounds and foregrounds can blend together in places. In the first town, Tagrum (Human, Latinate), there are yellow-brick platforms. Some are in the background, some are solid, and you can usually tell the difference, but not always. For another, the characters designs are of inconsistent quality. Reina (Human used to be allied with Angels, Japanese-esqe name) looks great in her character portraits, but in her sprite, her hair mostly covers her face a lot of the time. It's like she's constantly looking slightly away from the screen, either way you face. Other characters have slightly odd head/face proportions. One guy is named Shadoboxxer (yes, two Xs, no W) for some reason. (See what I mean about the naming, though?)In the end, it's a decent Metroidvania that sacrifices the relaxing exploration element I love for some branching plot I don't care a lot about, and adds some really intricate fighting mechanics that are probably more contrived than elegant. Still, if you can look past the flaws, it's pretty enjoyable. "

												So I want to recommend this game but there are a few caveats. Before getting into pros and cons I want to say this is a game that I held off on buying for years but it was worth it in the end; I purchased it during the Summer sale this year for $3.75. This is a fairly standard Castlevania-esgue game in the same vein of SoN on though it has an interesting idea behind it a few quirks. So lets hit those pros and cons.Pros:-The art style of the game is gorgeous and everything looks fluid.-The exploration aspects are fun-The combat system is good but...(see below)-The challenge is adjustable, great idea considering some of the things you can stumble into.-An interesting story as mentioned earlier.Cons:-Certain ""puzzles"" are timed too short and have to be done almost perfectly to succeed.-...Combat is good but there are bad quirks to it. Status effects are very harsh and the combo/cancel system takes a bit to get used to.-Even with adjustable difficulty it's easy to run into something you aren't ready for if you go exploring or worse yet something you're supposed to be ready for but aren't yet levelled up. Regardless of the pros and cons I heartilly recommend this game. The problems are things that can be adapted for especially if you've played 16bit or earlier action platformer games and the difficulty is still fair even when you are under levelled. Good game that deserves more love.			"

												OK... I just beat this, so here it is fresh.This game if ♥♥♥♥ing hard.  Alright, it's been said before, but no one really talks about why or what is so ""hard"" about it.Look, this is an action adventure that has more in common with a game like Street Fighter than is does with a game like castlevania.  You absolutely need to learn how to combo, juggle, interlace spells with light/hard attacks, and use lift attacks to air juggle and use a mechanic the game calls ""skill cancel"" to tie one or more of these sequences together.  By the end of this game, if you see it that far, you will be chaining 2 - 3 attack/spell sequences together effortlessly, and it's bloody fun, but here's the thing...... the enemies play the same way.Even non-boss, little♥♥♥♥♥♥crabs and ferries will juggle you.  You will have enemies that spawn more enemies that do little burts of aoe that know you back ENDLESSLY - and you will want to twist your controller so hard the batteries start popping out the back.  It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ infuriating, exactly like queueing up against the 50th ♥♥♥♥ing Akuma and just watching him juggle you until you're dead in game and raging out of game.Now... this may vary from player to player, some people are find with this and the game has a ""retry"" option that lets you just restart the room you most recently entered.A quick look at the garbage:- The story is absolute garbage, something about gods, yadda yadda, you won't follow it either.- The in-game map is a turd that only shows the rooms connected to your current zone and never displays them in regards to the other zones they are connected to.  Basiacally, it's like having a town map and no world map, but the the town exit doesn't even say where it's going... you have to memorize it basically and its just a chore.- Many of the optional bosses are build specific.  That means you have to build your character a certain way or you're not going to beat them.  I beat the game at level 20, beat the last 2 bosses all first try, but could barely scratch some of the optional sub-bosses.  (Level 20 is the max btw.)A quick look at the briliant:- The control you have over your character is wonky at first, but really really amazing once you get the hold of it.  - The spells are all really varied and there are a ton of different ways you can build your character, some of them more effective than others, but all equally entertaining.  YOU CAN RESPEC TOWARDS THE END OF THE GAME.- The music and visuals are all on point, really good animation.- Lots of different items to farm, collect and upgrade.  This is honestly a big part of the game that is great, but really brought down by the worthlessness of the game map.  If you had a decent map to like, i don't know, know where they ♥♥♥♥ you are, exploring could be mroe enjoyable.Should you buy it... ♥♥♥♥... i don't know.			"

												This game is basically Metroidvania meets Dark Souls.  The combat system is smooth and extremely rewarding, the music and sound design are great, and the platforming puzzles are challenging.  There are a few parts where you might get stuck, but you can usually google search it to figure it out.  All things considered, this is a great game, and you should play it.  Like, right now.  Why haven't you bought it yet?			"

												This game is possibly the best purchase that i have made on steam so far. The gameplay is extremely satisfying, the soundtrack is incredible and the game mechanics are awesome as well. The only problem that I initially had with is was the controls for it on mouse and keyboard, but the game allows you to remap the keys to your liking. I have a razor naga mmog mouse, which was perfect for my attacking and skill cancel buttons. Solid game overall and I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes platformer rpg games.			"

												To put it simply this game is amazing and is well worth the asking price of $14.99 USD.I've been playing games on all platforms since 1986. Commodor64/Vicks 128 style, Atari, Sega Master System, Nes, Snes, etc.This game is simply amazing. It offers SO much in a tiny package. As an rpg you have literaly hundreds of different kinds of builds from the 2 currently available characters. 2 more characters will be available upon a future update! A pro can finish this game in 2 hrs or less, however there are many players like me who enjoy creating crazy builds and will grab every chest/armor/weapon/magic upgrade possible and enjoy using it on enemies! It has elements of Contra, Super Ghouls and Ghosts, Metroid, Castlevania (Sotn and +), etc.If you like games like Castlevania Sotn, Contra, Super Ghouls n Ghosts, Megaman, etc. You will feel right at home with this along with some refreshing new game mechanics like skill canceling and focus finishers than can make a huge difference in fights especially against a boss.Over-all I'd give this game a 9/10. It has a 10 in action/replayability/character uniqueness or customization/lore and storyline. The only reason I give it a 9 is simply becuase you cannot play co-op. Please do not let this discourage you from buying this game! It is a solid well-rounded game that anyone can appreciate!			"

												In 1997, I fell in love with Castlevania Symphony of the Night, many aspects of Valdis story reminds me of this masterpiece.This game delivers expectations of a metroidvania. Great arts, good crafting concepts, Boss mechanics, skills tree, different characters and more.Valdis Story offers great challenges, the game absolutely worth every penny, don't need to wait for a sale.

												This is a repost of my original review here[www.sophisticatedmayhem.com].When I'm asked what my favorite game genre is, I reminisce of Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Both were huge games with their own forms of progression and a sort of open-ended exploration element, which was controlled through movement upgrades and keys. Neither were particularly tough, but they offered a gradual increase in difficulty as the games went on. This genre of 2D exploration games took both titles in its portmanteau namesake: Metroidvania (or Castleroid if that's your thing). There's been quite a few of these games in the past few years, but Valdis Story: Abyssal City by EndlessFluff Games, is a particularly different one. While it has all the elements from a typical of a Metroidvania, it sandwiches its own in there: hard as balls combo-centric combat.The game begins with the player selecting difficulty. Unlike many games, the player is free to select ""Normal"" mode all the way to ""God Slayer"" mode right from the start. I went with ""Hard"" since I definitely wasn't a ""Veteran"" of Valdis Story yet. The game also lets you select between two characters: the brooding swordsman Wyatt, or the spunky monk Reina. There are two other characters with greyed out portraits, Gilda and Vladyn which apparently are to be added later. There are some variations in the story when playing as either currently available character, and different weapons and spells as well. The game begins with Wyatt, Reina and their crew of merry seamen hot on the tail of a warship carrying the Demon General, Gernot. While preparing to ambush, their ship is attacked by a huge sea creature that is neither Angelic nor Demonic. The ships sink and a flash of light ends up protecting the crew as they plummet to the lost city of Sitheil. The crew is split up, and your character quickly discovers that the war between Angels and Demons has reached here as well.Immediately, the game thrusts you into combat. In the beginning of the game, your character has a variety of spells and some basic attacks at their disposal, which can be used in the chaining of combos. Light attacks and heavy attacks can be fluidly chained with spells, and experimentation with this is encouraged in the game with ratings and experience bonuses. Further on, the player gets the ability to do a ""Skill Cancel"", which allows the player to dodge an attack, dash through an enemy or pound to the ground if in the air. Skill Cancels require a short recharge time before using again, and additional charges are available later on in the game. Combat quickly goes from button mashing to methodical cat-and-mouse within the first twenty minutes. In addition to this, there's an ability called ""Focus Mode"", which is a bar that fills from doing combos, killing enemies and taking damage. Once it's filled, it can be activated, bestowing the player with various buffs depending on equipment and skills. Before it has run its course, the player can deploy a finishing move from their repertoire that expands as the player plays.While Valdis Story has a particularly complex combat system, there's also a generous helping of RPG mechanics. Characters level with experience and are granted stat points and skill points for each level (up to level 20, which is the cap). Skills are divided into three trees: offense, defense, and spellcasting. Skills are entirely passive and have a strong influence on your character's optimal playstyle, but can be reset for a price halfway through the game if you've made a mistake. Armor also has a rather large influence on a character's playstyle by not only imparting stats and special effects (and some weapons, accessories, and spells), but by controlling your player's affinity between neutral, dark and light. You can go through the game without knowing or caring about affinity, but it's another straw on the pile of RPG mechanics.Unfortunately, there's only a few weapons in the game, and they come pretty late. The upside to this is once the game is completed, any of those weapons will be unlocked for subsequent playthroughs. Outside of this, there is no ""New Game +"" mechanic, but the game wouldn't particularly benefit from it considering how quickly it can be completed once combat and layout are mastered.The name of the game in Valdis Story, however, is difficulty. I only played on what they've deemed ""Hard Mode"", but it was unrelenting for a first try. There's little margin for error for a fledgling player and it takes a while to hit the ground running when walking into a boss fight, but a little practice goes a long way. Bosses have patterns and occasionally a boss will have some minions, but there's always a weakness to exploit. There's major incentives for playing well, as beating the boss quickly, without getting hit often, landing a bunch of combos and without using a health potion contributes to a grading system. The player is ranked from ""S"" to ""F"", with bonuses ranging from none for doing terrible, to free skill and stat points. The only particular issue I had with the game was the platforming aspects. Jumping is the only thing in this game that feels mushy. There's not very much control in the air, and flinch animations lock you in to tumble that make you feel you're playing I Wanna Be the Guy at times. These sections are definitely doable, but many of them feel unnecessarily difficult for being in a main path of progression. One section of the game requires you to perfectly complete a long section of platforming and timed switches to even leave. There are plenty of difficult platforming sections that will have you tearing your hair out, but this all depends on if you seek challenges from games or purely experiences.The game is beautiful and the soundtrack is excellent, but there's a lack of polish when it comes to the opening and ending scenes, which are motion comics without sound effects. There's a few other minor quirks, like some extremely static sprites and a lot of enemy pallet swaps, but nothing egregious. The story is actually pretty well written and considerably less tacky than I was expecting, which was a pleasant surprise.Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a surprisingly interesting addition to the Metroidvania genre and is worth checking it out if you're into these sorts of games. That said, this particular game is without a doubt championing triumph over uneven odds with skill, even on normal difficulty. Consider it the Dark Souls of Metroidvanias, which should excite as much as it should terrify.			"

												This game is a wonderful experience. Aesthetically the game is incredible, with atmospheric music, magnificent visuals and an incredibly detailed world. The game's mechanics are also fantastic, combat is an absolute joy and the metroidvania structure is pulled off wonderfully with objectives that are open ended but rarely confusing.But unfortunately the game likes punching you in the face every so often.Even on normal mode some bosses just infuriate me, some of the rooms have incredibly annoying hazards and others just force you to redo a multitude of rooms if you get knocked off a platform by an enemy, one of the most enraging instances being a chest that forces you to redo an entire dungeon if you miss the platform. The lack of a proper world map also prevents me from caring about completionism and can sometimes cause you to waste time when you thought one chunk of world was somewhere it wasn't.So this game definitely has it's flaws, but for the most part it's enjoyable and has too much charm for me to not recommend it.

												First of all, I wake up this morning, visit steam store to see what game on sale next, and see this @@. I bought this game 2 days ago, and now it's 75%-off. Ahhh, i'm so unhappy because i'm just a college student. I rarely buy new game on steam, but when i do... yeah... you know.Ok. Now the main part. As you can see, if you knew Maple Story, megamanX you will see this game so familiar. But! Game combat ? Awesome. You can watch the featured video to know more. You can do a combo to 30, even 40 and 50 hits. But it's very hard. You must do it with the lightning speed, and try different moves to continue the combo attacks.Graphics ? Awesome.I'm playing this game on fullHD screen, and this game doesn't support fullHD. Yeah, but it's still good. Puzzle ! So hard (to me) the first time. You can go from happy to angry when try to solve the map puzzle :P And btw, the map familiar to the game called: Castlevania. Why ? There are rooms, and many special spots that you can not enter when you are weak. Only if you defeat the bosses, they drop skills and then you can use those skills to enter.You will have an hour running all the map to find the treasures, lost crews and do quest. Because there is no quest's hint.What can i say ? Buy it now and stop asking if it's worth your money or not. You will like it.			"

What I liked:   Great piano gothic/orchestral soundtrack, it’s awesome Great progression of difficulty of bosses Loot based crafting upgrades paired with the standard metroidvania unlocks as well Art style and character/enemy design is outstanding Different characters for different playstyles What You Need to Know:  Let me get the bad out of way first, the timing for opening doors and doing the puzzles are ludicrous at times requiring nanosecond timing for about half of the puzzles. I really hate this and could be easily fixed by just adding 1 sec to every timer and boom, no more rage.   The crafting mechanic is so unique and I loved it, but what items to upgrade and what is really needed to be bought is not explained thoroughly. Some items are locked behind doing a very precise story part that can be screwed up and not allow you to get some good end game gear.  The UI is terrible for both keyboard and gamepad. No mouse for the UI, has to be arrow keys. I used the gamepad only because it’s more comfortable to play these games like it. Moving between submenus is tedious requiring you to move to the top and then shift the tabs, no shoulder buttons to do this, when they are not used for anything in the menus.  The map system is limited to what area you’re in and doesn’t show the whole world in any way, so the wiki is needed till you learn by memory, if you can where everything is. It’s so pointless.  Also when you discover an area by finding every room, you get 100% discovered on the map. This can be confusing because when you need to backtrack you don’t remember what areas you need to go to find previously unreachable secrets. I love the bosses in this game, all except the optional unkillable ones that need to be rebalanced and the final boss. I will say that every boss in unique, requires memory of patterns, timing and it’s starting to sound like a 2D dark souls ey?? It’s not that good at mimicking it, Some bosses have phases that they can’t die until a cystal is destroyed, all enemies killed etc. This breaks the flow and drags out what could have been a lot of great bosses. The worst is the final boss, I really hated that one. I got really lucky and killed it my second try. If I didn’t I would of given up, because too much♥♥♥♥♥♥is on screen and so many lame phases that make him unkillable and kicking orbs to him while dodging a million things. That boss fight is the worst designed boss fight I’ve ever seen. Sadly it is the last fight so it’s the freshest, I would say 80% of the bosses though are great fun. XD Exploration is ok in this game, and again I sound really negative with the game but I want to convey every little thing so you know what you’re getting before you buy. Areas can be fire, poison, or a blizzard and this will constantly damage you. Some even are boss arenas.  There are potions that prevent this, but you don’t know what  you need and can only have 1 active at a time. Going back to a town every time is tedious and can be fixed by townsfolk telling the player what might be needed. I fought the final boss fight with constant freeze damage ,because I thought no way this is the final boss area, it’s just a passable zone, and I got lazy, made the fight tougher, but still give me a heads up developer. Alright I’m starting to write an essay here, so I’ll finish it up quickly, combat has great variety in the magic abilities you unlock as you progress, and some are used to unlock secrets, hint metroidvania. I didn’t’ use much except healing because I needed it a lot. You get xp to level up your stats, you get rage mode with finishing moves, a story that is passable. Music is great and I applaud them for the effort put into it. Combat is stun lock heavy on you and the enemies as well, this isn’t really a good thing. You do have I frames but it’s a 2 action thing, it’s weird and it took a while to get used to. Lots to dig into on the wiki with multiple playthroughs as different characters and end level gear that might make the game easy if you want to.  Let me finish by saying this game has some flaws and some really stupid, obviously fixable annoyances. But it’s still a good little game I found and if all the annoyances didn’t turn you away, get the game, it’s still quite fun for the 80% of the great game in here My Score: CPaid: $4 Completed in: 12 hoursGames similar I recommend:  Dust: An Elysian Tail Apotheon Guacamelee SteamWorld Dig Strider MegaSphere "

Over halfway (60%) complete now and just not having any fun with the continious movement issues, never played a platformer with this poor of movement design. Challenging, engaging gameplay yes, poor movement design and controls yes, would I recommend this game, no, absolutely not until the game is even remotely enjoyable to play with smooth motion, not the continous jerky, faulty, and frustrating movement.

												Relatively fun metroidvania game, right up until it decides it wants to be the guy. Character wide platforms with a character that has hairy jump controls at best and is bundled with frequent timed jump puzzle rooms that require pinpoint jumps or you get to wait for another attempt. I do empasize the word ""wait"", as the timers have to fully expire before you can try again (something which IWBTG solves by just letting you reset and go from where you were, that idea escaped the developer in this case.) So if you mess up early or midway, enjoy sitting out that 45+ second timer you were given, because you can't skip it. Best case scenario is you have a room entrance nearby you can leave, and return from, provided it itself isn't barred with a timer jump challenge door that will lock as soon as you enter and force you to redo the previous room also.If the dev's would of reigned in their IWBTG fetish later on, this would of been an excellent title.

												A great idea ruined by horrible execution, which is a shame, since the game actually has a great setting and story.The game, a very interesting take on the Metroidvania style, starts showing its horrible flaws that add an artificial layer of difficulty not too long after starting out, like enemies ganging on you/chainstunning you, giving you little chances to escape, or just sitting next to ledges to hit you while you're climbing, pushing you down a few rooms without letting you do anything aside having to waste 10 more minutes to attempt that room again.This goes combined with a bunch of other problems, like the wonky controls and the dreadful menus. Also worth mentioning that there are some informations in the game manual (ex. status effects) that SHOULD actually be shown ingame, too.Buy only if discounted heavily, and if you feel like you have the patience to finish the game and not give up when the issues start coming up heavily.

												Writing a review for this castlevania-like game is a hard one.Most of the time, you jump and run around, hitting monsters, fighting bosses, and getting a fair share of storyline, which back in the days was enough for a good game, and by my opinion still is. The game tries to be more. Let me tell you where it succeeds and where it fails.So whats great about the game?The best part, I would say is the soundtrack. Its an orchestral masterpiece, that is most of the time rather calm but adds to the flair of the game without getting annoying. Weapons and armors are different enough to be satisfiyng and encourage you to try them out.The fighting system is easy to learn and hard to master. It makes you feel part of the fight!  I wish I could say that about the controls (I will come to that later)The game also has a sweet crafting-aspect that is subtle enough to keep the focus of the game, but it encourages you to pick up items dropped by enemies or received from chests.Graphics: As expected for the budget not full HD but still gorgeous. It reminds me of the days of castlevania on the gameboy advance, where they had to make the best of each pixel. It is incredibly satisifiying.So this makes up for a great game, right?Yes indeed. But on top of that solid base, the makers decided to put a thick layer of BS. Excuse my language.It is just so frustrating to see such a promising game to sort of be torn apart by those things.Ridiculous controls: Pressing the guard-button and the spell-button simultanously will open up the spell menu, which itself only requires you to press one directional button, to swap a spell. So guess what happens to you all the time:You guard, then want to cast a spell, then end up messing up your spell-config. Also you need to press down, then press an other direction to dash. Sounds complicated? It is. Of course you can change that. But remember, the evade/dash-button is also used for the dive-move (which lets you fall down incredibly fast). This will especially annoy you, when you have to do parcours under time pressure in order to get to those chests that you might want.Oh yes chests: There are golden-red chests, and grey ones. You might think, the golden ones are more valuable? Well, nyes, they usually contain lvl1 armor which 90% of the time may be weaker then your current one, and needs to be upgraded. Grey chests dont even have to contain frequent items, some of them may even be rare. Oh boy oh boy.Combat-system: This one is a big letdown, and one of the main aspects that almost ruin the game so listen up:- 90% of your enemies can block your attacks. Which means you spend way too much time on trying to somehow break their defense. - No recovery time. You do not get even half of a second of invulnarability when being hit, and every hit stuns you for about half a second. Enjoy the stun-locks. You will get them a lot.-BS- Bosses. I know I know... Bosses need to be hard. But also, they need to be fair. As your bossfight will be graded and rewarded according to your perfomance you would expect a fair fight. But no, while your grade gets worse about every minute or so, your enemies will do their very best to either: -Heal themselves -Run away (by teleport) -Build up a complete shield instantly, if you give them even just a millisecond of time to do so -Make 90% of the screen a 99% deadly hazard-zone. (yes, once you get caught you lose one life most of the time) -Do a combination of the things aboveIn effect the bossfights are quite frustrating. Also: BOSSFIGHTS are NOT announced. In other games you get a checkpoint, or a lot of chests, or a BIG HUGE DOOR that says ""DANGER, DANGER! HIGH VOLTAGE!"". Not in this game. Then two pet peeves of mine: Sometimes, areas that have been accessible before will be locked until further notive without any announcement, THANKS OBAMA!Also: SOme of the areas are large in vertical measure, one wrong button press and you fall about 6 stories deep, without knowing whats going on. Happy climbing.TL, DR:Graphics, sound, fighting system are awesome.I hope you now understand why this game frustrates me. I love it I hate it. It is like a good castlevania game and expands the horizon by cool caracters, lots of skills , crafting and such. But it ruins it by adding bosses that act like little finches, complicated  controls without any need for that and a good deal of unfairness.If you are totally into Castlevania and stuff  like that  and you can take a beating without crying, give it a try.If you cannot deal with an unfair game and clumsy controls then hands off.Love you guys,Goobs out!

												Very fun game in the ""metroidvania"" style of game. Really more a combination of Metroid and Devil May Cry. Lots of replayability options in the form of diferent characters and builds. Music is amazing and very memorable. Only gripes I have about the game is the somewhat slippery control and jumps don't feel the most fluid. I'm surprised this game isn't talked about in regards to great indie games. If you enjoy any of the genres mentioned, very much recommended!			"

												A great metroidvania title with solid and challenging combat accompanied by an excellent soundtrack. The platforming is the weak point of the game as the walljumping sometimes feels a little unreliable, expecially when played on a controller. However, I would still strongly recommend Valdis Story for it's satisfying gameplay if you looking for a challenging metroidvania game with good, fast-paced combat and have patience for the odd periods of frustration from accidentally falling off a platform or not knowing where to go. Be warned, however, that bosses and the game in general are rather difficult and due to the bare-bones map it could be helpful to consult some forums for some tips if you get stuck.			"

												This game is awesome. Ignore all comments from people that whines about bad control (they are not, they respond perfectly, they are just a bit demanding - but way less demanding than a game like dark souls for example), difficulty (yes the game IS DIFFICULT, if you wanna play casual game, just don't buy this one) or stun lock (you can't be stun locked, learn to guard or dodge...). All these complaints are either invalid or coming from people that get frustrated at the first difficulty they encounter and don't want to train to overcome it.If you have the right mindset, this game will blow your mind. The content is huge for a metroidvania (even more if you're a completionist like I am, I think I'm in for at least 60 hours). If you crave challenges, go for an SS rank run in the highest difficulty available and you'll be rewarded. I'm having a great time playing this game and I'm so happy I bought it. To summarize, be wary that by buying this game, you enter a difficult yet really well built software. Don't put bad comments and destroy a game's reputation just because it's too difficult for you.

												10/10- Great Replay Value. Endless fun in Heaven or Hell Arena Mode.Hard Game so prepare yourself. It's a challenge, so no ♥♥♥♥♥ing.Each playable character have different dialogue with NPC (very interesting). Lots of ways to build character based on playstyle. 4 craftable weapons for each character (1 hidden craftable golden weapon) on top of the 3 skill trees.P.S.90% negative reviews are on how hard it is. After doing 3 playthroughs with different characters I can get SSS rating on all bosses in God Slayer Mode. Just need to practice if you keep dying not the game's fault. Hard game so don't expect less.			"

												It's not a bad combat combo sorta metroidvania, but play as Wyatt your first time.  If you play as the gril, the game is really difficult and confusing (you require either 10 times the hours of gametime in exploration, or just looking up walkthroughs to find the items that are required for you to do damage to the final bosses).  I played as her the first time and while the game was still alright, it was much more of a struggle to get through.  I would've legitimately enjoyed the game more if it didn't give me a choice but to play as Wyatt the first time until I beat the game at least once (he does much more damage and attacks faster), and then unlock any side characters after that.Lots of people do speedruns of this game so I know people get a lot of replay value out of this game.

												Valdis Story certainly keeps the Castlevania vibes going throughout the experience. The music sets the atmosphere well, and is one of my favorite parts of the game. Gameplay is your standard Metroidvania affair of finding items to access new areas, or revisit previous ones and obtain things that were out of reach. The game has a levelling and experience system, which seems to give the player a lot of options as to how to build their character. Grinding appears to become essential by the end of the game, which is a disappointment. I enjoyed the flow of the game for the first several hours, but hit a brick wall about 5 or 6 hours in. That break in the action is a terrible killjoy to experience, and its akin to something like Circle of the Moon, where you can romp through the game up until the final parts, where suddenly you need 20 more levels. This wouldn't be so bad, but I was playing on the ""normal"" difficulty. Why have 4 different difficulty modes if the lowest one doesn't allow you to play through the game with any sort of consistent pace? I understand having a hard difficulty to challenge experienced players, but it is weird to me to have 4 difficulty modes, none of which allow the player to just make consistent progress. The game seems to dish out tons of extra damage due to its lack of invulnerability frames during damage. This means enemies can combo you while you are helplessly watching. Spikes can play pinball with you and kill you, rather than just dealing some base amount of damage and offering you a chance to escape.Perhaps the most annoying aspect is how the game handles saves with regards to boss battles. If you enter a boss room, you are locked into that fight until you either win it, or load your previous save. This wouldn't be a problem if you always encountered a save room prior to a boss fight. It's not necessarily the case that you find the save room before the boss room, though, and I found it hard to even know I was in a boss room before the door closed and locked behind me.Overall, I like Valdis Story, despite these minor complaints. It would be nice to see these small issues I had with it addressed in some manner. In particular, I'd like to see the lower difficulty settings emphasize flow of gameplay over punishing the player repeatedly. Punishment can be reserved for the players who want to experience that highest level of difficulty. I just want to play the game, because the game that is there is addictive.			"

Posted: January 17, 2014
												The quick and dirty, Id give this game 3/5. This game is extremely challenging, to the point it can be game breakingly bad at times. If you like a good challenge, this game is for you.It's been a while that Ive truly gotten frustrated and angry at a game. Usually when I run into something that is annoying or just plain bad, If there isn't something else in the game that really makes me want to continue playing it, then I just simply stop playing. But when I actually want to continue with the game because it has some really great stuff in it, but is constantly hamstringed by very poorly made choices in the gameplay, then I get frustrated because I want to keep playing but certain aspects of the game make that difficult.Ill start this off by going with what's great about the game. The premise of the story is actually pretty damn cool for the most part. While not entirely new, it does give a fresh feel to things. While not super in depth, the story is good enough to where I want to keep playing. The playstyle and feel of the game is both nostalgic and new, and for the most part very fun to play. The music is great and really adds atmosphere to the game. SO with all this great stuff going for the game why only 3/5  rating?I usually am not one to complain about this, but the biggest problem with this game is difficulty. Normally I tend to play games I own on hard settings. I do this because I find a challenge rewarding personally. But this game I honestly feel goes to hardcore on the difficulty. When starting this game, I chose normal, because I was not familiar with this games mechanics right away, so I wanted to play with it first before going to a more difficult setting.The unfortunate thing is that this games normal setting would be equivilant to most games very hard settings. And it's done for a few reasons. First and for most it's the problem with the fighting in the game itself. The game is very exacting on the timing aspect. If you screw up your timing, you take a fairly high amount of damage. Im all for being punished for messing up, but with the exacting nature of the timing against some enemies, and the punishment recieved, it's too finely tuned. The second is dealing with multiple enemies results in juggling. In certain combat situations, you will be pitted against multiple enemies at once. In most games, they compensate this factor by weakening individual enemies a slight bit so you are able to deal with them. This is not the case in this game, which is fine for the most part except when the game has a nasty problem with juggling. Your character will flinch when recieving damage, and this problem results in that when multiple enemies hit you, you can literally be locked in perpetual damage till you burn up one of your lives in a single encounter. This is compounded when they included normal enemies who have long stuns, disables, and other abilities, as well as the ability to block your attacks, or spam theirs. There are countless times when running through places  that you can get a game over because of mis timing one evade. The game attempts to make this up by creating aritificial check points through out the game that will allow you to restart from there instead of the last save point. However, this doesnt change the ease of which enemies can really kill you. And this is normal mode too.On the same not of difficulty, some of the trap puzzles are also to finely tuned. Where the difference between making it through a door on time or not is determined by pixels and fractions of seconds. There is no room for error and things have to be timed precisely with great reflexes. This can lead to a lot of frustration when trying to attain treasure chests in the game. Once again, for normal difficulty, the leeway should be greater, and more finely tuned for the harder difficulty settings.The next problem with this game is actual direction, which stems from a few things. What this game lacks is a quest log tab of some kind, so you can keep track of where your objectives and goals are. While the map screen does give you a small little text of information on what you are trying to achieve in the bigger picture, there is no way to keep track of what I would assume to be side quests or minor quests, so keeping all those things in mind will have to be done via memory, so if you dont play through this game in a week's time, youll likely forget what you were doing if you were to come back to it.Also, because of the lack of general direction, you can actually stumble into boss fights. Something Ive done a few times. While simply looking for a save point, Ive walked into rooms with boss fights and spent a lot of time just trying to get through the fight by the skin of my teeth. This could be a good point cause it does give it more adventure feel, but considering the difficulty, a little bit of heads up of what lurks nearby is a good thing.There are a few nostalgic, but terrible game mechanics that really need to stop being used. The grid map system where rooms are defined by squares with holes for doors is a system from when there was a limitation of what could be shown on map due to memory space in the games. Now that we dont have that issue, using a grid system is pretty terrible. Maps should have a bit more detail to them to more accurately define what is where. Also, a global map system should be pretty self explainitory. The map only shows you teh rooms visited in the zone youre currently in. And in a game where trying to find where to go next is a pain as it is, not having the ability to look at the maps of other zones so you can see whats where is just bad design.The dungeon jumping mechanics, while fun in most cases, is nothing short of being god awful in situations where youre pitted against new enemies in large numbers. There are a few cases where you can be knocked off a platform and fall 3 screens, fight your way through a horde of enemies you already beat, just to get back to the newly unveiled enemy you dont know how to counter yet only to get knocked off the platform yet again. This mechanic is once again heavily punishing a player before they have time to learn and adapt to the situation.As I said before, I do like this game. I love a lot of the ideas, the visuals, the mechanics of the fighting system, the music, story, and so on are really good. What really just kills this game is the rediculously hard presicion needed for decent play, and the game breaking mechanics as mentioned before. The advantage to steam is that they can patch and update, which I hope they do. A game for normal difficulty should NOT play this hard from the get go.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun (but challenging) metroidvania esque platform based RPG.This game has great combat and a great amount of customization to it to make the combat feel even better. With the 4 available characters, each who have 4 completely different weapons and skill trees to choose from, the sheer amount of choice makes the game very easy to personalize for your own playstyle.The story is pretty good too, I won't spoil anything but the lore is very deep and fun to read, and they also provide an incentive for actively reading the lore as you get bonus stat points to spend if you find these ""books of the old gods"" scattered around the map.Art design is fantastic, the game looks really good. The main heroes are all fairly unique aesthetically and have individual back stories suited to their play style, but more than that the design of the enemies is great. The diversity from the angels to demons to ferals really makes each sub faction more distinct and individual because of the lengths taken to make them each seem unique.Overall I give this game a solid 8/10, would recommend always buying it on a sale if you enjoy tougher expierences or rpgs, or buying it on full price if you love the genres listed at the top.

												If you like Metroidvania games, keep reading. If not, move along.Valdis Story is a game that will not hold your hand. To a newcomer's first impression, it may feel brutal or even unfair. However, once you learn all there is to know, it's anything but. It's rewarding to go from struggling on the easiest difficulty level to thriving in a harder one. It's short enough (there's an achievement for a 3 hour speedrun on Hard - the second-lowest difficulty) to pick up and play, but there's enough to do to keep you busy. As of writing this review, I have clocked 80 hours across several playthroughs, due to the multiple characters.Four playable characters with unique weapons, skills, and some unique/ some shared spells give a lot of replay value, as your crew are caught in the middle of a war between Angels and Demons. In the lost city of Sitheil, where the war first began decades ago, your crew are the last hope for the unafiliated humans of the world to not get wiped out.The game rewards preparation and mastery with bonuses for good ranks. Doing well against a boss will reward you with bonuses to make the rest of the game easier. While this may seem like a punishment for players who don't do so well, and really need the bonus stats, it's more than possible to get by without these bonuses. If anything, these are intended more as an aid to the speedrunners - to assist them in clearing even faster. As someone who's never especially cared too much about speedruns, it's certainly motivated me to give it my all to try to clear bosses quickly instead of playing overly cautious.In true Metroidvania fashion, you get upgrades to allow more freedom of exploration, ending in the entire game being open to you by the end. Seeing a door locked with a Demon Key, for example, will be marked on your map, so you can go back later, making it easy to keep track of where you still need to explore. However, there are a few more subtle things that you may need to remember on your own - like a treasure chest just a little too far to get without the double jump, or a breakable wall that doesn't lead to another room.Not to mention, for a relatively short game, there's quite a lot of lore, for people who are into that. Every enemy type, as well as noteworthy characters (Allies and enemies alike) get their own entries in the Lore section, and there's even history books you can find for more insight into ""The Tyrant Gods Era"" and how things eventually became what they now are.Ultimately... if you like Metroidvania games, and you like to work at things and get good, I wholeheartedly suggest checking it out.

												I love this game.And nobody seems to know about it, which is an awful shame because it's a wonderful experience. A Metroidvania-esque action platformer set in an interesting world caught in a war between angels and demons, exploring a long-lost city which sunk into the depths of the ocean long ago. It has multiple playable characters, each with three skill trees to advance through as they level up, four stats to raise in the same manner that can affect your playstyle dramatically, four weapons, and plenty of armor options with their unique benefits as well. Not to mention that both your armor and weapons can be upgraded with the proper materials and NPC. Add to that the accessories, support characters that you can call on cooldown to attack and, in some cases, heal you or some such, as well as finisher attacks that put you into a more powerful focus mode, and the combat is rich with options. Oh, and did I mention that each character has their own set of magic spells, in addition to gaining more magical options as the game progresses, and that those can be upgraded too?In addition, the game uses a unique form of mobility called the Skill Cancel, in which you enter a state for a second or so in which you can dash to either side and dodge through enemies and attacks completely, and it gets even better the more 'charges' of it you can hold at once, or the further down a skill tree you go to improve its effects. The game has many small puzzles which include using it properly to navigate a room quickly and activate switches and such. It makes moving through the game feel very fluid and satisfying.I find myself on my third playthrough of the game at the time of writing this review, and I'm still finding things that I've missed before - from item pick-ups and side characters, a couple of well-hidden rooms, to a few things that affect the world the game takes place in. Between S-ranking the bosses, finding 100% of the collectibles, and trying to go through the game quickly, as well as many levels of difficulty (including one that removes the ability to save completely for an ultimate test), the replayability is quite high - which is only complemented by its incredible soundtrack.Composed by Zack Parrish, Valdis Story: Abyssal City's music is never found lacking. Moving from haunting, beautiful melodies to complex guitar rhythms and a few very in-your-face boss themes, flowing effortlessly from locale to locale, the soundtrack itself is a masterpiece. The first time I entered The Pit, even though you find out quickly that you cannot advance through the area when you first encounter it, I just stood around and listened to the music for a few minutes. It's a wonderful experience. I recommend that you see for yourself[zackparrish.bandcamp.com] whether you choose to buy the game or not.All said, my first playthrough of the game took me around six hours, but I had hardly seen all that Valdis Story: Abyssal City has to offer... and they only intend to offer more through future character releases. This game is a true gem, and it doesn't seem to have much visibility nor the largest playerbase (I only have one friend to talk to it about!), so here's hoping a few of you see this review and decide it's worth picking up for yourselves. Happy gaming!			"

												While this game is more along the veins of a Metroidvania, it doesn't have the same quirky humor that Rogue Legacy has in abundance. But this game does excel over Rogue Legacy in other ways. The colouring and character designs are superb and the music sounds like something that would never be expected in an indie title, it's just that good. The bosses in the game are intelligent to a degree(It's still modern AI), so just running in and slashing like an idiot is not rewarded at all. Which is what a game like this should do.			"

												Not for Everyone!I would recommend this game for the Hardcore types only, casual gamers should avoid this title as you will be endlessly frustrated with its mechanics and control scheme.  Read on for more details.Game Play 6/10 - Game is very easy to get into but requires the old and tired rinse and repeat process till you succeed method.  Defeating bosses are your traditional meat and potatoes, try & die until you learn their attack patterns for openings here.  All too often the difference of 1 pixel is all the leeway you will to have navigating some of the puzzles which is frustration for more of a casual gamer such as myself.Sound/Music 8/10 - I would rate the Sound & Music for this game to be above average for your general jump & slash game.Difficulty 3/10 - Game has a very inconsitent difficulty... very easy to waltz through most of the game, but advancing certain parts or aquiring the teddy bear for example to early can leave you with an over powered boss (blocking your path) too soon in the game, which happended to me.This game is more of a niche type/old school.  While it does have a very similar playstyle as a MedrioVania game, I would still rank it more of an action platformer due to the necessary acrobatics necessary to reach special places or to even proceed through some areas of the game.  While I would not fault a game for keeping extra special items behind difficult to reach places I do fault it for making overly convoluted platforming to advance the story.I did not complete the game because it reached the point of excess in my opinion for overly contrived puzzles which do not fit in with a traditional MetroidVania game.

It was the most frustrating fight but after you learn her pattern you just need to keep the crystal broken, combo her then jump or dash through her block and combo her again using your assist character and finisher move. When the angel pops out, use the dark rain spell and it's dead in 5 seconds. Then, continue comboing and jumping until Magus is dead.The sense of accomplishment you expierence when you beat something you swear is impossible the first or second try is amazing!			"

												If you like the Metroid-inspired Castlevania games or action platformers in general then this is a good choice. It may not be quite as huge in scope as Castlevania or Metroid but still of compelling length.Just know that Valdis Story can be unforgiving at times, even on the lowest difficulty. There's also some disappointing platforming sections that are poorly designed but they don't detract enough from the overall experience. The leveling is fun, there's big and varied skill trees for each character, lots of weapons and equipment to find and upgrade with different stats, just a whole load of stuff that any fan of progression-based games will enjoy.

I was a little skeptical or the skill tree system but the weapons, the armor, accessories, magic make up for it where your character can play anyway you want. Also mixing and matching skill that serve a purpose for the way you play, not just because you were locked to one soul. I never thought that I would get lost in a 2D game because it does have depth. This is controller recommended in my eyes cause it just feels better. I would also like to say that the questing system and the character dialogue is vague at times where I would skim over something and have no idea where I was even headed in the world or why I was going there. Still a great game, buy if your into action, combos, platformers. 9/10			"

												Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a metroidvania styled game that was available on Desura for a bit, but is now also available on Steam. It's an indie game published by Endlessfluff Games, who consist of Carolina and Kyron. For a game being made by just two people, it is very good. I can tell they put a lot of effort into this game, and it is games like this that make me wish triple A game companies would try harder.The game's story is decent, but nothing amazing. It's enough to make you want to continue through the game. The gameplay is where the game truly shines. Since it is a metroidvania styled game, it has the basic side scrolling action and platforming, and you also have magic spells, which you can customize which you want in the menu. It also has RPG elements in the game. As you level up, you get to choose a new skill from three skill trees. Each skill tree is focused on different aspects, like combat, healing/defence, and magic. A lot of the replay value is from choosing different skills and customizing you'r own skill tree combination.I liked the simple, yet beautiful graphics of the game. A lot of people compare the look of the game to something similar to MapleStory, which i can sort of see, but I didn't really notice it until it was pointed out to me. I also enjoyed the soundtrack to the game. The music really set the mood for me, and I even found myself listening to the soundtrack when not playing the game.Even though I really liked this game, I still have some complaints. My main complaint is the forced, difficult platforming sections. I've checked gaming forums, and noticed this is a common complaint. I feel that difficult platforming should be left for optional items. This is the aspect of the game that will most likely get some people to ""rage quit"" the game. The other main issue I had, was random errors. I'd be playing the game, enjoying myself, and then a random error would come up. It wasn't very often, but it happened a couple times, so it got a little annoying.Despite some of the issues I had with this game, it is still quite good and I recomment it to anyone that is a fan of metroidvania styled games. I hope to see more games from Endlessfluff Games in the future. If I had to give this game a rating, I'd give it a 7/10.			"

												I picked up Valdis Story a few days ago on the tail end of the Steam Winter sale. It is worth every penny and more. I feel guilty buying it at the discounted price, to an extent, because you are guaranteed to get your money's worth at the normal price point.Some describe this game as a ""Metroidvania"" type game, and that is correct to an extent. However, this game differentiates itself from either the handheld Castlevania sidescrolling RPGs and Super Metroid in that it is very to-the-point. This game is not about massive exploration, tons of backtracking, and acquiring new abilities in order to repeat the two previous steps. It is all about the action: that is, a diverse combat system complete with combos splicing all-out physical assaults and magical barrages, and that is all it needs. Thus, instead of describing this game as ""Metroidvania"" inspired, I prefer the term ""Streetvania"" inspired, because it is all about the fighting. When you pick up Valdis Story, prepare for a game which leaves you lying in wait for each boss encounter, because there, alongside its diverse RPG system of specialization in play style, is where it truly shines (outside of its Odin Sphere-inspired graphics and beautiful soundtrack, which are great in their own right). The game can be and is difficult, but difficult in a fun and challenging way. Each boss fight is scored on a system, and if you are anything like me or a perfectionist to begin with, you'll find yourself repeating these fights in order to get higher scores; which by the way, the game rewards in kind.The pacing is perfect. It does not waste time on the frills of exploration, the old-school formula for stretching play time out of a game. Each area has just enough amount of screens to satisfy probing its secrets, but not so much that it wastes your time without your knowing. This acts as a great stimulus, because the game will take as long as it needs to, but never feels long enough, serving as a stimulus to delve into it for another playthrough, this time trying out a new niche with a new character (it has four, each with a menagerie of different play styles you can specialize in, leading one to want to try it all out).In sum, I definitely recommend this game, and I am looking forward to the next game release by this development team.

												At a first glance this game looked like you could just pick it up and play for a bit then put back down and get back to it a few days later. That was definately not the case.The game features a lot of difficult and challenging content even on 'Normal', don't let the difficulty fool you. Even though the content can be tough at times it keeps you going back for me. It incorporates many timed challenges that either provide a reward or passage to the next part of an area though the ones for items were much more challenging.Bosses in the game are hit and miss though. Some are down right easy while in other cases you can spend a good hour and get nowhere by the end of it. This could just mean you are going about it all wrong or you are there too early and missed some crutial item along the way that would make things so much easier.There is a fair bit of back tracking during the game to access areas that were closed off before you gained an ability from later in the game. The lack of a world map however makes it seem like the map look a lot bigger than it actually is. At the same time the lack of a full world map will probably drive you a little insane.Having played the game with a controller I can say that it is relatively fluid and feels right. I liked how double jump isn't something that is readily available for you at all times. The constant remapping of spells was very interesting as well.Having finished the game once after a few multiple hour long sessions it still makes you want to go back and play it through again in either a harder setting (trust me normal was difficult already)  or finish with other characters.I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of hack and slash/ rogue like games.

												For those of you having trouble loading this game after purchase, don't be discouraged! This game has a lot of potential challenges and rewards that you can definitely sink some time into. I come from a fighting game/danmaku background, so one of the most fun aspects of this game was mastering the combo system. Nothing feels better than no-missing a boss with maximum efficiency~ While it does have a couple issues that need to be ironed out (the controls are counter intuitive at first, there's no indication regarding passages of no return/boss fights), there's a lot to be explored and discovered. Sooner or later, you'll find yourself obsessing over getting every last party member.For those of you still having problems launching the game or have been deterred from purchasing the game because of the significant price and rumors of black screen issues, read the following link: http://endlessfluff.com/forum/index.php?topic=323.0 It's sure to save you a lot of frustration. Don't let this gem pass you up!			"

												I have played countless metroidvania games over the years but few have left a mark aside from the originals. Valdis Story is somewhat of a masterpiece that captures the greatness of metroid and castlevania in a single game. The combat is fluid, the story is memorable, and the challenges require precision on unparalled levels. The art style and soundtack should not go unnoticed; Both set a beautiful stage and give the game a soul commonly lacking in modern games. There is plently of replay value for those worried about getting their money worth considering the 5 or 6 difficulties and meaningful skilltrees. I highly reccomend this game to everyone who has enjoyed similar games in the past.			"

												It's one of those ""I wish I could give it middle ground between Recommended and Not Recommended"" review.Generally, I like overall mechanics. Solid control, cool combat design, fluid movement design, interesting skill tree, etc. But everything feels...lacking, and many design choices just ruined the game for me.For example, combat. It's pretty amazing actually, but enemy design and animation dump it down by a LOT. Some of enemies attack have almost no animation (including bosses) which turns out make it impossible to dodge some attack if you don't know them before, and even if you do it becomes luck based.Game balance is also weird. You gain a permanent stat if you perform good in boss fight, and it absurd. When you level up you get 1 stat point, but in some boss fight you can get +2 stat point if you got an S rank. That's...2 level worth of stat? so if you're not good at this game, you're permanently punished for it. And as I explain about combat above, combined with this, make some boss fight plain annoying to deal with.Not mentioning the game itself is hard as it is. I got one shot by a boss from half-health (I play on hard in my 1st run btw. but still...:/), with no wind-up animation. it just fly toward me and boom. I died. I wouldn't call that fair. You NEED to know that attack before to dodge it.There're still a lot more but you got the idea.			"

												Fun fighting style for a side scroller, difficutly lvl increases quickly making the game challenging yet still fun, not fond of the use of magic requires you to stand in place for a second and sometimes that makes a difference in a fight, boss fights are unique and enjoyable so far other than the first boss fight there is no just beat them up strategy each one requires a different tactic. Storyline is comical at times and keeps you intrigued on what comes next. Dual storyline playing through as one character have yet to see the second but can't wait. Interesting variation between mobs you fight demons, angels, and beasts known as ferals (which seem to be the toughest), all of which are having a war within this world, humans seem to be barely able to survive in this war thrust apon them. All in all this is a game to buy as long as you like a nice action sidescroller, if you have issues with a game where you will die a bunch of times look elsewhere, but this game fits the bill for vigorous fighting while keeping a intriguing storyline that makes you want to be better at the game to see more of it.

												If you like Metroidvania games, keep reading. If not, move along.Valdis Story is a game that will not hold your hand. To a newcomer's first impression, it may feel brutal or even unfair. However, once you learn all there is to know, it's anything but. It's rewarding to go from struggling on the easiest difficulty level to thriving in a harder one. It's short enough (there's an achievement for a 3 hour speedrun on Hard - the second-lowest difficulty) to pick up and play, but there's enough to do to keep you busy. As of writing this review, I have clocked 80 hours across several playthroughs, due to the multiple characters.Four playable characters with unique weapons, skills, and some unique/ some shared spells give a lot of replay value, as your crew are caught in the middle of a war between Angels and Demons. In the lost city of Sitheil, where the war first began decades ago, your crew are the last hope for the unafiliated humans of the world to not get wiped out.The game rewards preparation and mastery with bonuses for good ranks. Doing well against a boss will reward you with bonuses to make the rest of the game easier. While this may seem like a punishment for players who don't do so well, and really need the bonus stats, it's more than possible to get by without these bonuses. If anything, these are intended more as an aid to the speedrunners - to assist them in clearing even faster. As someone who's never especially cared too much about speedruns, it's certainly motivated me to give it my all to try to clear bosses quickly instead of playing overly cautious.In true Metroidvania fashion, you get upgrades to allow more freedom of exploration, ending in the entire game being open to you by the end. Seeing a door locked with a Demon Key, for example, will be marked on your map, so you can go back later, making it easy to keep track of where you still need to explore. However, there are a few more subtle things that you may need to remember on your own - like a treasure chest just a little too far to get without the double jump, or a breakable wall that doesn't lead to another room.Not to mention, for a relatively short game, there's quite a lot of lore, for people who are into that. Every enemy type, as well as noteworthy characters (Allies and enemies alike) get their own entries in the Lore section, and there's even history books you can find for more insight into ""The Tyrant Gods Era"" and how things eventually became what they now are.Ultimately... if you like Metroidvania games, and you like to work at things and get good, I wholeheartedly suggest checking it out.

												Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a good metroidvania game. A great artwork, soundtrack and gameplay mixes together to create a journey leaving the player wanting to find out more of the story and the characters. It can be difficult with the platforming and boss battles but the grading system leaves you striving to do better than before. The only complaints I honestly have are areas with constant health drain, and timed platforming, an annoyance that I hate and this game seems to perfect. It would do better with a more in depth quest log (since I tend to ""blah blah blah text"" through a lot of the main story driving dialogue) and perhaps an overall map rather than just the current area. I found myself trying to think of how I progressed through the game in order to figure out where one area was located. Did I mention platforming boss battles with health drain, and regenerating bosses? It can get infuriating fast.			"

												I don't regret buying this game, Valdis Story is a really good challenging game using the metroidvania style of platforming and exploring, it is one of the better action RPGs that i've played; the combat system is superb with all the comboes you can do and is quite detailed and indepth allowing for a lot of variety of playstyles. The game is also in how well it tests your technique and actual skill with enemies scaling and variety so there's always some challenge. Though some of the bosses do feel unfair and some feel like they pop out of nowhere but that shouldn't deter you if your looking for a challenge. If that isn't enough to get you buying it has a lot of replay value with multiple difficulties and characters to try out! The story isn't won't win any awards but its decent and keeps the game's flow going while linking the fights together.Valdis Story is a hidden gem and worth your money.+ Fighting System holds up pretty well+ Pretty Visuals+ Exploration is fun to do+ Has a lot of replay value- Story isn't groundbreaking- Bosses can be infuritating 8/10			"

Posted: January 8, 2014
												I had no idea this game existed until about a week and a half ago when I saw it pop up in the corner of my screen as a friend started playing it. The name instantly screamed ""RPG"" to me and with that being my favored genre of game, I looked into it. What I found was highly intriguing and so I purchased it on a whim. Now, after having finished it, I'd like to share my opinion:Story: 9/10I've been gaming for the better part of 25 years (started at age 3 with the NES back in the late 80s) so I've seen and played a lot of games through all their stories and plot twists, both good and bad. Compared to the titles released by a lot of the AAA companies and developers, Valdis Story stands just as tall as some of the best games I've played. You control a man named Wyatt with an intense grudge and a desire to slay the ""false gods"" as he travels through a forgotten city beneath the sea following a raid gone wrong. The characterization, the pacing, story and the world presented to the player is both simplistic/easy to follow and very well developed. It definitely takes some creative liberties because I've never seen a world where both ""heaven"" and ""hell"" are the bad guys, but the execution is nearly flawless. My only complaint, if it can be called that, is that I was a little confused starting out as far as the lore goes. The confusion is cleared up as the game progresses, for sure, and perhaps that was the intent of the developers. The game definitely raises a few questions still and leaves itself open for future installments with some very nice plot twists.Gameplay: 10/10For any gamer that grew up in the 90s, Valdis Story is best described as a ""Metroidvania"" style game. It has the exploration and progression of a Metroid/Castlevania (Symphony of the Night, anyone?) fused with the level up and individual customization of any good RPG as far as stats, skills, and equipment go. For anyone not familiar with the above term, the best way to describe it is somewhat linear, but as you progress through the game and obtain new abilities and powers, expect certain areas that were previously inaccessible to be reachable now. As far as combat goes, it's very fast paced and fluid as you chain together combinations of light and heavy strikes, aerial attacks, and spells to devastating effect. At times it can be intensely thrilling and at others it can be brutally unforgiving. Don't expect every enemy you encounter to have the same pattern -- half the fun is in studying the foes and discerning their pattern and developing a strategy from there. What's even more exciting is that you are actually graded on your performance, not just in boss battles, but the entire game! As far as boss fights go, you are scored on how fast you win, your combo count, and survivability (did you die and use any healing potions) and are rewarded accordingly with some nice stat boosts. End game scores you on things like your number of retries, the number of civilians you saved, how much of your crew you located, and a combined total score for all the battles you engaged in. For anyone who enjoys a challenge, Valdis Story delivers!Music: 10/10I thoroughly enjoyed the wide range of music throughout Valdis Story. Each song lends itself to the different atmospheres very well and the boss fight theme, especially, the way it starts out, really gets you in the mood for a confrontation. Even some of the more somber themes like those in the towns you visit make you feel the quiet desperation all the more. Visuals: 10/10Valdis Story employs some beautiful, almost cartoon-like, visuals. For me, I loved the simplicity behind them, but they're far from poorly crafted. If you're expecting something top of the line as far as graphics go, you will be disappointed, However, the backdrops and the character sprites are all richly designed and thoroughly different from one another. It's not hard to tell that a lot of care and love went into the art style of this game.Replayability: 10/10This game can quite easily be a ""one and done"" sort of game if you like, or it can be something you revisit from time to time, but the developers gave plenty of options for replayability. There are multiple difficulties (only two are available the first time you play, to be fair) as well as the chance to replay the game through the eyes of another character. And if you're an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ like me, you'll at least be attempting multiple playthroughs.Overall, for an indie game, I was thoroughly blown away by how well done this game was. I haven't played a game that kept me riveted like this in a long while and it was a very refreshing change of pace. Nowadays, you can expect to pay 50-60 bucks a pop for a Triple-A title, but you don't always get your money's worth. I picked this up when it was on sale for 6 bucks (it's around 15 normally I think) and the amount of time I've put into the game has been well worth the cost. Endless Fluff games has definitely been put on my radar for all future developments.			"

												I'd recommend this game to anyone that likes Metroid or Castlevania style play and has been looking for a good challenge of late.The combat starts off fairly simple. The game allows you some time to get used to the basic controls, and an easy few levels to start building your char, when most enemies can be defeated by simply blocking and attacking. Before you know it, though, even the common enemies will have you on edge, and some of the boss fights are absolutely brutal. There's also a fairly low level cap, so grinding for extra stats only works for so long, meaning you'll really have to learn the enemies' weaknesses and your build's strengths if you want to progress.The exploration seems to strike quite a nice balance between not telling you where things are, but you somehow finding them anyway if you take a few moments to explore the surroundings. There's a few moments where looking for a certain quest item can be a bit frustrating if you didn't quite catch that one non-repeatable line of dialog that offhandedly mentioned where you should look for a new area, but on the other hand you really won't mind the extra level and additional upgrades you get while looking for them. And seeing how you unlock greater mobility and more keys as you progress, there's usually something new to find every time.I can't name many negatives about the game. The artwork's nice, there isn't a bit of music that I didn't enjoy listening to. It's definitely one of my new faves.			"

												If your looking for a game with a deep combat system and classic, metroid like platforming and exploring, then this is the game for you. *The Story is amazing but needs a little fine tuning, im not sure if this will be taken care of in a squeal or later update.*Combat is increbilbly fuild and varies with character, weapon, and the way you lvl up, leaving for many different ways to play them game and still have fun doing so.*The map isn't very nice; its not bad but there should be an entire map in which you select the area you wish to look at rather then only the area you are in. The style of the map also doesn't match the rest of the game, this may be updated though can can be overlooked.*The Music is nice, but there could have been more tracks, along with different tracks for when main characters are speaking.*The game can prove rather challenging, however this adds to the value of the acheviments. It doesn't just hand out acheviments but they are earned through practice and skill.*I highly recomend this game for anyone that likes games from fighters to platformers, I personally was looking for a game like this for a long time.*9/10 (for now, if issues are fixed, 10/10)***Let me know if there is something else you want me to cover in the review and I will try to adress it.***			"

												Very well developed take on the Metroidvania genre with different characters that handle differently and a whole lot of exploration. On top of that a huge variety of boss fights. However I can't recommend the game due to poor controls. I found the controls to be very floaty and not responsive to my button presses. Movement was janky making it hard to move your character precisely where you want them to go. Turning the boss fights from being challenging to just plain frustrating as you're trying to manuever to hit them or avoid attacks.The dash command which is vital to beating many of the enemies was simply not firing when I entered the command for it and the game could have done a better job in explaining a lot of the underlining systems like spell alignment.

												You come into this game, at first playing it like a simple metroidvania. You hammer that attack key and easily kill some early enemies. For a split second you see something like a combo meter. On one of the next opponents, you notice your character has a launcher and air combo capability. Then you figure out you have various spells and get your first Skill Cancel.It isn't ""just"" a metroidvania anymore. It's a full blown 2D character action game in the vein of Devil May Cry. And it is absolutely fantastic at it.Valdis Story is probably my favorite game of 2013. It is action-packed, rewards those willing to learn and take their time with it, has a nice amount of content at 8-15 hours first playthrough, AMAZING replay value due to 2 *completely* different characters, boss rankings, difficulty levels, and very deep character customization that completely changes how you approach battles. On top of all that, the soundtrack is really great.This is the best metroidvania game I've ever played, beating both Aria of Sorrow and Symphony of the Night. Yeah, that's right, I said it!			"

												First off the game itself is beautiful in terms of artwork and music. the combat system is fun and intense after you get the hang of it and with the usage of different weapons make it even more intense. the armour and weapon upgrade system is cool although I found it to be a bit lacking in terms of wanting to personalize the weapon (i.e add ice to a sword or poison instead of the preset). the puzzles can get frustrating at times as well, there were many times I found myself saying ""f**k it, I'll get it later"" lots of different bosses each with a unique fight and tactic to kill instead of the run of the mill run up and beat it up. In summery: its a beautifully fun game that is a blast. iIrecommend it to anyone who enjoys the metroid/castlevania play style.			"

												If you liked the classic SNES-style metroidvania games, this one will be just as you remember: pretty hard with clean graphics and a good flow. The only downside is that it still seems to be in ""beta"" after quite a while, and so there are aspects of the game that still make it feel unfinished (some empty rooms, the promise of new characters, etc).Some argue that the timing puzzles are too hard, but if you use a keyboard or a gamepad with a d-pad, they're about on par with your Super Metroid-esque timing puzzles.Overall, if you can look over some empty spots, it'll give you some good hours of entertainment.

												Personally I enjoyed this game despite how frustrating it can be.  My biggest complaint about the game is that you earn stat increases when you do well against bosses...which means the people (like myself) who need the stat increases don't get them. When I realized this, and after failing to defeat the final boss many MANY times, I finally decided to start the game over and retry every boss until I could pull off an A or S rank.  With the stat increases I moved through the game more easily and I was finally able to beat the last boss (though I still had to skip a few optional bosses to maintain my sanity).  I read a review once that said that this game is not for casual gamers...that might be true...and although I do wish this game had a casual mode, I am a casual gamer and I beat it, so there. (At least on Normal...I don't even understand how there can be 3 higher difficulties to this game lol)			"

												Hey. Hey, you. You there. Reading this review. Clearly you like games, because you're reading a review of one. By that reasoning, you probably also like being given a fair amount of control over the digital world of a game (or part of one). That feeling you get when you ride the fine line between ""that was AMAZING!"" and ""that SUCKED amazingly!"" That five second fingernails-on-a-chalkboard tense confrontation with a monster that has proven interested and capable of repurposing your spine as a coat tree. That instant where you finally throw the killing punch... only for the boss du jour to flip behind you and stab you through the everything - and force you to go and retrieve your hardware from halfway into the wall. Long story short: this game is bleeding-out-of-your-eyes fast paced, and if you are looking for anything like action, RPG goodness, or a difficulty spectrum ranging from challenging to spicy like hellfire, then you've found your destination. Pack a suitcase with escape ropes and plenty of Band-Aids.			"

												I want to start off by saying that I am obsessive about Metroidvania games. I absolutely love them, Metroidvania is by FAR my favorite game genre. I got sucked into Metroid on NES as a kid and I never looked back. I've played all of the Metroid games, all of Iga's Castlevania games, the entire Shantae series, Cave Story, the Wonder Boy/Adventure Island games, Guacamelee, and basically every decent game on Steam with a Metroidvania tag. If you can think of a MV game, I've probably played it.Now, I didn't say all of that to toot my own horn. I said all of that so you would know my gaming background and that I have plenty of comparisons when I say that Valdis Story: Abyssal City is one of the most enjoyable and well made MV games that I've ever played. Valdis Story ranks right up there with any of the greats. The character and scene design is beautiful, the gameplay is spot on, and the soundtrack is a treat to listen to.I do have two minor gripes about the game, but they are just that, minor. First, the game slows down every now and then when there's a lot happening on screen. I have a fairly high end gaming rig and this should just not be happening. Luckily, I've noticed that if I go into the options menu and switch the only graphical setting from high to low it fixes the slowdown with no visable difference to the game. So that's not even really an issue. Second, there's no overall world map. This is probably my biggest irritation when playing the game. Each area has it's own map that shows the exits to the area you're in, but not where the exits lead to. The individual maps aren't bad maps (they show you the number of exits a room has, what type of locked door is in said room, etc), but one large map showing the entire game would have been much better.This game also has a ton of replay value. Aside from the fact that there are four completely different characters which all have unique skill trees, there are many different ways to build each one. I'm on my fourth playthrough and I've still only tried the first character.Just do yourself a favor and get this game.Dear Endless Fluff,I saw someone in another review attempt to bribe you for a sequel by promising to get a Wyatt tattoo if you deliver another game. I'd like to echo his sentiment and his promise. If you come through with a sequel, I'll also get a Valdis Story tattoo.Love,Palmer "

												For those who are fans of the side scrolling versions of Metroid and Castlevania, this is a wonderful return to the style of exploration game play that was a hallmark of the two series.  The mapping feature is not quite as good as the SNES Super Metroid as it only shows you the section of territory you are currently in.  You will find a lot of customization of your character based on how you want to play the game.  Between armor and skill variations, along with a few choices in weapons, you can generally find a path of play that works best for how you want to go through the game.  While the main story can be completed in around 5 to 8 hours on the first play through, it has a lot of potential for replay and continued play as more then one character is available for play (up to four different characters after you complete the game the first time).I would strongly recommend a controller of some form with shoulder buttons.  There are a number of options for special attacks and magic that a 8+ button controller is highly beneficial for game play.  While it might be possible to play with just the standard keyboard, I personally would have had alot of issues with the game play due to the way magic is activated in the game (holding the main control pad in one of the four main movement directions and then pushing the magic button).  The ability to switch magic effects on the fly is also much easier to handle if you have access to shoulder buttons on the control pad you are using.While the story of the game is interesting, I would not say I was overly won over by it.  If anything, I felt like I was playing the middle chapter of a longer game.  Effectively you are dropped into the middle of the story with very little background other then what is provided by the opening cinematic.  You get some hints at the character backgrounds as you progress through the various NPC interactions, but don't expect a deep and rich story.  At it's heart, this game is more focused on game play and exploration, both of which are very solid once you get past the need for a controller of some form.			"

												I just beat this game for the first time and I'm already in love with it. The fact that there is still 3 more playable characters for me to play as means I'm no where near done with it either. The story, the characters and the play style. It's so rare to find a game where I love all 3. I pray to the makers that there will be a sequel to follow up on this story. The play style is mash up of devil may cry meets metrovania. The characters are fleshed out and the story has me craving more. If any of this sounds appealing to you by all means pick up this game. It's more than worth it.			"

												Unique fast-paced metroidvania-like that is overall solid but sports some unrealized mechanics and occasionally sloppy design.  Doesn't hold your hand very much.  Lots of nonsense terminology you won't understand for awhile.  You'll probably need to like 2D platform action and thin plot indie games for my recommendation to make sense.  This game is surprisingly free-roam as well, reflected in both your storyline decisions and level up choices.Pretty damn fun once you get the hang of things at all, and animations/backgrounds look very nice for an indie game.

												This is the single best single-player action game I've ever played. This easily eclipses Symphony of the Night, perhaps not in scope and length, but in sheer entertainment. The lore in the world of Valdis Story is rich and enchanting, the exploration is rewarding, the customization is so much fun and the combat is impeccable. All of the visuals in this game are beautiful and it's a wild and entertaining game start to finish.I did have a few problems with it here and there. I encountered more than one game-freeze or other such glitch, but due to an automatic quicksave feature, I never lost more than a minute's worth of progress.TL;DR: Not perfect, but the best action platformer in existence.

												If your into metroidvanias with a deep combat system then you should definitely pick this game up.  Pros:-great art style-very deep and fluid combat and combo system, something that is lacking in most metroidvanias and is one of the best combat systems I have seen in a game like this-branching skill trees let you upgrade your character a number of different ways all of which give a very unique feel- 2 characters currently avaialbe with 2 more freebies on the way-a good number of hidden secrets and even a few optional bosses to keep you busy if you are into 100% completion-challenging, but not in an aggravating way, when you die it makes you want to get better rather than throw your controller across the room.cons:-the jumping is a bit awkward at first, not generally a big deal but there is one level that requires precise platforming which is a bit annoying given these controls.  You will get used to it but you will miss a bunch of jumps before you do.-a few too many ""speed puzzles""  basically you flip a switch and you have x seconds to get the exit or the next switch, most of these are manageable and as you unlock dash upgrades they get easier, but I do feel these kinds of things are overused in the game.Great game overall and well worth your time.

												While the controls are not as intuitive as they could be, there is little else to gripe about in this game.  I generally describe it as a Devil May Cry Castleroid.   The combat has specific styles and patterns of fluidit\y like DMC, but the format, levels, and RPG elements have that newer 2D Castlevania feel.I enjoyed how you can't everything in one run, and it rewards you with stats for your skill in boss fights.  Consequently, New Game+ is a great option, with the option for quick exploratory playthroughs, and deeper perfectionist runs.For the truly fanatical, there is a hardcore mode (no saves/continues) with a global leaderboards.  Mere mortals like me won't be doing a lot of this, but it exemplifies the way the game provides challenge and replayability for players of all skill levels.			"

												Brings the magic of classic platformers back. I think you can roughly think of this as playing Zero on the Megaman series, since most of the action is melee. But it goes way beyond that.The characters have smooth animations, the bosses are unique and have interesting treats and the puzzles are in a varied range of difficulty. Some things might be frustrating, but hey, those are the rarest items you're striving for, keep that in mind!Very few maps have some trap elements which were present in famous platform games, such as Castlevania or Megaman. One of these, for example, is when you are hit by a monster and there simply isn't any type of air recovery, which means falling. Sometimes falling can mean going down one of two maps, which means going through the monsters again... But, hey,  those parts ARE supposed to be hard, the player IS SUPPOSED to pay attention!All in all,Pros:+ Fantastic Graphics+ Fluid+ Rewards player skill rather than grinding+ Rewards for good boss fights+ Has a fair bunch of secrets/missables for replayability+ has two characters to choose from and two more to come, all of them unique in playstyle and customizableCons:- Not a walk in the park game, beware!- If you skip some of the dialoque, you might never have a chance to read it again, so pay attention- Occasional framerate drop in some very specific setups (city waterfalls, _one_ specific boss)			"

												Fan of Metroidvania? Get this. It's everything I loved about Super Metroid, from fluid complex combat, to power ups galore. Tons of loot to be had, and the backtracking becomes faster and faster as you get new abilities. Not to mention the zones are small enough that 5min will get you through to your new items and out.There are FEW issues here, but some of them are daunting (keep in mind, I played through on God Slayer, the highest difficulty).1. Difficulty of certain MOBS is ridiculous. Flying skulls are horse♥♥♥♥♥♥early on, and the spider mini-boss is ridiculous to fight. This isn't because of the upped difficulty, these mobs are just terrible to deal with.2. Some of the 'puzzles' (read: platforming on a time limit) are a pain. Imagine you're playing this game on normal, and the puzzles are on God Slayer difficulty.That's it though. This game is awesome. I seriously can't think of any other issues, and can't wait to play through it again with Vladyn when he is released.			"

												This is a very fun game once you really get a hang of it and are able to play competently. It offers an fairly high level of challenge, with boss battles on par with games like Dark Souls in difficulty; in both games, you can expect the fights to be extremely challenging as you learn them, and then be significantly easier with the right character build and player skill. What you get here is a great looking and well-polished Metroid-vania style side-scroller with lots of secrets and an emphasis on smooth combat that almost plays like a simple fighting game, all the way down to having assists. The game features a tremendous level of depth, with tons of equipment options, item drops and even a hybrid shop/crafting system that encourages you to kill all straggling enemies for their drops. The combat is really fun too, so you might find yourself going out of the way to kill enemies just because it feels great.What is quite unique about this game is the level of customizability that it offers, with multiple viable ""builds"" being possible among the 2 current playable characters; you can focus your skill tree such that your character is strong in melee combat, or you can make the character focus on defense and counters, or maybe you prefer to put a bunch of points into a specific branch of the spell tree that causes your attacks to scale with the luck attribute, doing extra melee damage to the enemy after you hit them with a spell. On the negative side, this game is extremely frustrating (and I mean EXTREMELY), featuring a few obtuse (and often poor) design decisions that may cause you to have to navigate large parts of the map again because you were hit by a cheap attack from an enemy standing in an unfair vantage... or sometimes because your attack caused you to step just a tiny bit forward. There is lots of unnecessary design like this... highly remeniscent of the NES era of side-scrollers. That said, there is plenty of good here to make up for it, though the frustration may drive you away initally (so keep at it!). It's sad to me that this game went so deep under the radar, since it's quite fun and very well made. Give it a shot.			"

The combat system is nice with a variety of spells to use and a couple of different weapons that offer a different way of figth. The game offer a selection up to 4 character (2 need to be unlock) to play with, this offer a certain replayability for the game.For the negative side, the fight can be unforgiven for players that do not have a great reflex (like me). I did have to retry a lot the fight and this can be frustrating.This game desperatly need a controller.			"

Despite of 2D-side-scrolling-navigation, the game still captures the basic of combo, the scoring system (both combo scoring to scale up the damage and boss fight to get extra exp). Besides, you can have fun with solving puzzles and the reward is really amazing.

												This game is amazing.This game needs more publicity than it currantly has.A ""metroidvania rpg"" game with smooth controls once you understand them (slightly unintuitive with no indepth instuctions aka no hand holding but really effective when you know). The story is interesting in my opinion. Bosses are a little hard first time through but much easier afterwards.A few missable quests and items are in the game though if you pay attention you will find most of them.there are different weapons for each character and they each function quite different from both, other weapons that that character uses and weapons other characters uses.There is a magic system and each character uses 2 different starting magics but the other 4 magic are the same graphocally and functionally between each character (not that it is a bad thing).This game is one I recommend if you like metroidvania type games. It is a bit shorter than some games but a decent game length and this game has replay value that I won't cover here.Each character has enough difference in gameplay and weapons to give each a few playthoughs.

												This is the single best single-player action game I've ever played. This easily eclipses Symphony of the Night, perhaps not in scope and length, but in sheer entertainment. The lore in the world of Valdis Story is rich and enchanting, the exploration is rewarding, the customization is so much fun and the combat is impeccable. All of the visuals in this game are beautiful and it's a wild and entertaining game start to finish.I did have a few problems with it here and there. I encountered more than one game-freeze or other such glitch, but due to an automatic quicksave feature, I never lost more than a minute's worth of progress.TL;DR: Not perfect, but the best action platformer in existence.

												While the controls are not as intuitive as they could be, there is little else to gripe about in this game.  I generally describe it as a Devil May Cry Castleroid.   The combat has specific styles and patterns of fluidit\y like DMC, but the format, levels, and RPG elements have that newer 2D Castlevania feel.I enjoyed how you can't everything in one run, and it rewards you with stats for your skill in boss fights.  Consequently, New Game+ is a great option, with the option for quick exploratory playthroughs, and deeper perfectionist runs.For the truly fanatical, there is a hardcore mode (no saves/continues) with a global leaderboards.  Mere mortals like me won't be doing a lot of this, but it exemplifies the way the game provides challenge and replayability for players of all skill levels.			"

												For those who are fans of the side scrolling versions of Metroid and Castlevania, this is a wonderful return to the style of exploration game play that was a hallmark of the two series.  The mapping feature is not quite as good as the SNES Super Metroid as it only shows you the section of territory you are currently in.  You will find a lot of customization of your character based on how you want to play the game.  Between armor and skill variations, along with a few choices in weapons, you can generally find a path of play that works best for how you want to go through the game.  While the main story can be completed in around 5 to 8 hours on the first play through, it has a lot of potential for replay and continued play as more then one character is available for play (up to four different characters after you complete the game the first time).I would strongly recommend a controller of some form with shoulder buttons.  There are a number of options for special attacks and magic that a 8+ button controller is highly beneficial for game play.  While it might be possible to play with just the standard keyboard, I personally would have had alot of issues with the game play due to the way magic is activated in the game (holding the main control pad in one of the four main movement directions and then pushing the magic button).  The ability to switch magic effects on the fly is also much easier to handle if you have access to shoulder buttons on the control pad you are using.While the story of the game is interesting, I would not say I was overly won over by it.  If anything, I felt like I was playing the middle chapter of a longer game.  Effectively you are dropped into the middle of the story with very little background other then what is provided by the opening cinematic.  You get some hints at the character backgrounds as you progress through the various NPC interactions, but don't expect a deep and rich story.  At it's heart, this game is more focused on game play and exploration, both of which are very solid once you get past the need for a controller of some form.			"

												PROS: MetrovaniaCombat SystemCharacters Feel UniqueHighly Customized Character BuildsAmazing Art StyleWorld Building LoreTangible Risk/Reward RankingsAccessible But Heavily Rewards SkillCONS:No World Map Readily AvailableLow Level CapCombat Ranking a Tad UnforgivingNo Real New Game+Valdis Story is one of the best Indie Metrovanias I've played yet. I'd even say it ranks up there with many of the ""professional"" Metrovanias. The world is moderately large, and the game adheres by the classic Metrovania formula of: Go to place, see unreachable door, progress in different direction and get power-up/item, backtrack to previous location and us power-up/item to go throw door, rinse and repeat. Although quite a few of the aforementioned areas (that require significant backtracking anyway) are optional so the formula doesn't damper the game, if you're not into it. Combat is smooth and the combo rewards system is a pretty nice incentive to get better at the game. Each of the four characters all feel unique, and have their own weapons, strengths, and (at least one unique) set of spells. The two starting characters have subtle nuances that set them apart from one another (aside from the different set of weapons), but the two other characters feel completely different. The story is relatively simple, but does a good job of world building and draws you into the conflict pretty well. The art style is stunning with each backdrop/sprite/item looking hand drawn and animated superbly smoothly. While each area has it's own map, you cannot look at the map of other areas that you are not in so it's sometimes difficult to tell where you need to go next. The rating system offers often significant stat boosts, which is a great incentive to improve and get better. However the ranking for Combat (damage taken vs given) is rather unforgiving at times. The low level cap of 20 also makes each stat and skill point very important so getting the best stat boosts is pretty important. There are also a number of limited resources which means that you can only upgrade a few spells, weapons, armors so you have to choose wisely. Also there's no new game+ (the only things that carry over are weapons but not any upgrades on them), which I feels is a bit of a detriment to the game as a whole.			"

												A good Metroidvania title that suffers from a couple of flaws, Valdis Story: Abyssal City combines replayability, crafting, and difficulty into a game that delivers an overall fun experience that occasionally lacks direction. It's a game that offers some good ideas, solid execution in most areas with some aspects that could use improvement and serves as a good first action game entry from Endlessfluff Games.Valdis Story allows you to assume control of one of up to four characters (two locked on the first playthrough) as you explore a city, fight angels and demons and learn the fate of a goddess and her daughters. The controls are clean and work well, allowing for dash-cancels, stuns and blocks that add some depth to the fighting. The sprites are usually small and the graphics a bit simple and repetitive, but they get the job done. Some simple timing puzzles are involved in the gameplay, all in the vein of hitting a switch and then getting to a chest or exit before the timer runs down. Many timers are generous but getting some chests require precise, quick control.A crafting system allows you to upgrade your weapons and armor with the loot you find off of enemies. There is no standard money system in the game, only the barter of items. This adds some complexity but also can be frustrating when a specific material is needed for an upgrade or item and one has to go back to a specific area to farm a screen's worth of enemies until enough of that material drops.One of the strategic aspects of the game is just how many things can be permanently missed in a playthrough. Entire towns can suddenly have their populations go missing forever, and the game only sometimes warns you that this is a possibility. In fact quite a lot of the game's choices are time-based go with very little in the way of explanations and hints - several of these take the form of ""If X isn't completed within Y hours after Z first happens, then branch B happens and there's no warning and no going back."" This is not as big of a loss as it first appears, because Valdis Story is a relatively short game (8-10 hours on a first playthrough, significantly less on future games) and playing through multiple times and learning the branching paths and how to trigger them is part of the fun of the game. Some more exposition or an in-game warning when a deadline is approaching would have been welcome, though.Your character levels with a skill tree that allows for customization in three different major aspects of your character (melee damage, armor/health improvement, magic damage). The balance of skills is a bit uneven and some skills felt much, much stronger than others but it made for interesting choices while leveling. Each level also grants an extra point in a main attribute, which then affected your character's stats in a way that felt arbitrary. Sometimes, putting a point in Luck gave more power and critical strike than putting a point into Strength, and provided bonuses in other stats as well!There are many areas to explore, all of them connected to the main towns so one is never far away from some action. However, it is very easy to find oneself underleveled for an area or a particular boss, without a clear indication of where the player should be if they are not powerful enough for the current area. Some bosses have both regenerating shields and self-healing, which can be a very frustrating experience if the player doesn't have enough damage output to overcome those obstacles. Some grinding and crafting is very useful above Normal difficulty to help with this.Although Valdis Story has some flaws and quirks, it is overall an interesting game that is a pleasure to play and explore and encourages more playthroughs to determine what aspects of the story can be changed through the player's actions (or inaction). I'm looking forward to seeing more out of Endlessfluff.			"

												It´s a pretty good game, if you can tolerate the combat/hitting system design. The characters have some brief animations (like flinching when hit) that you cannot have control over, and can make you bounce like a pinball ball between the enemies attacks. This becomes extremely annoying at later levels in the game when some enemies and bosses spawn projectiles and sequences that take advantage of this mechanic.Save point system is also strange, since you cannot go back and equip the proper item in order to fight a boss or a environment hazard in some situations.Other than that, it´s a good old school Metroidvania.

												Do you like Metroidvanias? Course you do. This is a great one. Huge map with tons of secrets everywhere, lots of different upgrades for every playstyle you would want. Combat is based around building up combos by stingin light and heavy moves with spells and skill cancels, with a focus mode that rewards long combos and a nice quick-swap system for spells so you can switch them out mid fight. Honestly, the combat is just really fun. Story is interesting, it throws a lot at you in the begining but once you play for a bit it's not terribly difficult to understand. The art is BEAUTIFUL, and the music is just as good. My only complaints would be about difficulty, this is a very hard game, and it only gets harder as you go. With four modes of difficulty, it surprises me that they made Normal so punishing, I can only imagine what God-slayer must be like. However, it's not arbitrary difficulty as a skilled player that knows how to use skill cancels, dodges, and blocks can prevent most damage, but there are moments when enemies will juggle you for 40%~50% of you HP and the bosses tend to be damage sponges.Honestly, for $15 this is probably one of the best purchases you can make on steam, tons of gameplay with replayability and secrets to find. Solid game that's tons of fun.			"

												Best metroid-vania I've played (except for the actual SOTN). I've been searching for another game that would give the feeling, chalenge, and sense of exploration that SOTN had, and this is IT. Awesome lore, artstyle, OST, and combat. The game is hard, but it's not cheap. It's like DMC3 on 2d, and it is tight. 4 characters to choose from, optional bosses, events that will trigger depending on your actions, 3 skill trees that REALLY matter, and give you♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of replayability. The secrets are awesome too, very well thought out. I've beaten the game twice, once on normal and another on hard with 100% completion and S rank, all with the main character. And still, there is a lot of content, and I do feel compeled to play it, beacuse the characters really differ from one another, and the gameplay is just to rewarding. Awesome game, I truly recommend it.			"

												Solid game, combat felt good. If you enjoyed metroid or games like that you will more then likely enjoy this. Just don't play with the keyboard. There is a lot of points in the game where you have to be 100% bang on or you won't do whatever youre trying to accomplish.			"

												It's a 2D metroidvania-like game with crafting, skill trees and RPG stats. There are 2 characters to choose from (4 when you beat the game for the first time) and each of them of them have very different play styles and abilities, with multiple unlockable weapons for each of them, which changes the play style even further, and on top of that, every character has different magic powers. Also lots of boss fights, and not bullet sponge bosses, ones that will make you retry multiple times the first time you fight them. And no bugs, like, at all, nothing messed up the game, which is rare for a game made in the last 5 years (how f***ed up is that?) The main story took me 8 hours to complete (HLTB says 11 hours, so I must be a good person at this)(Bought at $9.74)			"

												Its pretty good. Four characters to play as, each with their own unique playstyles and place in the story. Starts out easy enough but there are some decently hard bosses later on. Especially the optional bosses.Probably the most annoying final boss I've ever fought in any video game, though. A little too much HP/shield regen for my tastes, but its still doable. Just have to have patience. And a lot of good equipment, because even as Gilda, the almost easy-mode spell caster character, that final boss is a pain.Character leveling almost reminds me of a class-based RPG more than a Metroidvania. 20 levels is the max and each character has three different trees worth of perks to put level points into. Most class-based RPGs also have some skills or perks that are just plain bad and you will want to stay away from, but I haven't seen any of the perks in this game as useless. Even the perks that scale various stats based on how many Angel/Demon/Polished Stones are in your inventory at any given moment are useful, especially since those are some very common drops.As far as the story goes, I'd say its okay. Pretty good, even. Not the best, sure, but its definitely not bad. The basic story is in the game's description, I don't need to go over it in this review.Art style is a little cartoony, but that's completely fine and, personally, I quite like it. The in-game music is pretty good, but you'll be too distracted with fighting the hardest bosses in the game to hear the best of it. Especially the ""Eye of _______"" bosses.So yeah, I'd recommend people give it a try. Too bad there isn't a playable demo available for download, but almost no games come with those anymore.			"

												Really solid brawler/Metroidvania hybrid--there's lots of exploration and powers for maneuvering around the world, but also a tightly-controlled and frantic combat system. Great bosses and cool skill trees, too. Cool visual style and a fantastic soundtrack are just icing on the cake.The campaign isn't very long, but there are 4 characters to play through it with with very different playstyles--true to any good Metroidvania, it's a blast to replay, especially on the higher difficulties. This game was a huge surprise--I can't believe it didn't get more discussion. I can't wait to see what these guys make next.			"

												This game is absolutely brilliant. While only two of the four main characters are playable right now, those two are quite well polished, and not only do they have their own distinct playstyles, but separate personalities as well. Wyatt is, well, angry, angry at the goddesses for how they treat humans and angry at the demons and angels for working with them. Unlike many characters like him, his anger is also reflected in how he acts around his friends. He may not be attacking them or insulting them, but he speaks in small amounts and doesn't give off the feeling that he particularly likes pretty much anyone except for Reina, the other character that can be played right now. Reina, on the other hand, was raised as a monk and acts quite differently than Wyatt. Where Wyatt sees angels and demons and attacks them on sight, Reina will often ask them to let her pass first. She's more polite and more controlled, and often seems to wish that she could avoid many of the fights that happen.As far as the gameplay goes, not only do the two offer very different playstyles from the start, but the unlockable weapons add more variation from there. My personal favorite was a bow and dagger that Wyatt could unlock- it couldn't break blocks nor could you block while using it, but the added range and speed worked very well with my playstyle, even more so when I upgraded the bow to poison targets. Overall, the game is very well done, particularly for a game that's still a work in progress. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes combat platformers.			"

												Valdis Story is a Metroidvania-esque game with RPG elements. It has a fantastic story, great character development, a lot of awesome music, beautiful art, and a combat system that suits everyone's personal playstyle. As like any traditional RPG, your character levels and you are allowed to set points into stats and skills (Meele/Defensive/Spells). Currently, there are 2 playable characters that, as far as I can see, share the same story. If you finish the story on one character, the other one shouldn't be too tough to play. At the time of this review, the developers are planning on releasing two additional characters; so look forward to that!Now, to the gameplay. On my first playthrough, I tried the game on Hard difficulty. First of all, you may want to rebind keys that are the most comfortable for you. Personally, I like WASD for movement and IJKL for combat and the CTRL key for blocking (I don't have any experience with gamepad, but this game definitely supports it). The game starts off pretty easy, but man does it get tough later on. There are the basic light/heavy attacks that you can combo and the armor/accessories that provide passive skills (ex. Extra damage every 6th attack). For the main character, there are about 4-5 weapons that each have unique attacks and can totally alter your playstyle. Most importantly, you have an ability called Skill Cancel that gives you about a 0.25s invincibility frame that you can dash with and avoid deadly combos. This ability takes about 2sec to recharge and doesn't recharge while you're attacking or being attacked, so you have to avoid attacks (like blocking) often. Later on, you gain more charges of Skill Cancels and have passive skills that recharge it more quickly. Bosses get really tough and test your abilities. They become easier when you know their pattern, but it's still hard to avoid some of their attacks as they require perfect execution within a miniscule window of time.When you defeat bosses, you get scored for your time, damage taken, and skill (Like combos and dodging their attacks). Get a great score (Rank A) and you get stat boosts. Achieve an amazing score (Rank S) and you get a skill point. Personally, I've only been able to get Rank S on a few bosses, in which there are dozens, and it took me many retries. You only get one chance to kill the boss and get a good score, else you have to start from the save point and fight 'em again. If things get too rough, you can farm monsters and level up. I personally didn't find grinding all that boring - I used them as opportunity to test out combos and refine my skills. My only issue is that sometimes, the movement feels a bit wonky. When you do an attacking without pointing a direction after landing on the ground, it does a little dash forward. There was this extremely annoying boss that stands on platforms the width of 2x your character and you'd always fall off into a pit of poison that drains health/mana. Wall jumping sometimes gets confusing in such that they made it so that you can't jump off the same side of the wall twice - if you miss the parallel wall while wall jumping, you cannot jump off the same side again and you will plummet down to the bottom and do it all over. This is an annoyance for the larger gaps.TLDR;Amazing Metroidvania-like game with RPG elements. Great story/character development/gameplay/music/art. Combat has a steep difficulty curve in regards to bosses, but still fun and rewarding. Skill Cancel is vital to gameplay; won't be able to defeat bosses without it. Some minor issues with the movement. Many, many hours of great fun!			"

While the battle system is a little basic there's plenty to keep it interesting and i haven't felt as though any of the dungeons were repetitive thus far. The games bosses and puzzles are legitimately challenging i started on the second hardest difficulty and some of these fights were seriously brutal, you have to aticipate every move and execute your combos flawlessly, the timed challenges for loot are also pretty damn hard, every single one needs to be executed within 0.5-1 second (sometimes less) of the fastest possible time but it still feels like its worth it because you're always rewarded with a piece of fat♥♥♥♥♥unique loot (its also the only way you can get armours).

Soundtrack is great, and the art is pretty to look at.One complaint is that there is no global map, you can only see the map for the area you are currently in, so it is hard to see where you are missing map completion without running around each zone.Overall, this game is a lot of fun and the devs are still creating content for it.Definitely worth picking up for $15 bucks.

												Takes a bit of getting used to the controls, especially if you're playing on a keyboard.Without spoiling too much, there's a slightly frustrating bad event that happens if you don't defeat the thing that appears after the first, very early boss within the first two hours (basically, you uh.. fight 3 bosses or so after, then go kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this thing, if you're not getting stuck in places.) so after 2-3 more bosses I suggest you haul♥♥♥♥♥back there and defeat the thing you were told to avoid. but don't go straight back when it appears the first time unless you've done it before.The controls are rather intuitive, once you have a feel for where everything is (rather, I got a little confused at first but the standard layout actually does make sense), blocking is actually useful, but you also got to know when to dodge and when to block. So it's nice to see there is a difference.There are also some choices in-story you can make that affect later bosses and so on, which is nice for a metroid-vania type game like this.Some dude I heard gave criticism to this game for its jumping mechanic but I don't see why.I give this about a 7/8 out of 10, The story is interesting and the art direction is pleasing but a lot of the timed challenges are a little unforgiving with how your character will pause on every wall jump or ledge grab, and that infernal, slightly obscure bad event that prevents you from playing an entire section of the game if you don't head back within a reasonable time-frame. If you don't go back to defeat the thing I mentioned before fighting the 5th boss or so you flat out miss out on this part. and there are some other things that might not be quite apparent either. I'm not asking to be hand-held through the game's optional bits but a few clues would have been nice.			"

												Abyssal City is like a hack and slash Castlevania game with 4 different characters (each with different playstyles), 3 skill trees, and an attribute allocation based leveling system. With the skill trees and attribute points you can customize a character as you see fit. Specific gear you find is also based also caters to the three skill trees. This allows you to play in various different ways. Magic abilities also change their effects based on where you position them in your ability slots. So the same spell being placed in your Up+Magic Attack and Down+Magic Attack will have completely different actions.The game has a story that seems to go throughout the game as well, and so far it isn't something to write home about but it's nice that its there. Overall the game has a very fun atmosphere and with 4 different difficulty settings you can easily find a nice place to set your own challenges. You'll also find mini-platform/time based challenges in some rooms that lead to huge rewards. Normally I find this sort of thing frustrating but I have found it to be an enjoyable challenge so far in this game. Boss fights can also be fun and unique as they seem to have their own very unique abilities and ways of defeating them. With a controller the game handles very well and plays with very few problems. I have not tried the keyboard option but these games usually don't work well with one. The music is also pretty top notch.I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed any of the Side-scrolling Castlevania games, especially if you like the idea of building your character the way you want.

												Dude ApprovedAt it's core Valdis Story is a platformer adventurer in the vein of Metroid and Castlevania (Arguably pulling from the middle aged Castlevania's like Aria of Sorrow and Symphony of the Night more than the original classics) and it rewards skilled players with faster levelling and more damage from pulling off combos without getting hit. Luckily even if you're like me and lack the ability to make the game work for you with it's skill cancels and wall acrobatics you can still get down and dirty giving as good as you get.One of my favorite parts of the game so far has to be the spells and affinity bar. Each directional key as well as jumping has a spell linked to it ranging from the left right directions being line shots to up and down having numerous utlity and damage uses from stealth to healing and even giving your attacks magical properties. The affinity bar is nifty because each slotted spell and equipped item (When they're aligned) slides it either towards Light or Dark giving you benefits related to your stats Neutral is naturally jack of all trades, Dark is for offense giving increase status effect chance and resistance penetration while Light focuses on survivability and utility giving bonus defenses and bonus damage on your Assists.I will reiterate that the game rewards skill relying on crackerjack timing for some of the puzzles...and sometimes just luck but the frustration melts away when you get to that chest and get a permanent upgrade, a snazzy new piece of armor or even make it to one of your crewmates who somehow got himself locked into a room you needed key items to get into...stupid crewmates.On the whole Valdis Story : Abyssal City is fun, difficult and frustrating but definitely worth it if you enjoy games in it's genre or even if it's your first dip into the pool.

												Hardcore Metroidvania for enthusiasts.I assume you know what to expect from the genre, so here are a few key features that set it apart from its brethren:- Combat is very technical. Enemies will block and counter after taking a set amount of hits. Dashes are very limited and do not recharge until you stop attacking. There are spells, affinities/weaknesses, backstabs, status effects, all the fun stuff we love and hate so much.- Gear progression is both, horizontal and vertical. Every piece of gear is viable and useful IF your build supports it. Most of them can be upgraded twice, some even branch out into two different upgrade paths. There is a limited amount of upgrade materials though, so make sure you know what you want/need and save your game before upgrading.- Boss fights are ranked and reward you with permanent stat boosts if you do well (B, A, S). This can be quite frustrating for new players, who are bound to finish with crappy D ranks due to a lack of skill and experience. It takes time and practice to get good at those, but once you pull it off, getting an S rank feels pretty nice and encourages you to get more of them.- 3 out of 4 settlements can be permanently lost, as well as certain optional bosses and unique item drops. For example, if you fail to kill the yeti boss introduced at the beginning of the game BEFORE you enter a certain area, it will wipe out an entire settlement later on (removing its shops and unique gear from the game). New players are unlikely to prevent all of these events without consulting a guide.It should be evident that this game does not mess around.What's even worse is the fact that it doesn't communicate any of the above to the player.My first playthrough was a nightmare and I vowed never to play this game again.Once you get good, however, it's really fun and a nice challenge for people who are looking for a bit more ""oomph"" in their 2D platformers. It's not going to serve you any breakfast after it's done with you though.One thing to be aware of: There is a known bug when quitting the game in fullscreen mode. Your screen will remain black and you will not be able to tab out of it or bring up the task manager (likely making you restart your computer). As such, I advise you switch to windowed mode every single time before you quit. If you try to avoid this by playing exclusively in windowed mode, you are likely to encounter some unsightly visual glitches in the game's terrain. The game's code seems to be a bit messy, so don't expect a whole lot of polish in the technical department.The game's soundtrack is pretty sweet.Try to grab a copy if you can.			"

												After learning the game mechanics and what each stat actually does, this game became a pure joy. I've played through it multiple times just to try different builds and get better scores on bosses; all of which is very fun to do. Plus, they are still adding content! A great metroidvania-ish sidescroller with intense action, multiple builds and continuing content? Who could say no?			"

												Alright - let's give you a short overview on my time with this gem.Approx. a year back I bought it, I played it (with Wyatt) and I did not finish the game, because I started travelling for said year. But I do remember, that the time I spent with that game was pretty darn good. I love platformers, I love Metroidvanias and I like tough gameplay - so I'm kinda biased by genre here. I remember having some tough and some annoying fights, but really enjoying the skill system which is part boring, yet useful, passives (e.g. 5% damage buff) and part really interesting and novel (kicks can now guard break etc.). There were skills that you grinded for, which would drastically change up your fighting style. Put new weapons and multi-tier armor on top of it and you got a pretty solid RPG-Element to this Metroidvania-Platformer-Thing at heart.Anyways - as I said, I stopped. Until yesterday. Yesterday there were a couple of hours of day left, but not enough to get myself really invested in Legend of Grimrock II finally - so I thought. The way I played Valdis Story yesterday though, I would have had enough time for Grimrock as well, but I'm glad I gave Valdis another spin - boy am I glad. Grimrock will have to wait.I didn't want to pick up my old save file - that was too far gone, but playing another character - sure thing. Let's say I did not expect Reina to be that different from Wyatt - this is (especially for an Indie-Developer) an amazing effort. With the recent update (and thus two more characters) this game has got me enchanted once more. And with no travelling planned in the near future (and the additional motivation to unlock two more characters), this time I'm gonna finish this game. Cudos to the developers for investing so much in this game and making those updates free. As mentioned before - this kind of genre is right up my alley. So me liking this, just kinda makes sense. Still I would recommend this game  not only to gamers with a soft spot for Metroidvanias, but for Gamers with a soft spot for either one of these: RPGs, Platformers, Challenges and actually fighting games. Let me briefly elaborate on the latter: The fighting system in Valdis Story takes quite a few things from fighting games àla Street Fighter, BlazBlue and Co. There is a good variety of skills that work as dashes and stuns and allow for interesting combos. Adding to that are guard-breaking moves and skill-cancels. Those two kind of skills really shake up the combo-possibilities and they are part of what elevates this game for me. There a many ways to skill your character and many ways to approach a fight. This is, for this particular genre, quite an achievement, that I have only rarely seen before (Dust: The Elysian Tail is the first that comes to mind, but isn't as broad in execution and as flexible in skill-developing).Long story short: This is a brilliant game, with some extraordinary developers behind it. PS.: Some fights can be quite frustrating, so if you get demotivated quickly - well think about the purchase. But with Steam's new refund policy, there is no reason not to try it. In 2 hours you'll see enough of what this game offers, in order to decide whether this is for you or not.			"

Posted: February 11, 2014
												Let me just start by saying that I have about thirty games in my steam library I've purchased the past two years and this is the first one I will have played to completion (I'm very near the end).  I know many young adults are in this same predicament these days, too many games, not enough time.  Valdis Story is the first game I've played in a good while that was worth my time to complete it.  If you did a lot of growing up in the 90's and spent too much time playing super metroid, castlevania:sotn, and/or mega man x then this is a game you've been waiting for.  There are a lot of good reviews out there that go into more detail about the game and I'm going to leave it at that.  This review is more of a rebuttal to the negative reviews that I've seen.  Sure everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I'd hate for someone to be on the fence about this game and not buy it based off of imo a bogus review.First of all, I don't know why anyone would want to play a platformer without a controller.  The game is meant to be played with a controller, so yeah I guess it is frustrating playing without one.  This game, like many, requires xinput for your controller.  If you don't have an xbox or newer controller with xinput you can even get your old controllers to work using a program called x360ce (just google it) which emulates your old controller to a microsoft controller.  I have a 10 year old logitech controller I got for free and it works fine.  Second, difficulty.  I guess people just like playing interactive stories these days where you just keep moving forward and hitting the x button.  There are four difficulties, I skipped normal and went straight to hard, the 2nd of 4 difficulties, where I would say it provides a moderate challenge.  Moderate being I have never once died to normal mobs, a few bosses I have killed after my first try, most a few tries, and some several tries.  And I still made several mistakes when taking them down so there is definitely a lot of leeway there even on hard difficulty.  It is akin to contra where you have to memorize the pattern in order to succeed except unlike contra if you died you had to start at the very beginning of the game you get to start right at the boss fight again!  Thats right, you don't even have to run from your last save point back to the bosses room you can retry as many times as you like!  I imagine on the hardest difficulty you have to have the patterns memorized and play pretty much flawlessly.  I've seen a few people complain about enemies juggling you.  If you allow 3-4 enemies to clump up on top of each other then sometimes, yes they can get a good juggle chain on you, it is something that rarely happens and when it does it is it is always your fault and it is never long before you can evade out of there.  ""Blocking does nothing.""  At the start you can only block light attacks, you can upgrade your block to block heavier attacks.  This is something I actually very much like.  I read a review on steam where the person said enemies get stronger so it never feels like you never get stronger and I have to disagree with that, I think they hit a good balance between making enemies non-trivial and with all the abilities you pick up, still feel very powerful late game.  Also, I started out putting all my skill points into offensive things since killing things very quickly is usually a good strategy, but eventually I had to spend points on defensive abilities and things like purchasing a block upgrade really make your character feel more powerful.  There is no way for the game to punish you for exploring because even if you did make a wrong turn at albequerque you can just load from your last save.  But I never felt like I couldn't progress.  I will say there is one boss near the beginning of the game when you start really backtracking for the first time that may seem kind of harsh, but he is intended to be that way because it is completely optional to do so.  Just like there are optional bosses at the end of the game that are tougher than storyline bosses, because it is optional they increased difficulty to give challenge to those who seek it.  And even though that boss did seem very powerful for my character at that time I was still able to beat him after a few, ok several, tries.  As far as time puzzles and super mario jumping, none of the time puzzles have taken me more than a few tries.  I just recently went through the area that had one of the time puzzles I really struggled with and it was comical how easy it was after having played the game for awhile.  For jumping, I've been through the entire game except for the hallway to the final boss and there are only 2 areas where its a bit tedious on the super mario jumping skills.So anywho, that is my review.  Game is well worth buying/playing through and has above average replayability.  If you played video games in the 80's/90's you might pee your pants laughing at the people saying this game is too hard on even the easiest difficulty.			"

												One of the best Metroidvania/RPG's I've ever played, if not the best. Lots of variety built into the game, different playable characters plus addition non-playable crew that add to the game (making the game highly replayable), great soft metal soundtrack, awesome story and world (humanist theme, fighting against both demons and angels), lots of little extras to find that help you along, tons of Steam achievements, great game to use a controller for, fun enemies and tactical combat, unique gameplay with movements that require skill, nice graphics. Overall, a very solid game. Keeps my attention and may be one I actually replay, which is rare for me. 10/10-----------Note: Some people find the controls hard and irresponsive and so choose to rate the game poorly. Other people complain about how so many enemies stunlock you. But there are ways to get around the stunlocking, like using armor that makes you immune, etc. The controls can be challenging in parts but I found it fun as much as frustrating. The level designs and combat maneuvering are meant for people looking for a challenge out of a game. If you like platformers then you should fall right into step with this game.			"

												I´m not very good at games like Valdis Story (Metroidvania-Games) and i took me a while to get used to the combat system and quite a few frustrating hours at the beginning. But if you get used to the skill cancels and the combat system it´s a great game. Overall the story is also quite decent but i don´t think that this is a deciding factor for a Metroidvania-Game anyway. It certainly isn´t perfect but when you work out the system it is a great game and worth the money. Personal score for the game would be: 8,5/10And 2 playable characters will probably be realeased in the future as well. So even more game time to look forward to.			"

												This is one of the best games I've played in a while. It has so much of what I look for in a video game; fun combat mechanics, beautiful visuals, and an awesome story. This is basically a 2d style side scroller with a metroidvania feel to it. If I had to compare this to other games, it's kind of a cross between metroid prime, castlevania and megaman x (with some of the platforming mechanics). However, it also has an RPG system that allows for different game play styles, but isn't too convoluted either. This game is gorgeous, but I would definitely say the highlight would be the fun, challenging and visually breath taking combat.			"

												I like this game in general, but it system bugs is just annoying. For example - I often unable to get back to game after I use alt+tab from fullscreen mode without manipulations with it from tasks-manager. Alt+enter seems to switch game to windowed and back, but game immediately returns it to previous screen mode for some strange reason. Game also didn't reacted to my gamepad, I turned on support for direct input gamepads in options, and now I can't control game not with gamepad, not with keyboard. Now I need to find out how to revert this last changes and make it to see at least keyboard again. And I could used this time to actually play some games. But I think you won't met such problems, if you use one of popular pad, that this game can recognize and don't have habit to  use alt+tab in fullscreen or play in window. Getting used to jumps also take some time and at first they seems annoying, but after you get used to them they seems pretty smooth. Game actually pretty fun, if you can get into it...			"

												An interesting Metroidvania with a decent amount of content with more coming later on, it focuses more on combat over exploration with more durable human-sized enemies and large weapon-specific movesets. The graphics are nicely animated even if the backgrounds tend to come across a bit too obviously layered, the music does its job and the controls are for the most part functional.However, it has a number of laws that tend to make it somewhat more tiresome to play than others of its kind: There's a severe lack of quick travel/warp options which isn't helped by the fact that NPCs that trade you items are all over the place: while most of them are located around the few quick travel points, there's at least one location with multiple NPCs you'll be bound to visit often that requires you to go through several enemy-filled screens to reach from the closest quick-travel point, and while the said location has an exit that leads back near the quick travel point, there's no equivalent entrance to it, which is just confusing.The magic system, while varied, also has an annoying tendency to lump together offensive and defensive spells with the ones that're mainly used for exploration and while there's a quick-change screen for them, it'd be nice to have at least 2 or 3 layouts you could switch between depending on the enemy. You also can't see your currently equiped spells without entering the menu, which also slows down the process of switching them around.As far as exploration is concerned, the game seems to have far too much focus on timed platforming puzzles: while having a few of them for variety's sake would've been nice, there's far too many of them in every dungeon for them to stay enjoyable. The jump physics also don't work quite as well with platforming as they do in combat, as the ledge-grabbing mechanics take some getting used to and jump velocity doesn't seem to match up to your movement. Finally, for whatever reason, your controls reset to neutral when you change screens, which can be extremely annoying during vertical screen transitions.I'm also not a huge fan of the way hitpauses are used in the game, as many of them seem to be too short to register mentally as anything but frame drops and take place during actions where they don't really serve much of a purpose, such as when activating a Focus Finisher. They would probably work better as slowdowns instead of action freezes.While the above issues aren't that severe, they still drag down the overall fun factor and playability in what's otherwise a good game: there's also an annoyingly large amount of mutually exclusive and missable content, including upgrades for entire sets of spells and skill points for the skills trees if you don't beat the optional bosses with an S rank. However, seeing as the game is still missing large amounts of its content, all of the above issues can still be fixed, in which case I'll be happy to recommend the game to anyone looking for a Metroidvania with a varied combat system and multiple unique characters, and as it is, it's still worth playing if you aren't turned off by the flaws listed above.

												This game pays homage to Metroid/Castlevania titles. It is an excellent metroidvania style game. Plenty of exploration, meaningful fights with bosses (You have to fight bosses with a brain or else you will die) and hidden items, upgrades and weapons throughout the game. The game has a leveling system implemented and plenty of skills to choose from to make a specific class or play style. You can definitely come back and play this over and over again to see which play style is your favorite. The difficulty is tiered from easy to hard, so those who don't want to struggle can choose to play on easy. There are multiple playable characters; each with specific abilities & weapons. Some require more skill than others but they are well balanced. I hightly recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of the original Metroid or Castlevania side scrolling games on the SNES/NES & DS.			"

												Stop me if you've heard this one before. ""I bought this game on a Steam sale..."" I picked it up because it was cheap and vaguely remembered the Kickstarter. I never really thought I'd play it but once I started the game I powered through in just under three days (~8 hrs). The game's combat system and world are well realized and there are multiple characters and builds to play as (with more coming). It's a classic Metroidvania style game that hits the progression loop well. At times I found the combat frustrating though. Many of the game's enemies can get you in a stun lock if you're not careful and the bosses in the game come with a three step recovery program. 1. Get your butt kicked, 2. Try again and do marginally better, 3. Take the boss down once you get down the pattern. This works well but until you understand the boss the battle can be rage inducing and life threatening to your controller of choice. Also I wish you could see a unified map rather than just pieces of it. Overall though if you're looking for a fun, well done, combat oriented Metroidvania I'd recommend the game.			"

												This is one of my favorite games. I've beaten it several times at this point. It's not especially long, but there's plenty of content that will take multiple playthroughs to see. I wish it were more popular, mostly because I find myself going to the wiki to find something and realizing I know more about what should be on the page than what's currently there. So this game has officially gotten me into writing wiki pages =p. But that just show's how good it is. The story and gameplay are so good that I'm invested enough to want make sure the wiki is up to date and accurate. Putting that aside, there are 4 playable characters with multiple sets of weapons and armor to unlock and subsequently upgrade. All of the weapons are unique to each character and have they're own different stlyes of gameplay. I've played most as the ranged character and the 'mage,' which is kind of just a split between a ranged and melee character depending on what spell/skills you're using. The bosses are fun and challenging and you're ranked on how well you do against each one. You get rewarded based on what rank you get. [PSA: I played for 40ish hours before I noticed, but if you look at the bottom left and bottom right during a boss fight you can see the timer and combat rank %. The timer will show exactly how much time you have before you can no longer recieve S rank, Then A, and so on. The Combat % will go down each time you are damaged, but it will go back up every time you do damage to the boss. I think S on that is around 75-80%]. You can make builds out of 3 different skill trees for each character. Each tree focuses on Attack, Defense, or Magic. You max out at level 20 but there are ways of getting more stats and skills if you're determined enough. Even if you're not into challenging boss battles, I would still definitely recommend playing through a few times on the easier difficulties just for the story. Unfortunately, as far as I know right now, there are no plans for a sequel. Hopefully if the developer see's more interest in the game that could change in the future. So if nothing else, buy this so I can get a part 2. Oh, and by the way, This is the first steam review I've written in several years that I've had an account. I just love Valdis that much.			"

												Dude ApprovedAt it's core Valdis Story is a platformer adventurer in the vein of Metroid and Castlevania (Arguably pulling from the middle aged Castlevania's like Aria of Sorrow and Symphony of the Night more than the original classics) and it rewards skilled players with faster levelling and more damage from pulling off combos without getting hit. Luckily even if you're like me and lack the ability to make the game work for you with it's skill cancels and wall acrobatics you can still get down and dirty giving as good as you get.One of my favorite parts of the game so far has to be the spells and affinity bar. Each directional key as well as jumping has a spell linked to it ranging from the left right directions being line shots to up and down having numerous utlity and damage uses from stealth to healing and even giving your attacks magical properties. The affinity bar is nifty because each slotted spell and equipped item (When they're aligned) slides it either towards Light or Dark giving you benefits related to your stats Neutral is naturally jack of all trades, Dark is for offense giving increase status effect chance and resistance penetration while Light focuses on survivability and utility giving bonus defenses and bonus damage on your Assists.I will reiterate that the game rewards skill relying on crackerjack timing for some of the puzzles...and sometimes just luck but the frustration melts away when you get to that chest and get a permanent upgrade, a snazzy new piece of armor or even make it to one of your crewmates who somehow got himself locked into a room you needed key items to get into...stupid crewmates.On the whole Valdis Story : Abyssal City is fun, difficult and frustrating but definitely worth it if you enjoy games in it's genre or even if it's your first dip into the pool.

												As a huge fan of metroidvania, I have to say, yes. I highly recommend it.[+] This game, unlike other metroidvania, is bit different. It's very fast paced hack and slash with combo system. In higher difficulty modes, even the minions you fight can be a battle. As for bosses, you try to get S grade to get extra bonus rewards and this will make you retry several times to achieve minimum of A (which can get frustrating).[-] But most frustrating part of the game isn't that. It's the odd / new controls. WASD isn't for moving and rather used for block/magic/light atk/strong atk. It doesn't stop there. This game takes some time to grasp the concept of how wall jumps and dodge (skill cancel) works. Not to mention that it probably has the worst double jump in gaming history (debatable). EVEN WORSE, the game has biggest ""WTF WHY!?"" moments. For instance, ""The Pit"" can be accessed without double jump. If you don't have double jump and go down, gg. You can't get back up. Another example, elder of Ishk asks for two items and tells where it's found. Never repeats it again. Just... WHY.[+]With that being said, there are many other things that make up for it. Such as, goddam, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing addicting. You feel so powerful when you cast magic and slash your enemies in combos. Likewise, magic spells in this game are creative and they aren't useless. You will have to backtrack but transportation system makes it so much easier. Lastly, two characters are available right now. They both have different playstyles, different weapons (each character has THREE different kinds), and different perspective of story.TL;DR despite some frustrating moments and odd controls, you will get used to them and will enjoy the game if you somewhat like metroidvania.

Another example, elder of Ishk asks for two items and tells where it's found. Never repeats it again. Just... WHY.[+]With that being said, there are many other things that make up for it. Such as, goddam, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing addicting. You feel so powerful when you cast magic and slash your enemies in combos. Likewise, magic spells in this game are creative and they aren't useless. You will have to backtrack but transportation system makes it so much easier. Lastly, two characters are available right now. They both have different playstyles, different weapons (each character has THREE different kinds), and different perspective of story.TL;DR despite some frustrating moments and odd controls, you will get used to them and will enjoy the game if you somewhat like metroidvania.

												This game is a hidden gem.It came as an absolute surprise to me since I bought this game on a sale without much research. But then I started it up. The menu music combined with the stunning handdrawn art immediately gripped my attention. Once in the game it felt responsive but limited until mechanic after mechanic were introduced and slowely everything in the world made sense. I felt in control at all times. I made the mistakes and I got the credit for achieving something but it's no DarkSouls. The game is forgeving in that you won't loose much progress by dying, since you'll just respawn in the same area, but unforgiving in that every enemy will punish sloppyness. Timing and propper use of your skills are of the essence. This combines perfectly with the rpg elements in the game. They are limited but during the game your character gets stronger, you get more skilled, and new movement mechanics add up giving you a real feeling of 'owning levels'. Now the story was rather enjoyable as well eventhough it didn't really matter to me but the endless fight between Heaven and Hell is always exciting and because the game has it's own lore for every element of that battle it was always interesting.The use of magic felt a little weird at times though since I often triggered my dash instead of my spell but I loved the melee so much I didn't bother to get skilled at using magic. I felt like the itemcrafting wasn't explained at all but this didn't hinder me in the end (normal difficulty).For some reason this game just clicked for me. It has rewarding gameplay in the line of DarkSouls, the looks of Bastion, and music like an older Final Fantasy.note: I've played this game as warrior/guardian on normal.			"

												Exceptionally solid Metroidvania with RPG elements. strong focus on combat and exploring. How you build your character significantly impacts your playstyle which provides a lot of replayability. Also there is more free content on the way in the form of more playable characters, each of which has a completely different moveset for combat. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy Castlevania/Metroid style games, as this is a real gem. Although for me its basically an afterthought, the story isnt bad at all, escaping a lot of the most common eyeroll inducing cliches found in video game stories.			"

												This is a wonderful ""metrovania"" style game. A nice handful of boss fights that are fun to fight and master for achieving S rank within them. Both playable characters are different to play and have a variety of playstyles. Expect to take anywhere from 3~7 hours on your first playthough depending on how much you adventure/search. Story is decent but the setting is wonderful. Downsides would be the lack of being able to max out all equipment/spells if you wished, and the low level cap. Overall I would recommend this game to people looking for either a metroidvania game or an action/platformer game. Would love to see a second installment that expands on this game.			"

												This game is hard!  Frustratingly so!  Some of the bosses are cheap - and I mean extremely cheap.Others are ... pathetic. You can stand in one spot the entire time and the boss basically doesn't do anything but jump all around the screen and eventually get near you so you whack the crap out of them.Neat story though confusing as sin when you first start the game. Some missables (meaning you'll never have a chance to go back and get them if you don't in the ""right time"" or at the ""particular point in the game."")The game is not designed really for the idea of 100% complete in all sections.  It is meant to be played over and over again.Update:So, I started to play this game again in 2015 - it has been patched a lot from my first play through.  It is more polished, there are some bugs, but not as many as when I first played. It is _a lot_ better now.  It is still ""about as finished"" as when I first played though, they added a few more bosses. I am more consistent at getting ""S Rank"" on boss fights this time around as I understand the mechanics and the general ""path"" to follow to complete the game 100%.There is only one area that I found was a true missable the last time I was in there and there are only a couple items/crew you can miss. So, 95% of the game is not ""missable.""You can either find it or not and a good portion is ""unmissable.""Some of the ""upgrading"" is a bit warped - takes waaay to many materials to upgrade so I think that is a bug or a re-balancing issue.Certain builds (all or nothing) types are enthusiastically OP. If you don't build that way though... you will not have a good time. Or well, you will have a much harder game to complete. I really enjoyed my all stat/skill points in Luck Build that seems like one of the most OP builds in the game currently. I don't find the game as hard as I use - after configuring my controller a bit more to a more generic playstyle it is significantly easier than using a keyboard.			"

												Pretty good metroidvania, with good music and decent graphics (nice looking, but a bit low resolution).The combat, while less fluid than in titles like Dust, gives a lot of room for choice, with weapons and magics each handling differently.The levelling system and the gear (primarily armours) give you a lot of options to customize your character toward your prefered style.Full offense, full magic, reaction/defense, a mix of these, or even damage over time and debuffs, the choice is yours to make.Bosses are challenging, and the better you do against them, the higher the rewards (experience, and possibly bonus stats or skill points)The combat and plateforming mechanisms definitely require you to get used to it though, and some of the timed portions to get the optionnal gear can get a bit frustrating.On the plus side, you can rebind even your gamepad's buttons to suit your habitudes, and it plays well with both keyboard or 360-type gamepad.Overall, a good package, with more content coming for free later down the line (including 2 additionnal playable characters)			"

												Let me just say i was so lucky to be told about this game. The art in Valdis Story was so magnificent and at times left me distracted from the actual game. The story in the game is very well developed but a little hard to follow. Im guessing im just too stupid to take the whole story in though. There are some plot twists, but they are mostly towards the end and ,i'm sure, would have packed more punch to me if i had already known what the dogmas were.The music all fits in perfectly and i found myself wanting to listen to it, ""instead of muting it and putting my own music on like i do with most games"", because i felt it might hurt the once in a lifetime experience that surrounds this game. In our day and age, it's hard to get back the magic and wonder of playing and beating games like metroid and castlevania for the first time, one of the reasons being the internet. With a game this new and lesser known there is minimal online walkthroughs and guildes to help find stuff out, so a lot of the learning is left up to the player. I found myself multiple times looking for help online and finding none, and this isn't an easy game either. The boss battles of this game are so amazing and well designed that i found myself really overjoyed and proud to beat them, ""and with no help!""There is however, a bit of a slow learning curve with how the game works and getting used to the fighting style. It took me until halfway through the game to learn how to use assists, ""q btw.""Leveling up is a little odd because of the stats being, ""Str, Int,Agi...and...Luck?"" most of my points in the end went to the Luck stat simply because it ended up giving me more boosts then the others for whatever reason. There is also a skill tree which can give you some really awesome advantages, i only wish i had focus on the skills i wanted to begin with and went to those first instead of last.The ending of the game ""NO SPOILERS"", was kinda unexpected. I just thought it was like any other dungeon and had actually beat the final boss without even knowing. The ending of the game would have been really anticlimactic, if it wasnt for the fact of the sweet ending cutscene. The amount of pride that i help though, i'll remember for a long time.All and all, this is a really great game and id totally suggest buying it, because believe me, you will never be able to get an experience like this again.

												Here's some standout features of this game:Awesome artwork-Character designs are varied and tell a story unto themselves. For example, each crew member the Wyatt must find is detailed, unique, and have at least SOME backstory to give them personality-Levels are vibrant and also have a lot of variety-Enemies types are recycled a bit, but they have cool designs and the bosses are downright awesomeA soundtrack that is, at times, beautiful, haunting, and tenaciously driving forward, all at once. Other times, it's just beautifulBittersweet Gameplay-Combat: move-canceling is introduced early on, and failing to use it to its fullest in respect to its limitations will leave the player frustrated and blaming the game's mechanics when the going gets tough. And boy, does it get TOUGH. Combos tend to leave one open for attack, so bad timing, spamming the attack button, canceling too early, and failing to mind enemies' attack patterns and environmental hazards will cause many to rage quit and not recommend the game. Once the player learns to cancel into a dash at the right moment, be defensive when the situation calls for it, utilize the right spells, and basically use the resources that the game gives you, the experience is fulfilling, as improvement can actually be felt with each boss fight won, each timed puzzle achieved, and each upgrade unlocked.-Movement: Not the best, but the cancel/dash is everything in this game. Certain platforming sequences are tough to pull off since jumping in this game is not as tight as others in this genre, but again, learning the mechanics of the game and working within them takes most of the kinks out, just not all. This game definitely needs a PS3 controller-type of D-pad to execute certain sequences with masterful precision. Unfortunately, too often there are platforming sequences where enemies are placed at the perfect position to hit you mid-jump, causing the player to be ""stunlocked"" so that you cannot recover in the air, thus forcing you to fall helplessly until you hit the ground. Additionally, the character can continously get hit by everything around them while in stunlock. The latter situation can be helped by move canceling into a dash, but the former can be overly punishing.All in all, highly recommended for those that want a little bit of the technicality fighting games offer (I'm thinking of ""roman cancel"" from Guilty Gear and other fighters with canceling) mixed in with Metroid/Castelvania/Mega Man X level design and platforming and difficulty spikes that seem like they were meant as a challenge to only serious 2D sidescrolling fans. I personally would love to see more of this genre done this way and even a sequel to Valdis Story: Abyssal City that removes or limits ""stunlock"" and tightens up the overall frame data of combos and jumps, but even then, what makes these games great may turn off the majority of players out there. Therefore, the appeal really comes down to nostalgia for the SNES/GENESIS era and the prospect of taking an old genre and injecting modern gaming features (skill trees, customization, etc.).  "

												I've played an hour of this and I already feel I can make a solid recommendation. I don't use the term ""Metroidvania"" lightly because Castlevania is one of my all-time favorite series so a poorly made Metroidvania is NOT a true Metroidvania, IMO. That said, if you love Castlvania: Symphony of the Night or any of the GBA/DS Castlevanias, you will love this game. It's not *quite* as professionaly polished as SotN but it's like 99% there and even the soundtrack is Castlevania levels of amazing. This is hands-down the best non-Konami branded SotN style game I've ever played. I paid $3.75 for this and I feel I ripped off the developer, lol. HowLongToBeat.com puts this as a 10-12 hour game so even for full price I have to say ""Buy this game. Buy it now!"".			"

Posted: January 13, 2014
												Summary: Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a challenging action/platformer that's a bit rough around the edges, but the core gameplay is awesome fun for the price.VS:AC's gameplay consists of navigating a 2D Metroidvania-style world while battling angels, demons, and other monsters in the name of humanity. Currently two characters are playable, with two more promised: Wyatt is a swordsman who begins with dark and light magics that can be built to do a ton of damage and healing, while Reina is an unarmed monk whose starting magic focuses on utility and applying a powerful self-buff/enemy debuff combo that massively boosts her damage. Wyatt can also fight unarmed (using a pretty cool stance-based system), and both characters can obtain a few radically different weapons later in the game. The combat system basically consists of mixing up fast or strong ground attacks, launchers, aerial attacks, and spells (which are incredibly strong even for melee-focused characters). You also have skill cancels, charges which grant an invincible dash and also reset your animation to continue a combo.As you gain experience and levels, you can place points in one of four stats: strength, agility, intelligence, or luck. Each level also grants one skill point, to be used in skill trees unique to each character. Building your characters gives a lot of potential replayability, as there are skills, spells, weapon upgrades, and accessories that dramatically alter how your character plays. For example, Reina can dedicate heavily to her Monk tree to get skills that raise her critical damage based on agility and further boost it during Focus mode, the length of which naturally increases with agility. Wyatt might choose to take advantage of his many skills that focus on slow attacks and strength, or he could become a spellcaster and take skills that increase the penetration and status affliction chances of his magic while making his normal attacks recover mana. Luck tends to be an all-around stat that raises different characteristics each time, but one accessory gives a massive boost to every other stat based on your luck while applying a constant HP drain. Each playthrough limits how many classes of magic you can upgrade, and you can only max out one weapon per playthrough, so there's an incentive to play again to try out different builds.The normal enemies actually get to be very tough on higher difficulties until you get very familiar with how to deal with them, but the real meat of the game is the boss fights. Bosses hit very hard in this game, and you'll need to learn their patterns and when to use your skill cancels to stick on them without getting destroyed. You're ranked on how quickly and skillfully you kill the bosses, and gain permanent stats based on that rank.Platforming is pretty easy early on, but gets to be VERY difficult in some of the later areas. This is kind of a con to the game, as the aerial controls are a bit limited and there's not really anything you can do to respond to an incoming attack that won't send you plummeting to the ground--the aerial dodge sends you straight down, and taking damage removes all control until you hit the ground. When there aren't enemies involved, it's a fair challenge.Other areas in which the game appears rough are the grammar (not well-edited), the story (which seems pretty cool and deep if you knew the details, but far too much is barely mentioned or explained), controller compatibility (360 controllers work, many others don't), and the resolution (which does not upscale well to fullscreen and only has 1x or 2x upscaling naturally supported for windowed). When using a controller, the skill cancel can be a bit touchy and go off at unwanted times, in my experience (and many others'). The game is still technically not complete, so there are some unfillable spots in the item list and a few other indications that something is missing.Despite those shortcomings, if you like challenging combat, RPG-style skillset building, replayability, a great soundtrack, and Metroidvania-style exploration and platforming, Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a great value as-is with more promised to come.

												Valdis Story is a fun game that reminds you of some of the classics, but stays far away from being a clone. Watch the opening video, and you won't have any surprises in terms of what to expect. The video doesn't leave anything out. If you like what you see, consider buying it. If you don't, you won't like the game.If you are thinking of purchasing the game, note that you could finish it in a single playthrough in about 3-5 hours. You will probably take a bit longer if you want to collect everything, or if you get lost or confused at where to go. There is an additional character to play(with two more coming), but if you're not the type to like re-playing things, consider you may be spending 15 dollars for a three hour game. If you don't mind re-playing games, there's lots of difficulties, and you can build your character a different way every time you play.Pros:-Fun combat-Good combat controls-Lots of difficulty options-Lots to find/collect to get 100% completion-Customizable charactersCons:-Platforming controls can get frustrating-Short gameOverall I recommend the game, but depending on your budget, there are some reasons to wait to buy it. I give the game a 8/10, taking a point for the length, and the platforming controls.			"

												Starting Vladis Story:Abyssal city,I thought it was gonna be a game that was short and sweet. But as I played I realized that this game has some serious value. If your a fan of the Castlevania symphony of the night game this game has everything that game had as well as a gripping storyline and just as much high paced rewarding gameplay and loot loot loot!Nothing beats finding awesome weapons and items and armor especially in a game that lacks mercy!Its a tough game at points and the platforming can be a little tricky as the controls dont always do what there supposed to and being in certain areas trying to get from one side to the next in a certain time frame while avoiding traps and hazards can be very annoying if your character decides to not lach onto a ledge or decides to pull himself up and get zapped or burnt when you just wanted him to leap to the next ledge. All in all the games atmosphere,soundtrack,gameplay and visuals are worth every penny and more in my opinion. These kind of games always will have a special place for me personally.Finding one that can stand up to castlevania is amazing as well. id give this game a 4 out of 5.			"

I got 25 exp from the ♥♥♥♥ing Manawar. It feels like there is little incentive to progress in this game. The ability to change your spells is simple, but not convenient when you're in a fight trying to execute combos and you accidentally pull up your spell menu and change two of your spells. This game is as engaging as it is disengaging. If you never play this game, you're not missing out.			"

												I bought this on a lark and have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised.The positive aspect of this game is that you have some real nailbiting, epic boss fights that will push things well past the limit. There is an element of trial and error as you learn attack patterns, but nailing a tough boss after a protracted fight is extremely satisfying. The game gives you a large enough toolbox to make fights organic and exciting. A boss' attack can be evaded with a dodge move or a timely jump. You might also be able to block it with your shield or blow through it with a defensive spell. Perhaps you could even be prevent the attack altogether with a well timed big hit. No matter how you play it, it's all very satisfying and deaths are not severely punished the way they are in certain other 'challenging' games.The main issue with the game is it seems to enjoy doing puzzle platforming sections that rely on basically leaping from ledge to ledge against a timer. Nothing has been too irritating yet, but I can see this being frustrating for some. The game's skill and magic system is also a bit obscure. You'll get an item that says it needs to be 'patched up' and the game will give no indication about how you might do that. The skill system is also filled with all sorts of terminology that the game doesn't bother explaining in the least bit, leaving you wondering if it's a good idea to inflict Retribution or gain a defensive bonus after dodging. Still, those drawbacks are set aside by some good old Metroidvania action. It's fun. It had a boss based on Rubick, what more do you need?The one flaw:I don't like the game's ranking system though. It's one of those ""You got hit, D rank"" games that get a bit obnoxious. I don't need some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ judging me after I beat an incredibly tough boss fight. Back off, game.			"

												Valdis Story:♥♥♥♥♥CITY is what happens when you take them good ol Metroidvanias of old and give it to people who like their typical anime plots. Fun gameplay mixing some creative platforming, Devil May Cry esque action, good ol exploration and RPG elements allowing you to spec out your characters for various builds makes for one of the more fun games released as of late. Just be sure to read up on the mechanics, and you should do just fine. Overall a good game with some good replay value, what with two playable characters with their own plots (with two more on the way as free DLC too, srsly you can see them on the character select screen).

												Very fun game.  The game play is a mix between castlevania and viewtiful joe combo style combat.  This game can truely be recognized as a metroidvania.  The combat was very well done and the platforming, i felt was really well done.  This includes backtracking which some of you may dislike but it reminded me what makes a metroidvania, the exploration and backtracking.  Plus with different power-ups and helpers.  I only wished all the characters were playable so that i clock more hours into this amazing game.  The spell system can get a bit annoying as you can only equip 4 spells to each direction ala smash bros style, and there are certain spells that is required to go through new areas such as a fire fist which breaks walls and the obvious double jump.  This forces the player to keep them on as the player can get constantly  annoying in doing so.Other then what was said above, i highly recommend this game to anyone a fan of this genre.			"

												What a great game! I got this game because I wanted to satiate my desire for a 'metroidvania' style game and I got that and more in Valdis Story. To me it has added to the this well loved genre with a twist of DMC. It has a great fighting system, which is easy enough to pick up but  difficult to master. I love the variety of the loot. Different weapons, armors, and spells keeps things fresh and the level up system (three branching skill trees) allows the game to played in a variety of ways. I am not a nihilist for perfect grades, but I found I liked the Boss grading system. This system gives you a letter grade based on how you performed in a boss fight-if you used any potions, if you kept the combo counter high, and time to complete. You are usually given a reward in the form of a permanent upgrade in a stat. I find myself purposefully losing a boss fight so I could retry it and get a better grade. Though I have yet to beat the game, it is a great game and I honestly have to say it is my new favorite of the metroidvania genre.			"

												Valdis Story is a well developed platforming action game that fits comfortably within the ""Metroidvania"" genre.  The story is interesting enough, creating a backdrop of a group of characters fighting for human souls in a war between ""angels"" and ""demons"", but the real draw is the gameplay.  A selection of different characters, equipment, and skills provide a variety of options for the gamer to decide how to engage the enemies that one will encounter.  Regardless of what path is traveled, however, many will find this game to be on the irritating side of difficult.  Merciless enemies require patience and understanding of the mechanics and pitfalls of the game.  Unblockables, lingering status effects, and a lack of the hit-invicibility that many old-school gamers can take for granted can lead to a devastating combination of unavoidable pain if you aren't cautious or have tremendous fast-twitch reactions.               The map is fantastically designed and, coupled with an astounding soundtrack, draws the player into the game quite well.  The controls are responsive, but demand skill from the player to not make mistakes on their use.  A gamepad is suggested for this game, and I am quite glad that key rebinding is a feature.  Certain gameplay mechanics and level design decisions will undoubtedly enrage some players, such as rooms with gaps in the floor combined with enemies that stun and knockback, send the player back to an earlier part of the level, or the exacting timed platforming speedruns for certain pieces of gear.               Overall, this game is recommended IF the player likes the ""Metroidvania"" style of games that require backtracking, AND enjoy the challenging but eventually rewarding type of learn and adapt gameplay in Dark Souls.  Gamepad is definitely recommended.			"

												A fantastic metroidvania style 2D action RPG.  Overall -- 85/100.  The combat is challenging and extremely fun. You have light attacks that combo quickly, heavy attacks that break guards but will get interrupted at times, block (with option to parry if timed correctly), magic actions, an assist function (similar to Marvel vs Capcom i guess), and a quick dodge system.  You can also choose which kind of armor (all offering various bonuses), weapons, and skill points to use to suit your style of play.  This is not an easy game if you choose a high difficulty setting.The story is interesting, although admittadly not its selling point.  At the very least, it makes sense and doesnt try to confuse you with nonsensical plot developments.  Its a simple Angels vs. Demons conflict with humans struggling to survive in the midst of it... and theres not too much more to it.Length and replayability wise.... first playthrough may last you 5-10 hours depending if you attempt the side bosses and are on a reasonable difficulty setting.  The story doesnt really change between the 2 characters very much, but the combat style is different so it may be worthwhile there.  The developer has promised 2 additional playable characters in a free DLC in the future... whether or not the game will change much beyond combat style, i dont know.  Either way, you may just wish to try the game again on a higher difficulty and test your skill.Presentation wise... there are a few glaring issues that really need to be addressed, but the total package is still very good.  The graphics are very pleasing, combat is well animated, and even a lot of the backgrounds have great detail.  The music is absolutely fantastic and really helps set the mood.  The sound effects are generally good, however... there are times where they will suddenly spike in volume (especially water flowing) and create extremely unpleasant scratchy sounds.  The UI is fine as far as equipment and skill trees is concerned, but can often be very clumsy equipping magic especially because some of the magic is almost entirely a platforming gimmick (ice wall, im looking at you).  Another annoyance is that the game overfills 1920x1080 monitors in windowed mode, but if you are playing in fullscreen mode and quickly switch to another application (such as skype), the game will revert to windowed mode, requiring you to go back into the options and select fullscreen again... would be much simpler to have a borderless windowed option or simply minimize when switching to another application momentarily.  Alternatively you can use software such as shiftwindow to alleviate this, but i dont feel it should be the user's responsibilty to use a 3rd party program...			"

												Artstyle/Graphices: 8/10. The game has a great art. Everytime I hit a new level I was awwed by the great secenry. The Charecters all have there own flavor and all fit well into the story and feel they try to convay.Gameplay: 6.5/10 I was going to make this higher but I found the enviorment itself more threatning then half of the monsters. Alot of juggling can happen if you get caught in a attack and can't break out until the game decided to have taken enough damage which is useally 50%. There is a way to break out but you need to wait until the game lets you break but if you are caught between 2 monsters its useally when there sone attacking. Bosses are very hit and miss. Some bosse are easy never even having to use 1 health potion while some are wall puching hard.On the good side the controls and most of the time responsive. Game Pad support is a big plus. Multiple charecters adds replayability for different sides of the story. Great open world feel. There is quite alot of backtacking but there is a transport system early on to help make it so you not spending 20min getting to the area to get to the new area.Story: 6/10 The story is basic but tolerable. There is nothing really deep but there is always a steady stream of lore to collect. Replayability: Yes. Like I said in Gameplay there are multiple charecters to play as with different combat styles and skill tress and such. Although I didn't touch the 2nd charecter yet the game dosen't start you off any different from where you start on the 1st charecter.			"

												I've put some hours into this game, some boot on Steam. I read a few of the reviews, and I was appalled at all the whining. Let's be frank. The controls are responsive, even elegant, on any computer that can run the game well. The combat system and your character build work together; one build requires a certain style, but will get you killed of you use a different style later in the game. Thigh the customization isn't incredibly deep, it is involved enough to be satisfying and make you wonder what would have happened if...I'm surprised how few have mentioned the wonderful soundtrack and the lovingly crafted art. This game is polished and complete in a way that not many games are.On veteran difficulty, I retried almost 400 times before I finished the game with all S ratings for the bosses. It was professional Korean difficulty on  God Slayer mode. When I finally figured out how to win (think megaman style for analysing patterns and weaknesses) consistently, the game was remarkably satisfying as a test of skill. I didn't for nearly so much after I figured out the flow and tactics of my build (shortly advise against starting on veteran difficulty). Discovering the flow and tactics for the next build went much faster.It's not an easy game, so go play Dust I'd you want easy. Despite massive increases in power through equipment and leveling, skill truly matters. This is Valdis Story. Go play it.			"

												A fun game if you enjoy the 2D Metroivania-style games.  The game has a strong emphasis on exploring and backtracking as well. The story where the game picks up is in media res.  A war has broken out between angels and demons with humans in the middle.  The protagonist will find themselves lost in the middle of an underwater city after their ship crashes.  As players progress, you learn more about the background of this war and the characters swept up in it.  Players will also learn about the city and its secrets. The game could be considered action/adventure with RPG elements, akin to Castlevania.  The combat system is based on a melee combo system with spell casting and standard blocking.  Spells can be interchanged in combat through a paused menu system.  Players level up based on experience and receive skills points to invest in skill trees.  I found there to be a slight learning curve with combat and some controls but it quickly grows on you as you face challenging enemies and bosses (used a gamepad).  The characters and environment appear to be hand-drawn and are very well done.  The soundtrack is well thought out and adds to the game atmosphere.  My only complaint is the sub-par map.  As a result, you will need to pay attention to where NPCs tell you to go and you'll do a good bit of backtracking.        Overall, a great game.  I grew up enjoying games like Castlevania and Valdis Story: AC does an excellent job breathing this genre new life.  Combat is fun and challenging and the enemies rarely are complete pushovers.  There are even platform puzzles based on time-switches that are fun to take on and really test your skills are maneuvering the controls of this game.  A great buy and an even better one on sale.			"

												Amazing soundtrack, visuals and gameplay. Will take on average seven hours to complete if played on the easiest setting and rushing to the end, much longer if you explore the game fully. Some bosses change up on the hardest setting. Still having new features added, the only downside is that the controls may not be to your liking. I personally had no issue with them except for grabbing onto the edges of platforms.			"

												I highly recommend this game! Not only does it have that traditional ""metroid-vania"" platformer/action-adventure aspect, but it's got a nicely added pinch of RPG to the mix which really ties the whole game together. A beautiful game with a DEEP storyline and very well-scripted/developed characters. This game is great for those who like to test themselves and just get-away from all the angry community members raging about ""crit-rockets"" or ""no-scoping"" or ""hacking"" - of any kind. It allows you the player to really sit-down and appreciate the simpler (yet powerful) roots of modern video games. Definitely a must-own for me.			"

												A truly great game. On one hand a nostalgic 2d brawler. But the complexity of the gameplay elevates it into a true masterpiece. The art and music both wonderfully form the backdrop for a very in depth story, and while all the art and script alone would make a great show or movie, it's all simply the stage for a highly customizable combat game. It starts easy and simplistic, and ends with a complex battle system that you slowly master. Extra points for high replay value due to the extra bosses, hidden items, game elements, AND multiple ways to build each character. Building a high strength character using one weapon plays very different than the same character building int/agi and using a diffent weapon and skill priority. I can't wait for futher development of this game. For while it's already amazing, new additions keep getting added. We still have two main characters to play as in the future, and you can see the spots in the game that have been set aside for new additions.			"

												It has a decent amount of exploration though not Metroid/Castlevania tier but enough there to make you feel satisfied when looking for any treasures/secrets.  The combat is the high point.  They implement a lot of ways to attack and pull of combinations using both light/heavy attacks along with magic.  Each power you get has multiple uses either for the environment or in combat, ie the double jump can also juggle enemies in the air if you hit them with it.  There is a lot of treasure to find and each has their own unique properties that can change your playstyle along with a skill tree.  Currently it has 2 characters that are quite different from each other and you will want to try them both out and 2 more on their way.  Story wise it has it's own lore and world, if you get into it you can enjoy it but I was just having too much fun to care for it.  Bosses and enemies are well done in it so you have to read movements and utilize different strategies as the game goes on.  Some parts can get quite difficult but there's nothing stopping you from grinding a bit since enemies respawn the moment you reeneter a room.  Later on you might feel a bit overpowered but it has multiple difficulty settings and each character has it's own skill level so if you play as Wyatt first and use Reina in the next playthrough you'll have to adjust and come up with new tactics.  Highly recommend and there is more content on the way.			"

												Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a stellar take on the Metroidvania game. It's really good, although ""typical"" metroidvania, but it certainly does an impressive job on variety and how satisfying the combat system and enemy AI is to fight.I beat it on Hard Mode, although I'd recommend Normal for a first playthrough. The main reason being the Boss fights -- almost impossible to beat them on your first try, as each one has a very unique gimmick and weaknesses that you need to learn before actually having a good fight. Aside from challenging combat, the game has lots of nuances regarding the equipment and towns you visit, that can be really confusing and frustrating for newcomers. The game is not gentle at all. It doesn't explain its more complex mechanics and story consequences very well, which may result in entire cities simply disappearing when you least expect. I was, for example, planning on buying a certain set of armor and items from a city... but when I got back, everyone was dead. And I had absolutely no clue why.On another occasion, I need a Bossfight item... but one that I couldn't get, because I didn't kill certain Bosses in a certain order...It has some interesting design choices like these. These aren't necessarily bad, but they certianly come as a shock and feeling of unfairness when you first encounter them. The game is designed for multiple playthrough, trying out different builds and characters. It's impossible to see everything in a single run. And that's fine! The game just doesn't make that very clear, in my opinion.Another interesting choice is how the game rewards higher rankings on Boss fights. Both with XP and certain Stat upgrades -- higher rank=higher stats. In a way, it's good to reward good players, sure! On the other hand, it makes the balance snowball in favor of high-level players. If the game is balanced for high-level skill, with high-level stats, people who haven't learned the mechanics as well get even poorer, since they get less stat upgrades. It's a weird choice.My reasoning for this is that the game is balanced in according to ranks, in a way. The reward for good rankings mostly helps to get high ranking on the next Bosses, and doesn't necessarily play such an impact on the general game's balance.Either way, it's a weird principle to have, and one that generated quite a bit of discussion on the forums. Once again, as a new player, I certianly felt like it was unfair! Especially since Bosses weren't repeatable -- if you've had a low rank, it's low forever. It's a good system for multiple playthroughs -- now you know better, practice more!In traditional metroivania style, you have several different areas, locked by different keys and powerups. There are also tons of optional Bosses with item rewards that let you craft weapons, armor, etc. It has a great amount of nuance and I'm probably going to explore it more in the future.The game is really challenging, but I'd say it's definitely worth it. Lots of hidden items and areas to investigate. Really awesome soundtrack! And it looks really good as well.The combat system hinges a lot on skill canceling, and comboing which feels satisfying to learn. The biggest problem I have with it is how it tries to make some skills a hybrid of progress gating (platforming) and combat.Some of the spells you gain are crucial to you traversing the game's areas and unlock new ones. They're also usable in combat. Unfortunately, with a controller, you can only have one of each type active. And the useful ones for platforming and absolutely worthless in combat... making the constant switching a pain in the butt. It's annoying, but not game breaking.The platforming is also a bit counter-intuitive, at times, but the sections are well designed, once you learn the systems well. All in all, this game reminded me of how much I love metroivania games, and how lost I become in these worlds, playing for hours at a time without noticing. It's an impressive effort from just a couple of people. Great job!			"

												This game is ALMOST amazing.   It ALMOST recaptures that feeling of wonder you get from playing a Metroidvania style game that's actually decent.  It ALMOST does the job of being an excellent game.  I still recommend it but here's just a few things holding it back from being absolutely wonderful.Positives:+Great Graphics.  Colors are vibrant and just really seem to pop out at you.+Nice sound.  Characters aren't voiced but sound effects and music in general are a pleasure to hear.+Combat System. The fighting in game is pretty legit.  It's actually a pretty deep combo system that actually goes beyond its ancestor's ""mash mash mash"" until dead.+Secrets and unlockables.  There's actually a wealth of content to find and unlock in game as the game does very well of rewarding you for exploring.Negatives:-Controls.(???)  These absolutely are 50/50 and I hate it.  I really don't care what anyone says.  I've played videogames since I was 2 years old and I am about to be 26 and never in my life have I ever been so frustrated with a game's controls. At least using a 360 controller as I can't actually forsee this being a problem with a keyboard. To go in depth, there's a mechanic in game that you use to dodge enemy attacks by pressing down.  During a fight that isn't super reliant on vertical movement, it's actually pretty awesome because it makes you feel like an absolute awesome bad***.  But during platforming segments this can be hell as if you aren't absolutely careful about how you are using your D-pad, you will more often than not accidentally press down during certain segments and totally mess up your run.  There is absolutely no deadzone for the down direction and it kills me.  There's also very VERY minor gripes that come out such as ledge grabbing when an enemy is near.  There's no way to jump and attack an enemy to climb up and there are some instances where the game will refuse to let you climb up at all if an enemy is positioned over the ledge.  That and there's no command for dropping off of a ledge without activating the dodge mechanic and shooting your way like a meteor till you hit the ground.-Pacing  At times, the game is actually pretty decent about it's saves.  They're spaced just enough apart that you don't feel like the game is spoon feeding you easy save points but not so much that you are crying out for help.  Other times, you'll often play for such an extended amount of time without a save, you'll get to a boss and be forced to either beat it to advance lest you risk your current progress.It's these two gripes right here that have me going crazy over how this game was ALMOST amazing.  I would have a third gripe but they have patched time based events to be 'event' based so that actually helped the score tremendously.I would still recommend this game to anyone but be forewarned, if you're going to use a controller for this game, be prepared to be absolutely frustrated by the game's mechanics at certain points.

												Best Metroidvania I have played in a long time. Combat is very fluid and tight controls make it exciting to play. Replaying the game for 100% item find or killing each boss expertly for the highest combat ranking is kinda fun but not the best incentive for replay.First playthrough 9/10Every other playthrough 6/10			"

												Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a fast paced Metroidvania style game with enough complexity to enable each playthrough to be different but not so much as to make it confusing. The combat system has light and heavy attacks, guard and parries, offensive and defensive spells, assists(the ability to summon members of your crew to do a unique attack), attack cancelling and dashing, and allows for both ground and aerial combos but eases into the separate systems slowly enough that it isn't confusing.The game also has a combo system. The longer your combos are the more experience points enemies are worth but getting hit ends your combo so you'll have to use parries and dash cancelling to maximize your combos. Boss fight ranks are based on speed, damage, and your remaining health. Do good enough for an A or S rank and you gain permanent stat increases!All weapons have different combos and all armors and accessories have unique abilities so instead of just picking the ones with the best stats you can choose the one that best suits your playstyle, even unarmed has equipment to buff it! There are three skill trees (offense, defense, and magic) each with 15 skills but only 20 levels to gain skill points with, though you are awarded a few points for sidequests as well.You can only save at save points which also fully heal you and are the only healing outside of magic. Anytime you do get a game over you are given a chance to retry, this restarts you in the area you died with full health and mana so you don't have to walk all the way back from the save point everytime you die to a boss.The games puzzles are all activating doors, by ground stomping or magically charging a switch, and then dashing to get through it before it reseals. Most hard ones are optional so if you aren't good at platforming you can still get through the game and there are some abilities that help make them easier such as double jump and wall jump. Every area has things you can't get the first time through but the backtracking isn't bothersome because quite a few areas have new bosses when you return and enemies scale with you as to not make it boring.Overall, Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a great game and I recommend it to anyone looking for an action platformer.

												This was the Salt and Sanctuary before Salt and Sanctuary came out. Minus the darks ouls art style/theme. The game doens't hold your hand on the quest, and a lot of thigns ar eleft for you to figur eout on your own. The bosses are very well made, fun to fight, and with the rating system, you'll end up fighting each multiple times for that S rating. Especialyl since you get permanent stat rewards if you get an A or an S, as well as bigger xp rewards. Lots of hidden items and side quests, an NPC that allows you to respec, multipel difficulties with new mechanics being added into enemies once you get high enough up there. The boss rush is also perfect for this game. The bosses are realyl the shining jewel on thsi ring, and beign able to skip allt he f luff and jsut fight the bosses really gives longetivity to the game.The Cons:-still has performance issues. Game would sometimes jsut randomly drop to 20ish FPS and stay there until I restarted, also comnputer freezed up a few times when I tried to quit. Both of these are easy tog et around, just restart the program and use task manager to close it. Still, three years later and this still happens.-Resources of information for this game are pretty bad. Directions will be vague, maps are largely incomplete, and the game has apparently been changed quit a bit from it's original release, which means making sure what you're reading is relevant.			"

												I'll give this a thumbs up.Pros:-pure metroidvania-incredibly challenging-lots of replay-a smooth visual appeal-decent soundtrackCons:-the devs are still working out game breaking bugs-patches take forever, but at least are an eventuality-I, like so many others, had to wait over a year for playable ""DLC"" characters who were shown in the character select screen.-basic things like the save confirmation sound are being changed, as well as adding new bosses(I like that part), all before the kinks are worked out.This is easily my favourite Indie game EVER!!! Don't misunderstand, I think this game is incredible, but the difficulty can be stress inducing until you know what you are doing and the devs should have maybe not been so ""indie"", if you know what I mean.While 16+ challenging playthroughs at appoximately 3-4 hours each to look forward to is great...paying less than $10 when it was on sale makes it AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												I have more than 100 games in my Steam library, nearly 200 really. But only 1 Perfect game. Valdis Story: Abyssal City. I think that alone speaks volumes on the quality and polish of the title. I shan't elaborate too much on what I think this game does right, since others have articulated it in a lot more detail. But suffice to say, if you're looking for a Metroidvania-style action RPG, this is the cream of the crop. 4 characters, 9 assists, myriad playstyles, 16 types of armour, 14 types of accessories, 5 weapons per character and their upgrades, makes for near endless replayability and a whole lot of fun!If all the reviews still don't sell it to you. Here's another thing then. I first stumbled on this game when a friend installed it on my computer. Where he got it, I have no clue. I played for free for one playthrough and liked it so much that I bought the game. It is THAT good. If only developers were like the folks behind VS: AC, we wouldn't need reviews no more, and we'd probably be in heaven.			"

												Metroidvania meets Dark Souls.This game highly encourages multiple playthroughs by offering four playable characters, stats skills and weapon builds that widely change each characters playstyle, ranking system, multiple difficulties, hidden secrets and collectables and mistakes that you wish didn't happen but it's too late to fix.The setting and themes are really good but the storytelling is a bit bare bones. Interesting characters and pasts are lightly touched on leaving me to think the game was working towards a sequel. (or more likely a prequel)Music is great, it's not quite good enough for it to be memorable outside of the game but during gameplay it gets the job done magnificently.Graphics is a complete hit or miss, I personally love the dark dreary look of the characters and enemies. The character models can look awkward as their 3D sprites used in a 2D game. Environments are a little lackluster and overused but get the job done well enough.Controls will feel terrible when you first start. You get used to them, but, it's enough to turn some people away completely. (Thank you so much for the double jump update!)All in all this game is pretty much the best Metroidvania I've ever played. (Yes that includes SOTN and Super Metroid.)I highly recommend!			"

												While there were many great games I picked up in 2013, I'd like to say that this one was the biggest surprise of the lot. Valdis Story: Abyssal City is, at a glance, an action-y ""Metroidvania"" style side scroller with some appealing art design. But with smart RPG elements, a very responsive combat system, special events in the world and multiple characters, there's a lot to like about this game. I would personally highly recommend this game to individuals who are a fan of the genre and would still encourage any fans of side-scrollers to at least give the free demo a shot. As a side note, its soundtrack is excellent.Criticizms would probably be a steep learning curve, events that you can overlook that can greatly impact your playthrough, and the fact that the game is rather short after 2-3 playthroughs; when you've become quite familiar with the general game path and have a solid grasp on combat, the game flies by.All that said, though, bang for buck this is a truly excellent purchase that I cannot recommend enough.

												So much better then expected.                                                                                                                               9 / 10 This is a really extremely cool game.Much better and more exciting then i could have ever expected from looking at the promotion video's.I have been looking at this game many times, over more then a year.But because i read some negative reviews about performance issues and/or windows 10 issues, it took some time before i dared to try it myself.But i should have bought it sooner, because the three most repeated negative comments are mostly one of the following reasons.1. Complaints about the game being to difficult for them. Some people nowaday simply are not used to this type of games where you need good and sharp reflexes. And need some tactic to overcome some trial's. And need a good build while leveling your charcater.But it is worth it and rewarding.How gaming should be !2. People that configured windows the wrong way, causing the game to stutter. Further Explanation on that is necessary.( The game runs with Windows Desktop settings for the resolution ). Well windows 8,8.1,10 nowadays has the APP scale setting where you can ZOOM in on your display resolution to make letters or apps look bigger without going a real resolution down.Windows prior to 8 also had it but hidden better inside the configuration panel, so less people had it enabled back then. The new Windows often automatcally enables this setting especially when using Resolutions of 1080p and higher.Thats why they get Frame drops. All you have to do is put windows on the NORMAL 100 % for scale, so that the game's scale settings does not conflict with it.So don't let that get you down if you want to try this game out.3. The last most seen category of negativity is from people that actualy were trying desperately to get there 12 year old Direct Input pads to work. But Direct Input causes stutter for some users.The developers have even put a note for it, so i guess they should read better.Or just be real and, plug in a XBOX ONE pad, and throw away that Dinosaur Pad.***SOUND & MUSIC***The game has very decent Music, and Soundtrack.Much like some Final Fantasy game's would have.It totally fit's the theme of the game, and the feeling would be best described as a Mystical type of atmosphere, the music can make you give that DAY-DREAMERS feeling.And the sound effects are likewise just as decent.***GRAPHICS***So actually this game looks fairly good for PIXEL ART.I run it with windows 10 desktop resolution of 7680x4320 Dynamic Super Resolution @ 60 HZ With VSYNC ON, and with the ingame res scale of 2X while windows is on the NORMAL 100% and it simply works PERFECTLY.Spells and attacks have detailed effects, just like the one's used by enemies.Anti Aliasing works when you keep it on ingame 1x Scale.And it smooths out the background layers perfectly.My personal preference however is to use 2X.It disables AA, but increases Sharpness fo rmost things, included Character Sprites, Enemie's Spells, User Interface, Menu Text, Fonts, Item Sreens and FRont Layer, they all look sharper on a 2X setting.Because AA get's disbaled the game also stays alot sharper during MOVEMENT.And that is why i prefer the 2X without AA setting.At the right distance from your monitor, ( in my case 2 meters from my 40 inch 4K screen, AA is not needed at all.The only thing that looks Jagged are the Background Layers, or at least some houses on them.But it is whatever you prefer, if you want it smoothened out, with less sharpness and more blur, while moving then just keep it on the 1X setting.***GAMEPLAY***The game is fun, plays smooth, there is enough content, and ALOT replayability.The story seemed rather dull looking at the Advertising movie, or at least thats what i expected when i looked at it.But it actually is decent, and at least it got me hooked.The developers somehow seem to have used different ancient FolkLore Stories as inspiration.A few things i thought i could detect where, some myths about Atlantis the ( Sunken ) City.And lore like from the Myth behind the MOvie 300 ( Forgot the Myths name ).There even seems to be some Moby Dic like similarities.And i am just a few hours in, so obviously there is alot more behind it.That can be read back inside a library you come across while playing.That same Library also serves as base for crewmates you discover to upgrade Skills and such.As far as Action type SLASH side scroll RPG, it really plays well.The battle's are fast, the Combo's react fast, just as jump, dodge and block.Everything reacts smooth.Bosses have tactics, some are extremely big, and they simply play really awesome.You can start the game with different characters, some of them have to be unlocked first, and the playable characters all have there own, Skills, SOuls (Magic Type), and Talent Tree's.You can unlock those talents, by gathering skill points while leveling, or turning in some items.The same for the base stats, taht come from leveling, or finding some items.The Tree's allow for different builds, combined with Magic Souls, and Equipment taht even allows for more different play-styles for the character of your choice.There is ALOT equipment that you can find.From Weapons to accesorie's, Armor, and Assist characters that come to help you in battle once in a while.You can upgrade equipment, level them up, by spending items you find in chests or by defeating enemies, Bosses.And then spend those items at NPC's Towns / city's, all have there own unique NPC's mostly 4 or 5 per town, that sell different things.All these items influence your build even further, and there are MANY, different possible combinations of playstyles.Ranging from Close up Warrior like or Stealth rogue like. To Magic, or Warlock, type of play.Later on you can reset both talent and skill points, for the cost of some items you can farm fairly easy, to try out a different build.So don't be afraid to spent them early on.*** DIFFICULTY***The replayability is already good because you can start the game with different characters, that have there own unique skills and talents. Armor, weapons, accesories and Souls,But besides that you also have 4 MODES to choose from: NORMAL, HARD, VERY HARD ( they name it different GOD SLAYERRR.I started out on HARD, because i want a fair challenge, so far i did get killed some time's.Mostly at bosses, and i had some moments where i needed to gain a level to be abe to make the boss fight a little more do-able.But i have not experienced anything that i could not overcome.If starting on HARD is too much for you, or you want a quicker first time run to get used to the game, you can always first play it on Normal.But if you want the perfect amount of getting used to the game as new player like me, without being a quick cakewalk, then just start on HARD.And keep the other 2 even harder mode's for ReplayaBility.Replay- Ability Tons more then i expected before installing it.And ton's more then most Modern Game releases nowaday.***CONCLUSION***Don't let negative reviews hold you back to try this like it held me back at first.Because you just need to configure some easy things correctly.If you loved playing RPG's from the  90's era.Or if you loved some Action or Slasher - Side Scrollers from that era.Or even jus PLatform games, and games like Mega Man, Mario'Bro's , Metroid, or even games like Power Ranger's Turtles, and Transformers.Then you will almost certainly get a good Time out off this Game .

												Probably the best Metroidvania-style game I've ever played. This game takes the standard Metroidvania gameplay and adds on a strong beat-em-up style combat system (combos, blocking, dashing, skills cancels, etc.) and a very-developed RPG-style character building system.It's hard to describe just how many options there are for building you character. But let me try and break it down for you:EACH of the 4 different playable characters has:+ 4 stats to be raised as you see fit+ 3 unique ability trees  +  each containing 15 different abilities, for a total for 45 abilities per character.+ 3 different unique weapons that significantly alter how the character plays.+ 1 unique unarmed style you can use instead of their weapons+ Or, alternatively, you can go with a magic only build.+ 4 unique spells+ 20 other spells that are acquired as you progress through the game.+ 16 different pieces of armor that do interesting things.+ 15 different accessories that can significantly alter your play style.+ 9 different companions that can be called to perform a special attack.+ 7 ""Focus Finisher"" special attacks that can be used to end Focus Mode.+ 1 unique Focus Finisher+ 3 different alignments (Light, Neutral, or Dark) that alter how your stats affect you.If that seems overwhelming, just keep in mind that all of this is provided to you a little at a time as you explore, so you don't have to take it all in at once, and mastery of all the various systems is really only important for the higher difficulty levels.In addition to the very good gameplay, this game has a decent plot to go with each main character, and while a single play-through has enough content to be fairly satisfying (especially if you try to collect everything), the game is structured in such a way that you can play through the whole game again multiple times, trying different characters or strategies, fairly quickly. All of this is accomplished without requiring a significant amount of grinding.Valdis Story is already a complete game even though it technically isn't finished yet. But don't let that fool you; other than a few minor elements that feel like they need some touch-up, the game already feels like a complete, polished game--more so than many games that are supposedly already finished.Highly recommended.

												A great platforming ARPG with Zelda and Metroid-Vania elements.A lot of great games have been combined to breathe life into Valdis, wall jumps, ledge hanging, melee combos, areas that aren't accessible until you clear out the next ""dungeon"" and come back. Quick travel between towns, crafting and item upgrading, talent trees... the list goes on.You choose one of two (eventually 4 with free DLC) characters to hack, slash and magic your way through angels and demons alike. The combat isn't really the best I've ever seen but its certainly very functional. The real treat is once you put a handful of hours into the game and have bulked up your character with gear and skills and talents, its a lot better and it just keeps getting better and better as you develop.Valdis looks great, its got rich detailed graphics and some great enemy/boss design. The music isn't anything too awesome, but it didn't leave me thinking it was bad at all... most games I'll just mute and play something else. It is really a shame there is zero voice acting, and I think it would of really pushed this game into that much more greatness.The story is probably a little short, but I'd like to ask you how long is Diablo 3's story? How long is Torchlight 2's? Or Zelda a link to the past, if you just play straight through the story and don't do anything else? With all of the hidden items to find, timed puzzles to solve, multiple difficulties and multiple characters, I don't really see Valdis' content being a negative for me. Not to mention the ""Coming soon"" free DLC/additions.All in all I'm very happy to recommend this game.			"

												This game truly is an accomplishment and it is shocking to me that it took a steam greenlight bid for it to get funded.  The short list of accomplishements are the combat which is fluid and entertaining, the fast pased gameplay, and the gorgious environments which I take to include the soundtrack.  This for me was not a game that sat in my steam library and never got played.  I turned it on, and started at hard mode, which privided just enough challenge to bring out the worst in me, but every challenge I faced was conquerable, it just actually required me to strategize, and plan ahead.  It has been a LONG time since a game made me think like this.  I also do want to comment on the level design.  Every stepping stone is well placed, and i've yet to find a single exploit or lack of flow.  Well done.Now for my very few qualms which are all things that can and hopefully will be added in later patches.    -The graphics in the game are all very intentionally low res, but if atleast some of the interface items could go up to 1080p level ppi that would be nice.  -The map system leaves something to be desired.  I would love to be able to zoom out and see how the different maps connect.  ( I realize now that I havent checked the manual to see if this option is hidden somewhere.)  -I debated on counting this as an opportunity, but the objectives are always a bit bland, and dont ovffer much guidance as to where to go next.  Right now I progress through just by finding doors I wasnt previously able to go through WHICH IS EXACTLY THE POINT!  I still however would enjoy some more sidequests, and maybe even mini games to break up the play style in between venturing out to obtain the next arbitrary artifact that we desperately need to solve this problem.This is longer than anyone will read, but  I still want to comend this game and its developers for sticking with the project, and focusing on getting the core game (which is vast) out in a beautiful way.  I cannot wait to see how the project expands.			"

												At first it seemed a little dull.. Story seems abit tardy, nothing spectacular about it. Gameplay on the other hand was quite fun! The characters movements were very fluid and it felt like i had real control. Also the mobs are pretty cool aswell, as they arent your regular ""im-going-to-attack-you-really-slowly"", some mobs can be really annoying and flat out hard in combination with others.Has some replay value as it is impossible to 100% the game in one playthrough.Overall entertaining and just a teeny bit addicting.

												Well finally we get the full release of the game or rather they added on the two extra characters as they had promised and added in some new content.  The two new characters are both cool and have some interesting gameplay mechanics that make them quite different from the first two characters the game launched with.  Their story starts from slightly different points as well, while I had hopped to find them in almost an entirely new story I didnt really expect it as this was an indie project, none the less the world is a colorful and fun to move around in as it ever was.  I have noticed several changes already while im playing through as vladyn, but I havent visited any of the new areas yet but im sure they are interesting.  This game stands above so many AAA titles its really a shame this game isnt getting the exposure much worse titles get.  Quality through and through, I hope we see more from endless fluff I hope we get to delve deeper into this world and see these stories resolve.  *old reveiw*Still in development but very fun game, great visuals, combat is fun and deep, theres a lot of upgrades you can do but unfortunately you wont be able to upgrade everything as there is a limit to resources so you have to make choices about what weapon to use and such.  All aside the game is challenging and fun, definitely recommend.			"

												This game is beautiful, with playing style reminiscent to the good old days, specifically Mega Man X.  The art is gorgeous and the story is fabulous.  While there are still kinks to work out it's a game that is deffinitely worth picking up.  The only issue that I've seen, is the boss battles, the bosses are extremely cheap using tactics that will drive you insane.  Other than that the game is full of fun hidden surprises and a crew that I'd love to see more of.  All I can hope is that the creators of this game can put out another that is as fascinating as this game, they'll have their work cut out for them.			"

												Well, if i take some time to write a message on a game, you can assume it's a good one.Valdis Story is one of the best game i have played so far, it's a side scrolling exploration platformer with an emphasis on intricate and rewarding combat as well as deep play style customization....Ok, ok i have to add that the story is interesting (maybe not the most original, but still), the graphics are gorgeous, and so is the chara-design.I just LOVE the music of this game, it is just ahhhhhh... Almost as acurate and magnificent as could be the soundtrack of secret of Mana.In short : Non-linear action Rpg with great possibility of builds, combos, magics, weapons, characters, accessories, loot, crafting, platforming skills + Awesome graph and sound !Don't hold back, this is something you have to try.

												I suppose I am not a true fan of the 2d Castlevania scroller, except the most recent one I played.  I haven't played the genre much, so this is coming from not a true fan I guess, because some of the things that I didn't like I'm sure a big time fan would love.The map system didn't show where objectives were.  Just played Dishonored where they give you markers as to where to go.  Much better design so you don't reach level cap like way early.Level cap at 20.  I really hated that, because it lowered the incentive to kill things.  The amount of time to figure out where the specific drops were, combined with no more experience progression, pretty much ensured the last boss would be nuts.That's the other thing I wanted to mention.  Bosses are insane.  You pretty much have to play over and over and over again to figure out how to beat it.  Real annoying.I could invest more time to figure out how to beat the last boss, but I'm done using my time to play this game, it just isn't worth it.			"

												You are WYATT. A member of a group of Warriors who happen to have their ship sunk by enemies unknown to man (at least the not the water that is) by word of the Goddess Valdys you are to regroup with other members of your crew and make way to the Goddess. Along the way you will encounter friends, Enemies, and even some wacky characters that may or maynot help you in your quest. But in this Exploration/Action Platformer you not just play as WYATT you also get to play as REINA. Both playstyles are drastically different and so are the powerups they both obtain into the game.The combat aspect of this game is so impressive that you do more time fighting then actually customizing your character on the fly. Can't beat a boss? Well all you have to do is switch up your tactics. If one way doesn't work. Another way always does.Each boss in this game has a pattern and even so you have nearly an unstoppable amount of raw power and energy at your deposal to wreck everything in your way...Go now.....The Goddess awaits with your mission.

												Valdis Story is a Metroidvania type of game, but one that couldn't hold my attention. I did find it infinitely better than Dust An Elysian Tail and that's saying something. Anyway, it's just that I didn't care for the characters. They came across as very dull.And the controls aren't quite what I expected, especially using and switching between magic proved to be frustrating and counterintuitive. The boss fights, on the other hand, were somewhat challenging and it's one of the things that I liked. Same goes for the combat.Navigating your way through the game is also kinda hard, since many of the cities you visit look similar to each other, and there are many different levels and ways to exit them. Add that one to my list of frustrating things as well.There's a decent game to be found here, but I just didn't find it all that exciting. I hope other people do enjoy it, because it deserves a little love. But, not from me.[Rating: 67/100]			"

												Severely broken controls, and bad mechanics that result in timed, meat boy difficulty, puzzles being screwed up as your character tries to cast a spell rather then charge crystals, or dash pounds fail to activate levers, cause, what could have been a great game, to be nothing more then an aggravating ""rage fest"". Combined with the fact that much of the game relies on these controls, for things such as ""s"" ranking prizes with little room for error, and for generally just getting around, it really comes off as a ""best of intentions concept,"" but a do not buy. Unless, of course, you have the calm state of a buddha. A shame as the art style and much of the game has the feel of a castelvania-ish 2d platformer that steam has a short supply of, and maybe, as they patch some of the issues, many of the issues (such as pound platforms not registering even when hit) will be fixed, but a large part of this game comes down to bad planning in both the control scheme and puzzle layouts.If however you enjoy games that offer a ""swearing inducing challenge"" due to split second, near inhuman reaction requirements and can put up with more then a few errors, then this may still be the game for you. But for the layman gamer? Run.For future designers of games, please remember, don't make dash ""press down, then forward"" and then also assign magic spells with a cast time to the same thing your going to link timed puzzle pushes too, that use the exact same button+movement, plus that self same dash one microsecond before hand.

												(I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off when I wrote this, but I can't say my opinion has changed)This game seems to have fun combat and platforming until you get stunlocked a million times. How could anyone say this game was designed so well? Enemies stunlock you all the god damned time in congested groups, or even just ONE of them. The jumping ""puzzles"" are overly precise and not really based on skill, seeing as I seem to get a different jump height every time I walljump. Plus, the wall spikes and such have massive hitboxes. The enemies will even stunlock you midair while platforming with ranged attacks, usually offscreen or too far away to hit. The bosses can go from super hard to super easy in a heartbeat, from one to the next. The Yeti is a prime example of that. Enemies are recycled CONSTANTLY. I don't seem to be doing anymore damage than before after leveling strength, or upgrading a weapon. The skill trees have some really lame filler skills that you have to buy or else you can't get the better stuff. A bunch of somewhat interesting characters are introduced, and then discarded from any importance immediately. You can miss some items because an area is blocked off. Platforming is not very fluid because a lot of it is based on grabbing ledges (Why is this a problem, you may ask? Platforming is a big focus for the game, and even IT is clunky and slow), and sometimes you don't grab ledges for no reason. Sometimes your character will stand completely still for no reason during combat (not stunned, possibly a glitch). The controls with a controller AND on keyboard are awful. Sometimes the character will swing more times than you press the button. Speaking of buttons, the hitbox for ground pound buttons doesn't even cover the whole button. Everything is a lame jumping puzzle and you end up having to fall down 20 times to get all the chests that they put under them. Sometimes these chests are anti-climactic, getting Cloth or something. Most armor pieces in the game are terrible and not worth getting or using. The camera is panned too high up, and too close to the player. Some artwork is WAY WORSE than others. Some bosses have weak attacks, and your attacks even weaker against them; this just ends up being grindy and boring. Blocking isn't very useful. The story lame and cliche. Farming isn't fun for upgrading, and never will be. Magic is overly weak.I think I sequence broke once or twice just by abusing wall jumps and ice pillars.On the upside, the graphics were nice, the combat was somewhat satisfying, and the music was great (albiet VERY LOUD in some spots compared to many others).Overall, this game is pretty okay, but extremely frustrating. I would not recommend this to anyone with anger issues, or standards for a good RPG. Disappointingly flawed, 55/100			"

My favorite traits of this title would be the constant urge to learn the patterns of a boss and the right time to dodge/block their attacks and the fact that you would need a certain weapon to fight other bosses (I wouldn't spoil the bosses though).If you want to play a game like the classic style Metroid or Castlevania games, I'd recommend this.

												To make this review simple and not too analytical, this game is fantastic. It is at times very, very frustrating, but it is a challenging game. You will eventually get past parts through trial and error and will have to push yourself to get better. I am glad I picked this up. There are some optional boss fights, so if it sometimes seems almost impossible, just level up some more or progress through the story and try later. Really, just don't give up on this game. I have rage quitted once, and have wanted to many times before but had not. Regardless I keep coming back to the game. The art design is wonderful and it is a pleasure to find new parts of the world. I don't see enough games like this. Pick it up if you are up for a challenging adventure with many bosses.			"

Very difficult optional bosses to complete. Intereting storyline.Cons: Developers have been taking a very long time to release to last 2 characters to the story. They promised these when the game was released in 2013. A year later, neither have been released. Relatively short game.I would definitely suggest this game to anyone on the edge about it. Really fun combat, interesting storyline, great soundtrack. And although the developers have been taking a while to release the last 2 characters to the story, it's still a great play.			"

The replayability is on point with the first Dark Souls as not only the classes and play styles can drastically vary with each playthrough, but the characters own version of events, so to speak, is portrayed in the main story. This combined with the plenty of optional content and upgrades makes this game a steal of a deal! Give these devs your money!			"

												I will say this on the matter: of you thought Metroid needed more of a collect-em-all feel, or if you wanted the metroid feel with a sword, then do not hesitate to grab this game.My gripes:-Momentum is not maintained between rooms.  When you run into a new room, if you're just holding down the direction, you will just stand at the entrance to the new room until you re-register your movement.  (I think they hard-coded a room entrance with a wall jump, just to make it not immediately drop you...)-High level boss trigger items are available as craftable items, but don't have optional triggers.  This being said, a difficult boss may very well be standing between me and my next objective.-Low-level bosses sometimes de-spawn when doing other stuff in the story line.  I was looking forward to trashing one specific boss, only to find the room totally empty when I arrived again later.If you can stand my gripes, fire away at what (in my opinion) feels like the younger brother to Dust: An Elysian Tail.

												I originally gave this game a positive recommendation, citing its beautiful visuals and fun gameplay. That review was actually based on my time playing it on a mid-range Windows 7 laptop. This review is from my re-download on a gaming desktop.This game has the potential to be a really great Metroidvania. It's hampered, however, by horrendous performance issues. The framerate is unbearable, with constant slowdowns and overall sluggishness. My computer isn't top of the line, but I have an AMD FX-6300, a Radeon R9 290x, and 16 GB of memory. There's no reason for this slowdown other than terrible optimization.I WANT to recommend this game a LOT. Theoretically, I love it. But the chugging framerate renders it unplayable, and the best suggestion I've seen in the forums is to edit your registry. When your customers have to edit their registry to try to get your game to work right, you've done something wrong.If the performance issues are ever fixed, I'll wholeheartedly recommend this game. Until then, avoid it, even on sale.			"

												There are times when small production games surpass large budget behemoths.Valdis Story: Abyssal City, is one of those games. It all seems very simple at first, until you start getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you.  Personally I bought this game around release, and did not like it.  After reading rave reviews I decided to give it another chance, and was pleasantly suprised at how good the game actually is.  This game is megaman, ninja gaiden, shinobi, metroid, and castlevania all rolled into one tight little package.  The game can immediatly be picked up and played by anyone, but it takes quite a while, and some good hand\eye coordination to master.  The OST produced by Zack Parish (spelling?) Is fantastic, with driving boss battles themes and interesting level music.  The item system is also pretty decent, allowing you to upgrade your weapons and armor throughout the game, coupled with the skill\stat system and this game has a nice sense of character progression.I am sure I am not alone when I say, I hope Valdis Story does not end with Abyssal City.  Game is worth every penny, buy now! "

												Valdis Story is a game that starts out with a lot of promise. Starting the game up it has great music, fun combat but as you progress the game will wear in you and it'll come slowly likely as it did for me. The combat is fun, you get a lot of cool moves, magic, abilities and even new weapons that change how cobat works. Platforming starts off fun till you get the ability to ""move cancel"" or as we all know it as, dash. Sounds cool right? It does, lets you dash through enemies or their skills allowing for some cool tricks. Problem is there's no dash button. You hit diagona/ down or down and you dash or shoot straight down. Now if that sounds like it'll lead you to frustrating falls, no that's not even the end of it. You'll often dash straight down and end up in another area or 3 floors down having to back track back up becaues they couldn't have the common sense to have a dedicated dash button. This aspect is only made more glaring when they demand precision out of you from a control scheme that I feel like would have benifited from a dash button. Heck you get a double jump later that requires you to hold R2 and hit up. Why not just jump again?  Also, there's an area map, but no overworld/world map, so you'll need to look one up online and alt+tab between game and steam overlay to navigate. To make matters more frustrating, there's no floors you can jump through or ladders, so backtracking often means you need to go very round-about ways or just needlessly specific to go somewhere. Making even towns simply a chore to navigate; which isn't helped by having 2 paths that end in the same spot but one they block off with a gate for no reason leaving you to walk all the way down your path and then go all the way around because you can't pass through floors like in other metroid/castlevania games. They do this a lot too, they TROLL you with this crap where you'll try and make a jump and OOPS there were spikes now you've fallen 3 floors and gotta back track. Or they'll spawn infuritating enemies that lock rooms and force you to fight that respawn; meaning every time you want to go through you need to fight these things that will drag out the fights with shields  and what not. I don't like having to say any of this, because the game is beautiful it has a lot going for it in combat and boss fights and even an amusing story with a cool world to explore. But when you're spending a lot of the game fighting controls, absolutely NEEDLESS padding where a ladder and being able to pass through floors would have made a frustrating 20 minutes not have to happen. The padding even extends to bosses where they will have shields over their health ...and moves to recover chunks of their health. The game IS good, it's fun and has a lot of stuff that you should try if you like ""metroidvania style"" games where you explore and fight. Just if you do intend on playing this know that you'll need to deal with excessively frustrating controls that it feels like the devs did on purpose or were trying to avoid controlling like other games. I enjoyed the game but if I wasn't switching off with my cousin while playing...I'm not sure I would have beaten the game. Other perks are 4 playable characters with a leveling system that lets you choose how to play, a awesome sound track, plenty of bosses, a nice diverse cast and pretty art. It's a mixed bag, I DO  recommend this game, however there's a giant paragraph of fine print of: Recomended: if you can deal with dodgy controls and excessive and needless padding.			"

												I heartily recommend this gem of a game. The soundtrack is very good, the combat is exciting and challenging and the character and environment design is excellent. It should be noted that some platforming sections can be very frustrating, and it is very helpful to keep your own map as the game will only display the map for the region you're in.In conclusion; For me, this is one of the best games in its genre. Note; I know it says 18 minutes or something playtime in my profile, but I bought it on GOG first, where it doesn't record playtime.			"

												This is one heck of a game. It was on the one hand unbelievably frustrating, but on the other hand it was an absolute blast! This is much closer to an old school SNES or NES metroidvania style game than anything else, and on top of that the game can be pretty brutal. I played through my first time going for the bare essentials achievement. It wasn't all that easy for me, but I never felt that it was unfair. And that's the most important part.This game isn't complete at the time of writing this review, but that doesn't stop it from being very fun. I like the style of the characters and world, and the game play is wonderful. There were a couple of times where I had to just get up and walk away for awhile because a boss was just beating me into submission, but I knew it had most to do with my own in ability to dodge or block at the correct time. In the end that just mad me want to learn to play the game better, and that's a mark of a well made game.One thing that is frustrating right now is that there are portions of the game that say that they're coming soon or are clearly not implimented. It'll be fun to see what this game will be like when it is finally complete. I'm especially interested in the two unavailable characters. The other thing is that this game isn't very strong on plot. Really though, that's not too bad for a game like this since most of the plot is just an excuse for opening more places to explore.There are a couple of gripes that I have with this game. I'm not sure if these will be features in the final game, but they are sorely lacking. One is definitely that there needs to be an update to the map system. It helps show some handy things, like where save points are, but it really needs two additional features. One is that it should list what crew members and how many treasure boxes are in each area and how many I've found. I really felt like I was wandering blind and ended up missing two treasures. Two, that's frustrating. Sure I could look them up on the net, but that's still annoying. The other thing is that there are enemies that stun lock far too much. I'm specifically thinking about the spider mini boss and the ice ferrals. When those things were in the room I usually ended up losing a health potion. Heck there were ice ferrals with some mini bosses and full bosses and they were usually more frustrating than the boss themselves. Even if there was a good way to quickly recover from stun that would be nice.That aside this game was a blast. I admit my frustrations largely come from doing the bare essentials run with the monk on my first go. Even through the frustration I found myself feeling great whenever I would pull of a combo or finally defeat the boss I was stuck on. If you're looking for a fun challenge definitely give this game a go!			"

												Valdis Story is a game that starts out with a lot of promise. Starting the game up it has great music, fun combat but as you progress the game will wear in you and it'll come slowly likely as it did for me. The combat is fun, you get a lot of cool moves, magic, abilities and even new weapons that change how cobat works. Platforming starts off fun till you get the ability to ""move cancel"" or as we all know it as, dash. Sounds cool right? It does, lets you dash through enemies or their skills allowing for some cool tricks. Problem is there's no dash button. You hit diagona/ down or down and you dash or shoot straight down. Now if that sounds like it'll lead you to frustrating falls, no that's not even the end of it. You'll often dash straight down and end up in another area or 3 floors down having to back track back up becaues they couldn't have the common sense to have a dedicated dash button. This aspect is only made more glaring when they demand precision out of you from a control scheme that I feel like would have benifited from a dash button. Heck you get a double jump later that requires you to hold R2 and hit up. Why not just jump again?  Also, there's an area map, but no overworld/world map, so you'll need to look one up online and alt+tab between game and steam overlay to navigate. To make matters more frustrating, there's no floors you can jump through or ladders, so backtracking often means you need to go very round-about ways or just needlessly specific to go somewhere. Making even towns simply a chore to navigate; which isn't helped by having 2 paths that end in the same spot but one they block off with a gate for no reason leaving you to walk all the way down your path and then go all the way around because you can't pass through floors like in other metroid/castlevania games. They do this a lot too, they TROLL you with this crap where you'll try and make a jump and OOPS there were spikes now you've fallen 3 floors and gotta back track. Or they'll spawn infuritating enemies that lock rooms and force you to fight that respawn; meaning every time you want to go through you need to fight these things that will drag out the fights with shields  and what not. I don't like having to say any of this, because the game is beautiful it has a lot going for it in combat and boss fights and even an amusing story with a cool world to explore.

												I'll keep this short and sweet. Valdis Story is a fun game, but the combat system is more complicated than it appears to be at first glance. This isn't a bad thing at all, but the game isn't quite done yet, so I've not yet put much time into it. Once the other characters are fully playable, I will definitely be coming back to this and putting forth the effort that this game demands and deserves from myself and others. You should check it out, for sure.			"

												Got through my first playthrough and I love this game. Gorgeous art style with great animations. Combat is very repsonsive and customizable, with lots of varieties for different situations. Talent and skill points further add to the replay value. Even at full price this is some of the best money I have spent with a game. This is a Kickstarter and Greenlight game done right. My only gripe was that the movement is geared more for combat than platforming, which made some of the platforming puzzles harder than it should have been, due to having to correct for touchy movement and falling off a ledge. All to do it again.Excellent game, worth the money. If you are a fan of the Metroidvania genre why haven't you got this yet???			"

												I'm not a guy who usually likes platformer style games. I only bought this because it was on sale and kinda looked cool. Well, now I'm not sure how glad I am I got it. Let me put it this way: this an awesome game that will invariably cause you more irritation than poison ivy. What I mean by that is the difficulty level is insane. For every enemy, even some of the most basic ones, you have to learn their attack patterns and know how NOT to attack them. Then, the bosses. Every single boss in this game will kill you. Many times. For example, there is one fire boss who is almost impossible to beat without perfect timing. I died so many times to him, but when I finally finished him off, it was more rewarding than almost any game. Plus, the combat systems is remarkably cool and easy to use. The system to swap out what spells you use on the fly is a little  annoying, but since it pauses the game for you to do that it isn't a major pain. Overall though, if you have ever played a Metroidvania style game, you know in general terms how to play this. The biggest problem I have with this game is lack of direction. You're told to go somewhere and what direction it's in but nothing more. Since this is a 2d sidescoller, that seems like it would be easy, right? Well, there are so many locked doors and passageways that over time you are able to unlock that it becomes a little difficult to find the right path. However, these same locked doors  give you a reason to return once you have the keys for these locations. But then, the problem of remembering where you've already been occurs, since there is little indication of that except perhaps an opened door. Once you play for a few hours though you start to learn what takes you where, until you find the next new place to go. It's not as bad as it seems from me, but again, this is a true Metroidvania title with a hint of RPG. If you enjoy finding those little pieces of loot hidden at the end of an incredibly difficult platforming puzzle or a speed trap, or even behind a locked door at the very beginning of the game after most of the game has been completed, not to mention cool stuff from the bosses, play the game to see what they drop. Thus, this game is a Dark Souls difficuly mixed with Metroidvania loot acquirement. Plus awesome combat, which I can't really talk about without giving away a little too much. So, if this sounds like a game you're not interested in, think again. No matter how I look at it, this is one of the overlooked gems of the Greenlight program.			"

												Valdis Story was my hidden gem of 2013.  I picked up the game cause I saw the video roll and just really liked the art style but OMG, the game really brought me back to the good old days of Metroid (back when it was still a 2D side scroller).  I played through and enjoyed it so much,  I played through again with a different build cause the first play through, I hardly used any offensive magic at all and found it was even better and super different than the first play through.  I even ran through as the second alternate character too which has very different combat style.  The amazing thing was that additional content for the game was being developed and changed while I was playing through it.  Basically, during the later play through, and additional final boss was added and other little minibosses were added!  It was like getting DLC as surprise presents!  After those play through,  I'm now waiting for more additional content cause it looks like 2 additional playable characters could be added.  Seems like it will be a while but that's ok cause it'll give me time away from the game to enjoy it even more the next time I get back to it :-D.			"

												Excellent game. Combat is as simple or complicated as you want to make it allowing for playability by a wide range of skill levels, and multiple difficulties offer added challenge for those who want it. Multiple characters with differing fighting styles and their own multiple versions of the storyline (2 so far with 2 more forthcoming) add replayability, which is quite welcome as the game is a little short. The story, setting, and lore are very entertaining, and will only improve as the rest of the content is added. Overall, the game is quite good, and I do recommend it. But only if you have a good controller. And make sure to read the manual on the game's page in your library as there is much that the game itself doesn't explain. I give it a 4...out of 5.			"

												I mean it's an alright game. Everything works, no major glitches/issues throughout, and it's definitely well-polished. It has major issues in terms of gameplay though. Some of the puzzles can be really obtuse or just incredibly difficult, and there's a bizarre power spike in enemies in the middle of the game that makes everything extremely hard very suddenly and very briefly. The game's mechanics didn't really make it feel new or interesting, and there isn't a lot of innovation which is not good for a metroidvania game--there are many other options that have more innovative concepts and are much more fun. That's the biggest problem; it just isn't that fun. I'd just so much rather be playing any castlevania game or super metroid instead of this. Not that it's bad, it just isn't good enough. And in a market where 5 dollars can get you TES: Oblivion or The Binding of Isaac there's not a whole lot of reason to add this one to your library, unless you want to get the trading cards that badly.Avoid this game unless you can get it for less than $2: I spent $3.75 on it and was stil unsatisfied.

												I'm writing this review right after finishing the game for the first time.Metroid, Castlevania, Devil May Cry, Megaman...  If any of those names fill you with fond memories of wanting to throw your conroller at the screen (as opposed to unfond memories of wanting to throw your controller at the screen), then you need to play this game.Valdis Story has elements from all of them, but most reminds me of the original Castlevania: Symphony of the Night on Playstation.  If we're honest, the whole game is probably much smaller, but it is absolutely beautiful.  Many of the exploration elements are very similar, certain areas requiring you to have specific items or abilities before you can access them.  A new twist are timed platforming segments, wherein you have to hit a switch and then traverse the necessary route before the door you opened closes again.  Many of them demand a great deal of precision, which can be quite frustrating at first, until you get the knack.The combat system is fairly deep, combining weapon combos with spells and dodge-cancels.  I've seen less complex combat from games that were supposed to be primarily brawlers.  And you will need to make the most of all of them when you meet the game's bosses.  There's no overpowering a boss through sheer button-mashing prowess.  You'll need to pay attention and attack, defend or run away at the right time.If you enjoy games that demand precision, practice and determination on the part of the player, then Valdis Story will deliver in spades.

												Valdis Story is a prime time 2D action game.If you were ever in love in Castlevania/Mertroid games, this is definanetly something to you. GRAPHICS: Graphics are up to date and well-made. I would like to make a distinction between strictly technical performance of the graphics and the overall feeling: sprites are not full HD and this might feel lackluster when you played modern Rayman games or Dust:Elysian Trail, however overall design is top notch from the artistical point of view. 8/10MUSIC: Slashing sounds of destruction are done well and I really enjoyed them - during the whole game they did not tired me, and that's a lot. Music keeps up and gives some nostalgic vibe when it's necessary, pumps up during the fights and keeps you on your toes. 8/10STORY: It's good. You are exploring remnants of the city that is lost in time and space. It might feel somehow lackluster, especially when you compare it to other aspects of the game but the game is not about story all that much. Still, I would say that it's better than in any other game of that type I had ever played. 7.5/10 Only because it still has huge potential and I feel I want more.GAMEPLAY: It is basically a 2d action game similar to Castlevania series. You fool around the map, find the new places you can go and explore. You fight, pick up goodies, fight again, go back to town, pump up your skills/lvls/items, rinse and repeat. The game is all about nimble fingers and fast decisions, fighting is the real name of the game and it's core difficulity lies in action. This is where the game really excels and broke me into pieces. You have passive trees that let's you decide wether you want to be magic wielder, relentless sword fighter or unkillable juggernaut - and believe me, they are not just a ball of stats but they force different playstyle. The same goes for armor you can wear. It does not only give you different stats, it also alters the way your character behaves. Did I mentioned that different weapons behave completely different as well? Giuve oyu different animations, attacks and such. Side note: you can play unarmed as well and it is a viable option. On top of that, there are currently TWO different characters that can be played, gameplay experience differs DRASTICALLY. Did I mentioned about assistants that can be summoned any time during the brawl? Well, I just did. Amount of complete builds, gamestyles and possibilities just makes your head spin. 10/10 all the way.FLAWS: It might feel ... short? I am not sure. I really liked the game, it sucked me in and I played until I finished. It took me about ~18h and I really, really wanted more. Experience was really intense, I wouldn't mind if it would take a little bit longer.Valdis Story is still under poroduction and it takes a lot of time. Game is totally playable in it's current state and gives full experience, yet the polishing takes a really long time and if you expect update every week you will get dissapointed.Still only two from total of four characters is playable. Don't get me wrong - in one character there is more depth than in any other Mertroidvania games I have ever played, still I would really like to see the 3rd and 4th character being playable.Overall I do not feel like giving the final score, it's really up to you wether you will like it. If you ever enjoyed any 2d action game - you will be happy. If you are additionally an action RPG junkie trust me, you will love it.			"

All to do it again.Excellent game, worth the money. If you are a fan of the Metroidvania genre why haven't you got this yet???			"

												As a Kickstarter backer, I have been looking forward to this game for some time.But heres 5 reasons why you should play it.1) Genuinely difficult. One of those Challenging and Rewarding game that Addicts you right from the Get go.2) Fantastic Soundtrack. Seriously, I spent 10 minutes just listening to the menu screen. Its that good.3) Beautifully Designed dungeons, scenery and character Sprites. A colorful and dramatic landscape that is a joy to explore.4) Fast paced Metroidvania style combat system that uses a variety of spells, upgrades, equipment and weapons. The system flows well and grants remarkable variety in play style. And I've only played one of the 2 unique characters so far...5) It features a Panda with a magic Cannon on its back as a summonable ally. That is all XP			"

												From me this would come highly recommended, its Avatar The Last Airbender meets classical platformer games with good story, rpg elements, rough fighter action, and a constant flow of events.  The only negative thing I would say about it is that, there is no multiplayer which is fine, but there is no coop which is not as fun.			"

												Pros: Great soundtrack. Seriously, it's fantastic. Different characters, each with a different playstyle. 3 different skill trees to choose from. Allows variation between playthroughs. Very difficult optional bosses to complete. Intereting storyline.Cons: Developers have been taking a very long time to release to last 2 characters to the story. They promised these when the game was released in 2013. A year later, neither have been released. Relatively short game.I would definitely suggest this game to anyone on the edge about it. Really fun combat, interesting storyline, great soundtrack. And although the developers have been taking a while to release the last 2 characters to the story, it's still a great play.			"

They pretty much took everything that I liked about the Castlevania series and made it into a game. Music is phenominal Combat is challenging Optional Encounters Beastiary C-C-Combos Puzzles! Puzzles everywhere! Crafting/upgrading Spells Stat/Skill Tree Sidekicks Equip ""X"" weapon for ""X"" Playstyle --Many different ways to play the game. Secrets Collectibles 4 Playable characters Supports NG+ Atmospheric each level has a theme to it (Lighthearted when it needs to be, dark and creepy when it has to be.)  The combat is really fun it pulled me in very quickly, lots of secrets to explore and ""optional"" bosses to fight.  You start with 2 characters to play as whom have a bit different playstyles; a male with a sword (Wyatt) and a female monk/mage (Reina)  after you beat the game once you unlock two more characters with other playstyles still. Game works flawlessly with a controller (I recommend playing with one.)10/10 I bought it on sale and I almost wish I hadn't,  these guys deserve more money than what I spent; this game is that good.  Probably one of the best purchases i've made on steam and just a real pleasure to play.  Does anyone else know where I can find more games like this?  :)			"

												Valdis Story is gorgeous, has an awesome soundtrack, and features combat similar to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and Devil May Cry. The world is laid out in a similar way to Super Metroid, with many atmospheric and highly stylized zones to explore. You can sink many hours into this game, since Valdis Story encourages you to do multiple playthroughs. Each character's playstyle is different, which creates a unique experience each time. For completionists, God Slayer difficulty is a genuine challenge, especially if you're trying to get ""S Rank"" during each of the boss encounters. Not an easy task, because boss difficulty ranges from total pushover to insanely tough. Similar to Diablo's skill tree system, each character has three unique skill trees, featuring unlockable special moves and bonuses. You earn stat points as you level up, and your character has a primary stat which they're built around. Fortunately, you can also respec your character's skills by visiting a vendor (Mesmer), which I felt was a nice touch. You won't get locked into one skill tree.Playing as Vladyn (unlockable character):Vladyn's arsenal of guns provides long range attacks, and his summonable minions will jump straight into combat, while absorbing tons of damage. Unlike some of the melee characters, Vladyn can rack up gigantic combos from across the screen, especially with his Long Gun (Rifle) and Doombringer (Launcher). He's a hell of a lot of fun! You can unlock him by finishing the game once, along with Gilda (heavy magic user).Critique:My one complaint about Valdis story has to do with its jumping puzzles and level designs, which can lead to frustrating situations and/or deaths. Sometimes, your character is knocked off a ledge by an enemy, and you'll fall multiple floors back towards the start of the area. On other occasions, you'll just barely get grazed by enemies who cast status effect spells (Fire, Poison, Lightning), and your character ""locks up"" temporarily, and becomes stunned. Thankfully, even if you die, Save Points are fairly common.On harder difficulties, you'll get punished for not blocking or evading enemy attacks. Getting hit multiple times can absolutely mess up your timing, and it'll also result in you dying very quicky. In this way, Valdis Story plays a bit like a fighting game. Practice blocking and Skill Canceling, and you'll be good to go, even against some of the scarier bosses. It's a good idea to purchase armor/trinkets which reduce/nullify status effects. Thankfully, the Paladin Armor and Armor of the Grey Knight provide status immunities. Equipping powerful weapons and items can make all the difference in this game.Arena mode (NEW!)The newly updated version of the game (featuring Arena mode) adds a new dimension to Valdis Story, and it's also perfect for testing different builds of each character. Arena mode is tough, and you'll find yourself facing multiple bosses all at once. Good luck, you'll need it.Final Score: 9/10			"

Overall, the game is almost perfect, save a few minor flaws.  The game can be challenging at times, but it's nice to see a game that requires actual skill over random button-mashing.  I highly recommend this to any fans of the GBA/DS Castlevania games.			"

												Valdis Story is any metroidvania fans wet dream. The story is excellent, the combat is superb, and the art style and animations are a great throw back. The replayability is on point with the first Dark Souls as not only the classes and play styles can drastically vary with each playthrough, but the characters own version of events, so to speak, is portrayed in the main story. This combined with the plenty of optional content and upgrades makes this game a steal of a deal! Give these devs your money!			"

												Hands down the most charming and one of the most entertaining, Metroidvania games I've played, easily the best on steam. Cutsey art style belies the very deep fantasy story. The anime/fighting game inspired combat takes some learning but is compelling, entertaining and combined with the challenging platforming drives the story. And the story, so well told! Similar to dark souls uncovering the story requires the player to invest time into gathering items, lore and engaging in dialogue but the complete picture is well worth it. The AI is really strong providing a challenge at all levels, scaling really cleverly into the late game and higher difficulty settings. The music is incredible sometimes a serene wailing as you explore derelict masoleum corridors, other times an exciting score as you face down a giant deity determined to end you. Add to that an evolving game world, great twists and tonnes of replayability, you have a truly great gaming experience. If there was a co-op mode @.@, too awesome to even hope for			"

												You see that this comes recommended, so let's just cut to the chase. There are things I hate about this game. Don't get me wrong, I S-ranked this game on the hardest difficulty. I just don't want people to buy it, and then discover that they actually hate it. So I'm going to focus on the negatives after breezing through the good stuff.The good stuff:- tight controls- great combat- setting (music and art) looks very good- great boss fights- good nostalgic feel (if you like retro games, then you'll like this)- characters and enemies are designed wellFirst of all, this game is hard. But it's not the feel-good Mega Man 9 kind of hard. There are times when I hit a snag in a boss fight or a tricky platforming segment and it just feels unfairly difficult. One of the reasons for this is that your character has no invincibility frames. This means that you'll get combo'd really hard sometimes, where you'll find yourself at full health one second, and zero the next (I'm not sure if they changed this or not, but there was this one stupid enemy that was capable of stun-locking you. What the heck is that all about, seriously?).The story, in my opinion, had a lot of potential, but I was really annoyed about all the forced tropes and forced ""fantasy"" names to things; they don't sound like natural words to me. Plus, all the characters are, to avoid spoilers, ""special"" in some way, as if it's wrong to have some sort of normal main character. IIRC, one character is the last living member of an ancient civilization, one character is the daughter of a god, one guy is half-angel-half-demon or something, one is the only half-dragon or something?. What I did like was the premise. I really like the demons and angels warring against each other, and that neither side was right in the eyes of the main characters. The premise was good, the characters, not so much.Lastly, this game has retro roots. Because of that, it does feel dated. Things like not having enough clues to tell you where to go next, or clues that only appear once, or sidequests that don't give you enough information feel dated compared to newer games. While this isn't much of a problem for some gamers, it's a problem for most. People are lying if they say that they never had any struggles with lack of direction with games like this one.It still comes recommended, but as long as you're okay with VERY cliched characters, sometimes BROKEN gameplay, and potentially being LOST, then go for it. But if you're down for some retro gaming style, then go for it anyway.			"

It quickly became my favorite, even before the amazing update. Tight rewarding combat system, good story that doesn't take away from the action, and a great leveling system as well. Collectibles, upgradable weapons and armor, everything you would ask for in a Metroidvania style game. Oh, and not to mention the music! By far some of the best video game music, at least for me, since Chrono Trigger.So much more I could say, but I'm sure many other people can say it better.This is on the Humble bundle weekly sale, which prompted me to write this comment.

												It's a metroidvania with bullet hell style bosses and a crappy map. This means some of the bosses (and certain combinations of enemies) are very difficult to fight, and exploration is tedious.That said, it's still a good overall experience. If you enjoy your first playthrough, there are several optional bosses and alternate characters you can play with. This is a game I'd probably give closer to a mediocre review if steam let me, but if I have to pick yes or no...I'd pick yes. But only if you're starved for a solid metroidvania experience.			"

												Fantastic metroidvania/brawler style game.  Definitely one of the best I've played.  Combat is very rewarding, level design and art is great throughout, and bosses are very well put together.  Bosses also have a rating system, and a rather forgiving retry system (it hurts your rating to restart a boss fight - but ratings have a very slight affect on the game, and it is really only their as a slight punishment - I thought this was a fantastic compromise between challenge and hand-holding).Honestly my only critique is the games platforming sections.  While controls feel great for combat - I had a harder time when trying to navigate tiny floating platforms.  It feels almost as if there is a slight input delay - that lends itself well to the combo based combat, but not so to navigating an obstacle course. "

												Best indie adventure game I have ever played. The stroy was amazing, the art is fatastic. Don't even get me started on the game play. Its nice, with fluid combos. I loved the DnD feel it had to it when upgrading! It was really challenging; at one point i thought of Ninja Gaiden 2...its not that level hard all the time, just on some of the boss fights...a lot of them. The enemies level with you so to speak. When returning to an area in the begining, I was surprised when they were doing different moves and it took a little more damage to kill them.The only real ""bad"" thing I hated about this was when you reach an area border, you have to re-click the direction you were going most of the time. That part was really anoying when you are jumping into a different area. I didn't have to do it all the time though which was strange, but any time I really needed to keep moving forward after a screen change (time limmet parts), it happend. This is going into my all time favorite games for sure. I recomend this to everyone. I didn't know my life was missing something until I played this game.			"

												An excellent metroidvania type game that has a few flaws but is overall a great experience with plenty of replay value. I strongly recommend it if you are a fan of the genre. The leveling caps at 20 which came as a surprise but it is possible to respec stats with a hidden npc. Gameplay:Fighting system:The fighting system takes a few pages from ""spectacle fighters"". The combo system features light and heavy attacks, juggles, aerial attacks, spells, assist characters, focus mode and focus mode finishers, blocking, parrying and skill canceling that enables you to dodge and/or continue to most of the available actions. It works really well for the most part, but mixing spells into the fight is sometimes bit of a challenge. Spells are activated by pressing a spell button and then a direction to activate the chosen spell or just pressing in the air to use the aerial spell, which works pretty well in most situations, but the focus mode is also activated by pressing the spell button and then light attack, which makes it pretty easy to activate by accident. It is also bound to a trigger on 360 controller by default and personally i'd prefer it being in a face button, but that makes activating focus mode insanely awkward.Exploration:Game features the standard style of metroidvania maps, each area has its separate map that shows if the room has a locked door and what type of lock it is, which rooms connect, the basic stuff. Exploration is rewarded with new armors, materials and crew members that can teach you focus skills, assist, strenghten spells or craft 2 of the 4 available  weapons. Different characters get different weapons and have different starting spells that are unique to characters. Most of the areas are locked until you get equipment and spells that allow further exploration and it has a good feel as there are lots of things to find. Most of the armors are locked in a kind of platform challenge rooms and here the game stumbles a little as the platforming aspect has some issues. The control feels a bit floaty and its easy to overshoot your target, there are also some issues with collision detection as it's difficult to jump to narrow corridors and sometimes it feels that the landing is a little slippery. The character can grab a ledge if you press towards it, and will climb up if you press up and it is very sensitive. If you press away from the ledge you're hanging from, the character jumps. There are a few parts where you have to do that quickly and it's easy to mess up.The game has a few timed events that can be missed and they have various effects to the gameworldVisuals:The animation and spriteart is simply beautiful. It is simple enough that you can see what happens on screen and detailed enough to still look very good. There is a decent variety of environments and each has their own identity. Some bosses look simply amazing. Character portraits and cutscenes/storyboards are heavily stylized but personally i feel they are weakest part of the art.Audio:The music is really beautiful and fits the overall aesthetic and situations really well. Sound effects wary from good to irritating, there are few sound effects that just sound bad, but for the most part, they are serviceable.The story:The game begins by the protagonist falling from the sky into a forgotten land. where he finds demons, angels and ferals fighting and a tribe of humans trying to survive. The humans who live in this land have white hair for undisclosed reason and they distrust the protagonist who they fear could be a demon or angel because the protagonists hair is not white. It sounds better in the game. From there on the player must earn their trust by helping them survive and also try to find his/her crew that fell in different places in this land. The game fills in backstory as it progresses and it's allright, but not very memorable.Enemy and boss designs:There is a decent variety of enemies that have distinct behaviours and they encourage and sometimes require player to use different tactics like prioritizing to a larger enemy that can resurrect smaller enemies, breaking shields with magical attacks or dashing through a tanking enemy with invulnerable shield. They are pretty easy when fought alone but can be tricky in groups.Bosses are for the most part unique and have different abilities, there are a few humanoids that have player like abilities, but most bosses behave very differently from player character. Almost all bosses become stronger the lower health they get to and you need different strategies to survive. The end result is ranked and if you did well enough you get a stat boost. Some bosses have gimmicks like healing or needing to damage different parts in predetermined order and they are, for the most part interesting. I have to give a mention for the final boss however as it is not very fun. If you have not prepared well enough, it can became an endless dps race against it's healing ability and your ability to deal damage as there is only a set amount of damage you can deal during the phase it is vulnerable. It is a cycle of trying to activate the damaging phase by damaging it's shield while the boss tries to heal, if the boss heals it repairs the shield nullifying the progress toward the damaging phase. The boss looks epic but can be very frustrating to fight with.			"

												Valdis Story is a solid, metroidvania RPG with fast enjoyable combat that, while short, offers plenty of replayability and room for exploration. Valdis Story is probably one of the best of it's genre that I have played, so I would recommend giving it a chance. TLDR at the bottom, for those who aren't looking for the specifics.Valdis Story has tight melee centric, fighter-esque gameplay, uncharacteristic of what you might expect of the genre. There are 2 basic attack buttons, light and heavy, as well as a button toggle for magic with several directional options to change which spell you are using, and assist characters who can help you chain combos together or provide useful secondary effects. Skill cancels (dodges) and parries become available later on for the purpose of damage mitigation or as additional offensive tools. Combat is easy to learn and hard to master, with grades awarded based on performance on boss fights and numerous rewards for good play.Valdis Story has two characters, Wyatt and Reina, who both have 3 different weapons each (not including barehanded combat) and several supported playstyles and builds each, based on 4 stats. (Luck, Str, Agi, Int) Each character has 3 different skill trees that you can use to customize the character to your gear and intended playstyle. Wyatt is a very straightforward fighter that can be anywhere from a pure brawler, to an assassin or a spellsword. Reina is a bit faster and weaker than Wyatt, and has to rely more on combinations of magic and attacks early on but can later become anywhere from a powerful mage, to a lightning fast brawler lategame.Valdis Story is also an rpg as much as it is a metroidvania, there are many pieces of interesting gear scattered around behind unforgiving timed puzzles that you may end up running through the game a few times to try incorporating into a new build. Some cons to the game are that it is perhaps a little melee centric, that some bosses and timed puzzles are rather unforgiving on your first or second time around and that there is no world map, though like Dark Souls the world is small and interconnected and you will eventually memorize where everything is.While not relevant at the time of this review, there are two characters planned to be released later which may extend the lifetime of this game later on. I also feel that it would be selling the game short to not mention the excellent soundtrack it has going for it.TLDR: I strongly recommend you play this game if you are a perfectionist, or enjoy metroidvanias. You would really be doing yourself a disservice to pass on this game if you like either of it's main genres.			"

												An excellent metroidvania type game that has a few flaws but is overall a great experience with plenty of replay value. I strongly recommend it if you are a fan of the genre. The leveling caps at 20 which came as a surprise but it is possible to respec stats with a hidden npc. Gameplay:Fighting system:The fighting system takes a few pages from ""spectacle fighters"". The combo system features light and heavy attacks, juggles, aerial attacks, spells, assist characters, focus mode and focus mode finishers, blocking, parrying and skill canceling that enables you to dodge and/or continue to most of the available actions. It works really well for the most part, but mixing spells into the fight is sometimes bit of a challenge. Spells are activated by pressing a spell button and then a direction to activate the chosen spell or just pressing in the air to use the aerial spell, which works pretty well in most situations, but the focus mode is also activated by pressing the spell button and then light attack, which makes it pretty easy to activate by accident. It is also bound to a trigger on 360 controller by default and personally i'd prefer it being in a face button, but that makes activating focus mode insanely awkward.Exploration:Game features the standard style of metroidvania maps, each area has its separate map that shows if the room has a locked door and what type of lock it is, which rooms connect, the basic stuff. Exploration is rewarded with new armors, materials and crew members that can teach you focus skills, assist, strenghten spells or craft 2 of the 4 available  weapons. Different characters get different weapons and have different starting spells that are unique to characters. Most of the areas are locked until you get equipment and spells that allow further exploration and it has a good feel as there are lots of things to find. Most of the armors are locked in a kind of platform challenge rooms and here the game stumbles a little as the platforming aspect has some issues. The control feels a bit floaty and its easy to overshoot your target, there are also some issues with collision detection as it's difficult to jump to narrow corridors and sometimes it feels that the landing is a little slippery.

												Best indie adventure game I have ever played. The stroy was amazing, the art is fatastic. Don't even get me started on the game play. Its nice, with fluid combos. I loved the DnD feel it had to it when upgrading! It was really challenging; at one point i thought of Ninja Gaiden 2...its not that level hard all the time, just on some of the boss fights...a lot of them. The enemies level with you so to speak. When returning to an area in the begining, I was surprised when they were doing different moves and it took a little more damage to kill them.The only real ""bad"" thing I hated about this was when you reach an area border, you have to re-click the direction you were going most of the time. That part was really anoying when you are jumping into a different area. I didn't have to do it all the time though which was strange, but any time I really needed to keep moving forward after a screen change (time limmet parts), it happend. This is going into my all time favorite games for sure. I recomend this to everyone. I didn't know my life was missing something until I played this game.			"

												Pros:Crisp, satisfying gameplayInteresting dash mechanic that makes combat funVariety of gameplay stylesCons:Extremely trite plotSpells used as keys. The fire punch ability for Wyatt could have easily been a key item instead. Restricts spell use for navigation.Lots of enemies have attacks that can juggle the player, even when doing negligible damage. Removing hitstun on attacks doing under a certain amount of your max health, or having a way to mitigate or eliminate hitstun would have improved the game.Permanent stat buffs linked to performance on a boss, discouraging early attempts at certain bosses.Lack of transparency of consumables. Using even one of the 10 rare crafting metals precludes you from certain items.Lack of an overarching world map.Visible percentages on maps result in the game feeling smaller than it needs to.Lots of backtracking that is only somewhat mitigated by warping between towns.Overall 6/10. I don't feel like I wasted my money, but I wouldn't encourage you to spend yours on it.			"

												Valdis Story is an action-rpg with plataform and exploration elements. Typical metroidvania, it's challenging so be ready to to use a few retries before you master it, specially the bosses. They're well made, with some having patterns, and with the possibility to surprise even the most experienced players. The game has a rank system on bosses battles, with good prizes to a well fought battle. The prizes can be a higher experience and even status/skills bonus.The soundtrack is excellent and the highest point in this game. One of my favorites on steam. All hail to Zack Parrish.The controls is a topic of discordance between players. Some people complain but I particulary don't think it's bad. Valdis Story has it's own mechanics so take your time to understand how it works. For instante, you have wall jump and grab, and understand the difference between them and when you will use one or another can save your life a lot of times, since you will need often to make precise jumps.Some people also complain about the map, that he doesn't help. I don't use it but exploration is a part of the game. I took my time to memorize routes playing so I leave this to your own opnion.The game has an high replay value. You can't get all itens on one playthrough and even some upgrades are limited. You can customize your character attributes and skills so you can try a lot of differents builds. It has four playable characters, with differents habilities. The game offers differents routes so you don't have to follow the sames steps every game.For power players, you can play Goibniu Mode where you can compete with others players for the ending the game on the lesser time and a better rank. Also, on Heaven and Hell Arena you can fight against bosses in an endless tower for leaderboards.Hope I don't made a lot of grammatical mistakes on this review. =P			"

												I like Metroidvanias, but this is more a beat em up bullet hell with bolt on RPG elements.I didn't find these elements very well explained - like many RPG systems it's assumed you know how often a crit occurs and thus how good boosting crits are compared to everything else. The magic system is interested but again not very well explained, and all the controls felt very stodgy on the PS3 controller. There is weapon crafting too but the weapons I had didn't feel very unique or characterful.This is the other RPG element that doesn't really work. as the character you meet all stand in place and lack movement and personality. That includes both the team mates you pick up and those you meet in the world.The missions too lack variety, and a lot of the world is about collecting keys to open a door to punch more people, there wasn't a big hook to the story to push you onwards, and the plot assumed you already cared enough to move on.Returning to the controls, with gamepad, the controls feel messy, with four spells activated using up, down, left combos when they could have just been mapped to the L and R buttons. This makes combat more fiddly than fun, and as it does end up like a bullet hell at points the lack of precise controls undermines this.In addition, you don't feel each hit you make, other games give opponents howls when you finish them off and big reactions when you even hit hem a little, but this really doesn't make that connection between player input and good chunky sounds. I really didn't feel the combat was either graceful or powerful.It felt like a game where the RPG elements had been borrowed but not really understood or expanded in a flavourful way (which is bizarre given how the angels vs demon aesthetic suggests creative minds at work)  while the combat doesn't feel particularly precise or rewarding. So I do not recommend this game.			"

												Incredibly beautiful and satisfying ""metroidvania"". The Metroid and Castlevania Symphony of the Night (CSotN) games are the most famous of the early attempts to turn 2d games into open world games. Exploration is key, and progress usually involves a new ability or item allowing you to explore new areas, and new secrets within areas you may have already explored. This game takes a lot from Castlevania Symphony of the night, with a similar Trigger Button + direction to create magic, with its focus on melee combat outside of spells. Fans of CSotN might be dissapointed by the (relatively) small amount of equippable items. Besides that, I have to say this game is absuletly incredible and a real contentder for the best metroidvania game since Metroid Prime (I wanted to say since CSotN but Metroid Prime is stupidly good). Here's what I like about this game:  Multiple characters to choose from, where they really are different in movesets, weaponry, spells, and stats wise. The first two characters you start with unlocked, and two more to be unlocked. The first is a male sword wielding warrior, and is considerably easier to use (at first) than the monk-like, female second character. Either one controls flawlessly, with VERY responsive controls (I played using an xbox controller). There is a block button, but the block button is usually not as good as the dodge mechanic. The dodge mechanic has you hitting ""A"" on the controller, and then a move of your character to the left or right will have your character do a dash in the direction you chose. While dashing you're invulnerable, and there's many attacks that require you to dash through them. If you're in air the ""A"" button will have you plummet to the ground quickly, which is a nice convenience, a puzzle element, and a get-the-f-out dodge for aerial attacks. Your melee attacks are two-fold, a light attack (X button) and a heavy attack (Y button) which can be mixed and matched or repeated in order to create a surprising variety of combo attacks. The attacks feel satisfying, and are fun to play with because of the variety in which light and heavy attacks can be combined into novel combo animations.  The movement is rock solid in general, although the platforming is a little, very little bit floaty. You don't build up momentum like you would in mario, though this never really bothered me. Even when you have to jump to and from very skinny platforms, falling felt like my fault and not the fault of movement mechanics/physics. You grab on to ledges automatically, which is nice, but I do wish that grabbing was its own button because sometimes you'd rather wall jump off the near top of a platform instead of grab-on.  Magic comes in several elemental varieties , with most having to be unlocked. Four spell slots ( corresponding to up, down, left/right are the same but in-air is its own spell slot so there are four) can be assigned one spell from any of the elements, The spell type depends on the element and which slot it is assigned to. Left/right holy magic, is always the same spell, but is a different spell than you would get assigning dark element or any other element to the same left/right spell slot. A problem that plagues many games is the usefulness and balance of the spells. I'd say that I feel healing spells are a little bit costly for the amount they heal, and that some of the Damage over Time (DoT) spells are a bit overpowered. Like the potion in castlevania series, the DoT attacks launch a projectile that stops upon monster-impact or after a fixed maximum distance. When they hit their mark they do damage each second or so until the spell wears off. The variety of spells is excellent, with 6 or 8 elements and 4 slots you have between 24 and 32 spells. Many spells in a given element have similar counterparts to spells in another element, but each element has its own flavor and elemental differences come to play in the rpg mechanics of the game. The game is very much an rpg, with experience points from combat leading to level-ups, which give you a stat point and a skill point (a la Diablo). The skill tree is typical of post-Diablo skill trees. There are three different ""trees"", offensive, defensive , and magical. Each tree has 3 skills per level , and 5 or so levels. Points in the second level can only be placed if you have 5 points placed in total AND at least one of those points is directly above the desired second level skill. The music is honestly not amazing, it's just there. It certainly detracted nothing from the game, but it pales in comparison to CSotN and Metroid's legendary soundtracks. However the sound effects are a notch better, still not the best you can find, but plenty satisfying when it comes to hit sounds, unique monster noises, and spell effects. Some sound effects (notably those in the wintery area) are almost laughably similar to those in CSotN, but that may more of a nod to the predecessor than a symptom of carelessness. The monsters provide a solid variety of movement/attack behaviors. Some are about your character's size, and some are huuuge. Some fly, some walk, and some do a bit of both. You'll find that the enemies each have their own patterns and openings which are learned through repetition (a la Dark Souls). However, like Dark Souls, the enemy variation more than makes up for the redundant feelings that accumulate over time. You will kill the same enemy type many many times, but I never got bored of the killing. Killing a monster because you know its pattern is very rewarding, and it's excellent to play a game where skill is as much of a factor as your character's ""level"" (again like Dark Souls). The visuals are stunning 2d, with beautiful tile sets that vary a lot around the different areas in the game world. The enemies and Character sprites are very colorful and detailed, with smoother features than you'd find in more pixelated old-school games. The usually bright, contrast heavy color choices are well done, and don't make the game feel cartoony in a trivial way. The whole look screams production value and care. It's some of the best 2d graphics I've seen outside of the last two Rayman games (which are INSANELY beautiful), and it's not quite as good as CSotN's pixelated style (it is close though).All in all I'd say you're a fool if you miss out on this game, and I reccomend it whole-heartedly to anyone who likes the metroidvania style of 2d games. Let's call it an exploratory-action-rpg-platformer.			"

												Great game to play through, the builds are fun to try out and there's quite a bit of replayability with fun combat to boot. Minor flaws in that some of the treasure challenges are infuriating to the max due to sometimes questionable platforming. Other than that, I had and will still have fun replaying this game.			"

												This game is awesome!It has a nice graphic, good music, some story, a lot of action and interesting unique bosses. And bosses could be really hard if you don't understand their mechanics. You have two characters (for now) to play with unique skills and a different fighting style. You have four unique weapons that allows you to use a different builds based on your weapon and armor which are upgradable (It's not a farming-money-game-style). The entire game isn't long. It depend on your priorities. If you would like to find everything in the game, so it takes about 5-7 ingame hours. But if not - you can finish it a far earlier. But the game has a pretty high replayability. So it is interesting to test new builds on a higher difficultues and trying to reach an ace rank with bosses (every boss fight has a rank based on time, spended to kill a boss, damage, received from him, and used health potions during a fight)			"

												Unresponsive and VERY poorly thought out controls, badly designed levels, very few enemy types (all of which are 100% predictable), NPC interactions limited to ""hi, go here for next quest.""  I give this a D-, because I reserve F's for games that are nonfunctional due to bugs/DRM.Here's a limited sample of the frustrations:Many of the games actions are mapped to keyboard button combinations - for example, s+d, s+w, s+up.  You can figure the individual keys, but can't configure the fact that it's a combination rather than the MUCH simpler and more intuitive single button press.  There's no justification for this, other than the developers being LAZY as this is console port and they 1-1 mapped the buttons from the original.Many of the boss fights involve the following - boss punches the ground to use a shockwave attack, boss punches forward, boss makes stuff rain from the sky, repeat.  I've encountered this pattern (with very similar, if not identical sprites) on at least 3 bosses and I'm nowhere near the end of the game.  If you don't grind levels - and you level VERY slowly - most boss attacks deal 10%-50% of a full life bar when juggling, damage over time, and what not are added in.Loads of enemies have ice attacks that freeze you in place and want you to wiggle (<- -> repeatedly on keyboard) to escape getting endlessly rejuggled.  This game LOVES to juggle you with no control given to the player, no or limited combo break opportunity, and no chance to escape.  Just put the controls/kb down and let it do whatever.The game does not have money.  Instead, the merchants - of which there are many - want to barter for a very particular set items.  The game has ~50 or so things that can drop for barter, making trying to get anything from the merchants a ridiculous chore.  The game lacks any sort of in-game tracking for targeted trades.  You either need to write down the trade requests or consult a FAQ.Quest givers give you an indication where to go ONCE.  Asking them where to go a second time results in unhelpful small talk.  The in game map does not give meaningful directions, though mercifully it does tell you the current quest goal.			"

Once your character is levelled up and starts to get totally bad♥♥♥♥♥ you're pretty much done with the game and there's not much left worth killing.  Obviously adding major content from a small team that already spent years making this is hard, but a bonus challenge tower or something that used the game's existing assets would have been nice.  As is though it's still pretty replayable with a large variety of character build types and difficulty modes if you're so inclined.			"

												Valdis Story stands as a well-made metroidvania with RPG elements.As of this review there are two playable characters, each feeling fairly distinct from each other with three unique weapons  plus unarmed fighting. Upon leveling up, you receive a stat point to distribute between four stats, as well as a skill point to assign to each character's own unique skill tree.The game can get a bit difficult or frustrating on the higher difficulties, where missing a key jump in timed platforming segments or getting knocked off ledges can lead to having to trek through the same several rooms many times over. For those that truly love a challenge, the Goibnui mode offers a global leaderboard with which to compete against players across the globe in conquering the game on it's hardest difficulty without the luxury of saving.Overall, the game is rather short, coming in at about 8 hours for a 100% playthrough. That said, it's still fun and offers a great speedrunning challenge for those who're interested.			"

												Really quite good for a platformer hack-n-slash/metroidvania game, something that's becoming more and more of a rarity these days. Linear, but with an open-ended streak that allows you to get to spots you may not be ready for (as I, myself, have encountered). Combat flows nicely with a lot of room for fancy footwork. A punishing difficulty, but the potion system still gives you a fair bit of room to breathe. I'm not finished yet, but so far I would recommend picking it up even if it isn't on sale if you really like platformer adventure or metroidvania type games.			"

												I like Metroidvanias, but this is more a beat em up bullet hell with bolt on RPG elements.I didn't find these elements very well explained - like many RPG systems it's assumed you know how often a crit occurs and thus how good boosting crits are compared to everything else. The magic system is interested but again not very well explained, and all the controls felt very stodgy on the PS3 controller. There is weapon crafting too but the weapons I had didn't feel very unique or characterful.This is the other RPG element that doesn't really work. as the character you meet all stand in place and lack movement and personality. That includes both the team mates you pick up and those you meet in the world.The missions too lack variety, and a lot of the world is about collecting keys to open a door to punch more people, there wasn't a big hook to the story to push you onwards, and the plot assumed you already cared enough to move on.Returning to the controls, with gamepad, the controls feel messy, with four spells activated using up, down, left combos when they could have just been mapped to the L and R buttons. This makes combat more fiddly than fun, and as it does end up like a bullet hell at points the lack of precise controls undermines this.In addition, you don't feel each hit you make, other games give opponents howls when you finish them off and big reactions when you even hit hem a little, but this really doesn't make that connection between player input and good chunky sounds. I really didn't feel the combat was either graceful or powerful.It felt like a game where the RPG elements had been borrowed but not really understood or expanded in a flavourful way (which is bizarre given how the angels vs demon aesthetic suggests creative minds at work)  while the combat doesn't feel particularly precise or rewarding. So I do not recommend this game.			"

												Pros:Crisp, satisfying gameplayInteresting dash mechanic that makes combat funVariety of gameplay stylesCons:Extremely trite plotSpells used as keys. The fire punch ability for Wyatt could have easily been a key item instead. Restricts spell use for navigation.Lots of enemies have attacks that can juggle the player, even when doing negligible damage. Removing hitstun on attacks doing under a certain amount of your max health, or having a way to mitigate or eliminate hitstun would have improved the game.Permanent stat buffs linked to performance on a boss, discouraging early attempts at certain bosses.Lack of transparency of consumables. Using even one of the 10 rare crafting metals precludes you from certain items.Lack of an overarching world map.Visible percentages on maps result in the game feeling smaller than it needs to.Lots of backtracking that is only somewhat mitigated by warping between towns.Overall 6/10. I don't feel like I wasted my money, but I wouldn't encourage you to spend yours on it.			"

												I'm just gonna say that I tried so hard to like this game... but I'd rather get lasik surgery on my♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game wasn't necessarily too hard however the battle scheme got really repetitive throughout the whole game. There was no solid tips on armor forging or weapon upgrading, you kind of just stumble upon it when you reach your first city type area. The characters were very chibi-like with the huge heads compared to the rest of the bodies. The artwork on the enemies was great, the character the player controlled, not so great. I mean sure it's not for me and it could be for you but I didn't like the game, the controls were a bit awkward on controller and on keyboard (the stretch for certain abilities was a bit tasking)10/10 would get my refund all over again.

												I hate how I just can't love this game...I guess just let me tell you where it succeeds and where it fails.Good stuff:+ Soundtrack. Orchestral masterpieces are pretty much the standard.+ The fighting system is pretty interesting. Kinda hard to make use of at first, but also interesting. Realy wish I could say that about the controls (See the negativ section, mate)+ The crafting-system is alright. Nothign special nowerday, but very enjoyable. Common items will be able to craft rare once, and multiple rare once will make a super rare one. You can also get rare stuff right from your enemys.+ Graphics. God! Do I even have to say anything? Just look at it! (Recomend playing in full screen though, window is really smallI.)All of this does point to a great game, right?Yes! That is why I bought it! But with all this lovely sugar coded candy you will soon notice that the core is a solid block of BS! It is just so frustrating to see such a promising game to sort of be torn apart by those things.BS stuff:- Unhelpfull controls: Pressing the guard-button and the spell-button simultanously will open up the spell menu, which itself only requires you to press one directional button, to swap a spell. So guess what happens to you all the time:You guard, then want to cast a spell, then end up messing up your spell-config. Also you need to press down, then press an other direction to dash. Of course you can change that. But remember, the evade/dash-button is also used for the dive-move (which lets you fall down incredibly fast). This will especially annoy you, when you have to do parcours under time pressure in order to get to those chests that you might want.- The Story is stitched to getter at best: No really, you would think the story of shipwreck in weird place, find your friends, survive, explore place would be enough of a story. Apperantly endless fluff dosn`t agree. Instead you get a lot of weird throw in lines about some old war. (To be honest: you CAN read up on it)- I hope you like odd words for simple concepts... Not wanan spoil it.. but yeah.- Odd ""Hitboxes"": This will really only annoy you at first. Any veteran video gamer will except to move out further on a clif than you can here. Leading to you having very little if any idea when to jump.- Chest are BS: There are golden chests, and grey ones. Golden once SHOULD contain better items. Well, kinda... they usually contain lvl1 armor which 90% of the time may be weaker then your current one, and needs to be upgraded. Grey chests will usually only contain comon items... no fun there.But i could forgive all of this, BUT!Combat-system: This one is a big letdown, and one of the main aspects that almost ruin the game so listen up:- 90% of your enemies can block your attacks, INCLUDING the ""blockbreaking"" (yeah, sure) heavy attack. Which means you spend most time just waiting for them to let you hit temr. - No recovery time. You do NOT get any invulnarability when being hit, and every hit stuns you for about half a second. Enjoy the stun-locks. They happen. A LOT! Usually until you die.-BS- Bosses. Hardness aside.. I rarely ever found them hard, more anoying! Why? Because they will do one IF NOT ALL of these:--Heal themselves--Run away (by teleporting out of sigth)--Build up a complete shield instantly (sometimes timer based)--Cover 80% of the screen in poisones♥♥♥♥♥♥ or electrizity... just bad♥♥♥♥♥♥br>--Stun lock you until you loos a life--Giving zero indication of actually appearing (have fun beeing on your last life when you enter)--Appear in bossrooms once used before, and give ZERO indicationSitenote: A lot of areas are large in vertical measure, one slip (which happens a lot with these controlls) and you just lost your last 10 minute of climbing. Better do it again.Endresult:It looks and sounds amazing. Hell it even has the potentiol to FEEL amazing. But it does not... It feels awkward at best...Buy it if you want. Just.. dont excpect it to be as great as it looks. "

												It's a metroidvania game with multiple playable characters with differing combat styles.  Each character also has unique skill trees that can change how you play the character, even between different playthroughs.  The sound and graphics are solid, although not the best.  The story is likewise good, but not great.  The gameplay, however, is top notch.  Fast combat that is reliant on skill.  I highly recommend it.			"

												I'm going to try to say some things I think haven't been said in the previous reviews. The first thing is that I do believe this is indeed a good game. It has a lot of qualities and care taken to be something that certain people would enjoy. Notably, the art and difficulty (both of which I don't find too attractive myself). But I found specific points that made the game so frustrating and UNENJOYABLE that I had to quit. Mind you, I'm the type to keep playing a game just to see the end regardless of the pain and/or boredom (in this case, pain). I'll do a bullet list for ease of reading:-Combos, ugh. Symphony of the Night didn't have combos. It was simple hit-and-run. I hate how so many games think adding combos automatically makes things better. More on this later.-Uninformative map. This might be due to me foolishly choosing a harder setting, but I got completely lost. Especially since...-Metroidvania or levels? This really seems to be just a bunch of levels, but they're tied together in a gigantic, continuous, labyrinthian 2D map. It's really really weird having a bunch of separate locations forceably tied together in this way. Most Metroidvanias (I think?) generally have one gigantic area to explore but in 2D. And once you start being able to go everywhere due to unlocking new areas and you have the previously mentioned uninformative map... I got completely lost.-What am I supposed to be doing? I understand I'm looking for lost crewmates, but I have no idea who they are, what they look like, or even how many of them there are. But that's just a side quest, it seems. There's always some main quest you have to be doing in order to progress. I only see one place in game to check what you're supposed to be doing, and right now my quest is incredibly vague. I need two objects, but from where? I've been playing only once a week (I guess that makes me not hardcore enough) and I can't figure out what DIRECTION to even go in!-Bad/trollish enemy placement. Maybe this is a Dark Souls type thing, but it's very clear enemies are spawned on the maps in ways that completely screw over the player. The best example I would name would be ""near edges."" As this game uses combos like a fighting game, ALSO like a fighting game it has pushback. This means any attack and you knock enemies into sometimes impossible to fight locations (or just off the map, where they don't die and you don't get loot). This, again, leads to the next point...-I hate the movement. Backtracking through these trollish enemy placements sucks. Granted, I'm only 8 hours in. But generally by this point I should have some gimmicks for crazy movement. See, something that makes backtracking so fun in Symphony of the Night, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Guacamelee! is that you quickly earn new, amazing traversal moves. Areas that were a pain before can be traversed with ease with a bat form or double jump or chain dash, etc. Here, all I got was a hard-to-use dodge that lets me go through enemy collision for about 3 feet and a wall jump. And I really hate the wall jump in this game. It's so slow and it feels inconsistent. Maybe more stuff unlocks later. I'll never know. Which leads to the BIGGEST point...-Exploring doesn't feel rewarding. You generally just run into the same few enemies- maybe with a new ability or two- in some new, more annoying setup that just leads to a chest with a crafting material in it. At no point did I get that feeling of, ""Oh, man, what's over HERE? I bet it's a secret! Eee!"" Instead I just felt like it was a slog and all I wanted was to find the next save point.At this point the review is already too long. I hope I've covered enough ground. This game isn't bad, like I said, and certainly isn't cheap or scammy in the amount of effort put in by the dev's. This is more about me wanting to elaborate on some of the points I wish I saw in the reviews so I could know that this isn't a game for me. And maybe this isn't the game for you.			"

												I wanted to like this.  I really did.  I'd just finished playing a runthrough of Slat and Sanctuary, and then moved on to Dust, and was hoping to continue the trend here.Sadly disappointed on a variety of fronts, alas.  Played the game through to the ... fourth boss, I believe? and decided enough was enough.The controls don't feel tight at all - many times I'd try to wall-jump but would fail to connect.  In-air movement seemed floaty and inconsistent - landing on moving platforms was particularly challenging.  The graphics looked pretty but none of the textures aligned, leaving boxes around almost all of the background and level art blocks.  And the gameplay itself was... frustrating.  I'd picked up the third or fourth key and headed into the fire level and while any individual monster was not much of a challenge, I'd yet to pick up /any/ new weapons and by the time I'd gotten to the boss, the difficulty ramp from the rest of the level to the boss itself was huge.  And I don't think I was underleveled, either, having just unlocked the third tier of the upgrade trees.Traveling between regions was just not particularly fun.  There was limited enemy variety in each area, few rewards - mostly just crafting materials for later in the game, I assume - and with all of my attacks melee, each monster was a ready opportunity to lose expensive-to-regain health.Finally, having four differnet action keys - two types of melee attack, and two types of magic - seemed overcomplicated and unnecessary.Metroidvania's are on the knife-edge of reward-vs-challenge and playing this one just had too few rewards to interest me in trying to grind down another boss (or, this time, a boss-pair, due to a decision I'd made earlier) with my massively underpowered attacks.Can't say anything bad about the story, however.

												I would recommend this game, except for a handful of issues, some of them developer decisions, and others related to the gameplay.First we have the awful controls. They simply aren't put together well enough, along with some HORRIBLE mechanics in the game, like how easy it is for your character to be constantly juggled or stun locked. God help you if you want to attack an enemy on a ledge, as you're going to have to hope it's an enemy that doesn't have stun locking programmed into it's moves. That, however, almost doesn't matter, as the game follows the castlevania decision of having your character fly backwards if he's hit while jumping.You are going to be expected to be playing very smoothly and with skill, except that the controls makes that very difficult. Whether it's with controller or keyboard I found this game a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to control. There are other character action/brawler games like bayonetta, devil may cry, and so on, that require you to learn the combat system very well if you want to progress far in anything other than an easy difficulty. This game also requires that of you. Unfortunately, those other games have a very well put together system of combat, combined with the controls, while this one does not. The attacks don't flow together well, your characters movement is overly reliant on the 'skill cancel' ability(which you can only use at most a handful of times before you are forced to let it recharge, which can be death), and hit detection is all kinds of off. The hit boxes are clearly beyond your characters graphics, as I've been hit by ranged attacks that were going to sail over my head, but much to my surprise I got to enjoy yet another cheap shot.The game has a weird system as well when fighting a boss where if you do well in the battle, you get rewarded with stat bonuses, while if you do poorly, say goodbye to those nice rewards. Basically, if you're good at the game, the game gets even easier, while if you struggle, you will continue to struggle. That seems poorly thought out. Add to that, as I'm about to go into in the next section, that you absolutely do NOT want to use their convenient retry feature, to restart the boss battle from right at the beginning. That penalizes you 5 minutes towards your in game timer, that you are not notified about, and has catastrophic consequences if you allow to go on too long.There are certain time management decisions by the developer that are absolutely unforgiveable given this is a metroidvania style game, with leveling, and if you want to meet certain objectives, you are expected to explore the entire map, and pick up all loot. The worst part, is you are not notified about these time limits, until you find out later on that you failed certain objectives because you took too long to accomplish certain things. Add to that a 5 minute penalty any time you decide to retry the game again upon death, or just wanting to restart at a checkpoint. You are actually expected to quit out of the game to the main menu, then reload your game from your save point, if you don't want this 5 minute penalty.The time limits in question is first, a 2 hour game time limit for you to kill a certain enemy boss, otherwise it triggers a sccenario where it kills a town full of people. In addition, you have a 7 hour game time max to complete the game, before another town is killed because their source of heat expires, and everyone freezes to death. Once again, you are not notified about this, and even if you were, it's anyone's guess why the developer doesn't want you to just enjoy your time in this game.As it is, you are forced from destination to destination, with very little leeway to explore or level up in the earlier parts of the game. That 2 hour time limit may be rearing it's ugly head a little too close for comfort when you're heading back from the library objective. The enemy is quite difficult as well, so squuezing in some leveling up before you go to fight him is almost mandatory, even though you will be trying to fit every minute is that you can. Oh and don't forget, before that 2 hour mark, you better not ever use that retry feature.Among other terribly set up parts of this game, you have a very lackluster options menu. There are no resolution options, rather a resolution scale option, which is just weird. It gives you all of 4 choices. No vsync option, which potentially plays into the horrible feel of combat at times, along with bad hit detection. Graphics get a high or low option, that's it. In addition, if you choose low, it forces the game to run at 30 fps. If it's at high, you are allowed 60 fps. Needless to say, the options menu is unacceptable.There is also very little information available from the game to teach you certain mechanics, or useful information. Like the combat ranking system, that rewards you with bonus experience. You are told nothing about it. The timers that count against you are not brought up. The map system is extremely lacking, given the loot hidden behind unaccessable areas until later in the game when you have a certain upgrade.Basically you are reliant on the work of others, such as steam guides, and user created maps, unless you want to learn the hard way. I understand wanting to explore and understand something yourself, but that's a bit easier done when the game actually provides you with plenty of information. Crucial game mechanics should not be unexplained.As far as positives, the graphics are nice, the music is good, and occasionally the gameplay is enjoyable. You just have to deal with many pitfalls. At it's heart, it's still a metroidvania, which I love. It's easily one of my favorite genres. It's just hampered by some bad design decisions, and a flawed combat system.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game. There are too many annoying, or unforgivable negatives, that simply outweigh the positives, for the majority of people. I'm sure there will be some people that love this game regardless, but it's really not for everyone. If you want better luck with a metroidvania, maybe try Dust.			"

												Imagine your standard Metroidvania-esque Game. Maybe it's Super Metroid, maybe it's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.Now imagine a 2D Fighting Game. Maybe it's the older Street Fighters, maybe it's one of the BlazBlue games...Now take both of those things and mash them together; you get Valdis Story.There's good, there's bad and there's ""Omg did I just do that? LOL PWND!"".The Good- Tight and Responsive Controls that combine with a Combat System reminiscent of an Arcade Fighting Game. You can combo enemies, you can Air Juggle enemies, you can Stun-lock enemies, You can do a 15-hit ground combo, uppercut the enemy into the Air, Juggle them for another 15-hits then finish them off with a Spell for a 31-hit combo! Did I mention the better your Combo'es the more Experience and better Drop Chance you get from the enemy you kill?- Clean, Customizable Skill that allows you to do all sorts of things. Want to specialize in using Magic Attacks, yet be able to dish out a few good Melee strikes if need? Check. Want to play defensively and Parry/Counter-attack for big damage? Sure why not?- Plenty of Equipment/Accessory Options that enable you to tweak or augment your preferred playstyle/build. Want to be able to gain increasing Attack Damage and Attack Speed while doing combo'es? There's an Armor for that. Tired of getting hit by Spells and you just wish you could Nullify them with a press of the Block button? There's an Accessory for that. Want to make your ""Buster Sword"" Scale with Magic/INT and use it to set your enemies on Fire or Freeze them based on what Elemental Spell you are using? There's a Weapon Upgrade for that!- A ""Free Roam"" style map that gives you that Metroidvania feel. Discovering Secrets, finding Areas you can't quite reach so you come back later, doing a few Side-Quests to get more Materials for ""Buying"" Gear ... Oh, and unlocking Shortcuts, discovering Optional Bosses and rescuing Crew Members that you can Summon mid-fight for a Bonus.- A good amount of Bosses; 26 in Total if I remember right. Each Boss is actually unique and seperates itself from the others. Sure, it may start off with Standard Fare of just ""Oh look he just 3-hit combo'es into a special move. Only this time he uses Ice instead of Fire!"". However that is only the first couple of Bosses. After that the game really amps it up. You'll quickly fight Bosses that can Combo you for 20+ Hits if you aren't careful or Summon Minions to help while Casting Spells.- A pretty solid Story that features multiple Characters. This isn't one of the plethora of Game Maker-esque stories. It's more akin to the Castlevania or Metroid games; not too deep but not superficial either. You'll have 2 Characters to Select from at the start, then unlock another 2 upon beating the game once. The Story stays the same but the interactions and Dialogue adjusts for whatever Character you're playing. One Character faces a nemesis, while another faces a sibling. One Character is treated like a Savior, another is treated like the Devil incarnate.The Bad- Boss Ranks. This is a somewhat ambiguous topic. Upon defeating a Boss, you'll gain a Bonus on how well you did. Crushed that scrub in 10 seconds without losing HP? Well here's 5 Free Stat points. Get curbstomped and just barely kill that same Boss? Well here's a +50 HP Bonus.(Which is quite a bit FYI) There are some that hate this system because they feel they are being ""punished"" for not doing well. Personally, I like this mechanic because it encouraged me to Reload and try the Boss again and perfect my Tactics or try out new ones. Also I felt like I was ""rewarded"" for my Victory, even if I got a lousy C-Rank ... I got a Soul so I could Upgrade one of my Magic Spells; which is really rare.- No Mini-Map or Map at all. There were times where I was confused as to where to go and which direction I'm going in. Sure some NPCs will point you in the right direction like ""Go East"" aka ""Go Right"" but they don't exactly tell if it's Up and Right or Down and Right. Plus some ""Area Transitions"" seem almost identical which doesn't help.- Respawning Enemies. I look at this as a Good Thing since I can Farm/Grind forever. However it does get annoying when you get confused as to where to go and clear out a particularly hard room ... only to inadvertantly backtrack and now have to ""Re-fight"" that hard room again.ConclusionI really enjoyed my time with this game. I ended up putting in quite a few hours and only did ~2 Playthroughs. It's got a great feel and is similar to Dust: An Eleysion Tale while being Unique. I haven't come across many games like Valdis and I'd recommend it in a heartbeat.			"

												This game starts with a great deal of mystery, smooth mechanics that seem to provide lots of room for mastery, and a distinctly metroidvania spice. Unfortunately, the mystery quickly falls apart, the game reveals itself as linear, and the bosses become time-sinks, since understanding the boss isn't enough, you have to exploit its pattern with incredible consistency to kill it without running out of health. With Metroidvanias becoming ever more popular, there's just too much competition to recommend this game.			"

												This is the world, where gods kill one another, and where armies of angels and demons are fighting for forty years after the downfall of titular supreme goddess Valdis. Armies are controlled by her twin daughters, red-tinted Myrgato and yellow-glowing Alagath. And humans are used as foot soldiers and fuel source (a lot of that magic runs on soul power, so yeah, sucks to be human in this world). Obviously this dystopian fantasy world requires a rebel protagonist. And there they are —all four them, plus all their bad♥♥♥♥♥crew of warriors, magicians, rebellious demons and traitorous angels, travelling on their cool flying magical ship. Pursuing different personal goals they all agree on the subject war, that is must be stopped, and not be either of sides finally winning. And this is unusually large flying beast who tears this ship apart. Crew, separated by strange magic falls underwater to the different locations of legendary Sitheil. Long lost sunken city still contains some breathable air in its caverns, and shelters dangerous beasts, scattered survivors, magical artifacts and old mysteries.This is where the game begins. Player is prompted to choose main character. Though the developer intends to add two more playable main characters in the future, keep in mind that Valdis Story: Abyssal City was initially announced in 2007, and it took long 6 years before it was finally released with current two heroes, so it might take a while. Red-haired Wyatt wields gigantic sword, was raised by the demons and is in a search of his father. White-haired Reina starts with a bare hands and relies on her monk-training and magic. Their stories share same major pieces, but actually not replace one another, but rather intertwine and meet in the end. And it actually is quite worth noticing. Because, here's the thing, despite the fact, that my brief retell of major facts of this setting may seem like a generalised uninteresting mess, the actual lore and story aren't. Partly because all of that, except the flying beast are not actually told to the player in the prologue, but must be collected piece by piece from dialogues, item descriptions and story development. But mainly because retell presented you rather simplified version. Lack of the actual knowledge on characters' history and state of the world throughout the game creates delightful puzzle, and I'd rather not steal this pleasure from someone who intents to play Valdis Story. Let's just say that there's more than one twist, and the biggest one in the end, so it's more of a first tome in the series, than a closed book. Not all the questions will be answered, but this piece of a bigger story is of an amazing quality.Two characters have separate sets of talents (three different progression paths for each one) and weapons. They also start with a different armor and two souls each. Souls is the source of magic in Valdis, each provides four spells. With the Soul of Centurion Reina for example can attack foes with divine magic in three different ways and charge her weapon with it. During the game player collects different kind of souls, gaining access to the new types of magic and abilities, which help in visiting previously inaccessible areas. Also there's keys, quest items, armor, different kinds of loot for upgrading equipment. Resulting system feels just right: not too overwhelmingly complex, but not too simple either, being extensive enough to provide means to easier killing another particularly hard boss with choosing another approach, another set of magic, different, magic, armor, trinkets or assisting character.What stands truly unique here is combat system. You have two types of attack. Each can be used for a limited amount of times, increasing your combo rank before your character kind of feels tired. Here's what happens next, with the timed use of magic assist-attack you can increase the length of the combo. And longer combos deal higher damage. But the actual key here is using a special ability “Skill Cancel”. When used it dashes your hero forward or down, if you was in the air, giving him or her a few frames of invincibility and keeping combo chain on hold. So with this skill an experienced player can avoid damage and keep the initiative in fight. Also there's more boring blocking, and finally giving and taking damage fills your focus meter, which when fully filled can be used to enter focus mode, which heals you slightly, increase your stats and boosts your attacks for a limited time.Enemies have different strategies, abilities and weaknesses: some of them are nimble, some are heavy-hitters, some even try to poison you. But the true gem here are the bosses, who are challenging and unique. You'll fight lightning-blasting teleporting monk in the room with electrified walls, minion-summoning archangel blocking you from the use of magic with his attacks, and spore-spitting plant in a location slowly filling with poisonous gas. Like in some kind of slasher you can score a different rank for killing a boss, from d through c, b and a to s, with various aspects of battle taken in consideration.What’s truly amazing for the indie game is the amount of optional content in the game. There are whole areas and optional bosses that aren’t really needed to finish the game. Also some of the quests given by the NPCs are not mandatory, and you can ignore them. But hopefully you wouldn’t. Story actually is a bit non-linear and can be affected depending on player actions. Not of all those actions are really intuitive, some things are hidden well. The secrets of the game go as far as including concealed optional bosses which have to be slain before the timer runs out, or the story can take some unexpected turn concerning the survival of some of the NPC villages. Of course, there’s also more conventional dialogue choices for player to affect the story.All of those said above is packed with truly amazing visuals and soundtrack, making Valdis Story one of the best-looking 2D games. Characters move flawlessly with smooth and fluid animation. Backgrounds are truly detailed and a pleasure to look at. Design seems to be a true descendant of SNES era with its anime-like cartoon style, but it is executed by true artists who really have a passion for it. Same goes for music.Valdis Story: Abyssal City is one of the best modern 2D metroidvanias, if not even the best. Made by just two people, it really is an achievement. And what’s more amazing, considering its quality and size (I managed to finish it in 17 hours, while missing some of the areas completely), is that they continue their work on it. Not only they plan to add two more playable characters, who will have much more different stories, but they add all type of stuff like optional bosses, areas and items. They truly deserve your money.			"

												I tried to play this game a year ago, but put it into my 'early access' category even though it wasn't labeled as such because it was obviously unfinished. Shortly after that a new patch came out adding the final boss (see what I mean about early access?), and there hasn't been another update in nearly a year since. Two of the four playable characters are still missing.The game would still be enjoyable in its current state if not for some particularly rough edges. Most important among them, the game lacks immunity frames, so if you hit certain types of traps or get hit by certain attacks, you'll lose your entire life bar in a single hit (which is really a dozen hits landing all at once). Given the current state of the game I can't tell if that's a bug or by design, but it's terrible either way. Add onto that some extremely unbalanced bosses that make you feel underleveled even at max level, and the game just isn't any fun after awhile. It feels punishing in a very unfair way.I'd say wait for an update before getting this game, but I've been waiting a year and it still feels like early access. Maybe get it on a deep discount, but full price is too much until they at least fix some of the more glaring issues.			"

												I bought this game during the sale hoping for another awesome metroidvania-style game like Guacamelee!. Unfortunately this game is plagued by loose controls (the platforming parts are horrible) on top of an annoying control scheme. For example you have to press (and hold) a button to enter ""casting mode"" and then press a direction for the spell you want to cast. In the heat of the battle this often results in the wrong spell. The story, for as far as I played, was very boring and filled with stereotypes. The main character is very unlikable as well and tries to hard to be tough. The game had a lot of potential but is missing a lot of polish, which is why I can't recommend to buy this game. 5/10			"

												This game is really different, but in a good way. On one hand, it's your typical SNES-PS1 era platformer, on the other hand, however, you have this really fun RPG combat element added (leveling, magic, equipment, skill trees, the whole nine yards). The combat is fun and fluid; while difficult at times (I started on a higher difficulty with a ""harder"" character) is never cheap.I really don't play video games for their stories, believe me, but the artwork,characters, music, and setting all come together to form a complete picture that actually makes me care where the story is going. For eight dollars, I'm more than content with what I paid for.			"

												This is an action-platformer in the style of new Castlevania games.There are a few key differences, however. Unlike Castlevania, this game emphasizes quality over quantity when it comes to item drops and spells. Enemies drop crafting ingredients, not gold or items. Each character has only a handful of armors and weapons, and every one caters to a different playstyle and has multiple upgrade levels.The gameplay is more akin to a fighting game (especially in boss battles). There is a heavy emphasis on dodging over blocking. Striking enemies at opportune moments is much more important than simply hitting them as much as possible. You do have a revive built into your abilities, but you are still fairly fragile.This is much easier to play than a fighting game, though. Your skill cancel is a simple press of the down key, and dodging is just pressing left or right after that. Your assist has its own button, and spell casting and super mode have modifier keys. The game offers some tutorials, but muscle memory is the only real stumbling block here.Boss battles emphasize pattern recognition and reaction time over button mashing, and since your skill cancels have a short cooldown, spamming will get you nowhere. Killing a tricky boss after spending four lives learning their patterns is a very satisfying feeling. Retries are unlimited and place you right in the boss room, but its still crucial to keep your cool and respond to attacks carefully.There are downsides, of course. Whenever the game chooses to focus on platforming over combat, it becomes significantly less fun. Thankfully most of the timed platforming challenges are optional, though you will be missing out on a few items if you ignore them, as I chose to.Like any non-linear game, there are times when you will be unsure where to go, or where you accidentally miss important things because the game doesn't tell you enough. This is compounded by some occasionally suspect level design, particularly areas where it's easy to fall down several rooms and be forced to repeat an area, or where enemies can stunlock or toss you easily.The map and menus are rather bland. While it has some nice sprite work, the graphics options don't really give everything room to shine. It also doesn't scale well, so if (like me) you have a fairly large monitor and play in fullscreen, the upscaling is very noticable.The story is nothing exciting. Like Castlevania, it's mostly relegated to text boxes whenever you find a new area or kill a boss. It has a few engaging reveals and some pleasant backstory here and there, but the story is not a reason alone to play this game.Ultimately, this game doesn't hold your hand, but it has a reasonable difficulty curve and skill floor. It expects you to work a little bit for your victories, but it is neither impossible nor unfair. If you like action platformers and skill-based combat, look no further. Just be sure to use a controller.			"

												Valdis Story: Why gameplay testing is *so important*.This game is utterly beautiful, and the combat and magic design are well done, however it has a clear problem that's common among indie games, lack of outside input on gameplay difficulty.  I enjoy difficult games, and i like a challange, however this game demands more of it's players and controls it's than i think is resonable.The excellent game design show, ""Extra Credits"" once gave this advice to indie developers, ""If you think that the difficulty of your game is just about perfect, it's probably way, way too hard.""  In other words, as a developer makes the game, they become so familiar with it, that their sense of the difficulty is off, and they tend the game and it's challanges more difficult than they indended, even if they intended to make a challanging game.  This is most easily seen in Valdis Story's many timed puzzles.  Often they require you to hit a series of switches in order, hitting as many as 10 in a row before time runs out on the first switch, with platforming in between.  The margin for error on these switches is *incredibly* small.  It's not uncommon to hit a switch in this game and see it's giving you 2 or 3 seconds to find the door that just opened and dash through it, often a ways off screen.  So for the long sequence switches, you often have to hit the first, run to the second, hit it, look for the door that opened, find it, then go start the process over because you spent too long looking for the second switch, hit the first again, hit the second, hit the third, look for the door, start over again because you lost time again... etc. etc. etc.  Once you do find all the switches, and their respective doors, you are then tasked with hitting every one in order literally without a single missed jump or ledge grab for the entire sequence, something i don't believe the controls are tight enough to warrant, and i know i certainly am not a good enough player to pull off more than half the time.  What adds the frustration cherry to this gameplay sundae, is that failing a run early on will force you to sit and wait by the first switch for the timer to tick all the way down before you can restart and give it another shot.All in all, this is a very interesting game from a very promising studio, and i look forward to seeing their future projects assuming they can master the difficulty curve a little better in future.

												Potentially good Castlevania type game. But the clunky and fussy controls bog down the experience. Especially frustrating when the controls are need for the numerous timed platforming puzzles which require finese down to the last second. Fights are crisp, but one wrong move will leave you stun locked by multiple enemies, leaving a feeling that fights are very one sided and artificially hard.Visually stunning, Valdis Story favours style and lengthy animations over practical controls and may leave players wishing they could consistently pull off the flashy moves to good effect.Give it a try, but be prepared for a frustrating time			"

												If you read the negative reviews for this game, you'll see a recurring theme about bad controls.  And let me tell you - there's a very good reason for that.  It's also just a little bit lacking in the explanation department about game mechanics (especially with the spell system).  Some retro gamers might dig that ""drop you in and let you sort it out"" kind of gameplay, but I think a little bit of handholding can be a very beneficial tool.A couple other annoyances: - If you change scenes while holding down left or right, you won't start moving until you lift off the key and press it again.  This might not sound like a big deal, but after 10-20 times of this happening it starts to get on your nerves. - The boss battles are graded.  A good grade gives you permanent, otherwise unobtainable stat buffs (which can be equivalent to the stats you gain from several level ups).  But - you cannot go back and repeat a boss. If you beat one with a bad grade, that's it; and you're Don Goofson.  This ends up giving more stats to the skilled players that don't need them, and stunting the growth of unskilled players, making the rest of the game even harder.  It seems a bit counter-intuitive. - The graphics will occasionally lag for seemingly no reason and I have neither the time nor the inclination to figure out why and/or resolve it. It's a shame, because this really seems like a game I could get into and thoroughly enjoy if it weren't for the frustrations listed above.  Primarily the one that comes along with trying to get your character to move where you want them to go.			"

												Huge potential stumbles into a mediocre action platformer.  Valdis Story has excellent production value, but the art direction ends up a cluttered mess.  Light and shadow play no role in this universe, coming and going as they please.  It nauseates me, even though I love the anime aesthetic most of the time.The controls feel floaty and awkward.  To dodge attacks requires something akin to a three button maneuver, involving jumping and then performing the Hadouken joystick movement.  It is, quite simply, redundant and tedious seeing as most titles in this genre set dodging to one button.The platforming is an abomination.  Even very early in the game platforms are often tiny, and I often find myself falling all over the place, forced to retrace my steps.  Toss in archers/spellcasters who barrage you with projectiles whilst trying to platform and you've got a cocktail of frustration.  The problem is the core design.  Platforms don't need to be huge because he can hold into ledges, allowing for a lot of wiggle room.  The issue with this is that the characters are almost useless in mid air, so they depend on platforms to dish out attacks.  Hanging on ledges slows down the gameplay and cripples the characters to the point of absurdity.All things considered, this is a quality title that many can find enjoyment in.  It offers a deep development system of stats and skills.  And, as aforementioned, the quality is high.  It's just the core gameplay that I just can't get onboard with.			"

												Now I'm all about gameplay and this game has some really ♥♥♥♥ing mediocre controls. They're alright overall and ♥♥♥♥ing garbage when you really need them for some of the platforming and dodging. The whole combo system doesn't make sense, the more you hit♥♥♥♥♥♥the higher the combo but the combo tiers/exp rewards differ sometimes when you get the same combo length. There are also only a couple of good boss fights in the game but overall they're tedious as♥♥♥♥♥♥to take down with each one having their own obnoxious gimmick. The bosses themselves aren't exactly the worst♥♥♥♥♥♥to kill, it's when you get scored at the end of a boss fight that makes it obnoxious as hell. You get scored on how long it took to defeat it, how many times you got hit/how high your combo was, and how many bars of life you needed to defeat the boss. Trying to get that 'S' rank on a boss is hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥and annoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥to do. ♥♥♥♥ING DESTROYING CRYSTALS TO STOP A PASSIVE REGEN ON A BOSS ONLY TO HAVE THE CRYSTALS RESPAWN 30 SECONDS LATER FOR YOU TO RUN AROUND AND DESTROY AGAIN IS NOT FUN, IT'S TEDIOUS AS ALL ♥♥♥♥. Now I'm all for hard games that are actually, you know, hard. You get a feeling of mastering the game with your own skill. Valdis Story fights are mastering a cheesy gimmick and hoping that the controls don't ♥♥♥♥ you over when you have to dodge, jump and run around platforms. It's incredibly aggrevating. A few of the enemy designs are also annoying as hell to deal with, and you have to deal with them a lot. Like there are these floating ferals that can cast a wave of spells on the ground and if you get hit once, you're in for the whole ride. Man i wish the controls were better. Then the same enemy also has a shield they will deploy once they hit a certain threshold of hp, making them invinicble for about a few seconds. and the do this twice. this completely halts any action on this one specific enemy. I can forgive them if they just had it do the shield♥♥♥♥♥♥once, but twice? come on.The soundtrack for the game is well done though and overall the game looks very pretty.			"

												I really love Metroidvanias and that's why I bought this game. Unfortunately I got an unripe fruit that doesn't seem to ripen any time soon, if ever.Valdis Story: Abyssal City should be labeled as early access game. The game is (mostly) complete but it lacks severe polish and feels unfinished because of it. The controls are a bit wonky, there is some control lag and for some reason they are queued so if you input controls too fast, the character will perform all of them before stopping. On top of this all the font used reminds me of countless horrible Korean MMORPGs. Why was it chosen?The story is complex and I gave up trying to understand most of it. To get the best possible ending you are supposed to save all the cities and their inhabitants. This involves doing several tasks with some vague hints but if you venture too far in the game, you can't complete your task at hand. The game doesn't give you any indication of this. Oh yeah and you have to find all your friends too for reasons unknown. Most of them do nothing. Characters in general are all too shallow.I like challenging games when they are challenging for the right reasons. Most of the difficulty in Valdis Story is artificial. The hit detection and hit boxes are weird. There is no mercy-invincibility, which means you will be stun-locked and you will lose plenty of hp. Most of the bosses have tons of hp and moves that are impossible to dodge or guard against. To get the best grades (and rewards that help immensely!) you have to beat the bosses fast, without taking damage and performing a long enough combo on it. Save points are scarce and you have to keep backtracking to them unless you feel like being ambushed by a boss monster, dying and losing at least 30 minutes of gameplay. There are also plenty of timed puzzles and they require pixel-perfect maneuvering with various skills. Good luck with that with the weird controls.The game isn’t without good aspects and an update or two would fix most of the bad things listed but as of now, I can’t recommend this to anyone.			"

												After putting a few hours into the game I can't suggest this to most people unless you really enjoy an abusively difficult MetroidVania style game. Even on ""normal"" difficulty this game demands near-perfection from those who play. Some of the treasures you're trying to get are behind speed challenges that are so close you may as well start over on your very first mistake (even if it's a minor one). You will die, several times, so unless you find redoing things several times fun you will probably become frustrated at the design of the game. Finally the game is unstable, it's the only game in my library that crashes frequently (so I know it's not my computer) which is incredibly upsetting after you're doing well against a boss only for your progress to be lost due to a crash. That coupled with the infrequent save points just drains most of the fun out of this game real quick.			"

												   Excellent platforming done wrong. Your character will cling to every single wall it so much as touches, making some of the time-based challenges almost impossible, especially when not only does the character stick to walls, sometimes the walls stick to the character, leaving you unable to do anything for several seconds at a time.   The combat feels fluid to make up for that, but have fun finding a good key setup, seeing as the game has no mouse support at all and simply re-uses the same keys in different combinations. Also, to get that key set-up you desire will require you to systematically rebind every key in order. Got one wrong? Thought of something better during the process? Made a mistake? Too bad, you've got to redo the entire key-binding process.   Altogether, I enjoy the game for it's combat and flow, it feels  good, the idea of being torn between good and evil is also compelling, but it feels like I'm trying to have sex with through a blender every time I have to go through any dense platforming section. Would not reccomend in current state. "

												My review is mostly in line with what others have said.  The game has immense potential, but ultimatley the poor control mechanics and unbalanced difficulty hold it back, in addition to a few poor design choices, such as not having any sort of world map (users have had to resort to creating their own), as well as not having any objective identifiers or reminders (you will find yourself lost many times, and this is usually the most common forum question, some variation of ""where am I suppose to go now?). At this point I would argue the game is not quite ""there yet"" and it would be better for you to save your money until these issues are fixed.  The good news is that while these issues are pretty big, they should not be too hard to fix, and part of the reason I held off writing a review for so long was to give it time and see if the developers would start listening.  Unfortunatly that hasn't happened, and at this point I think the problems with the controls and difficulty have been brought up enough times by so many people it's hard to ignore.  It's been nearly a year, and they still have not added any sort of world map, any objectives, fixed the controls, or done anything to balance the difficulty.  Until the developers fix the controls and smooth out the difficulty, I have to recommend people avoid this game for now.  It feels like it isn't ready for prime-time yet.			"

												The game has a good ideal and concept, along with fun wepons and play style. However, none of that makes up for the horrid level design and what can only be discribed as cheapest bosses and boss like minions. The story would be good, however 90% of the time you have no ideal where to go as there is no direction or hint, and unlike other metrovania game you are unable to look at the whole map or even tell which map is what area. Normally by the time you ever get to a place where your suppose to be you have forgotten what the story was to get there in the beginning. Not to add since you have no ideal where to go or which bosses to fight, 3/5 times you go looking for the story you will find a seemingly unkillable boss. Which then leads to basically repetitive moves and eventually you getting stunlocked and beaten to death. Sometimes this is even more likely with the smaller ""weaker"" enemies as in everything in this game and basically eventually become immune and more often then not they begin to ""combo"" you or for a better example, hit you launching you into the rest of there attacks. The Devs made a good effort however havent really put there best foot forward alot of this could be solved by lowering stun times, or with some minor monsters getting rid of there immunity all together. Seriously a good chunck of the minions could be bosses with how strong they are. Theres literally no explaination for anything ever, trade this for that, or that for this, and more often then not you have no ideal what either do or why you would need them. I tried my hardest to like this game and for 4 - 5 days i kept comming back but why continue when you have less of a chance to beat these bosses then you do of getting a good win on candy crush. I would rate this easy a 4/10 and hopefully the devs try to fix stuff like the horrid hit boxes and all around unfair gameplay in the future, but honestly until then this is more worth like 5-8 dollars instead of the 15 they rip from your soul.

												While the art is good and the concept is interesting overall the game is poor. Despite a large selection of character I found them mostly bland and didn't care for any of them.Even though there's a large selection of items and helpers almost all are useless. The Paladin armour is effectively mandatory because without it's anti-ice abilities you'll be stun-locked by an enemy that can use ice.Most of the bosses can be beaten simply by button mashing and occationally avoiding one of their attack (which is often difficult to see as you character will be very close to them), rather than having to develop a strategy based on the spells and items you have.In order to save everyone and get the best items you have to read the guide because there's no way to figure this out most of the time. For example to save Tagnum you have to return to Tagnum at a time when you have no reason to go there and talk to someone who you have no reason to talk to.While time limits for puzzles are good because you only have to wait a few seconds to restart a puzzle if you can't solve if perfectly, they're terrible when you have to escape from somewhere because one mistake makes it impossible to escape and you have to wait for several minutes before you can try again.The map doesn't contain any information about where the exits lead to so expect to spend a lot of the time lost. Finally the lack of a save game plus means that all the work you put into your character will be lost and it you can't keep replaying so you can upgrade all the armour either.			"

												I'll start with the good:  The music and art are excellent and the story is interesting.  There's also a lot of fiddly customization for your character, their equipment, and their spells.Now, the rest:  For a Metroidvania game, it feels a little slow to introduce new navigational abilities, and the combat balance is weird; enemies I was beating easily at one point suddenly took many more hits to defeat on a return trip through the same area (this could be by design, but I don't care for it).  I was also pretty frustrated by the map system, in that it only showed the current section of the game world, so moving from one town to the next via the tram had a tendency to cause me to lose my bearings in relation to my current objectives; a clear map of the whole game world combined (at least as much as had been explored) would have been my preference.Those issues by themselves I could have lived with, but then the game introduced a timed escape run after one of the boss fights; one that took me through rooms with crumbling platforms that did not regenerate and were needed to move to the next area.  I flipped the bird at my monitor and uninstalled after my fifth attempt.			"

												This isn't a bad game... but it's missing something. The graphics are adorable, and a lot of it is pretty good, and I really really want to like this game, but I just can't. I don't know what it's missing, but it's missing something that takes it to that level of amazing, that it really could have achieved. The combat is fluid, and there's really nothing ""wrong"" with it, it just doesn't give you that same satisfaction and pure love that it's predecessors like Symphony of the Night, and Metroid have given. If you're looking for games in that genre, Dust: An Elysian Tale (sp?) does a better job and really pours the love into the game. All in all, this game looks great, and could be a ridiculously amazing, addictive game, but there's just something that makes it ""ok they made the mechanics good, but they pieced together level design and a non-engaging story"". Hopefully they come out with a sequel that fixes those issues, because this has so much potential.			"

												Cannot recommend this game as it is. The graphics and art style are gorgeous but the game is slow to reward the player's efforts and some issues with the responsiveness of the controls make for some very frustrating combat and platforming. The game has a non-linear structure with a semi-open world  but no useful map of any kind. No quest markers or indicators of directions or places where you haven't been yet.  Prepare for lots of clueless searching for hidden things, and backtracking. The old-school enemy re-spawn after a screen is re-entered makes for some annoying exploration too: Areas are split into screens (for no good reason in this day and age) If you exit a screen and then change your mind and re-enter it, you have to deal with all the stuff you just killed all over again. Hope to see issues fixed with an update as this could be a fantastic game.PS I have played for over 7 hours, no idea why Steam says its only one!			"

												Valdis story : Abyssal City is a Metroidvania type of game with quite interesting backround story and setting but shadowed a littlebit by frustratingly hard bosses. The game begins with your character dumped into an underwater city along with your now lost crew and point is to try search all of them and find out just what is going on.Population of the games world is split into 2 main factions which are Angels and demons, both sides trying to obliterate the other. Humans are minor third faction whose existance is comparable to fodder for both larger factions and their souls are used to bolster ranks of angels and demons. In Abyssal city another side called Ferals come into this equation, dangerous species who skulk around the Abyssal city and ruthlessly kill any who come in their way but for some reason they specifically hunt only angels and demons. You are a freedom fighter demi-human, a leader of your little crew consisting characters from all 3 factions. Every crewmember has, for personal reasons, pledged to your cause to fight both angels and demons. Each member gives you either an ability to summon him to aid you in a fight, work for you as a vendor in specific place in the game or teach powerful, castable finisher attacks to improve your combat performance.The game itself is basically sidescrolling hack and slash coloured with more or less difficult enemies, occasionally somewhat tough platforming and just insanely difficult bosses who are likely to have your hide several times until you figure their patterns and weaknesses. Thinking how you place your hard earned skill and stat points along with upgrading your picked up gear is imperative to make it to the end and using spells and buffs is occasionally a matter of life and death. For example an Ice buff against fire type enemies or bosses might actually save your controller/keyboard from immediate obliteration caused by momentual lack of better judgement due frustration.As it is, combat is very fluid, magic system works very well with melee combat system, weapons, armors and assistants are more than worthwhile to level up and with cooperation of skill trees and stats posses heavy effect to your combat style while allowing you to build, at least almost, the kind of fighter you want.. be it counter attacking warrior or backstabbing assasin type.. or just yolo going megacrit maniac.Valdis story has few game time connected events and doing something before its too late actually affects the later parts of the game. You are likely to waste much more time on your first playthrough but if you think it as a mere training run before the actual fun begins on the 2nd run, it makes Valdis Story : Abyssal City much more satisfying experience.

												When I played the beta build I was a bit skeptical, but now that I'm playing the final version I must say I'm impressed.The combat is very fluid. The basic attacks and magic spells chain well into each other and you have the ability to interrupt any attack to break into an evasive dash. This allows you to evade unforeseen attacks once it's too late to block them, and it also lets you flank your enemies by dashing right through them.The boss fights are both fun and challenging, and exploration is an important factor as it rewards you with neat treasure. If you're a fan of metroidvania-style games, you won't be disappointed!			"

												Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to anyone but those who love old-school hack-and-slash platformers. The game calls for fairly rigorous platforming almost right off the bat, which comes across as tedious rather than fun. The second boss you come across has a strategy of boxing you into a corner and pinning you there. IMO that's more mechanics abuse than strategy due to stun locks and jump mechanics limitations. It is a perfectly winnable battle, I just don't enjoy that type of gameplay. I can only imagine it gets more ""fun"" from there.			"

												One of the most refreshing games I've played in a while. As said multiple times in these recommendations, it definitely does the metroid-vania style proud; however, Valdis Story: Abyssal City one ups any metroid or castlevania game I've played in one area at the least, customization. How many people in Symphony of the Night wanted to use the nanchaku but was severely disappointed by how weak it was compared to your other weapons by the time you got it? This game solves problems like that, by making no weapon or armor a direct upgrade to another. This is by far my favorite part of the game, you can use any armor, and enjoy all the cool effects it may have, and not feel under powered. They all have stats of course, but the game focuses more on the stats you give yourself from level up, than the ones you obtain from weapons. The stat changes are simply for changing the play style of each. This concept goes for everything including armor, weapons, spells and accesories. The combat speed is very refreshing too, and different from most castlevania games where you hope two swings from your great sword kills an enemy, instead you're given situations where you need fast paced combos where you will need to utilise the skill cancel and dodging to keep up the offensive. However there are some bad points. One in my opinion is pretty terrible, because it directly clashes with my favorite point of the game, the customization. There are only 4 slave slots in the game, in a pc game where you're not held back by catridge size requirements, I don't see why this would ever be done. There are 16 different armors in this game, That means you can pretty much make 16 different builds for just one character, and there's 4 playable characters! You can see how frustrating it will be to make one save file for each character and decide on one build. Other than that there are a few small bad points but nothing to deter a buyer at the slightest, There was a sequence break (skipping ahead in the story) that I managed not entirely on purpose where I fought an endgame boss halfway through the story, and seeing that it took me an hour to kill it should have been my first warning to restart and ignore that boss, but I killed it and kept going anyway. The problem though is the game scales enemy difficulty with how far you are, and so the game has scaled the entire game to endgame difficulty and is much harder than I am quite comfortable with, but alas that is my fault... just a word to the wise, be wary of cold places near the third town...All in all, it's a great game, and you'll have hours of fun playing this. If you're a metroid-vania fan, this is a must buy.			"

												Sorry, I love metroidvania platformers. The art is nice, the controls are good, it's the level design that I hate. I am currently stuck in an area, along critical path*, where it requires some advanced skills from me to proceed. The game went from a good difficulty to near impossible after one boss fight. I cannot go back or save either, so all I can do is start again in a  save room, make my way to the boss fight, fight the hard♥♥♥♥♥boss and then be stuck, with no way to return, in a jump puzzle that is just f*cking hard as f*ck.I take it the devs are indie and have no idea of what critical path is and how it should not contain very hard a$$ puzzles to the point of making the game unplayable

												Despite there being seemingly endless potential for this game, and employing so many facets that Metroidvania fans crave, all potential  is destroyed by possibly the worst controls of all time. The dodge move, bafflingly assigned to the down key, works only 50% of the time, failing seemingly when the player needs it most. Combos are sluggish and unresponsive, resulting in frenzied button mashing which only traps your player in a loop that only the temperemental dodge move can interrupt - when it works. Add to this the need to open the magic menu with a combination of both the 'block' and 'skill' buttons (?!), two buttons that it's often easy to mash together accidentally, and combat feels less like a challenge and more like an ordeal.Platforming feels no better. Clambering stiffly up ledges feels unnatural, and actually worsens with the introduction of the wall jump 'ability', seeing your character ricochet blindly between the game's many contrivedly narrow ledges and low ceilings. It all clashes dreadfully with the level design; stages are immaculately presented, but they're a mess of scattered platforms and dull geometry.The worst thing of all? Throughout it all, there glimmers the promise of a truly excellent, open ended Metroidvania which is actually bolstered by tremendous graphics and music. How sad that absolutely none of it can detract from a game that feels less like entertainment and more like effort.			"

												Didn't expect much of this game, but was pleasantly surprised! Pro's Nice visual art style. It kind of reminded me of a game called ""Maple Story"". A lot more depth to combat than I expected thanks to equipment, stat distribution and talent points Nice metroidvania feel High replayability as there are 4 characters with a very different feel to their gameplay Actually pretty challenging bosses and tough platforming challengesCons There were some items that were limited. For example, there is only 10 Tamahagane that can be found in the game world, but that's not enough to buy all the items. You need to make choices. Apparently you also need to save civilians. I found that out by the end of the first playthrough, so I missed an entire feature of the game the first time around. However this system wasn't very clear to me during the second playthrough either. I hoped the world would have been bigger. There are only 3 ""real"" villages to go to. The storylines of the different characters have different text, but they all quickly connect to the main storyline and from there on it's basically the same (characters do say different things, but they conveniently all end up the same). Only one character had an extended ending scene (but don't expect much of that, it's really not even a minute extra with a few lines and actions) "

												Valdis Story let me down as I liked the graphics, animation and the genre of the game though found the end result somewhat distasteful.  The combat initially was appealing, but quickly became more laborious than fun.  Attacking seemed fulfilling and fun until you play for a while and are faced with enemies that repeatedly block your attacks or stun-lock you.  These can be worked through so it is not that it is hard, it is that the game slows down drastically and stops being fun.  Combine this with constantly getting knocked off ledges and you find yourself wondering if your time could be better spent elsewhere.  I was hoping for something more akin to a Castlevania game where you are quickly moving through enemies and anxiously exploring up until a challenging boss showdown.  Valdis did not have that same feel and was overlayed with a disjointed story that fails to grab your attention.  Additonally there were more platforming elements than necessary in an action RPG, which immediatley turned me off.  There was potential here, but it ultimately disappoints.			"

												A very good game I can't recomend because it has too many small flaws that add up to too much major frustration.  There is no world map, which is very necissary.  There is nothing to remind you where you were supposed to go for your next objective if you come back after a break (it will tell you what to get but not where to go to get it).  Little explanation about what items you can get in the game what they actual do or what they're for or how valuable they are.  The spell system is awful, essentailly having 24 different spells 20 of which you will never use.  UNTIL the end boss fight where you suddenly need to use them. Great design right  there.  This game should be good, it has good pixel graphics, it has a fun combat system, interesting lore and characters but it chooses to be challeneging instead of fun.  Bosses are more often frustrating than interesting.  And by the time you learn the basics of the combat (that are necissary for it be fun) you're already half way through the game.  By the time you really think about how you need to build your character it's already the end of the game.I'm sure this game has some major appeal with hardcore fans, but for a general player, it needs some work.  I know this isn't only me, you will notice only ~10% of people have completed the game.  If you buy this be prepared to be the 90% unless you're a hardcore platforming/adventure/fighting game fan.

												The good:Graphic style and animations are good.  Boss fights are good with the exception of..The bad:No warning when you enter a boss area, and then you are pretty much stuck until you beat it or lose your progress.  Never been a fan of crafting or collection activities, so if you do like this sort of thing, then you can disregard.The fustrating:The amount of hit a switch and run to a now open door timed events that barely give you enough time to be successful causing you to have to repeat them over and over.    Controls feel delayed, there are harsh recovery times after you perform an action that will constantly having you take more hits then you should. Jumping is a pain since you constantly grab onto ledges you don't want to, you will often do a mario style ground stomp by accident and fall for miles, and the inconsistancy when you want to grab on a wall and jump off of it and your guy simply refuses to do it half the time.  Most enemies block, which can prolong what should be a simple smack it and move on fight into a 10 second ordeal for just 1 enemy; this is increased 10 fold when you are in cramped corners and can't get around said enemy and all it does it block, you have to just wait and wait until it moves.  Spell casting using the D-pad, and each direction doing a different spell (i would MUCH rather have spell slots that you can equip to it's own button).  You will constantly be casting the wrong spell when under pressure.			"

												An otherwise brilliant metroidvania game hindered by frustrating combat and awkward controls. I really really want to like this game and it was on my wish list forever but it was quite a disappointment.PROS:-Its metroidvania!! (I'm a fanboy of the genre which makes this review that much more painful)-Great art style-Variety of moves and spells: You can find various spell orbs that grant a class of spell (fire, ice, etc) that gives 4 abilites. Some are used for mobility which opens up new map areas.-Variety of viable builds-""Money"" consists of collecting varios crafting mats and trading them with vendors. A very good change from traditional coin collection.CONS:-Recoil in combat results in chain-stuns. This is especially prevalent in the air. In the forced fight rooms, it is not uncommon to get hit once in the air and then chain-stunned to death (from a long series of 3-5 damage hits). Look at how many other negative reviews complain about this issue.-Only one save slot alloted to each character. You can have different character runs saved, but each character only gets one save slot. This, combined with the fact that you can end up in ""dead-end"" situations where your character is too weak to beat an enemy but you're retry point is stuck, you are forced to backtrack. Not too often, but it happens.-AWFUL air combat/controls. -SWING AND A MISS! Sometimes you will swing at enemies *directly* in front of you but completely miss. This is almost always followed up by you getting hit by them, of course, leading to the aforementioned chain-stun issue if other enemies are around. (especially prevalent in air combat)-Can't look down.  At the top of a tall room and need to work your way down slowly? Sorry, tough luck. Just jump and hope you land on a platform.-No quick retry option: retrying restarts you in the room with full health (so you dont use up your potions since the game does not have save points [which refill potions] before bosses...). You must either wait to die or go to your inventory -> main menu -> yes i want to quit -> skip opening video -> retry...it doesn't take that long but why the 3 extra steps? I should be able to hit Escape->retry.			"

												As a lover of other Metroidvanias, this game frustrates me to no end. I'll try to sum up my complaints in a manner that is meaningful to those looking into this game.First of all, I feel like a distinction needs to be made. This game is not a Metroidvania at heart. At heart, it is an action RPG with (minimal) exploration elements. Valdis Story's focus is on combat, and that's fine because combat is one of the things that it does quite well. The problem is everything else feels like it is tacked on. It feels like the combat system was developed first and then the rest of the game was developed around it.The map, for a metroidvania game, is awful. It is always scoped in on the area that you are in and there is no way to see any of the other areas you have been to or how they even connect. I would even be willing to forgive that, were it that the map actually showed anything useful at all. It is only comprised of boxes that represent the rooms of the area and the entrances and exits of each. It doesn't show anything else useful, like treasures you missed, or locked doors, or anything along those lines. Some of the rooms are color-coded, but there is no key, so the player has to try and figure out what color means what - the only thing I worked out was that green rooms were save rooms. The map leaves much to be desired.The platforming controls are terrible. The combat controls are good, but the platforming controls are bad. The jump feels really stiff and floaty and the wall grabs and wall jumps take a lot of time to get used to. This really wouldn't be a huge deal, but the game likes to throw platforming sequences at you where you need to be precise. I also don't see why the developer decided to throw some of the later abilities - double jump, an ability to make a platform to reach tall spaces - into the spells category, so every time you need to use them you have to mess with your spells and make sure you have enough MP. The boss fights are the thing that kept me coming back, because some of them are fairly interesting, but they get cheaper as the game goes on. You should pretty much expect to get completely wrecked by never-ending stunlock combos the first few times you try a boss, because you have no invincibility frames upon getting hit. I think the developer intended for the player to use the cancel you are given to dash out of these situations, but there are times when that is impossible - try it in big attacks and you will simply waste a cancel while still being caught in the move. If you try to dodge one of the many enemies placed on the edges, you'll end up slamming down into the pit that you were trying to clear. Not to mention, if you don't get a good grade on the boss fight, you miss out on stats for your character - why they thought this was a good design decision, I have no idea. It only benefits those good or lucky enough to attain those grades and further punishes players who are struggling.Most of the collectibles feel pretty worthless, because they are either crafting materials that only feel important when you want to make something and don't have enough, or sets of armor or accessories that aren't as good as what you have because they don't fit your build or playstyle. There are health and mana upgrades, but they are mixed in with the rest of the lackluster collectibles.The story feels really contrived and generic, and there just wasn't enough there to make me care about who I was playing, or why. If you're looking for a game with decent combat and a cool cancel mechanic, I'd recommend picking this up. But if you're looking for a true Metroidvania, I'd at least look a little harder before buying it.			"

												Don't be fooled by the hours I have played this game. It's just pretty much me just looking at the manual trying to make sense of how the game mechanics work, that and also forgetting that the game is open in the first place. First of all, yes beginner tutorial for this game is very 'light'. As in, they only pop-up at the beginning ONCE and never again to be seen anywhere. Not to mention the fact that they barely even any explanation that exist in-game about how the skills works in this game. If you want to learn about the mechanics, then google the .PDF manual for this game. Yes, it is that saddening. In this day and age where game manuals are not used anymore, especially the fact, that it should not be usable for a game that only exist as a digital download. Second, the fighting techniques are not satisfying at all. I find that fighting the mobs and bosses, was just a very 'meh' experience. The usual jump, dodge, then basic attacks (barely ever need to use the skills, or maybe that is just me, cause for the life of me, they seem useless and doesn't make sense despite the manual's explanation) is not exactly fun. Compare this game to other platform games like 'Guacamele' this is just ""Eh, not worth it,"" in my honest opinion. Third, the one that annoys me the most about this game is the map system. It's useless, I don't even freaking know where I was at, and where I am supposed to be in the first place. I just end up going around maps, back and forth without any indication where I am supposed to be heading for. The mainly reason why this game is lost on me.Overall, I really, really wanted to like this game. But I just can't. Quite frankly, I am annoyed I spent money on it. It's a very visually appealing game that comes with a great soundtrack, but the game mechanics are making the experience not fun. I'll probably try to play the game more and more in the future because I truly want to like the game, but at the moment, I just had enough of the game's bad mechanics. It's not fun, it's annoying and confusing.			"

												Platformer/Brawler with an awsewome battle system, great soundtrack and beautiful visiuals. Even the story is good. Not the best, but still good. In addition to that, it has some Zelda like gameplay elements, where you get new items from bosses with which you can reach places in old regions you couldn't get to at first. You choose from two different characters and then start to fight your way through the hordes of demons and angels to find a way out from the bottom of the sea. Killing enemies rewards you with XP (to level your character up) and sometimes materials that you can trade for items like armors, accessoirs and new weapons. There are many secrets to find and the different difficulties and the two characters create some kind of replayability. Therefor, the game is kinda short. You can beat it in 3 hours. But your first playthrough will be longer. Maybe 5 or 6 hours. Depending on how good you can handle this kind of games. Pros: - battle system - different characters - many secrets to unlock - visuals and audio - level system Cons: - short - can be very hard			"

												****One of the ONLY games around that does actual SKILL based difficulty.  Choosing your difficulty at the start doesn't just give the enemies you face more HP and damage, they gain entirely new skill sets and abilities to challenge you.****Some of the most fun I've had in a video game in quite some time.  The bosses in Valdis Story are incredibly well put together.  The fights are hard, but structured in such a way that you can learn from your mistakes, and improve your play over time.  As a result, it is immensely satisfying when you finally take down that boss with an S rating. This is a very skill-based metroidvania RPG with some  impactful character customization, an interesting story, and amazingly fluid combat.Oh did i mention the music? Some of the best video game music I have had the pleasure to put my ears to.  ***Using a controller over a keyboard will vastly improve your experience with this game***Edit for the update: The new update brings 2 new playable characters and a slew of new things to explore and bosses to fight in the world.  Quality update for sure.			"

												While the story and art direction draw you in, I couldn't help but get frustrated at the platforming controls. Probably the most irritating instance of this is the wall jump that behaves counterintuitively to how you'd expect it to and sends you jumping in the opposite direction from the direction you push. Having just played a reasonable amount of Ori and the Blind Forest, which has some incredibly tight, responsive controls for a platformer, this doesn't have the same fluidity. Another gripe is the respawning enemies. Leaving a room means that all of the enemies respawn when you reenter the room, which can turn some rooms into a massive grind, especially if the adjacent room only contains a treasure chest.Probably worth investigating as part of a cheap bundle, I wouldn't recommend paying full price.

												Putting stats in your gameplay inevitably hurts the game. You need only look at the dank, miserable two hit kill boss rush of any of the Metroidvanias or the tedious grind of the Infinity Blade games for a primer on that.But if you had to put stats in your game, you could do a lot worse than copying Valdis Story.Even though you are only using attack and magic as your tools of the trade, even though any and every build you use will require you to use both (A Dex Wyatt swings bleeding critical strikes, an Int Wyatt swings magical strikes...), and even though there are really only four stats, each stat, along with the perk trees and the light dark alignment, ensure your path to dealing endgame damage will be distinct from all the others. And yet the perks and points are all in the realm of added effects and slide bumps here and there. The power creep is tightly controlled. You CANNOT ignore build planning but at the same time it will rarely ever ramp up to make the game trivial.It's a shame then that this system, like so many others in the game, hides most of its info from you. Valdis Story seldom communicates clearly to you. It speaks English, but always seems to be talking past you, like it's the second game in an imaginary series. The world is a bit vague, the dialogue is so sparse you barely can match face with name on the characters, the weapon and armor upgrading is spread out to vendors in various towns and quite often you don't realize the scarcity of the materials you are using for upgrades until you run out and there simply will not be any more. (In the brilliant simplicity of this game though upgrade trees are seldom any deeper than two upgrades off base. The fat is cut completely out of this system.) Entire towns can disappear from the map, sometimes if you don't pay attention to their problems but other times if you fail to meet entirely arbitrary and unhinted criteria.But it's worth meeting Valdis through this. The combat is solid and satisfying, with some truly brutal enemies and combos flying back and forth, instant cancel/dodges, a wide variety of spells to chuck and a few different weapons to swing around. The bosses especially are wild rides. The art is memorable, sharp colors with pleasant maybe-sorta-anime-but-probably-some-other-culture character design. In the game's typical unpolished style, some of the spells are stinkers and some hit far harder than their animations suggest, so experimentation is rewarded. The soundtrack too is quite lovely.It's hard to put into words how disconnected Valdis Story feels from the gamer though, with all the little imperfections at the edges creeping up on you. Bizarrely strong/weak enemies placed haphazardly, the language of the game never quite engaging you, the hit effects on spells and weapons never quite suggesting your power as much as the number flying off the enemy... But Valdis is worth the extra effort it takes to engage. It's quick, briskly paced, with two different characters (More coming soon... but Valve soon, it seems.), each with at least three viable builds to their credit. There's a lot here, and though it will never quite gel to be the ideal indie metroidvania and it will take a bit more effort on your part to figure out its cryptic song, the mix of solid RPG stat mechanics, good action combat and bosses, and the lovely world is worth your time.

												Excellent Metroidvania mixed with Hack&Slash and RPG elements.At the moment of this review, only 2 characters are out, while other 2 are being developed. Even without those 2, the game is extremely good.The characters playstyles have a lot of depth as well. Depending on how you build them you have a lot of different approaches. You could sneak up on enemies, or hit them hard with your magics, you could be an extremely agile character, running back and forth hitting your enemies, or simply facetank them.The skill system provides unique synergies, some more obvious than others, and the playable characters have a few different weapons you can use, each having their unique combos, ranging from lightning fast attacks, to slow and hard hitting, and even some with special quirks like long range attacks or granting buffs to yourself via combos.On top of the playable characters, part of the game is finding your crew, which provide you with support. You can summon some to attack your enemies and buff yourself, while others grants you techniques, upgrade your gear or simply function as extra shops.And you are going to need all that help. The bosses are pretty tough, perhaps even too tough at first glance, however, if you learn how to dodge and block, you'll find them very rewarding when you get a high score.The game does a good job of telling the story without taking the controls from you for too long, while the music will make you want to stay way too long in certain areas, because its so good. The art at first i didn't like that much, but eventually it grows on you.Anyways, buy this, alright? game's good.			"

												Valdis Story is a Metroidvania style game focusing on a war between an Army of Demons and an Army of Angels. The visuals are impressive for a kickstarter game that raised less than $50,000. The combat is combo based and fun, while the leveling trees are very mmo inspired. The map feels large and takes some time to get your bearings and over the course of the game you are given new spells and items that help you explore it more thoroughly. It is not currently complete as of writing this, two characters have yet to be implimented and there are bugs here and there but from my experience they are minor. In my opinion, it is an enjoyable game though one that will require multiple playthroughs to get the best endings.			"

												YES!!This is what it's about.  Friggin sweet swordplay, dashing, magic, poofy hair and a bad attitude.  This game rocks the block!I like the blocking, parry he is stunned, do a 5 hit combo, knocks him into oblivion in a colorful fireworks of glory, I get a bunch of points and an item.  Sweet.The story is good, if not just a reason to go to different areas.  There is an addicting upgrade system, hard bosses, new weapons, combos, etc. etc. etc.  This game is very good.I don't like getting more reward for killing a boss more effeciently.  (How the HELL do you spell that?) I mean the difference between a bad fight and a perfect one is like an HOUR OF GRINDING!!  It's stupidly huge.  Which makes you die on purpose if your fight was 'meh', so you can do it over again.  Not impressed with that.Haven't played the other games and haven't beat this one, but it sure caught my attention.   "

												The best game of 2013 that I discovered in 2015. Possibly the best metroidvania title that I have had the pleasure to explore. The best combat in any 2D platformer - and by far better and more engaging than in the vast majority of contemporary action games. Valdis Story deserves way more attention than it has received.			"

												Valdis Story gets a 10/10 for me. Gameplay reminds me of a Metroidvania, but with combat style of Devil May Cry or UMVC3 conbat. Combat, art style, soundtrack are all spectacular. Lots of replay value with multiple characters to play and cool story additions for each replay. My friends and I have a podcast and we voted it game of the year. Love Valdis Story: Abyssal City!			"

												Valdis Story is one of the best Metroid-Vania games I've played and one of the best games I played last year. Valdis' biggest strength is it's combo based fighting. It's quite fluid and once you get the hang of it the game becomes quite fun to play. Enemy and boss encounters don't feel routine and that helped a lot with keeping me engaged in the game. Valdis also has back tracking to find additional hidden goodies once you unlock certain skills that help to aid in your exploration. If that isn't enough for you there is also 4 different characters to play as with unique weapons that all play differently. All in all I quite liked Valdis Story and I would highly recommend it to fans of Metroid-Vania games.Word of warning: you will probably want a gamepad for this game. The game is also quite difficult.			"

												It's damn good.The writing and supporting cast are good.  Really down-to-earth good.Combat becomes increasingly fluid as you increase the complexity and variety of attacks in your combo by mixing up light and heavy, ground and aerial, melee and magic skills.  The rating of your combo improves based on length and variation and awards an exp bonus.Some bosses are very hard, but their patterns are deliberate.  Study them, bring the right magic.  A patch sometime last year began saving your spell layout even when you adjust it after a savepoint - this makes a world of difference when you're testing and adjusting your strategies.With four playable characters, each with many unique build paths depending on stat, spell, weapon, and item allocations.  Stat and spell resets are available in-game once per playthrough at a special merchant.  Save before resetting points at level 20 and you may quickly test all max builds.  However, different allocations will also greatly affect boss strategies in early-to-mid game if you're going for speedruns.  Your character building decisions are meaningful at all stages of the game.This is my most highly recommended game for 2013-14.			"

												This is easily one of the best metroidvania's I have ever played. It has rpg mechanic's that I have never seen in a metroidvania. Not only does it have equipable gear, but also upgradeable gear, a skill tree, and all kinds of magic.There is 2 characters to choose from at the beginning and 2 more are unlockable which means meaningful replay value thanks to the rpg mechanics. Typically in castlevania games you unlock 2 characters at the end of the game and those characters cannot equip items so what you start with is what you end with and the run is basically easy mode because you aren't gated by anything. I don't know what else to say, but if you like metroidvania's and if you like Dark Souls you should play this.			"

												I turned on the game to test the steam streaming feature and 3 hours later noticed that I hadn't stopped playing the game. Its combat is a ton of fun and its got enough direction that you wont feel lost to be combing around looking for keys or bosses. You wont be bored to look around and it has a great deal of customization for weapons armor magic ect. You can completely change your play style several times over on just one play through. bottom line play this game and you wont be disappointed unless you don't have hands or are blind.			"

												as was mentoned in other reveiws this game is a metroidvania in the truest sense, and it is difficult. I don't mind the difficulty of the fighting because it is very rewarding. however one thing that I would like to mention is the EVERY room in the game has a puzzle where you hit a switch and have a time limit to get through the door. some of these ""puzzles"" are frame perfect and you will find your self rolling into the newly closed door over, and over, and over agian. other than that the game is great! you have been warned and have fun!

Some may complain about the platforming, and while it is a little jagid at first, after the 1st playthrough and getting the systems down, its actually pretty easy.  One thing to note though however, start with wyatt, i started with reina and ended up really dis liking the game with her, mainly due to not really getting the systems till the 2nd time through, they dont call her a advanced class for nothing.

												I really love this game, definetely on of the best side scrolling platformer/brawler I've played.From a technical standpoint the game has an amazing esthetic, truly beautiful and unique levels and a great soundtrack you can even listen to outside of the game. Enemys and bosses look great too, and there are a lot of effects put into every attack.The Story is to the most part interesting, it's a really cool setting, and there is a lot lore if you want to read it, otherwise you don't have to.Gameplay wise it offers a lot of diversity, from different weapons, enemy tactics, and lots of magic spells, for attacking enemys or platforming. I especially liked the leveling system, with many skills that will give your character a different looking effect.You can really put a lot of time into perfecting you fighting skills, but after about 15 hours you should reach the level cap of your character. But fear not, you can still upgrade your character with equipment and gain skill points in other ways, so it's allways usefull killing enemys.Apart from that there are 4 different characters to play, which are all worth checking out. There is also a lot of replayability in raising the difficulty, even though I admit I couldn't do with the hardest one, getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked really often.So you can really put a lot of hours into the game if you like, or just play through once in 15-20 hours. (At least that's how long I took, and I really took my time.)So I can only recommend the game, even if you aren't into side scrollers, you could really enjoy this.			"

												Valdis Story is a really incredible metroidvania. There is a lot of content here, four characters (after an upcoming patch), many bosses, varied enemies, tons of weapons (all of which have varied playstyles), skill trees, accessories, followers, armors... There is just SO MUCH in this game that it feels like stealing from the developers for only $15.Don't play this without a controller, and be warned that it is a very difficult game.			"

												Good Story and very very beautiful soundtrack.Easy to learn but hard to master combat system. Fight better for better rewards.Boss battles and the game feature a high replayability.(Different chars with different endings and playstyles)The overall map and level design is ""metroidvania""-style. Which i liked very much.One does not simply play this game just one time.			"

												A beautiful, beautiful game, this game is really fun. This game sounds great and looks great, the combat of this game is fun and fast-paced. The gameplay is as quick and stylish like DMC, the pixle art is handrawn and well made, the music gets you pumped when you are fighting bosses and slow when in towns, the platforming is very strict witch made me a bit angry. This game is a metroid-vainia game but it is kind of linear. I give this game a 8/10, a great game.			"

												My first impressions of this game weren't great, I saw raocow's let's play of the game, which... well, let's just say it was a trainwreck. I didn't fully dismiss this game but at that point it wasn't something I intended to get unless it was part of a bundle.And then Humble Bundle put it in a bundle. So here we are.I'm definitely glad I gave this game a chance, it's pretty enjoyable in its own right. Though it leans more towards the vania of metroidvania, which is my less-preferred style of gameplay, there's still pretty decent platforming controls. Sometimes a little stiff and sluggish, but. Good enough. The combat is really fast-paced and pretty satisfying, hard to master (I still haven't come close) but rewarding the better your character gets. The RPG elements in the game are a bit shaky, most accessories have too strong of a tradeoff for one, and the best way to build a character in this game is, without fail, dumping all your points into a single stat. There's a lot of spells I never even touched because I just wasn't interested in the magic of this game, you have a pretty limited MP pool and no real way to recharge it in-combat. The game's overworld is pretty meaty in size, some 15 or so unique zones with different enemies and gimmicks, quite a lot of treasures to find and timed platforming challenges to overcome. It's satisfying to explore and find all there is to find, definitely, and that's one of the game's biggest strengths. The story is... shaky, really, you're dumped in the middle of a new environment with characters who seem to know each other well and the backstory for the plot is confined to secrets. I think more of the basic plot could be better conveyed aside from just an opening cutscene. There's some frustrations to be had, though. The controls' stiffness can get in the way of platforming at times, there's a lot of instances of enemy spam or badly-placed enemies making rooms harder than they should be to traverse, a really badly designed escape sequence halfway through the game, and extra bosses that are way tankier than they have any right to be (especially the last one, which is the barrier to getting the best weapon in the game, at a point where it's not really useful anymore... oh well.) There's a few boss arenas that are kind of awful, too (Shu Gohth and Treu especially, Jazracht is a close third). And the fact that the game's towns can disappear if you miss events is a bit of an annoyance; you can be in a situation with basically no way to improve some of your gear if they vanish.It's far from a flawless game but it's enjoyable enough and definitely merits its asking price. New stuff is constantly added, too, apparently! So there may be even more to find in the future, who knows. Check it out if you like metroidvanias, certainly.			"

												This is a game I really have wanted to like fully since I bought it, but for every one thing good it does, there is an egregious error committed that holds it back. I love the art and the soundtrack is one of the best in any game I've played. The things I do like are the feel of combat and dodge cancels. They are spot on. That being said, I dislike the magic, as I feel it is not very useful outside of the platforming spells. I would have rather this game taken the traditional metroidvania route and just gone with stock spells. Another reason for this is apparently the reason I was having a hard time with the final boss is that I ""missed items"" and ""didn't build properly."" How did I manage to get to the final boss then? It's just nonsense. A more curated metroidvania experience would have helped this game tremendously. The map is pretty terrible to try and go back and collect things, so even if I wanted to 'right the wrongs' I made when just playing the game like every other, it's much harder to do than I care to invest my time. There isn't really any reference manual that I was aware of to clarify game elements that I was having trouble with. I had to actually leave the game and look up stuff online, which breaks immersion and ultimately worsens my experience with any game, this one included.A final thing I will include about that bosses. I generally liked the boss fights, except when enemies went into armored mode/healed HP. More often than not, this phase just unnecessarily dragged out the length of the fight, leading to boredom. This is especially true for the final boss fight, where 90% of the fight is fighting armor (which can later instantly heal - TERRIBLE IDEA) and the other 10% is slow, situational damage. I'm sure if I cared enough, I could force myself to beat it. But it's boring and tedious and I don't care, which is a failure on the part of the game design to hold my attention.			"

												Despite the fact this game isn't what I was hoping for, I wouldn't say I don't recommend it. That's not to sday I recommend it either though. I'm a pretty eclectic gamer and this appeared to tick a lot of boxes for me but I can't get passed the shoddily slow controlling of a face paced game. When it comes to wall jumping it's ridiculously tedious.Aside that, from what I've played (Two towns open, about five crew members recovered and onto my fourth or fifth boss) It's ok. I'd certainly not write home about it but I won't be starting a fire in the basement of the developers residence either. It's just not for me.			"

												Other than it being edgy as frick, this is possibly one of the best games I've played on Steam. I had to skip through the entire storyline which I generally dislike doing but I had to in order to finish the game.Cringy story aside, the actual gameplay is REALLY good and one of the very very VERY FEW games I would label as a true Metroidvania styled game. I hate that term because the definition has become so loose thanks to so many stupid indie games ♥♥♥♥ing it on the first date that literally any game can be called a Metroidvania now. ""This game gives you a double jump ability!"" ""THAT'S A ♥♥♥♥IGN METROIDVANIA, BRO!"" One thing that I really liked about this game was the way it thought outside of the box, one example is that THE DOUBLE JUMP ABILITY IS OPTIONAL! Right now there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ indie dev who just had a mental breakdown over there not being a double jump ability in a game with heavy platforming elements. A lot of the platforming puzzles have a good balance of challenge and creativity without being outright stupid or too difficult.The combat and overall gameplay is nice and tight like a clean, virgin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It doesn't feel like you ever get any unfair hits or die because the enemies R 2 STRONK. To post in language that most of you mouth breathers can understand, IT'S DA 2D BERSION OF DURK SOLS! Any game that you can't just speedrun on your first try and requires actual thought and learning is Dark Souls apparently, and that's what this game is. You have to adapt to the game, the game doesn't adapt to you. Any game that breaks away from preconceived methodology and generic structuralization is good in my book.t;drIt's a good game, just play it and don't get butthurt when you realize you ♥♥♥♥ing suck at video games.

												This is a game I hope more people try, because it is a love letter to Metroidvania fans.  Valids the Abyssal city is very much a Metroidvania clone, with a 2-d world that is large and sprawling, but with many areas locked off until you get the necessary key or ability to get past them.  The story is fairly good for what it is.  It focuses on a conflict between angels and demons where neither is truly good, both are corrupt, and humans are caught in the crossfire.  In an underwater city that they are warring in, you must defeat both sides and find your way out.  The characters are pretty cool and it is engrossing.The combat is pretty unique.  It focuses on a combo system mixing light and heavy attacks, almost like a fighter, however you can use spells, special abilities, and support characters to shake things up.  Also, the more hits or special ways you fight enemies, the more experience you get, as your consecutive hits or fighting styles give bonuses.What I absolutely love about this game is the replayability.  Four characters are planned, but only two are unlocked.  That being said, each character plays differently and interacts with the world differently.  Wyatt fights with a sword, but can also unlock daggers and a bow, or twin swords, or even fight with his fists, each being upgradeable with different abilities.  Reina uses her fists to start, but can use dark totems, a quarter staff, or a gigantic mace later on.  They both play differently and have different spells, offering a truly unique playthrough for each character.Some problems with the game are that to upgrade items, you sometimes have to grind against enemies to drop the necessary components for upgrading them.  There are also sections that seem to be awaiting an update, like the two other characters we can't play as yet.  And some of the items you can buy are near impossible to get because the items they want in trade, this game uses a barter system, are so rare.That said, Valdis Story is well worth the price.  The graphics are quite nice, the combat is fluid and fun, it is challenging, but not frustrating, and offers a large amount of replayability.  A sequel has been teased in the end credits and I dearly hope we get it.  This game is just fun.  It's not revolutionary, but it is a blast to play.			"

Captains Log, 07.09.2016Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Valdis Story: Abyssal City. Atmospheric, story driven action-plattformer. ANGELS! DEMONS! 2.348 NPC's! Crafting! Jump & Slash!!First look at the game: also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv]Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a skill based jump&fight game that features a crafting system as well as a spell and skill system. That makes it an ARPJ&RG (Action-roleplaying jump&run game). Kind of. It is very hard to compare it to other games, because it features so many aspects of different genres:  The Jump & Run part of the game is about different aspects that include exploration, timing, fighting, interacting and well….jumping and running.    The Roleplaying part of the game is where it gets more interesting for me (the old ARPG junkie that I am). You can earn experience points during the course of the game which you can spend in three different skill trees alongside some attributes that can be increased too. This gives you a lot of control over how your character plays through the game. Also: There is loot to equip you character and some materials for crafting!      You control one of three characters; choice diversifies after you accomplish certain achievements (hooray! for replayability). You can use a controller for that and I would recommend doing so.    Once in a while you meet npc´s who you can interact with. There is quite some dialogue in this game. And you can read through it at your choice of pace.(Story mode enabled!)The game starts with something I would call a silent tutorial. That means that the game leads you into its inner workings and controls pretty smooth and with a minimal amount of frustration. Whilst doing so it does not use tutorial pop-ups or a teacher entity. It works perfectly. You can enjoy the atmosphere that the game offers, explore a bit, experiment a bit and after some time you are being led into the first fight, then the first boss encounter and then an enemy that does actually require you to do some action-thinking and spellcasting while dodging enemy spells a.k.a. The fun beginsLook and feel and sound:Valdis Story features a good looking eastern comic style graphic, a fitting soundtrack, nice sound effects and most important of all in this case, precise and easy to master basic controls. For advanced controls you will need to do some training.Captains Orders:Valdis Story may look cute because of its comic/manga graphic style, but is really a very nice and demanding action platformer with some RPG –elements and there is loot! It is a very good game! Solid and well thought through. And above all it is easy to start up but I expect it to be giving the player some real challenges. If you can enjoy a nice story on the side and also like a lot of player’s choice you will find it in Valdis Story: Abyssal City. Both in terms of amount of story wanted and speedy or slow play through.Verdict:Cargo! Definite Cargo material, will stream this some time, but other games are just a bit more intriguing at the moment. That is totally a personal preference. Could be certainly a treasure for real 2D Action-Adventure Fans (I could have written metroidvania style) [just saying]{…but I didn’t}.For more Reviews visit  CaptNemo's Log[captainnemoweb.wordpress.com]For Gameplay Videos and live streaming visit CaptN3mo's twitch channel[www.twitch.tv] "

												One of the best, if not the best, Metroidvania games I've played on Steam. Great level-building system and RPG elements and a fluid combat system combined with vibrant art-style and a multi-layered world. The game perhaps plays like a mixture of Castlevania SOTN, Dark Souls, and Maple Story. It lends itself to many viable approaches and builds and the battle mechanics are perhaps the deepest I have ever seen in a Metroidvania-style game. Would second other reviews on boss and enemy animations needing better cues for their attacks.			"

												Do you enjoy frustration? Boy do I have the game for you! I got this game quite a while back in a sale, and finally got some time to start clearing backlog. I was rather looking forward to this given the screenshots I had seen, and it seemed fun enough at first. Times change.First of all, you get almost zero explanation on anything, yet you are expected to know anyway. You'll be afflicted by status ailments whose effect you will not know, you will require upgraded gear that you are never prompted to make, you will have to run all over creation to revisit old places, and you will be stunlocked to hell if you get hit at an inopportune moment.I had some problems with early bosses, but I was still figuring out mechanics and controls so no biggie, yeah? Other bosses were even quite fun. You'll find a few eventually though that will just be brick walls. I would slam my head against them for an hour and barely squeak past. I finally struggle my way to the final boss, who I discover to be the most awful of the lot. After coming close to actually physically slamming my face on the desk I decide to see if I can find any help online, only to discover almost all the tips out there suggest specific talent and stat builds or items which, ding ding ding, are very poorly explained in-game or likely not at all. It was here that I finally decided to give up because the last save point I was given was before another boss who I really didn't want to deal with a second time.Alright so you might want to go beyond my limit and tough it out, right? All the enemies in the game scale with your level, making all that backtracking you're going to have to do to find those items a right pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The ""fast travel"" system (if you can even call it that) is almost hilariously limited so you'll be trekking around the entire map for hours to get all the stuff you want. The terrain is incredibly annoying to traverse after the first time, in part due to having to swap out your magic spells that are required for it, which may not be the ones you want in combat. I'm not usually one to back off from a challenge, and the difficulty here is actually manageable (if perhaps mislabeled on the select screen). But this combined with plethora of poor design decisions and pure irritation so many other facets of the game can cause just make it not worth the time.			"

												A good effort at a side-scrolling action RPG but suffers from some critical issues. Combat is meaty but limited and often you get rushed with no chance of attacking until half your health is gone. The platforming is floaty and weak at times, which leads to incredibly frustrating battles as maqny enemies (and even some bosses) can knock you out of the sky with a single hit. There's a weightlessness to everything that makes Valdis Story hard to love and sometimes a chore to play. If you want a retro-style game experience, complete with clunky controls and often unfair failures, I'd say give it a go. If not, be prepared to take a lot of hits and deaths that don't feel like your fault.			"

												It's a game that had great potentional but has a serious short coming.  The ""puzzles"" are way to complicated and require almost perfect timing.  I would assume the gaming industry would figure this isn't the old school NES where they can add better challenege and excitement without those annoying puzzle timing concepts.  It's seriously annoying to have to hit a button on one side of the screen and try to race to the other side before the door closes.  Really?  Besides that the game seems to be perfect but adding in those ridiculous ""puzzles"" kills the whole gameplay and makes me not want to play after the 15 attempts to trying to get to the door before the timer runs out.  Hopefully they fix it because it really has taken the fun out of the game.			"

												I'm very excited for this game, but there seems to be some kind of visual issues with its current version. A bunch of random icon art is showing up instead of the opening screen, and then -- after some button pressing -- I see a pretty clear character selection menue followed by a black screen and sounds of water crashing upon the shore (the audio seems to be fine). I assumed there was some sort of error with the first download attempt and tried a second time to the same result. I'll come back in a little while and see if it works then, but in its current state I cannot recomend the purchase.I just recently (1/13/15) re-installed this game, and it now works wonderfully.

The story isn't to bad to follow just be sure you read and remember what they are talking about since there is no quest log or anything to check. My biggest problem with this game is the timed jumping puzzles. They are neat at first and you feel like you accomplished something after getting by it but as the game progresses you begin to notice you are having more and more trouble with it until it just gets to the point where you feel like you just want to chuck your monitor out the screen in blind rage when you step on a spike. All in all the game is alright besides the jumping puzzles. I would not recommend this if you have anger issues or if you don't feel like punishing yourself by going through this torment.			"

												Valdis Story: Abyssal City belongs to that funnily named genre which happens to be a favorite of mine: Metroidvania. The gist of the 2D platforming genre is to relatively freely explore different maps and environments. There are usually many places to explore and as you gain new abilities or improve old ones you gain access to even wider selection of locations to visit. Usually there are enemies on the way and defeating them earns you experience and as you level up your character gets stronger.The visual style is really pleasing in a cartoonish way which I enjoy very much and the movement and combat is, while not necessarily perfect, very serviceable. Your character will occasionally cling to ledge you didn't actually want to cling to or jump away from a ledge when you wanted to cling on it etc., but this isn't a game-breaking issue.What is a game-breaking issue is the way the player is kept pretty much in the dark about the core gameplay. Seriously, there isn't an effective tutorial nor text screen which would, for example, tell you what an ""Automatic Skill Cancel"" does or how much a block chance actually is and whether or not you can block a certain attack or not. See, the combat system is, while interesting and one that offers lots of possibilities, it also a bit of a hazzle to get the hang off. You pretty much have your normal attack, heavy attack, your spell, your seven other spells and your ""shadow power"" from the get-go and you will soon quickly get ""break points"" and ""finishing moves"" and ""assisting characters"" and wait could I actually get a small tutorial here? Please? None of this stuff is explained that well, if at all, and when choosing which skill to upgrade you might not actually know what some of the skills do, for example the previously mentioned ""skill cancel"". What does it exactly cancel? Is it my skill? The enemies skills? When does it do that, on normal attack? Heavy attack? Combo? In ""break mode""? When I block? What are these skills actually, since my characters ""Skills"" are all passive so does it negate opposing passive abilities? Or the spells they are using? I don't even... Also blocking seems to work, but not always. I guess it doesn't work against certain attacks. Or something.Add to this the fact that there is one of the most obtuse elements of the game: scaling monster and boss statistics. That means that the monsters and bosses get stronger by dealing more damage and having more health, but it is a bit unclear why and even on the forums there's speculation. Maybe it's the player characters level? Maybe it's the areas you've visited? Maybe it's the time you've spent? Maybe it's the angle of the moon related to your computer? All I know is that I managed to get myself stuck to a certain boss fight. I couldn't quite beat it, so I went and leveled up three times and tried again. This time, I fared considerably worse! I took more damage and dealt less, it seems. Now as a player I'm unsure what to do, level up more? If the boss gets stronger then I really shouldn't, but then again I can't really be arsed to spend hours upon hours mastering the finicky combat system. Scaling difficulty level in an RPG is inexcusable to me. It makes the whole leveling system redundant and you'd be much better off marketing the game as non-RPG action brawler or something.In conclusion it feels like there was a great game here with great feel and great aesthetics, but something went clearly wrong in the end. Perhaps there wasn't enough playtesting? And by playtesting I mean with real players, not the devs themselves who had SEVEN YEARS to play and test the game hours on end. To them the ridiculous difficulty level might be trivial. To them every ""+1 combo when rage full"", ""skill cancel"" and ""limit break"" is probably mechanically clear. Unfortunately the player is left in the dark wondering what he is doing and what is happening. To me, the game is broken.			"

YouTube™ Video: SteamPunk Episode 28: Valdis Story: Abyssal City 

			Views: 50		

			SteamPunk Bob knows Abyssal is an evil language used by tabletop demons, psychopaths, and this game's developers.		

This game is just plain painful. The platforming is sloppy, the combat is horribly unbalanced, the story is dull, and there's tons of worldbuilding that amounts to nothing.Pretty much everything except the rockin' boss music (played during the trailer) is just AWFUL.It expects a lot out of you in jumping puzzles, but doesn't give you precise enough tools to reliably accomplish it. Your spell choices are quickly handcuffed because your exploration abilities are in specific spell slots. In combat, you can easily get stunlocked by an enemy until death, or run into a case where an enemy declares you can't hurt them.I cannot in any good conscience recommend this game to anyone. Unless it improves IMMENSELY with patches, it's unfinished, broken, and unfun.			"

												This is a beautiful game.  The graphics are amazing, the music and sound effects are top notch.  The animations are wonderful.  The concept is gorgeous.  The RPG system is stylish and fun.  The combat is - in many cases - handled wonderfully....then the bone-crushing, soul-shearing, horrifyingly brutal difficult curve sets in after the first boss fight.  Christ, this game is designed to be screamed at with every four-letter obscenity you can muster.  You will scream at the controls for being finicky and spaztastic at the worst possible moments.  You will scream at enemies as you are a half-pixel off from dodging or hitting and pay a heavy toll as they perfectly juggle you to death.  You will scream at your inefficient efforts to grab onto ledges, run through courses, or skill cancel properly.  You will scream at bosses that randomly show up at the worst times and cannot be beaten because you are missing item X or you don't see the trick for their fight after death 10.  You will scream as you realize you have backed yourself into a corner with your build and are forced to start over to survive.  You will scream as you permanently missed an ally or collectible in the game because after a set period of the time the game moves events along while you explore and attempt to find much-needed items to upgrade your meager equipment just to survive.  You will scream as you try and figure out just where the hell you are supposed to be going as you dig around and explore, hoping to find some semblance of order or direction - only to wander into another boss room with ""LOLSTAB, DELETER OF YOUR SAVEGAME"" and sigh as you prepare to be used as a dishrag to keep the background shiny.I didn't pay much for this game - yay steam sales - and I'm fairly happy the devs got my money.  They clearly put a lot into the game.  However, at times I feel their desire for a difficult game have overshadowed other gameplay elements in favor of an artificial difficulty curve.Can I recommend this game?  No, I really can't - I found myself opening up cheats after 5 hours of playing just to survive a boss.  Then it was to beat a race.  Then it was for magic to survive a level.  Then I realized I wasn't cheating to get past certain points anymore - I was just cheating to play.  The game wasn't fun.  Even cheating I could see myself getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by everything.  Even raising my level to insane amounts didn't help - that's not how I want to play this kind of game, and it certainly isn't how I would expect anyone else to play.  Someone with more patience or skill might enjoy this - but you'll hit a wall.  And you might try to surmount it on your own, or seek help online, and you might pass it.  And you'll be happy with yourself.  But then the game will throw higher and higher walls at you.  And expect you to climb them.  After a while it just stops being fun and becomes tedious.			"

												I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. I did. I tried.But with erratic hit boxes, i-frames that come and go on a whim, zero priority over any enemy, frequent juggling from enemies (But enemies can just get out of any juggle you may achieve by just wanting to), frustrating platforming elements that do not mix with the game's combat engine at all (Several platforms are so small you cannot perform any action that will not throw you off of it), some of the most obnoxious common enemies in any game ever, quest triggers that the game fails to even HINT exist, boss difficulty that swings all over the place, the game quickly went from something charming to something agonizingly infuriating.

												I don't know what happened. I wanted to like this game, I really did. I was really excited when I decided to start playing. Then it took a few hours and I got bored.The story's portrayal didn't interest me, nor did the gameplay. I've played many games similar to this style, and some I've liked, some I haven't. The combat isn't bad by any means. It's interesting. But I just got bored. To be honest, I had lots more fun playing Dust: An Elysian Tale (though that game had its flaws too).The graphics are nice, but that's not enough to keep me playing. People bring up Dark Souls and similar games, and the funny thing is that I love Dark Souls. I sank 80+ hours into two playthroughs of the first Dark Souls and loved every moment. This game does not remind me of Dark Souls at all, even though the combat requires thought.			"

												Pros:-Nice graphics-In a Metroidvania style-Different characters actually play differentlyCons:-Very demanding platforming-Very little of the level is shown at a time, further hampering platforming-Unpredictable movement patterns make navigation and combat frustrating-Awkward control setup overcomplicates the demanding combat-Story relies too much on invented words, and is largely discarded after opening cinematicI wanted to like this game, because Metroidvania is an underserved niche on PC, but I really bounced off this title. It's clear they've put a lot of work into the combat mechanics, but they remain pretty baffling and hard to use--dodging, for example, is not a single button press, but requires you to activate ""skill cancel"" (bound by default to ""down""), then press left or right.  ""Skill cancel"" is a function which is intended to let you interrupt various moves, so that you needn't be hit by being stuck in a long animation.  That sounds good in concept, but it has a cooldown, and the main animation that got me stuck in the first place was the ""dodge"" animation, so the cooldown meant I couldn't cancel that animation. ""Dodge"" got me stuck because it would sometimes allow me to pass through enemies and get behind them, which was a critical tactic in tight corridors, but other times (I think it was if they blocked while I was dodging?) it would take me right up to the enemy and then freeze me in place for the rest of the dodge animation.  The interactions with ledges were similarly frustrating--by default, once you get the ability to grab ledges, you'll grab on whenever you can, and you can then climb up, drop down, or spring away in the opposite direction, all with directional presses. Unfortunately, it's very finicky about whether it thinks you can grab a ledge or not, and the height of ""you can jump and grab this, but failed to on this try because you jumped from the wrong point of the slope next to it"" and the height of ""you can't jump and grab this"" differ by only a few pixels, so it's often down to just trying a few times and then giving up.  In a metroidvania, it's important that the distinction between ""you can reach this now"" and ""you can't reach this without additional equipment"" be usually pretty obvious, so you don't waste a lot of time trying to get to things you can't possibly reach, and that's very much not the case here.  It's also fairly common to run across a boss fight as rather a surprise, and if you die during the fight, your only options are to retry the boss fight, or go all the way back to your last save point, which are few and far between, so if you find yourself underlevelled, it's a tough call whether to keep trying the boss or to redo a lot of lost ground and grind to try to power up a bit.  Boss fights are graded; I generally had to redo them a couple of times while I learned the patterns, and then squeaked by with a ""D"" grade.  It also appeared that XP awards for bosses were reduced if you got a poor grade, although I may be mistaken about this, because that would be pretty backwards--if you were underlevelled and barely made it through the fight, surely you need a boost of experience to make things a little easier, whereas if you're cruising through the fight barely breaking a sweat, you probably don't need much help in the levelling department.I haven't brought up the story yet, which is partly because the game doesn't bring it up much either.  There's a long opening cinematic, consisting of text over still images, but it still doesn't give the player control over the speed at which this advances, which is a minor pet peeve of mine; and it relies on invented nonsense words to try to create a sense of exoticism.  Actual line from the opening cinematic: ""We've been searching for Gernot for many months now.  He's the last living Hyogokun Knight in Myrgato's Dark Army.""  We have no points of reference for any of these names, so it's virtually meaningless to the player.  But this story is almost entirely discarded after this opening cinematic, so it doesn't make that much difference. Once you're playing, all that's really addressed is that you're looking for your crew, you're ostensibly at the bottom of the ocean but that apparently doesn't preclude the typical forest/ice caves/crypt etc. fantasy settings, and the enemies you keep having to fight are classified sometimes as ""angels,"" sometimes as ""demons,"" and sometimes as ""ferals,"" although the distinction between the three is obscure.  It's fairly generic fantasy nonsense, and if it were more of a focus in the game it'd be aggravating, but as it's all treated as window dressing for monster bashing, it's reasonably inoffensive.The music is kind of similar.  It's not actually bad music; it's kind of generic bombastic fantasy fare, but it's well made.  Unfortunately, it blares at full maximum-drama intensity at all times, with no sort of modulation at all, which is very quickly tiresome.In short, then, the movement and camera and controls felt off to me, and that really drove me off the game.  The artwork is nice, but focussing on it led the designers to zoom far in on the characters, which hinders the exploration and platforming that are the core of the gameplay.  The music is well done, but misused in the game.  The story is bland but mostly out of the way.  There's basically nothing here that's compelling.			"

												Graphic s are amazing, the gameplay is fun, and there is a lot of varity in how you can play. I was very much enjoying this title.But I kept running into one huge design flaw that just made me eventually drop the game without getting anywhere near completion.Bosses.Bosses are all in certain areas, but there is no save point near them and there is no warning you are about to enter the boss area.This would be no problem if you didn't have leveling and equipment. But what happened to me 3 times now is I end up with a save stuck in the boss room (it autosaves once you enter the boss room, so you can't go back) but discovered my character is too underpowered to fight the boss. This effectively kills that save.I guess that could be addressed with quicksaves (there are none) or multiple save files (again, there are none, there are character slots, but you can't manually save in a certain save slot)So if you end up stumbling into a boss underpowered, you have to start the game over. From the start.I did this three times and got a little further each time, and even found bosses that gave me no trouble at all. But once you do run into a boss who is too strong for you. Be prepared to start the game over again.			"

												Riddled with bugs and problems. Sure, it is independently made, but the $15 price is not fitting for a game so ill-maintained. I might feel better about the purchase had it only been $5 or something, but as it is I feel cheated. For over six months I wasn't even able to play the game thanks to a bug that wouldn't let me start from the menu screen (a bug that I was unable to fix even if i deleted all the files related to the game and downloaded it again, which I did over a dozen times).Even when the game works, it is mediocre at best. I assumed the problems with the gameplay were localized to the fact that the control scheme and ""skill cancel"" system is terribly implemented. However, as I discovered upon choosing a different character to play as rather than the default, graphically this game is extremely buggy as well. Any time I stopped movement (including cutscenes) my character simply turned into the default character. Not sure if this is shoddy programming or animation or what, but it was the final nail in the coffin.In short, I don't recommend this game. Even if I hadn't had to buy it, Valdis Story STILL wouldn't be worth devoting any time to playing.			"

												I probably jumped the gun with my previous negative review, as I was playing on Veteran difficulty and got angry at an area where I couldn't turn back and lost my health potions before a really hard boss. I played Veteran because found Hard a bit too easy when I played it, but that is because I didn't play against the bosses yet. In retrospect, I should have played on Hard, but hard seemed too easy at the time and the game eventually fustrated me to an instant uninstall.Realistically, Valdis Story is probably one of the better Metroidvania for purchase on Steam, ot at least the closest game to the 2D ""semi-difficult SOTN-Style"" Castlevanias outside of the Rogue-lite Rogue Legacy and colorful and slightly easy and very short Guacamelee.The combat is a mix of being great due to combos and magic, and fustrating due to the skill cancel and enemy/boss attacks that can stun-lock you and drain tons of health.-The skill cancel allows you to dodge or drop quickly while in mid-air by pressing down, and then the ability to dodge if you press left or right after activation. This key mapping is fustrating in platforming as you accidentally may press down on your game pad and is cumbersome in combat, but at least it is remappable to alleviate some fustration. -I like the fact that the same soul can be mapped to different directions Smash Bros style to offer you different magic abilities, but I have many times accidentally used Smite (Dark Magic Button + Right) while after making a Platform (Ice Magic Button + Down)-I eventually unlocked a Team Assist attack, much like Marvel Vs Capcom 2, but the Assist was weak and had a 10 second cooldown, and it sometimes misses - I was better off using normal attacks.-While combo's are cool, i'll admit that I miss the combat of Castlevania's where the game was about managing your ""single attack press"" and avoiding hits which caused knock back with temporary invincibility, but not stun-locks into combo barrages.Perhaps in the future I will reinstall when I'm in the mood for a Metroidvania again and play on a lower difficulty. I stopped at the Guardian Temple which is where I became completely annoyed, though it looks like I was relatively far into the game. I recommend looking at a few negative reviews before you Add to Cart, though if you play at Normal Difficulty and are decent at this style of game, then you may enjoy it..provided you remember to remap your skill cancel key.

												Looking for a metroidvania to play that was kind of like Dark Souls but without all the, y'know, dark, I came upon Valdis Story. And I like it a lot! The combat in particular is executed very well: you have dozens of spells, various combat moves and techniques, dodges, parries, and a large ability tree. There's a lot of skill involved in figuring out how to fight effectively, but once you do, you become a machine. The enemies are quite varied and the boss fights are spectacularly balanced, especially on hard mode. On the downside, the levels can feel a bit generic and there are a lot of timing/switch puzzles. I also don't love the writing, although the character art is really great (and a bit similar to Bastion).Oh, and for anyone claiming that the game is unfair: DEPLOY YOUR DODGE AND YOUR BLOCK LIBERALLY. Especially the dodge: it makes you invulnerable for a few frames and is absolutely essential in some sections.			"

												Just started and already agree with the comments with negative reviews. This game could stand to use another bug fix upgrade. Well, first off its still rather slow on my 2.2Ghz 2gb RAM laptop. The game seemed to have still been loading when I first got to the title screen. Music is choppy as is the on screen action when there is more than just my character on the screen.Now on about the game.The lever to open the first door seriously should not be that difficult. Problem is the designers did not add the time it takes to jump, press down on the d-pad to activate the ground pound, then for your character to ""recover"" from that action to the activate the dash (again pressing down on d-pad) then left on joystick. As I type this I think d-pad is also used to move your character, not just special move activation.Its a nice enough game but I think I'll wait until things are smoothed over before I begin playing again. Lesson to indies: If you don't want to earn $0.99 from your hard work I suggest you properly...thoroughly and fully test your game. This title has just made me more cautious for future purchases un general. Its a shame because I really was digging the art style, the animations and the idea behind the mechanics. It just didn't gel well altogether to be enjoyable.So although I'm saying its a negative, here's hoping the problems are fixed soon. I hope the indie seen realizes they are all impacting each others bottom line. If too many poorly execute products are out there people will respond in kind pick up titles at only the cheapest of prices (if your lucky) or flat our forget about you altogether. Step up your game!			"

												Feels very cheaply made with tons of abilities that will leave you scratching your head. Im going to have to google what the stuff does again becauase I forgot and theres so much to remember. Still it has nice music and graphics... just let down by being dumb.. maybe it gets better later, If it does I may well alter this. But yeah theirs better ones out there so missing on this isnt a big loss.			"

												Graphic s are amazing, the gameplay is fun, and there is a lot of varity in how you can play. I was very much enjoying this title.But I kept running into one huge design flaw that just made me eventually drop the game without getting anywhere near completion.Bosses.Bosses are all in certain areas, but there is no save point near them and there is no warning you are about to enter the boss area.This would be no problem if you didn't have leveling and equipment. But what happened to me 3 times now is I end up with a save stuck in the boss room (it autosaves once you enter the boss room, so you can't go back) but discovered my character is too underpowered to fight the boss. This effectively kills that save.I guess that could be addressed with quicksaves (there are none) or multiple save files (again, there are none, there are character slots, but you can't manually save in a certain save slot)So if you end up stumbling into a boss underpowered, you have to start the game over. From the start.I did this three times and got a little further each time, and even found bosses that gave me no trouble at all. But once you do run into a boss who is too strong for you. Be prepared to start the game over again.			"

												this is kind of the first time playing it so this will be a first impressionthe story is pretty good i enjoyed it and it was interesting, lots of characters, average weapons but this is the start of the game so i say it pretty good but and a BIG BUTthe controls felt clunky and often led to my death, often fighting against the controls, wall jumping was extremely odd and felt really weird, blocking was USELESS, tutorial... what tutorial???, they dont explain things such as some magic abilities and enemies and the mana keys, there is an odd rush of bosses that often leave you un-prepared and often feeling not ready for them (they also rank you for the bosses) and the map is kinda useless as well... so yeh i didnt really have a fun time			"

												This is another aesthetically pleasing indie game. Yet like all too many indie games, it lacks the precise mechanics to be really enjoyable. Too many pointless deaths come from something that should have been dodged, if only the character had responded as expected. That, and a breakdown of the gameplay mechanics would be nice, perhaps a proper tutorial. I feel that I spent way too much time just figuring out what the difference pieces and parts were and how they all went together. In some games, that is fun, but in one with the learning curve as steep as is here, it is not.			"

												First i would like to start out by saying this game is very well designed. Good story, Great graphics for a ""platformer"", and it can be very challenging at times which that is kind of a good/bad quality.  The good of course meaning there are times when you just want the game to get more exciting and button mash like crazy, the BAD part of it is that there were times when it brought the rage and constant yelling at the screen out of me lol.You will see what i mean when the times come. Just to elaborate quickly it involves pulling various switches and making mad rushes to certain points while also having enemies♥♥♥♥♥♥you off by getting in your way or knock you down off a platform just to have to go the long way around to get back to where you were :)The Good outweights the bad for this game though by a longshot. My first impressions of this game made me feel like i was playing a Castlevania SoTN clone with the graphics of Grand Chase/Elsword.The combat and skill system is great. You can do a mix of light and heavy attacks with magic skills thrown in the mix to create some nice combos. You have 3 skill trees that you can put points into as you level up to increase ""Passive"" boosts to your characters. For example extra armor, hp, physical damage, magic damage, etc....The actual magic skills you aquire are just from defeating Bosses during the story.Love the item trading system as well. No currency in this game. You aquire random item drops from enemies and you can go to vendors with the required lists of items and increase your different armors or sword's defense/damage.My Final thoughts!If you love platformer/metroid-vania games, you must buy this because its one of the better ones out there. Great soundtrack and gameplay. Even though the store page claims partial controller support, it is indeed FULLY controller operational and i highly recommend using a controller or you will get frustrated at times. Even with a controller there are times of utter frustration and constant cursing the computer screen lol. The story is good but could be better in the way its presented but all in all I did enjoy the game thus im giving it a Rating of........................9/10			"

												I initially posted a bad review to the game.  This was due to a too hard difficulty for a first playthrough in normal.  The reason for the difficulty are:- Some bosses are seriously too punishing to be fun.  I ended up screaming in anger in front of the screen and that's not good if you want to have fun.  At times, you really have to ""cheat"" to beat them (eye of Myrgato for example) and even then, it takes minutes to kill them.- Some places are really super painful: mobs sending you flying from far away, locking you up in attacks removing half your health, making you fall 3 screens and asking you to redo it all.  The biggest problem there is that it is even made like this by design.- You get too much possibilities to upgrade gear you find / spells and weapons but the decisions have a very strong impact.  For a first playthrough on normal, having no help / guide, I ended up with a build that was not doing much damage in the end, always ending up barely killing bosses and being told I was super bad (which was the case but after a point, it's just too late to change).- The important places (like the libary) are far away from each other so you end up running a lot from place to place.  Painful.So, why did I continue in the end?  Why do I still recommend this?Because I still think in the end that the game is worth being played.  I'd recommend reading some guide before because of the punising difficulty but all in all, it's really well done, the design is really awesome, all what has been poured into the game is worth checking.Honestly, I'haven't been that angry at a game for very long but it was still a good experience in the end.Without the mistakes explained here above, this could have truly become an unforgettable hit like metroid... but it's not.Play it if you like platformers but be prepared for mixed feelings :-)			"

												**Mild Spoilers**This is my favorite game on Steam, and IMHO it doesnt get the attention it deserves.It plays like a standard Metriod/Vania platformer, with an interesting and original storyline. One of the best features about this game is that it is CHALLENGING, which makes the victorys gratifying.The combat is Melee/Magic based, with equipment that you scavenge from chests and upgrade. There is also a 3 tier skill tree, which lets you customize your character based on the way you fight.The visuals are fun, i personally love the animaton style, and the soundtrack is a cut above the rest.ONE LARGE PROBLEM is the command for healing magic is so sloppy, many of the later bosses send torrents of attacks your way, and the ""heal"" command shares the same button as the jump command"" (WTF?) So when you find a second in the fight to cast a much needed healing spell, half the time you jump in the air, and get hit by another attack or cast the ""Air"" spell which gives hang time. Either way the second you had to heal is gone and you end up taking more damage because of a bad key setup.Also there are many NPCs that are very flat, saying only one line. Endless Fluff could have done a better job making them more engaging. The story/terminology is also slightly confusing, not giving the main character a clear backstory (Why were they on a ship, where were they going?) Your sort of ploped into this fantastical world to look for your ""crew"" while also hearing that you are an ex soldier from a demon army, and they never tell you how you got from one point to the other. Lastly they seem to have abandoned the ""Lore"" section of the game, which could be finished in a couple hours. Very sloppyMinor criticisms aside, Valdis Story is very entertaining and i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys games of the same genre.			"

												As someone coming to this game from years of Dark Souls, Metroid and Castlevania experience, I was expecting a typical ARPG Metroidvania title. The first hour of this game is exactly that, and it's wonderful. What follows is something entirely different.I'll just list the stuff that irks me:1. Timed, switch-based puzzles: These are in almost every room, and are pointless from a design perspective. Why force players to arbitrarily race from one point to another in a game like this, often in rooms with no enemies and requiring near pixel-perfect timing? 2. Scoring system for bosses: The best feeling in Metroid and Castlevania comes from just barely beating a tough boss, perhaps one that you weren't even meant to be fighting yet, and gaining awesome rewards. In Valdis Story, if you don't beat the boss quickly and with varied moves, the game slaps you with a bad grade for the fight and lessens your reward. Imagine if Symphony of the Night was like ""Oh, you only used R1 in this fight? You get reduced exp."" It's a vindictive, garbage system that punishes you for playing your own way.3. No warning for boss fights: Of course, you'd be far more likely to do well in boss fights if there was some way of telling when you were about to enter one. There are no special doors, no warning signs, and no way to leave once you enter. Either you go in totally unprepared and win, or head back to your last save.The whole thing reeks of a dev who was very adamant that his/her game be played and mastered a specific way, punishing the blind experimentation. ""You did it, but not the way I wanted you to, so screw you,"" is the message I continually felt as I played. Not a good feeling, not a good game.			"

												There's a lot about Valdis Story: Abyssal City that I do generally like. The problem is that it is one of the very few games in years that actually caused me to rage quit and uninstall. My blood pressure doesn't need to ensure this game.I love the overall idea: Metroidvania + RPG elements + light crafting and upgrading + engaging combat. The art is enjoyable as well as the sound track. There even is technically a story (in the more story driven sense of Metroidvania ala Cave Story rather than Ori).The problem is that for every positive, I feel I must add a ""but"" to the sentence: - Metroidvania except that 2 hours in and I still feel the game is basically linear (vertical at times, but I don't feel like I can or should bother exploring. There are even areas that cause you damage just standing in the which makes exploring for fun without knowing where you're going seem like a poor decision) - Crafting except when or how hasn't been explained in my couple hours with the game. My items mention a level, but I don't know who to even take them to in order to increase them. - Instead of currency, you trade for items (neat) but they don't really explain anywhere near enough for you to understand when it's worth trading for an item. For instance, I noticed there were elixers available to protect me from certain status effect, but no where did they mention what I might want. When you get to an area where every enemy poisons you (which saps your MP as well as your HP) and the boss is all about poison, you see how knowing what's ahead can make all the difference. Exploring it for the first time is not - Combat can feel nice when you get the right balance, but this is ""Stun Lock: The Game"". Mashing buttons to keep enemies locked is the most effective way to kill them. And it's ""fair"" insomuchas they can and do stun lock you. A lot. Just entered an area with full HP? Don't worry, two enemies might lock you between them and you'll only hit the ground when you're dead. Attack an enemy near an area boundry? Re-entering will reset all the enemies and you'll get no XP. Dodging to avoid attacks? I hope your button presses register this time and you don't get stunned.  - The art is generally nice looking. Except it has terrible and unpredictable performance. Usually it hits 60FPS no problem. But then sometimes it doesn't come close. Think your 32 GB of ram, a Skylake i7, 2x 1080's are good enough for a 2d sprite based game? Actually no. It will still fail to hit 30FPS sometimes. - There's a story guiding your actions like Cave Story or Owlboy. Except those were well written and enjoyable. Here you get piles of poorly written dialog and a moody warrior who is cocky and really not likable surrounded by people that are apprehensive toward him but then give him things for not a lot of reason.I feel this could have been a good game with a bit more work or likable characters or just enough iFrames to make combat not just a game of stun locks. But as it is, it's just not fun to play.			"

												I liked this game at first. The idea, story, and gameplay are all great at first. After a while the graphics get to you. They aren't quite 16 bit and they're blurry. If you do 2x to try and improve them it just looks bad. The game should look much better than it does honestly. However that's not the part I really don't like about it. Given everything about the game I would rate this highly except for the squishy factor.You start out super weak. You remain super weak throughout most of the game. It's crazy how OP some of the enemies are with powers that just destroy you in seconds. One bad hit can mean 80 damage and death. There's no blinking, no temporary invincibility when you take damage, so you just keep taking damage which just compounds the more enemies that are attacking you. Bosses and sections of the game are super trolly. Some areas you're supposed to jump gaps on tiny moving objects while enemies are shooting projectiles at you. They aren't on the screen, so you can't do anything about it except hope that it doesn't happen because blocking doesn't work that great. As you progress you get better armor, items, and skills that make it easier, or so you would think. Only the bosses and enemies get more OP and more troll as you go. I haven't yet finished this game because every time I pick it up something about it pisses me off. I always forget why I stopped playing and I always realize it's because the game is made to make you try again and again and fail over and over. This isn't the kind of game to have that play style and it just becomes a huge turn off. Maybe if leveling up didn't take forever, grinding wouldn't feel like some epic task that takes days. No matter what, I just realize this game all around was half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in many ways.			"

												I was excited by the premise of the game, and by the visuals shown off in the media on the storefront. I figured what the hell, I like Metroidvanias, this looks promising, lets go.And there is a lot here to like. Even though the art is low res, its charming in its own way. The combat and skill tree is fun and looks to have promise. But here is the deal: the game controls like sticky♥♥♥♥♥ The character feels glued to the floor, like you are directly fighting with gravity with every jump, or some demon snuck a hunk of iron into your boots. Everytime I pressed the jump button it felt like peeling a sticker off a box. Its doable, but this starts to really grate on you. The ""Cancel"" in the game, done simply hitting down on the stick, does NOT mesh well with the right-trigger+direction magic casting system. Attacks feel occasionally unresponsive. Its just a mess in every way when it comes to controls. The game itself is on the easier side, but a lot of incoming damage feels like it is more caused by wrestling with the funky controls than anything else.The other main complaint is the lack of instruction on how some stuff works like equipment, the spell system or other functions (particularly if you have ""info"" off in the menus, which is off by default). I picked up a lot of items in this game but had little idea what any of them were for. It all just felt a bit aimless. To me, this all meets in a hailstorm of frustration when fighting the game's 2nd or third boss, the Ice Dragon.  You will wiggle. You will miscast. You will stick to everything like Toby Maguire's Peter Parker. If you can stomach the Ice Dragon and still had fun, I think you'll enjoy this game. If not, just know it doesn't get better.			"

												The game is not working with my XINPUT controllers (PS4). All other games with xinput support I own do. The game looks promnising but since the keyboard controls are not really good, the game is not enjoyable at this point. I am sure hoping the programmers will fix this issue soon. I'll be playing AXIOM VERGE or 1001 Spikes or one of the other games supporting my controllers until then. So long guys.			"

												Solid game all around. side scroller metrovania style action RPG. Animish graphics, controller is needed IMO to enjoy this game the most. As you level up you distribute stat points freely, choose skill trees, etc. in true RPG fashion. Everything has a nice feel to it, UI, gameplay, graphics, sound. The difficulty is very nice as well, a good, challenging game. Highly recommended for maetrvania fans!!			"

												Irreponsive controls makes it feel as if I'm playing an online game with a really awful ping. The frustration is simply beyond belief. When an attack lands (whether from the player or an enemy) the visual and sound feedback feels so hollow and unconvincing. The developers may wanna try going back to the origins of 2D action games, such as Cadillacs & Dinosaurs even, to see how it's done!Way too many obvious/subtle similarities to Castlevania that go far beyond the normal extent of homage that they become distracting and make one seriously doubt the innovation capacities of our developers.

												I've never written a steam review before but I had to come here and just say that I thought this game was pretty crappy. I came in looking for a metroidvania game after playing virtually all that are out there for NES, SNES, PS3, XBOX360/1 Nintendo DS/3DS, etc. I've been playing game for 30 years now on virtually every system ever released and I think I know quality when I see it. This game is just not there. The graphics are crisp and simplistic to the point that I really feel like I'm playing a flash game that should run for free on a website for people bored at work. The controls, at least on OS X are pretty laggy. They are also a little bit overly complex the second you jump into the game. The character/story development right off the bat is not intriguing or understandable. They just talk about some gods of the past without any real plot development. Of course, some of the greatest games like Metroid or Cave Story also started out with little to no plot development, but they also had mysterious and intriguing worlds to explore. This game really doesn't. You start out in some kind of cathedral that is totally uninteresting. The save points are also impossible to find and the map system is horrendous. What does the color coding even mean? I almost feel like just ignoring the map is more helpful. Anyway, I have plenty of money to spend but I still regret this purchase because I feel like I gave money to a developer who turned in a lackluster effort on this game...			"

												I've only played five hours but this game is needlessly difficult. I'm currently up to the ice eye monster that summons an avatar in the sewers and I'm barely doing any damage to it, meanwhile I get slamed with hits that are half my hp. And it's not just this boss, they're all mindlessly difficult beyond belief. You can try to grind XP, but you won't get very far with that route either since the real XP comes from bosses and the minions barely give any.If you like a challenge beyond reason, this game is for you. However if you want to just chill and have a good time, go with Dust: An Elysian Tail which is the same type of gameplay, with less painful methods of progression.			"

												Two words perfectly describe this game: Aggravating and Annoying.

Combine that with enemies that continuously prevent you from moving or knocking you routinely out of the air and you get a game that's almost unplayable.

												As soon as you reach the 2nd boss you may as well just stop playing. First of all, this boss has WAY too much health for a boss so early in the game. Dashing is hardly effective for dodging anything because it's tied to that stupid skill-cancel feature that for some reason suddenly takes twice as long to refill unlike everywhere else in the game up to that point, which you'll totally trigger on accident from being forced to mash on the joystick to break out of its attacks (since mashing left-and-right on the D-pad is the most uncomfortable thing ever). Why can't I just double-tap left/right to dash like y'know, every other platformer ever made? You get magic and this ""special meter full"" mode to use against it but they're basically useless, same with blocking. The boss did eventually die after a dozen or so rage-filled attempts and even then I barely beat it thanks to that revive potion. Right afterwards you immediately stumble into enemies that hit even harder and faster than that boss and can do MORE ice attacks you have to button-mash out of. That's when you finally realise that you're playing Fake Difficulty: The game, and that the developers only made the first few minutes of the game easy to deceive you into thinking this game will have a reasonable learning curve when really it's the hardest most miserable thing ever since Battletoads, and even Battletoads at least had bosses that didn't take forever to kill.About the only good thing worth saying is that the game has a nice artstyle.

												The game is not bad, but it has a lot of default. For example the controls with the XBOX360 controler are not really well thought, especially the ""skill cancel"" that requires to be rebinded. The story and the graphics are great, but the number of different ennemies is small (about 15 types of monsters, most of the time they are used 2 or 3 times in different versions). Some bosses are not balanced and will blow you out until you find an other path to avoid them. Some items description are not really clear. The combo system could be better. The main adventure will hold you up to 20 hours.The price is really high for a game that seems a bit unfinished. I would rather recommend you to check Hammerwatch that is really well finished and it can be played in coop up to 4 players or Rogue Legacy that is my favorite indie game of 2013.6,5/10			"

												The “Metroidvania” platformer enjoyed its heyday some 15-20 years ago when Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night ruled the roost, and eventually found their names lent to the genre’s title. While many games since then have borrowed the tried-and-true mechanics of these classics, Valdis Story: Abyssal City is one that does so while also re-creating the aesthetic of the old-school consoles — its colorful art style would feel right at home on a PlayStation. The hours of engaging gameplay at hand will especially satisfy the nostalgic.In a world where demons and angels are at war, Wyatt and his crew set sail in order to track down his missing father. During the voyage, their ship is attacked by creatures from below and sunk. Beneath the water's surface, they find a slowly dying ancient city under constant attack from angels, demons and ferals. Separated from his crew, Wyatt must now reunite them while continuing the search for his father. During his journey, he discovers lost secrets and unravels mysteries surrounding him and his friends. As with its classic inspirations, the bulk of the gameplay in Valdis Story is spent battling enemies and exploring the side-scrolling landscapes. The satisfaction of a good Metroidvania game is intact; you’ll come across many inaccessible doors and return to them hours later with a means of entry, filled with anticipation of what could be behind them. The location of your next task is not always obvious, with a vague line of text serving as the only clue. This lack of hand-holding might frustrate in other games, but it’s a boon to Valdis Story, as revisiting areas to more thoroughly explore only enhances the whole. Valdis Story rewards those who go out of their way to explore; a vital aspect of this Metroidvania-style game. As you leap around the beautiful 2D world, you acquire new equipment and spells that allow access to previously unreachable locations. Summoning ice pillars as temporary platforms, short-range teleports and wall-kicking are just a few of the abilities needed to fully traverse the city. Dozens of hidden items, chests and crew members wait to be found, some of which are extraordinarily hard to find, making it sweeter when you do. There’s a solid progression system in place, injecting RPG aspects to great effect. Experience is earned through defeating enemies, with a substantial amount of unlockable skills and stat upgrades to choose from as each new player level is achieved. There’s even somewhat of a crafting mechanic — materials collected in the wild can be provided to vendors to increase the effectiveness of armor and weapons, or create new ones outright.The combat in Valdis Story is fun. Stringing together combos with the aid of unlocked skills is enchanting from start to finish. Magic plays a major part, serving as a gratifying complement to melee swordplay. By the game’s conclusion, you’ll have access to a generous amount of spells ranging from elemental attacks, to stat buffs, to abilities that help you reach otherwise-inaccessible areas. The depth of combat comes to light most effectively while entrenched in the numerous boss fights. Some of these tests are quite stiff, particularly later in the game. Success comes through experimentation, practicing different spells on different bosses, and even exploring the area where the battle takes place. But if nothing’s working out, doubling back for some old-fashioned level grinding goes a long way.Combat flows smoothly, and stringing attacks together is fast-paced and exciting. The keyboard controls are clunky, but they can be rearranged or a gamepad can be used. You can execute short-ranged dashes that allow you to dodge and move past foes, or employ more than twenty spells to deal damage, heal, boost your own abilities or reach new places. The sound effects that accompany them are appropriate, though a little artificial-sounding at times. Nevertheless, spell diversity is outstanding, and there are dozens of ways to approach combat in any particular battle. Often, you will need to mix up your strategy as some enemies focus on speed and manoeuvrability, while others are heavily armoured or stand back and shoot. There's a solid variety of foes, though their design relies on palette-swapping as the game progresses. On level up you can assign stat points and choose to focus on magic, melee or a mix of the two. It's a fun, flexible system that provides great variety on additional plays. There are plenty of bosses to test your skills against, both story-based and optional, and you'll always need to be at your best to beat them. Monstrous armoured angels and sleek, agile demons are just a few you'll encounter. Different bosses require you to take down shields, stay above poisonous gas, navigate precarious platforms, destroy healing devices and even beat a time limit in order to destroy them. There's terrific variety, and, even on the normal difficulty setting, they are a real challenge to defeat. Once you do so, you are given a rank based on how soundly you thrashed them, and may be rewarded with extra experience or even additional stat or skill points to assign. At the end of the game you receive an overall ranking too, so completionists have a huge task ahead of them. I had a wonderful time playing Valdis Story. Time and time again it exceeded my expectations, and it's a privilege that I was able to play and review it. Just when I thought I had seen the greatest boss or most intense challenge, it threw another one at me. One play through, as Wyatt, takes about 10-15 hours, so there's at least twice that to play as Reina and collect all the hidden items. Throw in Gilda and Vladyn, and you can double that play time again! As long as you're prepared for a challenging game, I can't recommend Valdis Story enough.Recommended "

												Right from the beginning, one of the things I found really offputting about this game was the lack of instruction.  There's a skill tree, stats to ugprade, accessories, assists, etc.  Through trial and error I discovered moves and abilities, but even towards the end of the game, I was still discovering basic game mechanics because it didn't bother to tell me anything.  Worse yet, even on normal mode, the game can be pretty difficult.  As you level up, the enemies level up too (making the entire process basically worthless).  There are no easy areas.  Come back to the starting section after reaching level 10 and you'll discover the enemies have all leveled up too with new abilities and skills, increased defense, and increased attack power.   This becomes especially frustrating because the game requires a lot of backtracking if you want to collect everything.  Or in some cases, it's required just to progress.Boss fights especially are hard because they have extreme amounts of health and you can barely scratch them.   If after twenty minutes the boss's health is only at half, then something is wrong.  Even worse, many of them can heal, so it's entirely possible to spend an entire hour fighting a boss and have them at full health.Status effects are never explained either.  Hit an enemy and a strange symbol appears over their head.  The game will never tell you what it does.Finally, about halfway through the game I decided to sit down and really commit to searching for information on the game.  And let me tell you it is almost impossible to find anything decent.  What is out there is scattered through several dozen forum posts and a wiki full of mostly blank pages.  It was only by spending time carefully combing through posts and following dubious and often broken links, that I discovered there are suggested builds and stats for the game.  (Although don't expect to actually find an explanation of these builds or a guide to stat upgrades.  They either don't exist or are extremely vague.)Anyway, three-fourths of the way through the game I discovered that because I hadn't done hours of research prior to even starting, I wasn't going to be able to progress.  My stat upgrades, skill tree path, weapon upgrades, and the items I'd wasted unique currency on were all mismatched because I'd been stumbling around in the dark.   Even the options to respec didn't help because I'd failed to achieve S-rank grades on boss fights, meaning I'd missed out on certain upgrades or bonuses I didn't know existed. All in all, this game is a giant waste of time.  If it bothered to explain even 1/10th of the information I had to carefully glean from internet forum posts like a prospector panning for gold, it might have been salvageable.  It doesn't.  Save yourself time and go into a windowless room, turn off the lights, and walk around bumping into things at random.  It'll be the same basic experience.			"

Posted: March 19, 2016
												Unfortunately, I have to give this game a very firm ""negative"". Everything looked nice on paper; the production value seemed high, the ideas seemed great, but the execution fails rather fundamentally and takes what should be an action-packed exploration of a fantastical wonderland and boils it down into a frustrating and poorly finished combat system with which you fight more than the in-game enemies.As is the custom, first are the PROs:+Soundtrack is well done (at least, what little I heard of it)+Backgrounds and environments are colorful and pretty (with some small visual design issues I'll get into later)+Character art is charming+Animations are purely gorgeous, though they can, on occasion, move too fast to understand what your player or enemies are doing.+The concepts behind the combat are exciting, though they're a letdown in terms of executionThen, the CONs:-Often times, interactable things like doors and enemies are difficult to discern from non-interactable elements.This is the visual design whoopsie I mentioned. Efforts are clearly made to make them ""pop"" from the background with a small, glowing outline on doors, but this garnish, too, blends with the palette and other elements of most environments, disabling the intended effect.-Controls. This was a bit big, so I needed to break it into paragraphs. Apologies.Put as succinctly as possible, the controls are very floaty and imprecise. Every movement carries far too much weight, causing your momentum play a BIG part in the gameplay. Running and jumping while pressing the opposite direction will cause your character to continue much of his forward motion and stopping and starting movement on the ground is stiff and wishy-washy. It feels like you're trying to wrangle your character whenever you try and get from one spot to another. This game requires much, much more precision than it's willing to give you, and all it leads to is frustration. What this game needed, and perhaps tried to emulate, is the Castlevania style of movement, where changes in momentum are immediate and everything responds as soon as you can think it. Based on the attack patterns and speed of the enemies, this admittedly unrealistic style of movement is an absolute requirement if fairness and a sense of player agency is to be upheld. Most of the time, you end up being helplessly bounced around, struggling to regain control of your own character, much less trying to attack enemies. If you still find it difficult to imagine, just think of ice-floor controls, but everywhere. It's not nearly as pronounced as that idea, sure, but it's fundamentally what I'm talking about. By the way, this game does employ the ice-floors trope in certain areas, which only accentuates the aforementioned flaws.Additionally, the acceleration in moving your character is inconsistent, clicking into a ""higher gear"", so to speak, after what seems to be an arbitrary amount of time. This isn't the only thing which is inconsistent, as getting hit can sometimes cause your character to cease all horizontal motion and begin a control-less freefall down what is often a significant amount of floors. Precision is made impossible by the whimsically activating acceleration as well as the oddly perilous distance your attacks seem to carry you, often flinging you off of things and missing enemies.-There are no invincibility frames upon taking damage. This is pretty self-explanatory, really, and it results in very frequent stun-locking. I don't think it needs to be said, but stun-locking the player is never fair nor is it engaging. I hate to generalize, but if you ever find your game putting the player into a position where punishment is doled out either with inconsistent relation to the player's actions or with plain abandon regardless of the player's actions, you have something that needs fixing. Stunlocking can occur without direct relation to how badly a player screwed up, and it is also a position in which the player has no agency. This type of inconsistent punishment puts stress on the player, as he/she can never fully predict whether a light tap will result in a bit of damage, or an extended tornado of pain.-Enemy designMost enemies fire projectiles. Avoiding them takes nimble aerial movement, which this game lacks, but many times projectiles are fired at you from off-screen, making them impossible to predict. This robs the player of the ability to anticipate their trajectory and space oneself accordingly. Even regarding the enemies on-screen, projectiles come out so fast and without warning that the optimal strategy when dealing with an enemy is to wait for them to attack first before approaching, as you can get close to an enemy, prepare an attack, and be knocked back suddenly by their projectile. When attacks like that can seemingly come from nowhere, the player is forced into a very stilted, slow mode of progression, which is detrimental to this game's design, overall. Add the floaty controls to this, and you'll feel like 90% of every hit was taken without justice.-Exploration techniques which use manaI didn't play far enough to know if there are multiple instances of this happening, but one spell you can cast called ""frost tower"" is necessary as a tool for reaching high ledges. The problem is that this mechanic uses MP, so if you approach such a ledge and you are without MP, you cannot progress until you stand around a wait for it to recharge. A tool of progression should not be tied to a limited use mechanic, otherwise it just gets in the way of exploration. As one of this game's core mechanics, exploration should be handled with the utmost fidelity.In summary, I thought that this was a game that really deserved to be good. The combat ideas were interesting and the game looks and sounds like a dream, but the mishandled combat and exploration elements were just far too strong a turn-off for me to continue playing. Personally speaking, this is a project that I would have LOVED to be a part of during development because I think it could have been easily be turned around, but as a finished product, I can't recommend it even for a niche audience.If you are someone new to the Castlevania-type of games, of which this is an example, then I would recommend playing a Castlevania game. If you are someone who has played a Castlevania game before and is looking to satisfy that special itch with something fresh, then I would especially recommend staying away, as you will be even less likely to tolerate the lack of polish here. As someone who has played nearly every Castlevania game multiple times and really craves something new in that vein, it's actually more appealing to re-tread those old grounds than to accommodate this game's flaws.To be honest, it really hurts to hate this game as it has clearly had a LOT of effort put into it, but every play session devolves instantaneously into pure rage at the broken mechanics and unfair, unpolished, rookie game design.

												Developers probably wanted to do some ""old school game"" like lots of devs recently, but obviously only when it was convenient for them. No explanation ? Old school ! Ununderstable map ? Old school !Why not ! Shovel Knight does that quite well by example. But♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a keyboard to this extent (at least 25-30 different spells / attacks) still does look like a failure to me. Developers only wanted to do something complex (or lazily) without balancing it by bringing the ""old school"" argument, and ended up with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and unplayable game (if you want to spend less than 200 hours to learn the controls, that is).Menus are quite a mess too. A waste, the universe and graphics/sounds were quite cool. Too bad.			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I had with this game. There are plenty of spells, talents, armors, and weapons in the game, and they all feel unique. Every item in the game has its own utility, and the potential to be the best weapon/armor in the game depending on what kind of build/playstyle/combos you want to use.The harder difficulties can be frustrating if you're trying to get a good rank on a boss fight, but when you finally do combo Eye of Myrgato from 100% HP to 0 it feels sooooo good.

												This game has potential, I can see that developers put a lot of efforts for this game and overall I'll say it's an OK game. But unfortunately it has some great problems that make user experience not as good as it should be; The most important one is CONTROL. Control is so bad in this game that I can't remember another game that has made me frustrated at this level. There are some major problems in control design (you have to push 2 buttons for lots of simple actions) and there are some major performance issues in control too (control is laggy and wall grabing is frustrating).Another issue of this game is its first impression. it's one of the worst actually! it just puts you in the middle of a story with so many characters, there isn't any good tutorial for early game and level design of the first areas is executed poorly.But almost after 3 or 4 hours of playing, you start to enjoy this game planned. (let's assume that you haven't refund this game yet and managed to become familiar with its pesky control, ineffiecent crafting system, complex map system and level design and its very bad first impression)I think and I hope that the developers have learned from their obvious design mistakes and performance issues and became more experienced, so I will give them last chance on their next game to bring me joy!It's OK, but could be a lot better. 6/10 (overrated on metacritic!)

												I wanted to love this game. I really did. I spent hours on it trying my hardest.This game is a gem. Beautiful visuals, a combat system thats easy to learn and very hard to master. Story is...not bad. Its bright, colourful, and a true metroidvania title. With all this praise, you may be wondering why I dont recommend it. Just one problem: time-based puzzles. This game has puzzles that are time-based and they're not optional. These are puzzles that require pixel perfect split second reflexes and you may often find yourself missing the goal by fractions of a second.If not for this aspect of it, I'd rate this game as high as it can get, but those brutal puzzles render the game nigh unplayable unless you got the aforementioned lightning-fast reflexes. I can't recommend this game to anyone unfortunately.			"

												While I did enjoy the graphics The game and wish i could give more of a cationalry lable rather than a purly yes-or-no system. That aside the design suffers from tring to be difficult game when in reallity it comes accross an easy game with the occational pooryly desinged area/bosses, that are less difficult and (unfortunately) just are far more annoying then anything else to the point of detracting from the game.Additionally,  trying to justify that the game is hard  only on the hardest settings and isn't challengeing on hard, is a kin to justifying a restarant is good as a whole but only if you order one item, in one pertifuclar way, and while that might make the gameplay harder that won't stop annoying machanics from being annoying. Just know if you already like then good for you, don't be detered in you liking it any less just because I don't.However, giving the game a second chance, I still feel the same way, it is an enjoyable game, just be aware.

												A great idea with poor execution.  It feels like the developers wanted to make something as a throw back to the day of Nintendo, but don't quite understand what made those games good.The first major problem is the controls.  They are loose in a bad way.  You don't ever feel like you have exact control over your character.  Now this  on its own could be forgiven.  However, this is combined with timed jumping puzzles where is literally not a single millisecond of forgiveness.  The two of these combine to become rather frustrating.Other horrible design mistakes start to rear their head as you move forward.  You are rated on how you do on each boss and given a severe penalty if you end up using your healing potion on the boss.  However, there is no way to retry the boss fight without dying.  So you frequently find yourself giving up halfway through the boss fights so the boss can kill you and you can try again.  Update: You can alternatively quit to the main menu, wait for that to load, select retry, and then wait to load back it.Another glaring example of poor design is a timed sequence where if you don't escape a dungeon fast enough you die.  The problem is you can fall down in the first room and be placed in a situation where it is literally impossible to get back up.  Since there is no feature to return to the last checkpoint you have to sit and wait for two minutes for the timer to run out before you try again.  Get hit by an enemy and you have to wait two minutes again.It is simply not up to modern design standards.  They were striving to be a good challenging game inspired by the NES/SNES era, but it ends up more like one of the janky bad games from that era, the stuff that came from LJN (the rainbow) if you remember them.It is heartbreaking because you can clearly see the potential.  It has a beautiful art style and soundtrack.  It was meant for replayability, but it ends up obnoxious in so many ways.  It is just constantly killing the fun.  The challenge isn't even interesting in a Dark Souls kind of way,  It is more about forcing boring repitition until get get lucky and get something exactly perfect.There are tons of great Metroidvanias on steam, I don't see any reason to settle for this one.

												Valdis Story takes a Metroidvania framework and adds technical combat, move-cancelling, timed block/parry and likeable characters that don't trap you in endless conversations loops.This is an action game and it shows.I found every single boss fight challenging (unlike Castlevania SotN where you can just SoulSteal past every boss), and the timed platforming challenges had me swearing at the screen every time I made a mistake, but were oh so satisfying once completed, and my skills were that much better as a result (not to mention the extra loot).The game has a unique potion system whereby potions are never lost when used, but refilled at a save point. They effectively act as continues, rezzing you automatically at the spot you died in the midst of the battle. It's really satisfying to find an extra potion as they are quite rare!The move-cancellation system is a real treat! At any time you can press down to cancel whatever you are doing. This can be to cancel out of a longer attack animation, or to recover after being hit. This also has the effect of hammering you towards the ground post haste, so can even be used to move around the levels quickly.Also once you hit the ground (or if you were already on the ground), you can immediately press left/right to dash in said direction! This is often used to get behind enemies that block from the front, or that are telegraphing overpowered attacks.Even when running from A to B, a quick 'down, forward' on the D-pad will give you a burst of speed to make the slight hesitation of pressing down worthwhile!The cancellation is on a 2 second timer so can't be abused after every single attack animation, but you can find/craft more charges, and learn skills that reset the charges.As you play the game you begin to transfer the cancel/dash and other moves to your muscle memory (the timed platforming sections are great for this, as while they start off easy enough, they soon become really challenging and require as many dashes and wall jumps as humanly possible).Once you are performing these technical moves on the battlefield, you feel like such a badass, dashing, dodging, countering, wall jumping, building combos and triggering assists from your 'party' (think of any recent fighting game that allows you to tag in a backup character for a second), or going all out in focus mode!There is no dodge rating or block percentage in this game; all skills must be performed by the player and timed perfectly for maximum results. Grinding can help to soften the edges of boss battles, but it's still on you to play well, especially once the timed platforming sections go from optional to compulsory, later in the game!All in all, Valdis Story is a great action platformer in the style of Metroidvania, and is the most fun I've had with a game since I replayed Castlevania: Symphony of the Night on PS1 (earlier this morning).

Posted: March 14, 2014
												Beautiful game falls short of expectations. The artwork looks great. (1/5)There are many problems that CANNOT be overlooked in this game. 1. The controls. The dodge button is really difficult to proc and it is the same button you use to 'cancel' an attack. They should have just had a dedicated button to 'dash' and another button to cancel. There are so many keys on the keyboard and buttons on a gamepad like the XBOX 360 PC Controller that it baffles my mind why some of the button combinations are so god awful.Another thing, the block and Magic button, when pressed simultaneously, it brings up a screen to rebind your magic. Here's a tip, GET RID OF THIS GOD DAMN BIND. IF we wanted to change up our magic combinations, we should just go back to the menu in our inventory instead of this 'fast' changeout of magic skills. The problem is if you are blocking an attack then attempt to do magic, sorry, you go to the magic skill screen to swap skills. It's very annoying, breaks the immersion, and impacts the ability to fight.2. Jumping onto platforms should not be this difficult. The character model looks like they'd be able to 'latch' onto a ledge, but they don't. It is VERY unpleasant to miss a jump, then get chain attacked by mobs.3. Combat. If you are surrounded my a bunch of mobs, they WILL chain attack you and juggle you, to the point where you cannot fight back and you're dead.4. Combat & Mobs. This is an RPG with not enough mobs in a damn map to kill in order to actually GET sufficent EXP out of them. Furthermore, there are NO consumables, so you're dependent on save points to regenerate HP/MP, kill maybe 2-3 mobs, and then head back to base to regenerate. Although you get potions later in the game, they only proc when you're DEAD. Running back to base when you've got 50 HP left is NOT fun. This was incredibly short sighted on their part.There is NOT enough mobs to get Experience from, which greatly hinders your ability to get levels and blast through bosses. You end up staying in 1-2 areas killing a few mobs over and over again. It hurts the immersion and the feel of the game. 5. There is no 'up' attack. You jump up and do a horizontal attack in one of the two directions. There WILL be mobs either flying or directly above you attacking you and you have no way of attacking them unless you use magic.6. Puzzles with Timers. There's very little time to get to through to the area with the activated door, and you have to rush to the area spamming your abilities. Timers are something like 6-12 seconds, average is 6 seconds. In my opinion, they should have just had switches activate and gotten rid of the time. The game attempts to add too many obstacles to a game that already has issues that hinder progression as seen by the terrible and broken keypad interface.Closing Statements: The game looks incredible; however, it's just that, it only LOOKS good. The game is hindered by it's control system, consumables (potion system), and the way the characters gain experience. It feels like I must spend 20 minutes grinding an area for 1, maybe 2, levels before progressing to another area to take down enemies. The story looks good, which is sad because it's being ruined by essential components in the game.The lack of healing items and regenerative abilities.The lack of experience gain from enemies.The lack of enemies in general, and when they are plentiful, they all attack at once and juggle you to death.The lack of consistency in jumping and grabbing onto ledges. It's 50/50The implement of timers is poorly done. The timers should be increased by 2/3 times. It really a component that is not necessary in this game.The poor use of buttons/key combinations for skills. They need to fix the dodge and quick magic skill menu. Just stay away from this game. Your time and money is better spent elsewhere on a game that works as intended.An alternative RPG game like this genre is Y's Origin. It's a much better and consistent Hack and Slash with great replayability due to it's 3 playable characters, each with a different twist on the story.			"

												Action RPG platformers are supposed to have exceptionally tight controls that don't slow the player down to ensure that they can move about with precision. There are some questionable design choices regarding that in Valdis Story, none the least of which is ledge clinging which requires you to press up to climb up. This makes bosses with platforms a very awkward affair, as you will need to be moving quite a bit to avoid certain attacks. Compounding the movement issue is poor air control, making jumping to small platforms extremely annoying.Combat is fairly simple, but bogged down by the most annoying magic system ever concieved. Hold the magic button then press a direction to cast one of four equippied abilities, which have to be set through one of two menus (why?). Both combat and movement is hampered by the game's dodging system, which requires you to press the down directional key to activate it, and you will have to use the dodge mechanics in and out of some boss fights. Since the dodge system has the secondary function to trigger stomping (for activiating floor switches) this can create issues for players during jumping sequences.The RPG elements feel rather pointless. Including stat point distribution (out of 4 stats), a passive skill tree to which you allot skill points, as well as items and equipment to pick up (not simply upgrade items like wall jump which are necessary for progression). The way they interact really feels like the entire system was cobbled together from disparate ideas, and could have been streamlined far better into a much simpler system.Graphically the game's 2D sprites look ok, are decently animated and work well with the over all astetic, except when it comes to the menu interface, which is pixeleated halfway to oblivion despite setting the resolution scale to 2x (It reeks of a port). Which brings up another problem. There's no resolution option apart from the scaling at all.Overall, the game developer's inexperience (Valdis Story is their second title) shows, but if you can over look the rough edges I'm sure you can find some entertainment out of this title. I personally reccomend picking it up on sale.			"

												I'm surprised this game gets as much praise as it does. It's pretty, to be sure, but the gameplay is a complete mess.The controls are so messy that I can't actually predict what my character is going to do. Hitting the attack button three times will result in my character attacking 2-4 times. This is BRUTAL when you're fighting enemies that will parry/counterattack after a certain number of blocks.There's an ability called ""Skill Cancel"" that lets you dodge, but it's so fiddly I can't actually predict which way I'll dodge, or if I will at all.Bosses aren't balanced at all. In the time I played I noticed that there are bosses that are totally, 100% unkillable until a certain ability is unlocked or item purchased, at which point the boss is completely trivial. This turns what should be a satisfying challenge into frustration followed by disappointment.And that's generally my impression of the entire game: It promises to be a good challenge, but bad design decisions strip away any fun that I would have had.

Nice animations, fun early gameplay, interesting, good art, music, and so on.Then you hit the pointless irritating timed puzzles, the frustrating platform puzzles, seriously unforgiving bosses that you have no warning about and have to grind through or lose progress, crashes, random pauses as it lags (sometimes in the middle of a jump), endless grinding to get items, and so on.Then it deletes your save game.  Which is what happened to me.  Time to quit this sloppy mess and not look back.  If you're really desperate for a Metroidvania-esque fix, pick it up, otherwise play any number of other things... or go back and play one of the Gameboy Castlevania games instead.  This is a serious maybe, but nothing more than that.  Pity, it could have been a lot more.			"

												After giving this a fair shot I cannot recommend this game, even as a metroidvania lover. It starts off intriguing and fun with it's combo mechanics and timing puzzles, however; Valdis Story quickly loses it's charm as you dig a little beneath the surface level of gameplay. The controls and UI and abbhorrent. Enemies and bosses are designed with little-to-no consistency in regards to their movement or mechanics. Constant backtracking to complete objectives. Boss fights, while most are interesting, rely too much on instant death moves and invulnerability periods. Memorizing boss patterns is pointless because they deviate from the pattern too often, this makes certain fights nigh impossible. The music is nicely composed but is haphazardly applied which detracts from the ambiance. Overall, Valdis Story: Abyssal City was rife with potential but hamstrung itself in too many areas.			"

The controls are basically an awful cluster♥♥♥♥ and you'll find yourself dash cancelling and casting spells with even the slightest motion of an analog stick and most of the bosses' difficulty is centered more around being a damage sponge than having any sort of interesting attack pattern. The final boss is a textbook example of how not to script a proper boss fight.I wouldn't give this game to my worst enemy out of fear of being jailed for crimes against humanity.			"

												Have you ever put down a game after having only played for a few hours?  You don't uninstall it because it seemed like it had potential, but it just wasn't able to hook you.  Maybe you're even on the fence about refunding it,  but you think: “It's seems alright, I'll go back to this someday.”  That's what happened to me with Valdis Story: Abyssal City.  Well, that day finally came around and I decided to revisit it.Immediately upon returning to the game I noticed something sort of strange.  It had been a few months since I last played so I thought I might as well start the game over.  After all, I was only a few hours into the game and a fresh start might rekindle my interest. Much to my surprise, it turns out there isn't a delete save feature.  Perhaps they thought being able to overwrite and create new saves was sufficient, but I feel like the ability to delete a save file has been standard for decades.  After a minor set back I was able to begin again.You play as one of four crew-members that have crashed their ship and landed in the lost city Sitheil.  There is a war going on between Myrgato the goddess of dark and Alagoth the goddess of light.  Humans are caught in the middle as both sides are using human souls to create their demonic and angelic soldiers.  Each playable member of the crew has their own backstory and play-style.  The different characters and difficulty options provide a solid amount of replay value.The game itself is a mix of genres.  I would describe it as an adventure platformer with RPG and timed puzzle elements.  You gain experience and levels by defeating enemies.  Each time you level up you are able to place skill and stat points.  The leveling and equipment system allow for building your character however you wish.  Unlike similar platformers there aren't many passive mobility upgrades.  Instead you find keys and learn mobility enhancing spells that allow you to access other regions of the city.  Spells can be assigned to up, down, side, and air.  Then to cast the spell you have to hold a button then press the direction to cast it (or just press the button while in the air).  In order to change the spell you have to pull up one of the two spell menus and reassign it.  There are quite a few spells for each direction but having to change them was so clunky I found myself leaving the mobility spells assigned at almost all times.Fortunately, it was very easy for me to create a melee based character to minimize spell usage during combat.  Fighting is where the game shines.  There are light attacks, heavy attacks, skill cancels (this functions as a dash, brief temporary invincibility, and an attack animation cancel), guarding, and ally assists.  One thing of note is the fact that there aren't invincibility frames upon being hit.  This means that occasionally you can be stun locked and juggled from full health to nearly dead.  Also worth mention is that you get graded and rewarded for how well you perform during boss battles.The bosses can be fairly challenging, especially if you're going into them completely blind.  You can expect to die a few times until you grasp their patterns.  This isn't an issue at all, and most of the battles are well designed.  What wasn't so well designed was the retry/continue system.  When you die you're presented with the options to either retry or go to the main menu.  Retrying occasionally penalizes you by lowering your level.  I tried to search the internet for what determined whether or not you lose levels but I wasn't able to find any information.  There was even one result that suggested it might be a bug.  Naturally you don't want to lose levels, so to avoid this you can go to the main menu and continue from your last save point.  Most of the time continuing from the last save location doesn't result in you losing too much progress.  There was one point at end of the game though where every time I wanted to attempt to fight the final boss I had the option of A.) fighting two bosses and doing a timed platforming section with a borderline pixel perfect jump (because apparently I missed the otherwise unnecessary double jump item) or B.) Retry at the final boss by taking the penalty of losing three levels.  It became more than a little repetitive and ultimately I opted for the level penalty.  Bizarrely, the pause menu doesn't have the options to retry or continue.  Every time you want to retry you either have to wait until your character dies or exit and and go back to the main start menu of the game.  It slows down the action quite a lot.Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a beautiful game and you can tell a lot work went into designing all of the sound and artwork.  Sadly, it's also a game that is tarnished by some very questionable design choices.  I have no doubt that some individuals will truly enjoy this game, but I found it to be more than a little rough around the edges. Overall it's not a bad game. However, the aforementioned issues marred my experience enough that I would find it difficult to recommend to anyone other than absolutely diehard fans of this genre.Like the review?

												Well, having spent the better part of a few days with Valdis Story, and I'm sure I'll play through a bit more, I feel like I'm finally ready to give my opinion on it.Should you buy it? The short version is ""no."" The long version is, ""Yes, but...""Let's quickly figure out why you're here first - you heard it was either difficult, or Metroidvania, right? Well, the game isn't hard, and what's Metroidvania about it is a Frankensteined mess of some of the worst aspects of a Metroidvania game. That's not to say it has no good qualities, but the bad outweigh the good by far.Bad platforming seems to be a staple of Metroidvania games, and Valdis Story most emphatically doesn't disappoint. It's the worst, and the controls just aren't up to the task without extreme frustration. Some of the most egregious of these processes not only involve extended sections of bad platforming, but bad platforming on small, moving ledges, again with conveniently placed enemies designed to knock you back off, falling down a floor or two, sending you back through rooms you've already cleared to re-clear them and try again. Will you grab the ledge, bounce off the wall, or fall harmlessly down it? Hard to say, but it'll probably annoy the hell out of you. Really, many of the enemies are obviously placed with the sole purpose of knocking you off the platform, as they pose no real threat, but are placed in such a way that actually getting to them without being knocked off is the real challenge.Most of the enemies are fairly well-rounded, and bring some interesting mechanics. Again though, they're not really challenging, and most can be pretty easily dispatched by charging in head first and mashing buttons. Of the few that don't fall to such a basic attack, some of them are rather entertaining to play, if not a bit cheap in some of their moves. There's something about an enemy going invulnerable and casting a nearly unavoidable ice storm that freezes you, forcing you to waggle an analog stick to break free, only to be hit with yet another ice attack, become frozen directly after escaping the first, and going through the waggle motions again.The bosses are the real highlight of the difficulty, but those... it's really tough to say they're difficult. Some run the gamut of being mildly challenging to somewhat difficult, but it's safe to say all of them generally fall to the same tactic of avoid their 2-3 moves, grab a few quick hits (or stunlock them, if the fight permits it,) run away, and repeat. They become quite predictable quite quickly. Thankfully, the game incorporates a Devil May Cry ranking system based on a few factors, speed being one of them, that encourages risky tactics to fell them quicker, which grant better rewards based on your rating at completion. An especially nice touch that I really appreciated, and some of the battles grant significant rewards, such as massive amounts of experience to stat bonuses.While we're on the topic, the combat system for melee is quite basic, but typically does its job well. There are quite a few aspects of it, however, that get more in-depth, and the game is very tight-lipped as to explaining what they do, and why you should care. Having a browser open isn't a terrible idea. Unfortunately I can't give praise to the magic system. Many of the spells are rather useless, and though you will NEED to use some of them to accesss secret/hidden/progression areas, there's a good chance that's ALL you'll use them for. The control scheme for them is atrocious, where holding right trigger plus a directional area on your D-pad or left analog stick is disgusting, plus the fact that holding down on your D-pad or analog stick causes another reaction, and shifting spells is typically done with right trigger+B, at which point you have to cycle through them all until you find the desired spell... it's just bad. Really, really bad, and the spells themselves are pretty underwhelming. All said and done, melee works rather well, but avoid magic like the plague. Further, the map is almost completely useless, which is a real sin considering the game involves large amounts of backtracking to find places you couldn't previously access. The UI is bad and could use a severe overhaul, and for whatever reason, when you've triggered enough hits to access your ""combo breaker"" or whatever it's called (also VERY underwhelming) it lets off so many sprites you actually think there's something going on that requires your attention in the upper-left of your screen. I won't touch on the story too much, since there's not much more you can say outside of convoluted, difficult to follow, but still dull as hell. Angels and demons are waging a war, you've been caught in the middle of it while attacking a demon ship, neither the angels nor demons like you, and you need to save the day while reuniting with your crew and befriending other citizens caught in the middle. It's not interesting, and if you skip through the dialog, I wouldn't blame you.All that being said, the game has enormous amounts of replay, unlockables, secrets, etc., with multiple ways to play. If you're a person that doesn't mind frustration, and enjoys the Metroidvania style of play, despite its numerous flaws, it's a solid game that will probably give you quite a bit of entertainment. If any of that doesn't appeal to you, I don't think you'll appreciate Valdis Story. The game has some great ideas, and moments of good fun and combat, but those moments are few and far between, and require enormous patience on the part of the player.			"

												If I didn't have extremely autistic levels of completionism I would have dropped this game after halfway through. Even completing it was an exercise in sadomasochism. The controls are basically an awful cluster♥♥♥♥ and you'll find yourself dash cancelling and casting spells with even the slightest motion of an analog stick and most of the bosses' difficulty is centered more around being a damage sponge than having any sort of interesting attack pattern. The final boss is a textbook example of how not to script a proper boss fight.I wouldn't give this game to my worst enemy out of fear of being jailed for crimes against humanity.			"

												I would advise not to buy this game(<~IF you like well made Metrovania's, not shallow cartoon versions for children).  The developers REFUSE to put in binding options for the mouse.  As if we're living in the 1980's still and that kind of thinking/developing is too hardcore..  Ontop of it already being a shoddy metrovania..  Simple as that to why i would recommend against anyone buying this game..  But don't let me stop you, listen to all the fanboys exaggerating to the extreme about this game...The mouse binds mostly bothers me because they claimed they were listening to their fans to add things.(while they were finishing the developing and patching).  Then continued to ignore the large group asking for mouse binds to be added..  Followed up with the exaggerating fanboys being obnoxiously snarky about anyone asking for it(and holy **** do i mean snarky, for NO good reason). Then the dev's shrugged it off like it was nothing, being they already got their money.  and so my ""rant"" ends.. moving on...			"

												Do not buy.The game looks good at first sight, it is a fast paced 2d action platformer, with an interesting aestethic and decent story, but the problems is with the gameplay.First of all, this game is hard, that in itself is not a problem, but the way the difficulty is implemented is. Several enemies can stunlock you, which results in one lucky attack causing you to die helplessly (or get knocked down 3 stages below). This is particularily annoying with certain bosses (Looking at you Gernot), since he uses stun spells,a bad spread of attack will get you killed through your whole lives since he can hit you as soon as your revive animation goes through to stun you again and keep the circle going.The controls are not very tight, firstly they have a weird setup to begin with, I highly recommen changing it (Down then forward to dash? Who ever though it would be good idea). The ledge jumping gets tedious as you'll never know if your character will decide to latch on or not, introduce enemies that shoot at you sometimes from anywhere in the map and you get some annoyance. Finally, the biggest problem of this game, the hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. Enemy attack animations are only loosely representative of where you'll actually get hit, Demon Widows being the worst offender in this case. THis is a huge problem for a game like this, it sometime feels liek playing the old castlevania on the NES.			"

												It'd be a fun game without all the dedication to wasting a player's time. For example, you can spend several minutes standing around waiting for mana to recover to heal yourself (particularly fun on levels where you lose 5 hp / second because it's cold). Often, missing a single jump means you fall off the current screen and have to fight two screens back to the same jump. If you want to collect items to upgrade your equipment, you'll be grinding for hours. The map doesn't show information like where passages go or what treasures you haven't collected. Then there's a ""puzzle"" where you jump back and forth up a long shaft and need split-second timing to activate seven different doors and missing one means starting all over - turns out you need some upgrade that I didn't even know existed.Other than wasting your time, the game often feels written by people who hate you. For example, save points are fairly uncommon, and then SURPRISE BOSS FIGHT. Or to enter the Guardian Temple, you fall into it - there is no sign you're about to go in, and no way to climb back out. Enter a room and SURPRISE four enemies are now all around you! (And yes, the doors are ""magically sealed"" for the ambushes.)And it's not like you can overlook these things because the game is particularly clever or cute or has a compelling story or characters. Basically, you're going to like this game if you like mastering rapid-fire key press combinations, but that's really all there is to recommend it.			"

												Nice graphics, good music... and that's it.The gameplay itself is fun at first, and it keeps being fun for a whole but as soon as you hit the fire temple you're done, perhaps you'll be done by the garden level depending on how much you can tolerate.Simply put, stun-locking and recoil will be the end of you.You'll be stun-locked by nearly everything in the game and often you'll not be given a chance to get out of it. The Garden Boss is especially annoying about this since the lower half of the arena is flooded with poison and if you get thrown down there he'll shoot projectiles all over the place effectively keeping you stuck down there till you die or get lucky enough to avoid the projectiles and wall-jump back up, and you better HOPE that you don't tap down by mistake because the Cancelling mechanic will shoot you straight down and you'll have to restart the climb.The fire temple is where I drew the line this time, it is extremely punishing, the enemies can kill you in just a single combo or two and if they don't get you, the fire damage will. I'm level 10 in there and the level cap is 20, keep that in mind too. The sensitivity of the ""cancel"" technique and how it shoots you downward if you even so much as graze the Down button makes this level a complete nightmare right away.Later on in the game you'll go through a series of gauntlets with pitfalls. If you fall down a hole you'll be thrown to the bottom floor, effectively resetting the gauntlets and forcing you to redo everything as all the monsters will respawn and the doors will lock. All of these enemies have super armour and will guard against almost everything and parry your attacks, not to mention the countles projectiles, long combos, and invincibility they get. Again, I have to mention the ""cancel"" technique as it will ♥♥♥♥ you over here too. If you mess up and tap Down by mistake here you'll be forced to do the whole gauntlet again.The game looks really nice, it sounds nice too, the story I couldn't care less about, but the gameplay, despite being really fun and promising at the start, becomes entirely composed of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t really early on without warning and without giving you the tools to fight it off. I can't recommend this game to anyone expecting a fun actiony Metroidvania title. If you have the patience of a saint and the perseverence of a God you can make it but normal people should stay away. This could easily be renamed ""Metroidvania: Kaizo 200%"" and it would be more fitting.			"

												My name is Reina; I am an orphan, an expert soul manipulator and predestined to be the next “golden child”.  Alas in a world where the gods are at constant war the best of human plans often go asunder.  My ship was attacked, destroyed and sunk to the bottom of the sea.  That’s where I found the lost city and started what should have been an adventure for the ages.  The lost citizens were wary of this fare haired human visitor, but by backing my promises with actions they warmed up to me.  With their help I explored hostile environments and battled ferocious Feralls with my physical combo attacks supplemented by my customized magic arsenal.  With time, carefully planned personal growth and a few elixirs I was able to explore the underground city and defeat angels and demons alike.  After a while I grew tired of wandering to and fro, backtracking over and over again looking for the missing item I needed to advance my story.  In the end it wasn’t the demons, angels or bosses that ended my adventure prematurely.   It was the tedium that grew too much to bear.			"

												Beautiful game with great level design and fun combat. Unfortunately, the controls are terrible. Six useless buttons on the controller, and I still have to press down, then back to dodge? Really? Why not assign ""Dodge Back"" to a bumper button? And it gets worse from there. The game features truly terrible boss fights. Remeber all the unique combinations of abilities you can customize your character with, in order to create personalized fighting styles? Come boss fight time, that all goes out the window. There's one gimmick per fight. One right way. And usually it involves a whole lot of standing around doing nothing, waiting on the boss to finish some overlong animation and put up there part of the gimmick. Meanwhile you are just dodging...and sometimes watching a clock for a timer to run down so you can repeat some action for the fourteenth time per fight. To, you know, unlock the boss's vulnerable spot so you can hit it four times and repeat the entire sequence again. The game tries to be unique. In setting, style, combat, it pretty much manages. Then it wraps it all up in a package combing the absolute worst 80's and 90's platformers and asks you to like it anway.Avoid this game; hopefully the devs learn from the numerous mistakes present therein.

												I only tried this game with the male character. It is *so close* to being a good hack 'n slash side scroller, but the developers made some choices with the controls that I just can't get over. You find yourself jumping and clinging to ledges, and then climing up them, very frequently.  The player looses control for just a part of a second while the animation for this happens, and then once you are done climbing the ledge and returned to a nice standing position, you will have control again. You do a spinny sword move in the air, and there is a brief pause between hitting the ground and regaining control. Your main dodge move is considered some kind of ""special"" ability which has a short (second-ish maybe) cooldown. There is no indication on the character animation as to when you're ready to dodge again, just a fading purple indicator in the upper left corner. So if you want to know when you are able to /dodge/ in a boss fight, you either need to have the timing memorized, or be watching your indicators while trying to dodge. I've never played any other game where simply dodging has a cooldown.Playing Valdis Story feels like playing a really good platformer that freezes for a split second every few seconds. I understand the value of delays and cooldowns in movement and abilities in games, I just don't feel like were well executed in this game. The movement feels like it's being frequently interrupted for no good reason.			"

												This game wants to think it is a lot of things.I wants to think it is this great throwback experience to ARPGs of old.  It wants to evoke all kinds of memories games it cannot hold a candle to.Unfortunately for me, I have actually played those games.  Valdis Story is nothing like the games it is trying to emulate.  It's not even a good game in general.I can guarantee the people with a positive outlook on this game have never even touched this game's influences.Think of all the good things this game has.  The interesting fighting, the dodging, the soundtrack, the exploration.Think of all the bad things about this game.  The iffy controls, the stupid timers, the jumping puzzles, the wonky hitboxes.All those good things?  They were ripped right out of either Ys or Castlevania, albeit poorly and by someone who did not have the sheer presence of mind to understand what made those games good nor had the skill to execute them properly.  Then again most of the fans of this game must be too young to be familiar to those two game series; which is fine for the average indie gaming teen but not for me.  You people don't know what you are missing by not playing all these better games.  Seriously, pick up any Ys game past Ys 3 and any Castlevania past 2 and you will have basically the same game as this but actually made well.All those bad things?  That is all an Endless Fluff original.  Ys and Castlevania do have platforming in their games, but Konami and Falcom are a bit better at this whole game design thing than Fluff is.But who am I kidding.  Most of you are TF2 kids looking for a nostalgic trip back to a time you were not even alive for.  This game will do just fine for you if that is your perogative.If you know better, then just dig out your old games and save your money.I give this game a 2.5/10 on a true 10 point scale with 5/10 being an ""average"" grade.  This is a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game so I will give it half of a passing score.I have half a mind to make the prescence of this game known to Konami and Falcom so Fluff can get sued into oblivion... if not for plagiarism, then for leaving a mark on the source material.  The other half of my mind hates me for getting suckered in for buying this trash.Fluff you Endless Fluff.  Fluff you.			"

												First off, I played this with a gamepad.Secondly, I want to like this game, but it won't let me. I want to enjoy the beautiful vistas, the amazing Secret Of Mana style music, the huge bosses and the metroidvania environment, but I can't because I'm continually being punished by the game. This is a metroidvania version of I Wanna Be The Guy. If you like that game, you're going to love this one since it's built on the same principles:* EVERY enemy is a cheap, multi-hit air-combo juggling spam-fest. If you fight more than three enemies at a time and they crowd you, it's better to simply put down your controller and wait for them to kill you. If you survive the encounter, your bad healing ability will have you wait five minutes before you can fight the next batch of enemies only to repeat the cycle. I can understand elites in a game, but when every single unit has the health and skills of an elite that invariably juggles you in the air until you die on NORMAL difficulty, then that's a problem. * Pitfall screens, so you're up three stories in a dungeon, you get hit by one of the enemies, you fall two screens down and have to climb back up. This is not fun, this is punishing.* This has been said a lot, but the jumping mechanics and mantling are really bad. Unless you hit just the right part of a wall, down you go again. Combine this with the level design that seems geared towards you falling into pitfalls and you have a really bad result.* This is especially infuriating when you have to do timed jump/run puzzles where your inability to properly walljump punishes you by having you redo the puzzle again. And really, these puzzles are insanely complicated in some instances.* Boss rooms aren't marked on the map, why is this a problem?Well, here is a typical flow of a quest in this game: 1) Get a hint from someone to go somewhere. 2) Navigate annoying pit-fall maze with juggling enemies that forces you to stop every ten minutes to heal.3) Get hard to get treasures with jump/run puzzles 4) Save somewhere in the middle of the dungeon5) Navigate even harder pitfalls and environment hazards, get killed a few times.6) Get more treasures through puzzles, defeat more enemies, level a bit7) Stumble over boss room and realize boss is impossible for your current level.At this point, you can't quit the game. Either you defeat the boss and progress, or you lose ALL progress you've made since point 4 in the list above. Again, this is punishment, not because you're bad, but because the design decisions are bad. So after having played ten hours and gone through the same cycle over and over, I realized that I wasn't having fun, I wasn't enjoying the scenery, I wasn't pondering the story. I was just focused on exploiting the AI and how to not get killed and that's really not my idea of fun in a game.And really, considering the fantastic world this game throws at you, it's a huge shame.

												Literally just spent 15 minutes fighting a boss because it regenned health and blocked constantly from an impenetrable block.The game isn't bad up until you start to near the end, then there's no reason to even bother continuing to play because level caps out and all bosses become pure HP sponges.Button mashing platformer at its core.  I wanted to like it, but the controls are just too sloppy, and the design is meant to frustrate you on purpoes.			"

												Frustrating.  This game is frustrating.  Unless you sit down and play this game pretty much in one sitting, once you put it down you'll barely be able to figure out what to do when you come back to it.  There's nothing telling you where you left off and what you were doing so you kind of aimlessly run around trying to figure out where to go.  The control scheme is awful, and the micromanagement of your skills really over reaches the game's ability.  With the level progression skills you'd think this was Borderlands 3, but it isn't, it's a beautiful platformer that ultimately disappoints.  I don't know whether this game is a brawler with magic elements or a magic game with brawler elements.  If you can grab it cheap and you want a platformer this is fine, but don't expect it to be your game of the year, unless you're 12 or an absolute manchild.			"

												4 hours in, already at the final city. Controls still feel super clunky. Game feels very linear compared to say SOTN, with the way they block areas with locked doors and bosses. SOTN does this, but with a muuch larger map and tons of other areas to choose to explore. This game seems very small. Maybe my expectations were incorrect, but I've been left dissapointed.			"

												On the surface it looks promising enough (Metroidvania games are pretty hard to screw up) but within an hour of playing it you'll start to sour on it. First you realise the controls are ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. Then you realize you have no idea where you're going or what you're doing. Then all at once you realise... you are playing what I've come to call a ""bad game"". The story is straight up high school edgelord ""what if angels and demons are both bad guys"" kind of writing, which is perfect inspiration to go find all your old notebooks and burn them for safety's sake. In this game you play as some cretin who is a mixture of demons and angels or some crap (see Diablo III) and you go around a confusing map fighting pallet swaps of enemies for 6-8  hours and then you uninstall it. I guess there's other characters and difficulties you can unlock if you don't have anything better to do, and if this happens to be the only computer game your circus ringleader lets you play, because you are a dumb ♥♥♥♥ing idiot clown. Bonus points for a late area where you're constantly poisoned and the entire screen has a lovely bright neon green filter on it, which is great if you're the kind of person who is dissatisfied with the amount of migraines you suffer while playing your video games.

												EDIT: Finaly I can change my opinion of this game due to the nasty error that has been fixed. Valdis story is a realy good RPG with a metroidvania feel to it and can say that the creators realy pulled up their socks to fix most to all bugs that have been leading to negative reviews. That is why I can recommend this game to people after a year of agonising bugs. I'm just keeping my original comment below for those interested in what was wrong.I was realy looking forward to play this game since I am a huge fan of indie side scrolling games but this game contains a bug that you just cannot miss. The FPS drops down to a screeching halt with in less than 5 minutes of playing. If it weren't for this bug I would have recommended this game but unfortunately I should give this warning. Do not buy untill this has been fixed.			"

												This game is one that is sure to enteratin you with its fast-paced action and great graphics quality with an interesting artistic style. If you're looking for a challenge, you'll find a particularly intense one in Valdis Story: Abyssal City, as even on the lowest difficulty it can prove punishing to newcomers, and on the highest, it's a crazy tough battle like no other. Gather weapons and armor to slaughter your enemies, and show as much mercy as they do, which is none. And if you're not in it just for the challenge, there's a very interesting story to go along with it, plus a few choices that can have big impacts. Choose wisely, as the results may come back to haunt you. Kill angels and demons alike, as well as the ferals, as you forge a path to victory against all kinds of deadly opponents, and find out why you're fighting them all in the first place. All-in-all, it's an amazing game.			"

												Very cool game ! The graphics are beautiful and the soundtrack really good (I went and buy it actually). The gameplay is interesting and a mix of something new and something more retro/nostalgic at the same time as it remembers me a little of Castlevania sometimes. The monsters to fight seemed to me like surprises everytime so far, both with their designs, but also what they can do. The story itself is fun and the characters funny and interesting. As you progress, you'll see many different type of area that each have their own style and feelings attached to it and this makes it even more interesting since not everything seems made in the same box. It makes it refreshing. I definetly would advise this game to everyone.			"

												If you happen to like platformers with more fighting, as well as games with RPG elements, you'll probably like this game. Valdis Story: Abyssal City features 2 playable characters from the start, each with their own fighting style. Honestly, which character is best for you, really depends on your preference. Completing this game will likely take you some time, so if you want a game that'll take you a while to complete, well, this might be that game you're looking for. You might end up grinding sometimes, and that's part of what makes the game hard to just breeze through, but, is that really a bad thing?So you beat the game, now what? Well, there are still other characters to play as, so there is that for replay value. Based on what I've played of the two initial characters, the dialog definitely varies a bit depending on who you play as, so it's not gonna be exactly the same if you choose another character.So, all that said, this probably isn't a game you'll be 100% finished with in a matter of hours. Just don't take too long a break from this game, you might forget what you were doing, like I did. Yes I know, I'm an idiot. "

												I recommend this game, but with a warning:  You will get frustrated at the controls.  Asthetically speaking, the art style is nice and vibrant, with bosses and mini bosses seemingly every where.  Many of these encouters are made difficult only due to the controls, which takes some getting used too.  The ""cancel"" ability is almost a curse, as you will constantly be fighting it.  You will, in time learn to accept it and move on, but you will become frustrated at the battles you have to repeat because you accidentally ""canceled"" in mid jump (which drops you straight down), and have to fight your way back up... whie poisoned and getting pummeled.  The metroidvania goodness is there, if you can overlook the overly complicated combat system and the boring story.  Flashy doesn't always mean better :)			"

												I didn't really expect much from this game, having seen many other games nowadays try so hard to pull off the Metroidvania style with a mediocre result.That was far from the case on this game.Attacking feels smooth and many other mechanics make the combat one of the most enjoyable in a 2D world. The story feels JRPG-ish with the way the dialogue is set up, which I personally find as a plus. The leveling system adds several different ways to go about fighting, as does the element system which allows for a combination and easy-swap to counter any monster type at any moment.While the platforming can be difficult at times, its more than likely that it is for a completely optional item that may or may not help you. I see a lot of complaints regarding the platforming, but most of the ""difficult"" ones are simply optional.As far as progressing through the game, there is no hand holding. There is a simple indicator on which area you need to go to and the direction it's in. There is a lot of exploration to be done, especially later in the game when backtracking is essential to completing that old puzzle you didn't have the ability or means to complete before.What I have a minor issue with is the restricted trading system, as it sometimes feels like it doesn't give anything of use. There are obvious exceptions to this such as the weapon/armor upgrades given later in the game, but otherwise there are only a few other items that you will be looking for each time you find a trader.My biggest issue though is the lack of ""navigation completion"". By that, I mean that the maps don't indicate very well that this particular room is complete, giving the feeling that there's always Something left to do it there, when in reality there isn't. It's a little frustrating for the completionist in me because I want to be sure I collect every treasure and complete each room to its fullest.Overall, a must-get for anyone looking for a Good Metroidvania game. 9/10			"

												Valdis Story is a 2D side scroller with plenty of beat em up action. If you enjoy Castlevania games, you're going to like this. The controls can take a while to get use to if you're using the keyboard, just remap them to your liking. I prefered playing with a Playstation 3 controller and DS3 tool, it was fantastic. There are times when doing the precision platforming can be painful but all you have to do is take your time and feel it out.There are currently two playable characters, Wyatt and Reina.Wyatt plays more of a strength/dark and light magic character. He's a bit slowered than Reina when it comes to combos, but overall I believe Wyatt plays easier for a new player (especially if you like to jump in on the hardest difficulty). He comes with the ability to use his sword or fists (fists take -40% attack dmg in exchange for +25% exp).Reina is a monk and begins the game with only her fists (No negatives, just +25% exp) as a weapon. She employs magic as well, but doesn't realy have ""dark"" magic. She's not as easy to jump in with, as the ability to break guards is obtainable at level 4, where as Wyatt begins the game able to do so with his strong attacks.Gameplay: 9/10Music: 8.5/10Replayability: 7.5/10 (Two more characters on the way)Overall: 8/10			"

												All right. As angry as the puzzles can make me, as harrowing as some of these boss battles are, AS♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥AS I CAN ♥♥♥♥ING GET AT THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME...It is worth every dime you pay for it. Despite the challenges, or even because of the challenges if you can get past the possibilities of rage quitting, it is a wonderful game. The graphics are stunning, the mechanics of the game are pretty spiffy, the characters are pretty awesome, and the plot keeps me interested. The enemies are broad in variety, the bosses are a league of their own, and finding crew members is a fun side game of its own, I'd have to say. The fact that your main character's soul can gain either a dark, light, or neutral affinity based on the armor you choose, the spells you use most often, and the accesories you choose to wear is pretty novel. Most games, it's what you choose to say. This game, it's how you choose to fight, and that is a rather cool idea, and at the very least, really ♥♥♥♥ing intriguing. I would suggest this game to anybody. Especially if you love hacking and slashing, some witty one liners, using magic spells, and the occasional puzzle. I'll admit, as much as they♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, they provide an edge-of-your-seat challenge that tend to have this really relieving and rewarding feeling when you can manage to make it to your goal in time. Definitely buy it. If you got 15 dollars, I would recommend this game. The replay value really speaks for itself, and you can play as one of a few characters, so hours of fun are something to be had with this game. So what are you waiting for? Dive into the Abyssal City! The gods aren't going to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of themselves!			"

Beautiful 2d art and animation coupled with an interesting storyline and a surprisingly deep combat and magic system makes Valdis Story a joy to own. Now playing it.... well it is tough.... mega man tough really. I've had to stop and take breaks for a bit during my playthrough and I'm playing on normal! Still the fact that I keep coming back is a testament to how much fun I'm having. I never feel cheated by the game or its mechanics because I know if I keep trying I will perfect the part I am stuck on and get to the next boss, who will probably grind me down to nothingness without trying. Multiple characters to play and a wonderful location to explore.... this is going to keep me busy for a while.			"

												This is a combat-focused, combo oriented MetroidVania. It isn't entirely finished, but has a decent amount of replay value and was definitely worth the couple of playthroughs I've given it so far. It's a little on the easy side, but that seems typical of the genre. Last I checked there are two additional playable characters on the way, and I'll probably be playing through one more time with Reina, before they are released. The combat system takes a little getting used to, and with a little attention can be used to create ridiculous combos and damage. That was actually one of my bigger problems, as most of the normal enemies died entirely too quickly to get a feel for the combat system. A few bosses in however, I'd figured out how to outmanuever enemies, essentially utilizing combat based-sequence breaking. I spent a little bit of time backtracking, and the map isn't exactly enormous, but if you're any good at this sort of game you'll find it a cakewalk. And I have yet to try the game on any of the higher difficulties, so I figure my perception that the game is easy may be challenged later on.Overall it's fun game with nice music, solid mechanics and decent replay value, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in 2D platforming or dungeon crawling.

												Imagine a cross between Castlevania, Metroid, and Devil May ♥♥♥♥ You. This game is hard, like sweating from my eyeballs hard. It will make you cry, unless of course you cheat and look up stuff. You need to use everything you've got and be extremely careful when playing this game because you're going to die. To explain Dark Souls is trial and error and patiance, this game is just get good and be good.The movement feels slightly floaty, and I would completely recommend using a controller instead of keyboard and mouse. Combat and gameplay other wise feels great. Magic feels great comboing with other attacks, and enemy responses are great too. The one huge flaw in this game is a lack of downtime. If you get hit, you're going to be hit again. Enemies can and sometimes will combo YOU as a player. Even the enviroment will do this. killing you instantly. It's frustrating how almost everything in this game throws you into unexcapable knockback, from ranged damage to a lack of mana to cast spells you will suffer knockback.Platforming is a 6/10Combat is a good 8.5/10It's a weird but fun genre.

												It's a fun Metroidvania game. It's pretty as all getout, sounds good, and has some really good sprite animations. But there's one big BUT. It's got some absurd timing puzzles, and the controls can be a bit wonky, especially since down acts as dash/defend/etc. Let me repeat that: Really, really tight timing puzzles with less than a second's leeway and occasionally finnicky controls. These aren't all optional, either, there are several points where you've gotta complete a series of really tightly timed switches in order to advance, watching your half-second leeway shorten every time you hit a switch.If you're willing to put up with those, the combat's fun, and the weapon-switches mid-to-late game create an almost entirely brand new fighting experience.

												Fun and challenging RPG-Action-Platformer ( I believe the correct term is Metroidvania?) game. Pros:-The combat system is pretty good and very satisfying, you can feel the impact of your attacks as you shred your enemies. Magic can be fluently integrated in your basic attack combos, which gives the impression of a constant flow in combat. -The amount of customization the game offers is incredible, there are so many ways to build your character(s), making every playthrough unique. This is the biggest strength of the game.-The overworld is quite big and contains numerous hidden treasures and areas which you have to come back for later, rewarding exploration. -People who think newer games are too easy will be satisfied here. Even on Normal difficulty, buttonmashing won't get you anywhere, you have to learn enemy patterns to defeat them. Every boss is unique and a challenge.-Even though the game is considered complete, the devs keep adding addditional content for free every few months.However, the game does have its flaws:-The controls can be a bit wonky, making some of the platforimng puzzles that are already stupidly hard even harder. This frustrated the hell out of me a few times and made me skip some treasures.-The story is near impossible to understand at the beginning as you are flooded with names, requiring an extensive read of the lore section (which isn't even fully available from the beginning) to understand what's going on. Moreover, it feels like you are tossed right in the middle of a story instead of starting at the beginning, while the ending of the game is far from the end of the story. This makes for a quite unsatisfying story experience, you feel like you are missing out on a huge chunk of lore.-The directions you are given for your current quest are very vague; I found myself wandering the map for almost an hour before, by luck, finding out where I have to go to continue. This has never happenend to me before on any game I've played.-A single story playtrhough is quite short (took me about 7 hours on my first run)I bought the game on sale for 4 €, which it was totally worth. At full price, it's a different story though; you should consider the flaws if you plan to pick it up at full price. You can download a demo at the devs homepage for free to try the game and see if you like it. Generally one of the better games in my steam library. The gameplay is comparable to Dust: An Elysian Tale, if you liked that, you will probably like this too despite its flaws.			"

												As someone who still refuses to touch Castlevania: Symphony of the Night due to it not being a classic Castlevania title, I had my prejudices about this title when it was advertised to me as another Metroidvania game. Boy, am I glad I decided to give it a go.This game has got it all. Appealing graphics, good story, superb combat system, great RPG elements... the list goes on. Pretty much the only bigger minus I could possibly give are the controls that might drive new players nuts at first with the precision required in this game (Hi, Engineer's Palace!) The game is still playable and ""finished"" as such, but there's still more to come in the form of patches. Would definitely want to see more items in this game as the weapon choices are really few and limited and with most accessory items the cons outweigh the pros and you will find only the god-slaying item being the only decent one. In this version it's mainly the armors that offer you a variety of choices against different foes.A big plus has to be given to the variety of spells in the game. Sure, you will not end up using many of them at all throughout the playthrough, but it's awesome how they have managed to come up with such a variety of different combat spells and numerous spells that you need to use cleverly to complete many of the puzzles.This game is definitely worth the money and even more. Eagerly looking forward to more awesome games from Endlessfluff games if they are anywhere near as good as Valdis Story.			"

												Fantastic game, was hesitating to buy it at first since I did not heard of it before, in the end bought it as I usually like metroidvania. It looks absolutely beautiful, has great music, a perfect story (not boring, not too complicated) and amazing gameplay. I actually did a second run (with a different character, which felt completely different) right after I finished it the first time, on a harder difficulty. During that run I found out I did not had a clue about the combat before, which is what makes the gameplay so good. It is very easy to understand at the start, but still very deep. Basicly it has everything you want from a metroidvania game. Easily my best purchase during those sales. 10/10			"

												While the platforming needs a tiny bit of polish, the game is extremely enjoyable. I paid the full 15$ for it and don't regret it one bit. The story seems enjoyable enough, but the gameplay is where the charm is. It has RPG elements which add to the charm. You level up, spend points on attributes, craft items, upgrade them. I would recommend this to every metroidvania fan out there. I really love it so far (5 hours in). I think there's a replayablity value to it too. Anyway, if you love metroidvania type games and don't have this yet, you're missing out.			"

												Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a game that got funded by Kickstarter (about 600% overfunded no less). After the initial hype from Kickstarter died out and the first batch of dissapointing games came out people got tired of having their expectations not met lost their faith in overfunding vague promises. However this game is a shining example of going above and beyond everyone's expectations.Valdis Story is one of those action RPGs with stellar gameplay and bad plot. It's almost a tradition by now. If you're familiar with games like the Ys series you will feel right at home with this. Not that everything about the story is bad, theres extensive fluff to be read at the Lore section (kinda funny since the studio is named EndlessFluff) like descriptions of the various ingame enemies and a backstory for every member of your crew that you unlock, the main plot, however, is still bland and doesn't really tap into the decent amount of potential the setting had.But enough about meaningless things like ""plot"", this is an action RPG, as I said it is somewhat of a tradition to have a generic plot. Earlier I mentioned unlocking crew members, but that's not the only thing you will be unlocking, oh no. Weapons, armour, trinkets, material to craft more weapons, armour and trinkets and spell that will allow you to reach new areas you couldn't previously reach so you can get more weapons, etc.-you get the point. You've probably gathered by now that this game is a Metroidvania and so you should expect lots of glorious backtracking and platforming to get to those oh-so-desired treasure chests.Not that you're forced to do any of this platforming if you so desire, if you're only here for the action RPG aspect of the game you can go straight ahead to the combat (of which I guarantee there will be no shortage of), sure there are several mandatory platforming segments in the game, but those are all relatively easy. But you'll be missing out.Notice I said ""relatively"" easy, because I can assure you they won't be easy, but if you're into platforming at all you'll enjoy the clever level design and tight controls (you may prefer to play this game on a controller, but I played on a keyboard and it handled absolutely perfectly). The optional platforming sections are harder, and usually with harsh timers with barely 1-2 second error margin (as opposed to most mandatory timed sections which have far more generous margins) but they're very, very far from impossible. Again, if you're not so into platforming you can skip these but you'll be missing out on all the exploration which is really one of the best aspects of this game, and if you can't do the harder platforming sections you won't be getting the best equipment and so the combat will be harder, so the game has a way of balancing itself out.As for the combat, as I said before you'll fell right at home with this game if you're a fellow fan of the Ys games but even if you aren't I'm sure you'll appreciate the combat system greatly once you get used to it, and I admit it takes some getting used to. At first it starts fairly simple, block, light attack, heavy attack, basic combos, the works, the only thing you're probably feel a bit weirded out by at first is the magic system, but you'll get used to that too. Soon though, you'll start to see a great amount of depth to the system, such that I really cannot discuss in detail in this review. First you'll start to chain together more complex combos and skill cancels (a kind of dash/dodge, you'll be using it a lot). Then you'll start getting a better understanding of how stats/skills and equipment works, and it is here that you'll notice the staggering amount of possible different builds with different skills and equipment and the best stat distribution to go along with them, then you'll find out there are two alternate weapons for Wyatt (I'm assuming you are playing your first playthrough as Wyatt since the game recommends it) which handle so completely different from the standard sword you'll feel like you're playing a completely different character. Afterwards, when you beat the game, you may try to play as Reina, the other of the two playable characters as of now, and it plays so different you'll feel like you're playing a whole different game. There's just no end to the replayability of this game, and there are two more characters coming along as free DLC soon and I can assume they will also handle completely different.I also have to say a few good things about the magic system in this game. Whether you're building your character as a mage type or just use a few spells as utility you'll have to learn how to correctly use the right spell to deal with a situation, and the great part about this is that there really is now useless spell in this game (even a utility spell like forming an ice platform in front of you so you can jump higher can be used to block projectiles or as a barrier between you and an enemy as you dash away from him) so you can really chain together some smart maneuvers in a huge number of different situations. However this will require some quick thinking and skill of your part.Also deserving of a quick mention are the graphics, which are absolutely gorgeous, you don't get art this colourful and detailed in videogames very often anymore, and the soundtrack which is amazing, I seriously cannot overstate just how good the soundtrack is.I do have a few gripes with the game though. 1)A bit more enemy variety would be appreciated 2)The final boss was a letdown after all the great bosses along the game and 3)The ending was stupid even by this game's standards for story. Everything else wrong with the game I consider too nitpicky to mention.All in all this game has a fantastic combat system, interesting use of magic and great level and boss design. If you're a fan of either action RPGs or metroidvanias this game if definitely worth checking out, and if you're a fan of both this game is simply heaven. If you take your time during your first playthrough and explore as much as you can this game will net you 10-12 hours easily but the devs regularly update the game and more content is on the way (it's nice to see the extra funding being put to good use) so the already huge replay value of this game is going to be extended. This game is a serious GOTY contender for me and if you like this kind of game and/or are looking for a seriously challenging game in both action and platforming then this game should be a no-brainer for you.

												This is a combat-focused, combo oriented MetroidVania. It isn't entirely finished, but has a decent amount of replay value and was definitely worth the couple of playthroughs I've given it so far. It's a little on the easy side, but that seems typical of the genre. Last I checked there are two additional playable characters on the way, and I'll probably be playing through one more time with Reina, before they are released. The combat system takes a little getting used to, and with a little attention can be used to create ridiculous combos and damage. That was actually one of my bigger problems, as most of the normal enemies died entirely too quickly to get a feel for the combat system. A few bosses in however, I'd figured out how to outmanuever enemies, essentially utilizing combat based-sequence breaking. I spent a little bit of time backtracking, and the map isn't exactly enormous, but if you're any good at this sort of game you'll find it a cakewalk. And I have yet to try the game on any of the higher difficulties, so I figure my perception that the game is easy may be challenged later on.Overall it's fun game with nice music, solid mechanics and decent replay value, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in 2D platforming or dungeon crawling.

												This game is very well done. The art, combat, and music make up for a few of its frustrations.Addressing some issues that other users have brought up:No waypoints or journal - It is sometimes difficult to figure out where it is to go and I did manage to get stuck at one point, forcing me to reload the save. You will spend some time exporing.Controls - The controls are a bit hard to master. I use a keyboard, and I imagine it would be slightly easier to use a joystick. It takes a bit of getting used to.New armours - To receive new armour, you have to perform jumping challenges, where you must execute a series of jumps in perfect succession. Some of them are relatively simple, while others can be more than 10 jumps. This can get frustrating at times, but collecting all the armours is not required to complete the game.As you defeat bosses, you will unlock new abilities to access new areas. Certain new abilities will make these jumping challenges easier. You can also return to old areas to completely loot it with new spells.			"

Besides the beautiful graphics, the combat is solid and addicting and the levels rewards exploration, granting you both common and rare items from hidden chests. The only thing that I didn't find so consistent about the game is the difficulty curve in some bosses: You are in a level, destroying everything in your way, and suddenly, the area's boss kick your♥♥♥♥♥so fast, you keep pondering what just happened. Fortunately, after dying a lot, you memorize the boss' paterns and retalliate accordingly. Anyways, I would recommend this game for any fans of the old Metroid/Castlevania games.			"

												In a field strongly crowded with mediocre platformers, Valdis Story delivers a fresh and formidable experience that rewrites the formula rather then just rehashing it. Challenging, Castlevania-esque gameplay rewards patience and practice while DMC style combo focused combat helps deliver not only a  gauge of your skill, but immedeate gratification when a new fight pattern is mastered. There is challenge and replayability aplenty, as well. Follow the story, or go exploring. Certain areas may start off limits geographically, but there are plenty of challenging areas accessable right off the bat, whose only barrier to entry is your ability not to get killed. Add this to a well written and unique story, snappy controls, a brilliant original soudtrack, and you wind up with a can't miss title.			"

												Excellent metroidvania type of game that allows you to pick from multiple characters(classes) to play, offers a wide variety of spells and abilities to use, and has a talent/perk system similar to offense, defense, or sorcery. Great art style and soundtrack and the bosses are challenging. The game rewards exploration with useful loot and other items or upgrades.			"

												This game is an incredibly entertaining time killer. Story is pretty solid, generic, but solid. Gameplay is fantastic, with lots of unlockables and tons of variety as far as building your characters. Castlevania/rogue legacy type gameplay, with lots of hidden things to unlock. Strongly recommend.			"

												This is a really fun game and it goes to show that you dont need a huge AAA game teasm to make a good game. This game is smooth and is fun to play. I havent had anything bad to say about it so far. I would like the resolution to fit 1920x1080 but what its at now is good enough. I cant wait for the new characters to come out and am very thankful that they are scheduled to be free.			"

												(I have not yet completed this game and this is thus only a first impressions review)One of the most fun and prettiest 2D platformers I've played in recent memory.The game is a 2D beat em' up platformer, mixing combat with nice and fun to explore enviroments, that reward you for taking your time to look around (and often also test your speed). The boss fights are unforgiving but seem fair and very fun to play. Even when I've died multiple times to the same boss I never feel cheated or loose interest in the game, I want to get back in and prove my skill. The game is not afraid of shoving bosses at you from the very start, with a nice balance in difficulty, where even normal might prove a challenge for you if you're not used to this type of game. The music is simply beautiful, and fit well into the games atmosphere.For me the game was worth it's price and I almost can't wait to play more of it. The only thing I've been missing is co-op, which is a very small complaint, if you can even call it that, since it's just me wanting to share experience that is this game with some friends.(Should most definitely be played with a controller)			"

												Short and sweet: Metroidvania.  Some kind of story that is apparently ongoing.  Giant talent trees, good combo system, a combat system that is completely unforgiving of poor play, but makes you feel like a total badass when you master it.   Good music, unique art style (I personally like the sprites and levels, but dislike the portraits). Warning: You need a gamepad to play it right.It's a hard but fair metroidvania.  You like that, you will be happy you spent a mere 15 dollars on it.			"

The game play is solid but i do have to point out that the controls are scheme could have been done alot better then what they have, if they fixed it, it would (in my opinion) could get a 4.5 out of 5.0 instead i give it a 3.5 out of 5.0			"

												Its been a long time since i've played a half way decent side scroller rpg. This game has really fluid movements and the beautiful character art and backgrounds. I'd say all this game is missing is a decent double jump, it does offer you a wall jump; but even with my responsive keyboard it just doesnt do justice. Also this game really does dump a lot of information on you about skills, spells and items but doesnt really do anything to explain them or how to use them. I'm not asking for a step by step tutorial, but it did take me quite awhile to get used to the combos and how the play actually works. Other then that its a very fun fast paced side scroller beat em up.			"

												Valdis Story: Abyssal City is absolutely incredible.+Difficult-yet-rewarding platforming and combat. You actually feel accomplished when you get to a hard-to-reach area or beat a hard-to-defeat boss.+Interesting story. I found myself reading the text instead of skipping it.+Different characters/weapons/armor/skills/etc. to allow different playstyles.+Beautiful visuals and fluid animations. There are nice little touches like your character shivering in a cold area.+Fantastic music.+Great level design, exploration is encouraged. There are places you won't be able to get to at first, but you'll later find keys to open doors and learn spells that allow you to reach new areas and probably get some nice loot!+Controls! I've been playing with a controller and it works for 100% of the game (so I'm not sure why it's listed as having only ""Partial Controller Support"") and the controls are great.I immediately started a second playthrough when I finished it the first time, which is a good indicator of how much I enjoyed the game.

												I've just bought this game expecting a mix of hack and slash and castlevania-like levels and exploration, and Valdis Story did not fail to surpass my expectations. Besides the beautiful graphics, the combat is solid and addicting and the levels rewards exploration, granting you both common and rare items from hidden chests. The only thing that I didn't find so consistent about the game is the difficulty curve in some bosses: You are in a level, destroying everything in your way, and suddenly, the area's boss kick your♥♥♥♥♥so fast, you keep pondering what just happened. Fortunately, after dying a lot, you memorize the boss' paterns and retalliate accordingly. Anyways, I would recommend this game for any fans of the old Metroid/Castlevania games.			"

												The best thing about this game is its combat; it's so fluid and uninterrupted. And the combat changes all the time depending on the situation and how you've built your character. There are so many different ways to customize your experience. The difficulty is great; hard, but not infeasibly so.My only complaint is that it appears fairly short, but releases/updates are still coming out for it, so I can see myself sinking in more hours as they progress.

												In a field strongly crowded with mediocre platformers, Valdis Story delivers a fresh and formidable experience that rewrites the formula rather then just rehashing it. Challenging, Castlevania-esque gameplay rewards patience and practice while DMC style combo focused combat helps deliver not only a  gauge of your skill, but immedeate gratification when a new fight pattern is mastered. There is challenge and replayability aplenty, as well. Follow the story, or go exploring. Certain areas may start off limits geographically, but there are plenty of challenging areas accessable right off the bat, whose only barrier to entry is your ability not to get killed. Add this to a well written and unique story, snappy controls, a brilliant original soudtrack, and you wind up with a can't miss title.			"

												Fantastic game, was hesitating to buy it at first since I did not heard of it before, in the end bought it as I usually like metroidvania. It looks absolutely beautiful, has great music, a perfect story (not boring, not too complicated) and amazing gameplay. I actually did a second run (with a different character, which felt completely different) right after I finished it the first time, on a harder difficulty. During that run I found out I did not had a clue about the combat before, which is what makes the gameplay so good. It is very easy to understand at the start, but still very deep. Basicly it has everything you want from a metroidvania game. Easily my best purchase during those sales. 10/10			"

												As someone who still refuses to touch Castlevania: Symphony of the Night due to it not being a classic Castlevania title, I had my prejudices about this title when it was advertised to me as another Metroidvania game. Boy, am I glad I decided to give it a go.This game has got it all. Appealing graphics, good story, superb combat system, great RPG elements... the list goes on. Pretty much the only bigger minus I could possibly give are the controls that might drive new players nuts at first with the precision required in this game (Hi, Engineer's Palace!) The game is still playable and ""finished"" as such, but there's still more to come in the form of patches. Would definitely want to see more items in this game as the weapon choices are really few and limited and with most accessory items the cons outweigh the pros and you will find only the god-slaying item being the only decent one. In this version it's mainly the armors that offer you a variety of choices against different foes.A big plus has to be given to the variety of spells in the game. Sure, you will not end up using many of them at all throughout the playthrough, but it's awesome how they have managed to come up with such a variety of different combat spells and numerous spells that you need to use cleverly to complete many of the puzzles.This game is definitely worth the money and even more. Eagerly looking forward to more awesome games from Endlessfluff games if they are anywhere near as good as Valdis Story.			"

												Fun and challenging RPG-Action-Platformer ( I believe the correct term is Metroidvania?) game. Pros:-The combat system is pretty good and very satisfying, you can feel the impact of your attacks as you shred your enemies. Magic can be fluently integrated in your basic attack combos, which gives the impression of a constant flow in combat. -The amount of customization the game offers is incredible, there are so many ways to build your character(s), making every playthrough unique. This is the biggest strength of the game.-The overworld is quite big and contains numerous hidden treasures and areas which you have to come back for later, rewarding exploration. -People who think newer games are too easy will be satisfied here. Even on Normal difficulty, buttonmashing won't get you anywhere, you have to learn enemy patterns to defeat them. Every boss is unique and a challenge.-Even though the game is considered complete, the devs keep adding addditional content for free every few months.However, the game does have its flaws:-The controls can be a bit wonky, making some of the platforimng puzzles that are already stupidly hard even harder. This frustrated the hell out of me a few times and made me skip some treasures.-The story is near impossible to understand at the beginning as you are flooded with names, requiring an extensive read of the lore section (which isn't even fully available from the beginning) to understand what's going on. Moreover, it feels like you are tossed right in the middle of a story instead of starting at the beginning, while the ending of the game is far from the end of the story. This makes for a quite unsatisfying story experience, you feel like you are missing out on a huge chunk of lore.-The directions you are given for your current quest are very vague; I found myself wandering the map for almost an hour before, by luck, finding out where I have to go to continue. This has never happenend to me before on any game I've played.-A single story playtrhough is quite short (took me about 7 hours on my first run)I bought the game on sale for 4 €, which it was totally worth. At full price, it's a different story though; you should consider the flaws if you plan to pick it up at full price. You can download a demo at the devs homepage for free to try the game and see if you like it. Generally one of the better games in my steam library. The gameplay is comparable to Dust: An Elysian Tale, if you liked that, you will probably like this too despite its flaws.			"

												The wall jump mechanic in this game is not very well designed. Wall jumping requires only that the jump button is pressed while against a wall to trigger the wall jump ability once you have it. This has lead to several deaths as many fights require jumping and attacking. Many times I end up wall jumping into bosss attacks rather then dealing damage as my intention. Most wall jump mechanics require the user to press away from the wall while pressing the jump button to trigger a Wall Jump.  "

												Great metroidvania with rpg elements, I recommend it for anyone who likes button bashing and hard bosses. Music and the graphics are beutifully made and the combat and skill system keeps you hooked. However the mobs are really cheap and boring, which makes you avoid them most of the time. Also the puzzles are as boring as the mobs and way too easy, also Wyatt was much more overpowered than Reina and on my opinion she didn't have as much variation as Wyatt had, making you fall a sleep when you play as her since she is not as customiseable. I give this game 8.5/10.			"

Semi-frequent ""save-points"" allow for a small playing time if necessary, or just keep it up and play longer.  The game feels almost circa 90's Castlevania-esque.  Musical score fits the game perfectly and aids in immersing the player in the overall story.  A must for fans of old school gaming.			"

												Good one! I was surprised by the quality of graphics, sound, and gameplay. Definitely something that you really get into a flow with the combat system, and there is a lot of room for mastery. There is great level design, and excellent secrets hidden without being completely arbitrary like others in the Metroidvania style. The crafting and leveling systems are also a great touch, because while you are searching and backtracking you are still building up yourself, which makes it less repetitive. The magic system is an interesting take that fits well into the game's dedication to skill and combo systems, leading to some very intense and varied boss fights which are ranked based on how well you perform. I'm not much of one for ranking, but I wasn't punished or anything for not being very good!The storyline was also pretty incredible and takes a unique view on the common trope of angels versus demons -- it isn't often that a game gives me chills right from the start!To be a bit critical, I think that this is not as polished as it could be, leading to some instances like discovering a secret room with an ""out to lunch"" character that just hasn't been implemented yet (leading to some confused Googling). I think this is forgivable due to the Kickstarted nature of the game and actually leads to sort of a throwback classic game feel where there are inexplicable things that happen, but without being as brutal as La-Mulana.This was a neat one to find, and I hope that it becomes even more popular!

												Similar to Metroidvanias: You acquire new abilities and items which encourage you to revisit old locations and open new areas.Similar to RPGs: There is a leveling and character customization mechanic, gear and weaponry to acquire and buff, and companions to assist you.Similar to DMC: There is a very fun but not overly complex melee / combo system. It's not hard to get the hang of, but adds some depth to otherwise simple, enjoyable swordplay.Somehow, the game is so much more than the sum of its parts would suggest. Highly recommended.			"

												I have spent a very large amount of time playing this game, and it's been worth every moment. This game, to me, has set the bar for what crowd funded indie games can achieve. It was a totally addicting journey from start to finish. I normally don't do metroidvania because I am conceptually against backtracking and it certainly didnt help that I havent been into platformers since maybe the late GBA era, but this game persisted to me as a stand out title. I love so much about the game, the music, the combat, the level of character customization (weapons, armor, accessories, meaningfully branched skill trees, etc.), the well implimented story and all the little details and encounters. It reminds me of Dark Souls in a more colorful way. Angels are trying to murder you (and everyone else) and harvest your souls, demons are trying to do essentially the same thing and you are here to sort that out with nothing but the simple goal of shredding two oppressive and militant Goddesses. I normally dont PC game all that much, so the controls were innitially kind of a brick wall to me, but I was enjoying the game so much that I found mysellf trying very hard on the first playthrough to actually adapt to using my fingers instead of my thumbs for playing the game (The game supports game pads, but apparently only Xbox because my PS3 controller wont work). I whole heartedly reccomend this game if you like RPGs, platforming, challenging gameplay and really inspired combat with a hint of DMC flair.			"

												I'll start by saying this is a great game, the only thing that stops it being a fanstastic game though is some flaws which bleed through into frustration inducing headache.It's your normal 'start with nothing but your sword' affair and then go to villages performing their run of the mill tasks 'please get me X item and i'll unlock this door for you' and so on and you run around dungeons with a different colour/environment with slightly different spikes/traps in each one. Rinse and repeat until bosses are killed, find some other people from your ship that sank to get extra shops, story and perhaps an attack or two and repeat the formula until the end. There's no originality here but what it does, it does well.The Soundtrack is magnificent, very impressive and gets the blood pumping in battle and sets a superb orchestral haze for general exploring. It's arguably some of the best 'fitting' music for a platform ARPG since Zelda 'A link to the past'.Graphically and animation wise it's top notch, there's a few games in the same category which trump it but the style serves well and has a strong western anime feel to it. Story wise? Again decent yarn, you are the grey line inbetween demons and angels and battle both. Done to death with diablo onwards but still its pretty interesting but not great.So down to the meat of it: Exploration? Check. There isn't a million rooms but my god the back tracking. I'll say it now, if you don't like backtracking in games, remembering where items/chests that are unreachable are and committing it to memory/paper or notepad then forget it. This is your personal hell. The map isn't that great and you can end up spending hours running through the same puzzles/traps/monsters etc just to find out which way is up and where you are meant to be going. Especially on the puzzles where you'll be force to run through the same ones several times.Combat? Correct and present. It's not that complex, just rack up combos, block/dodge, rack up some more and so on. You get a nice dash feature called a skill cancel, it also allows you to break out of some frames of animation in a combat setting but generally speaking it's not that great and far too many puzzles expect it. The worst bit about combat is the juggling that occurs on you. Too many opportunities to have 2/3 enemies which bounce you around like a basketball and it's unblockable/cancellable.Thankfully it doesn't happen often but it's incredibly annoying getting pinged between them an no hope of escape.There's also a nice limit break /rage feature called focus allowing you to special attack for a large amount of damage. Which most of the time you wont bother and will ignore it, mainly because its a key combo to turn on the rage and then another to execute a super attack. I think it's probably why I just disregarded it as with the split seconds you get an attack opportunity on bosses, it's more bother than worth trying when you can just heavy attack instead.Puzzles/traps/chests? Yarp. None are difficult in working out what to do, many are painful in execution. You are talking pixels and split second timing on some puzzles to get that elusive chest which, 9/10 times is rubbish anyway. The movement of the character is wooly at times, often you can be stood on a switch graphically - but you aren't and need to scootch over a little to activate it. Same with jumping onto walls to grab them, the collision can be horrible on some of the later dungeon walls which are crumbly graphic wise but you are actually guessing where to jump to. Bad design here unfortunately.Bosses? All here and as 'boss by numbers' as you'd expect. One is weak to magic. One is weak to fire. One is weak to melee. One is half the wall you have to break bits of and so on. You've killed all these ten times before in every other game.Oh and don't forget the obligatory mini boss rush at the end of the game. None of them are standout though. After you've killed them all you won't remember them.RPG skills/experience/talents? +1 to X skill gives more attack and so on. Standard stuff, max level 20 and 1 talent point per level and 3 different trees that are unlocked as you move through them at levels 5/10/15. Standard fare and apart from the guardian tree, they don't alter your character play through that much. It's nice and simple which means it's easy to get into and you can even redistribute at an NPC later in the game. I would have preferred that each tree was far more weird and wonderful towards the bottom rather a mundane 'some extra HP' or 'more magic damage'.Overall I enjoyed it - a second play through or a third? I don't think so. Not in it's current state anyway.Even with the unlocks for a second play through or even a different character or two, the frustrations of backtracking/collision and juggling really takes the shine of what could have been the makings of a classic.It's clear the developers are going for a multi game story here so here's to hoping the 2nd builds on this.Overall B-			"

												If you're a gamer, you've trained your whole life for this.Beating the game on hard--only the 2nd of 5 difficulties--required the best of my skills from platformers, fighting games, and RPGs. Most bosses feel outright impossible the first time you fight them, but the satisfaction when you emerge triumphant is what the gods gave us video games for. The story is pretty good, too, though it barely scratches the surface of what is clearly a well thought out world and history. And if all that doesn't sell you, the music is worth the price of admission all on its own.			"

I'd say all this game is missing is a decent double jump, it does offer you a wall jump; but even with my responsive keyboard it just doesnt do justice. Also this game really does dump a lot of information on you about skills, spells and items but doesnt really do anything to explain them or how to use them. I'm not asking for a step by step tutorial, but it did take me quite awhile to get used to the combos and how the play actually works. Other then that its a very fun fast paced side scroller beat em up.			"

You actually feel accomplished when you get to a hard-to-reach area or beat a hard-to-defeat boss.+Interesting story. I found myself reading the text instead of skipping it.+Different characters/weapons/armor/skills/etc. to allow different playstyles.+Beautiful visuals and fluid animations. There are nice little touches like your character shivering in a cold area.+Fantastic music.+Great level design, exploration is encouraged. There are places you won't be able to get to at first, but you'll later find keys to open doors and learn spells that allow you to reach new areas and probably get some nice loot!+Controls! I've been playing with a controller and it works for 100% of the game (so I'm not sure why it's listed as having only ""Partial Controller Support"") and the controls are great.I immediately started a second playthrough when I finished it the first time, which is a good indicator of how much I enjoyed the game.

												I recommend this game but I have an incredibly hard time doing so.The combat was fun with tight controls. Dodging, counter attacking, and casting magic are all well done. One of my major gripes with it is that there are no I-frames after taking a hit. This could lead to situations where a single hit could get you chain stunned until you die. Avoidable, but infuriating. Additionally, a large number of the spells you get seem to be redundant. You have at least 3 different ways to cast a projectile sideways. Seems pointless.The upgrade system to me left a lot to be desired. Most of the effects were fairly underwhelming and many of them had vague descriptions at best. Also, no abilities to help you leverage unarmed combat which was my personal favorite.Finally, platforming. Oh dear god the platforming. It has been years since I have been this frustrated with a game. Some of the sections in this game were so incredibly touchy and tedious I screamed in frustration. It boggles my mind how a game with such tight controls can have such annoying platforming. I found myself constantly falling 2+ zones downward when I would be caught by a stray shot from a rifleman and get knocked off a platform only to feel the pleasure of having to kill the same cluster♥♥♥♥ of enemies at the bottom of the chasm. In short: you will not enjoy the platforming in this game, you will endure it.That being said, there is something compelling about this game that forces me to continue playing it. The good in the game is REALLY GOOD and the bad in the game is mind flayingly bad. Thankfully the obnoxious parts are spaced few and far between.			"

												Easily one if not the best Metroidvania game on Steam. Valdis Story I picked up on release due to curiouslity, and I was extremely surprised with what I played. The game has four unique scenarios following the main protagonists of the game which will give you a good amount of play time. The gameplay feels so smooth, and responsive so you can pull off good combos on enemies. The bosses provide challenges, and require you to level your character or try new tactics. The art style looks pretty good, and the environments are very calming along with the good OST. Metroidvania fans should pick this up without a doubt.			"

												This is a great metroidvania style game with lots of customization between the skills you learn leveling, the spells you use and the equipment you find and upgrade.  While the bosses can be seemingly unfair at times you just have to learn their patterns (which may take a couple of retries). Overall the game has been a lot of fun, my only big complaint is that as you progress it is not always clear where you need to go to complete a quest, or when you return to the game after a break there is only a small hint of where you need to go.

												Extremely fun platformer hampered by the default controll binding of the dash/cancel key to down on the d-pad. Once once gets used to and tweaks the controls though, its an extremely solid platformer with some metroidvania flair thrown in.			"

												Wow... easily the best Metroidvania game to come out in a long while. Beautiful 2d art and animation coupled with an interesting storyline and a surprisingly deep combat and magic system makes Valdis Story a joy to own. Now playing it.... well it is tough.... mega man tough really. I've had to stop and take breaks for a bit during my playthrough and I'm playing on normal! Still the fact that I keep coming back is a testament to how much fun I'm having. I never feel cheated by the game or its mechanics because I know if I keep trying I will perfect the part I am stuck on and get to the next boss, who will probably grind me down to nothingness without trying. Multiple characters to play and a wonderful location to explore.... this is going to keep me busy for a while.			"

												Amazing game that recalls the greatness of the 16-bit era. Amazing music, colorful art style, fun to play and explore, very satisfying. I haven't been this in love with a Metroidvania since Super Metroid.There's a ton of depth to the character progression system with several viable types of builds (magic, melee, high damage, high survivability, etc.). The item crafting system also allows you to augment your play style; it reminds me a lot of the Souls series, actually. Certain NPCs that you meet or unlock with be able to further upgrade your gear and skills, and the incentive for exploring the world is finding them and fiding ingredients you can give them to boost your character. This game is a very worthy buy, and will be especially resonant if you grew up on the SNES as it harkens the action-adventure and RPG games of that period while using contemporary design to enhance the ideas it borrows. One of the best games of 2013.			"

This game has alot of potential if only it had the effort that was put into its appearence put into its level design. despite all of its flaws however there are aspects of the game that are truely well done, the exploaration and the puzzle/treasure rooms are well put together, over all dispite its lack in certain areas it is a very rewarding game 7.5/10			"

I picked this game up on sale, but upon reflection, it is well worth the price of admission at the regular price of $15.I will admit that I find some of the boss fights to be particularly challenging, but I'm also pretty sure that this is mostly because I am absolutely awful at this type of game. Still a lot of fun, though.			"

												Easily one if not the best Metroidvania game on Steam. Valdis Story I picked up on release due to curiouslity, and I was extremely surprised with what I played. The game has four unique scenarios following the main protagonists of the game which will give you a good amount of play time. The gameplay feels so smooth, and responsive so you can pull off good combos on enemies. The bosses provide challenges, and require you to level your character or try new tactics. The art style looks pretty good, and the environments are very calming along with the good OST. Metroidvania fans should pick this up without a doubt.			"

												After beating both campaigns and starting to work on achivements, I've finally decided to review. What drew me to this game was the art style, but when I realized it was a metroidvania type game I was sold. Before I review anything I read most of the negative reviews, and I can see why they feel the way they do, but I disagree with a lot of their complaints. A big issue I saw was the difficulty spikes, and the timing on some of the puzzles. I'll agree some of the bosses are very difficult, but trial and error is a solution, like with most games. Or just do some level grinding and try again. Some of the puzzles are horrible, in the sense that if you misstep once, you HAVE to start over because you'll never make it in time. I don't think that's a good reason to not recommend a game though, considering a lot of the harder puzzles are optional. Overall I'd say this is one of the best games i've come across on steam, i'd give it a solid 9/10. P.S. Good luck with the hard difficulty getting S rank on all bosses achievement.			"

												I didn't really expect much from this game, having seen many other games nowadays try so hard to pull off the Metroidvania style with a mediocre result.That was far from the case on this game.Attacking feels smooth and many other mechanics make the combat one of the most enjoyable in a 2D world. The story feels JRPG-ish with the way the dialogue is set up, which I personally find as a plus. The leveling system adds several different ways to go about fighting, as does the element system which allows for a combination and easy-swap to counter any monster type at any moment.While the platforming can be difficult at times, its more than likely that it is for a completely optional item that may or may not help you. I see a lot of complaints regarding the platforming, but most of the ""difficult"" ones are simply optional.As far as progressing through the game, there is no hand holding. There is a simple indicator on which area you need to go to and the direction it's in. There is a lot of exploration to be done, especially later in the game when backtracking is essential to completing that old puzzle you didn't have the ability or means to complete before.What I have a minor issue with is the restricted trading system, as it sometimes feels like it doesn't give anything of use. There are obvious exceptions to this such as the weapon/armor upgrades given later in the game, but otherwise there are only a few other items that you will be looking for each time you find a trader.My biggest issue though is the lack of ""navigation completion"". By that, I mean that the maps don't indicate very well that this particular room is complete, giving the feeling that there's always Something left to do it there, when in reality there isn't. It's a little frustrating for the completionist in me because I want to be sure I collect every treasure and complete each room to its fullest.Overall, a must-get for anyone looking for a Good Metroidvania game. 9/10			"

												If you happen to like platformers with more fighting, as well as games with RPG elements, you'll probably like this game. Valdis Story: Abyssal City features 2 playable characters from the start, each with their own fighting style. Honestly, which character is best for you, really depends on your preference. Completing this game will likely take you some time, so if you want a game that'll take you a while to complete, well, this might be that game you're looking for. You might end up grinding sometimes, and that's part of what makes the game hard to just breeze through, but, is that really a bad thing?So you beat the game, now what? Well, there are still other characters to play as, so there is that for replay value. Based on what I've played of the two initial characters, the dialog definitely varies a bit depending on who you play as, so it's not gonna be exactly the same if you choose another character.So, all that said, this probably isn't a game you'll be 100% finished with in a matter of hours. Just don't take too long a break from this game, you might forget what you were doing, like I did. Yes I know, I'm an idiot. "

												EDIT: Finaly I can change my opinion of this game due to the nasty error that has been fixed. Valdis story is a realy good RPG with a metroidvania feel to it and can say that the creators realy pulled up their socks to fix most to all bugs that have been leading to negative reviews. That is why I can recommend this game to people after a year of agonising bugs. I'm just keeping my original comment below for those interested in what was wrong.I was realy looking forward to play this game since I am a huge fan of indie side scrolling games but this game contains a bug that you just cannot miss. The FPS drops down to a screeching halt with in less than 5 minutes of playing. If it weren't for this bug I would have recommended this game but unfortunately I should give this warning. Do not buy untill this has been fixed.			"

												An increadibly enjoyable game with interesting lore, tight controls, engaging rpg leveling, and solid gameplay. It isnt perfect though, exploration and map layout are only ok. Backtracking from one area to another can be a chore (trolleys help but only so much). Some steps in the story are not exactly spelt out clearly, and the barter system for items can get tedious depending on what you're aiming to craft. Still, if you are a fan of Metriodvanias this game should definitatly be on your hit list.			"

												The controls in this game are great. I didn't expect much coming in to this but after playing it I wish more platforming games took a note from this style. The shop system in the game was disappointing but it was balanced. The story is so/so too. The gameplay is wonderful though, reminding me of Castlevania SoTN.			"

												HIghly recommended for Metroid-Vania players.... Fun and challenging game plus the story's kinda nice.. the only downside I found was that if you 'explored' instead of following the story, you'll risk yourself losing some miss-able items.... would definitely play this again.....			"

												This game I guess you could say is a ""metroidvania"" platformer, but more spefically the feel, level themes, and music really remind me of Castlevania: Symphony of The Night. However, the fighting style is a lot more involved in this game and allows you to use a variety of different spells (you can equip four a a time). The controls are mostly smooth and allow for quicker combat than you usually have in these types of games (although I occasionally had a hardtime parrying attacks). My one main complaint about the game is that the story seems to left a lot unexplained, like, a couple more sentences at the beginning of the game would have made more sentence. It's not to say they left it all together, there's a lot of talk about gods and goddess, angels and demons and our angry hero who hates all of them, but you never really get a sense of who the characters actually are, which makes me wonder why the even bothered with the dialogue. I would also say that the bosses at the end of the game are quite a bit harder than ones you'll fight previously...if you make to the end of the game prepare for a couple of very frustrating fights. Additionally, a global map would have been very helpful, not ones that were partitioned with the three seperate stations. In a game like Castlevania where you have to revisit things and travel long distances, it always helps to keep track of where those things are- it was a little difficult in this game. Despite my complaints, I still enjoyed the game overall and would recommend to anyone who enjoyed Symphony of the night or enjoys atmospheric ""metroidvania"" style games. "

												Great metroidvania with rpg elements, I recommend it for anyone who likes button bashing and hard bosses. Music and the graphics are beutifully made and the combat and skill system keeps you hooked. However the mobs are really cheap and boring, which makes you avoid them most of the time. Also the puzzles are as boring as the mobs and way too easy, also Wyatt was much more overpowered than Reina and on my opinion she didn't have as much variation as Wyatt had, making you fall a sleep when you play as her since she is not as customiseable. I give this game 8.5/10.			"

												I can't say enough about this game. I've sunk over 100+ hours into it and I didn't even mean to. I just wanted to keep trying new builds, unlocking new achievements and no game has ever made me want to get all the achievements. I will say this right off the bat: If you enjoy games that encourage build experimentation involving skill trees and whatnot, this game with scratch an itch that most games don't.Let me get the main flaw out of the way: the story is only serviceable. The characters are all unique and enjoyable and the lore seems interesting, but you don't get to spend much time with it during the game (you can read about it in the lore entries though).Okay so where do I start with the awesome stuff. All 4 characters are released now. They all play incredibly differently, have multiple weapons, and three separate skill trees. There are various upgradeable weapons and armors in the game. All of these things serve to modify the gameplay significantly. There are so many ways to build each character that before I knew it I had beaten the game about 10 times in a row. Different builds really do make the gameplay feel fresh, too.Combat is fantastic. It has such a tactile feel. The best way to put it is that it plays like a 2D Devil May Cry game. You can chain weapon attacks/magic/aerial strikes and create some insane comboes. THE BOSS FIGHTS. The boss fights are SO fun. With all the different character builds there are so many ways to approach the boss fights. I almost can't wrap my mind around how well balanced this game is, considering that. You do get graded for how well you do, but the game doesn't penalize you for doing ""poorly"". With a good build and a few hours of experience it becomes fairly easy to S-rank most of the game on Normal mode. The game is short, 3-5 hours if you really know what you're doing. Maybe 7-8 if it's your first time. This could be a flaw to some, but for me it's a great thing. It means I can keep playing and trying new builds, experimenting all the time. It feels like the perfect length.Really ended being one of the best games I've ever played, and I didn't expect it to. In fact, I played it a couple times last year and put it down. Now that the devs have basically updated the game to what seems like completion, I decided to play it again and next thing I know I've put down 100+ hours. Definitely worth your time and money if you like Metroidvanias, Action RPGs, and games where you tinker with builds.			"

												This is an awesome metroidvania style game with a heavy dose of combat. Each character has various weapons and combos available to them, and three trees of abilities to choose from. Tons of customization options here. It's not perfect, there are a couple things toward the end-game that bugged me. Without giving away any spoilers the last boss fight is either nearly impossible or fairly easy depending on what items you have equipped - so its a little imbalanced there. Overall, it's a very good game. I'd give it a 9/10 and if they make a sequel I'll definitely get it.			"

												Do you want to tell yourself ""Man, I really over came that challenge with skill and had a tonne of fun while doing it?"" Well don't play this game. 90% of the bosses scenarios and enemies feel like you are simply up against unfair borderline cheating. Did you dodge that super blade? Nope! Did you grab that wall? NOPE! did you enjoy yourself? NOPE! This is seriously on the edge of I wanna be the boshy, except the controls feel like they simply do not care what button you are pressing at key moments. if the game wants you to take a hit when you are hitting the dodge button YOU ARE going to take the hit. Does the game decide you can't wall just out of the poison? Well guess what it doesn't matter how many times you hit that button you aren't jumping out of the poison. Aditionally this should have come with a quick reset button.(Edit) It does come with a reset option HOWEVER you must1 go to the main menu2 hit retry3 make sure you have the gear you want to use, because if you change your gear mid fight, it doesn't remeber it.4 Dodge the obnoxious fast Boss risking losing an S ranking becuase you need to pause instantly to change stuff.All that aside you CAN have fun with it, however I do not suggest going in blind. look at strategies, look at how other people do, and then try it for yourself. ----------Summary------------If you like the ""I wanna be the -"" Games play it, you may enjoy it. If you like Punishing grueling teeth grinding games Play it! If you want a 2d version of darksouls Give it a whirl! But if you want a game that you can simply enjoy without developing a brain tumor, stay away. (side note) this game doesn't lead you anywhere, you can miss VERY important things by going straight to the objective. This is a great part of the game. Punishment is the key word here and I suggest you are ready to be punished like a masochist before playing this game.			"

												Valdis Story manages to combine a Metroidvania-like genre to an RPG but in my opinion, the game is too dependent on stats. Most of the time I felt the enemies were way too strong but after grinding for a while, it was the complete opposite. Gear also plays a big part but this is to be expected.Overall, if you're expecting a normal Metroidvania-like game, this game may not be for you. If you're looking for something more than just a good example of the genre, try it.			"

												Exellent game, probably one of the best metroidvania games I have played in years. Combat is fun and flowing, the map offers a lot to do in terms of exploration. With all the side objectives to flesh out game time a little this ends up being a really nice title to sit down and play through. The leveling/skill point system is done very well and each character has a multitude of different ways to play, offering a nice amount of replayibillity. The visuals and sprites are done very very well and everything looks and feels smooth. Only gripes I really have with the game is lack of a ng+ and a better tutorial should be in place. Overall this is a must have title for anyone who likes medroidvania games! Already hoping and really wanting a sequel!			"

												Valdis Story is a fun little Metriodvania game with solid combat. The challenge is a little harder than most games, but the game feel fair. (Note on the challenge: there were like two bosses that I thought were a little on the cheese side of the things, but besides those few instances, I enjoyed the balanced game play.) One other little complaint, the trading/currency system in the game is a little hard to keep up with. Every item cost a variety of other items in trade. It's hard to know what you need for what and if you're spending an item that you may need for another item. I would've preferred a single (or at least simplified currency system—gold, gil, whatever).   Plus+Great combat+Great exploration+Great art style+Great RPG mechanicsCons+Convoluted currency/trading+No world map +The story uses so many strange names I didn't know who from what from where. I'm almost done with the game and I just finally learned the three towns by name. I think less would be more, but if you like to dig into lore, then this may be a plus. Well worth the price of admission. "

												Wow, this game is great. I hate the term ""metroidvania"" but that's exactly the genre, and it's really done well here. You get a large area to explore, find upgrades that grant new powers to access new places, and face intimidating bosses. 4 characters give a layer of replayability as well as versatility, and each has skills and status points to upgrade each time they level up, offering numerous ways to play as each. Most importantly, the combat is fun and well paced, utilizing skill cancels, dashes, parrying, plenty of magic spells, and several weapons for each character. Also, the music is some of the best original video game music I've heard in awhile, probably since Symphony of the Night. Frankly, if you like SOTN, then buy this game.			"

The writing is pretty damn solid as well. Feels incredibly satisfying when you start to get the hang of the combat. Incredibly hype.Cons: Some weird controls that you may want to re-map. Namely the dash. Also when you take damage, there's no invincibility frames after, which means you can get absolutley ♥♥♥♥ED on if you're not careful. Also, the story is a little hard to follow.			"

Who would imagine that doing a Luck build will give you higher damage output than a Str build if played right? And dont let the game fools you when it says that Wyatt is a Str/Agi char. You can build him with Int build and see him rekt anything in this game within few seconds. Trying all kinds of builds for all characters in this game is really fun and you'll enjoy creating your own deadly build.			"

There is a great RPG element to combine with its amazing platforming.  You can beat the game without having to grind on any difficulty so long as you're good at dodging and blocking.

												This is a hard but fair game. I get ticked off a lot in this game and I only have like 4 hours in. But hot damn does it feel good to get that chest that's been just out of reach or kill that boss that took 5+ times. It makes me feel like Im playing a game and not riding the rails that so many games of today make you do. You will die in this game and you like it. You will want to get better and you will. I feel the heavy attack could be a bit faster but there is a skill you can get for that. It looks like there will be a lot of different playable syles in this game and I'm looking forward to playing a lot of them.The one thing I really really dislike is the skill cancel being useing  down and a spell needing to use that as well. I have gotten boned a lot over that. Maybe there is a way to just bind the cancel to something else.It looks just beautiful and the soundtrack is nice. The story is,well it's there.

												I enjoy old school platform games like this but there are some issue with this game that should be fixed. First off the controls are a little bugged as you will sometimes block and a monster will cut right through your shield. You'll have to watchout for the the quick spell menu they put in as it is crap. It opens with the block + magic button so it is difficult to use magic and block at the same time. The biggest problem I have is the diffculty of the bosses. Normally I expect some difficulty but the bosses seem to be atleast a level more difficult than the level playing. I am playing on normal and am lvl 20 and yet the bosses still give me a challange as if I was on atleast hard mode. Over all the game is playable and fun but there with these issues and a few others the game can become frustrating.			"

												This is a hard but fair game. I get ticked off a lot in this game and I only have like 4 hours in. But hot damn does it feel good to get that chest that's been just out of reach or kill that boss that took 5+ times. It makes me feel like Im playing a game and not riding the rails that so many games of today make you do. You will die in this game and you like it. You will want to get better and you will. I feel the heavy attack could be a bit faster but there is a skill you can get for that. It looks like there will be a lot of different playable syles in this game and I'm looking forward to playing a lot of them.The one thing I really really dislike is the skill cancel being useing  down and a spell needing to use that as well. I have gotten boned a lot over that. Maybe there is a way to just bind the cancel to something else.It looks just beautiful and the soundtrack is nice. The story is,well it's there. I picked this up during the Summer Sale and I can say that after playing it, it's worh more than what I paid!			"

												To say it simple, very nice gameand addictive, but too much hard to play. Art, Music, level design, Gameplay mechinics are all good.Selected the Normal mode(no easy mode is available) and able to play up to level7. After that boom too much harder bosses or locations.Recomeneded for: May be pro platformer gamersNot Recomneded for: others since it will get more hard and cant complete the gameI am interested play and finish the game if they upadated with a Easy mode. Anyhow uninstaling the game as of now..			"

												(06/10) - GoodHoly moly...I thought Dust could not be beaten for some time now, but this game...Well, it´s darn tough considering Normal is the easiest difficulty, going 4 times harder, it´s also a heck load of fun.Fast pased 2D? If that makes you a bit curious, you should really consider giving this a try!			"

												a pretty decent metroidvania with a story that barely matters and progression elements that are so lopsided as to be laughable, but not necessarily in a bad way.  Play it for the enjoyable and fun combat, for the frenetic pace you can take in many areas, and for it being nearly the perfect length (it is just a TOUCH too long)  Play it for the vibrant, colorful environments, for the challenge slowly builds through the game, and for the (mostly) rewarding bosses.  The soundtrack is also quite good			"

												Great game (SO FAR), a hidden gem indeed, highly recommended! For several times I wanted to give up on it due to it's difficulty, but I kept coming back, wondering ""how about trying it the other way"", and the other way always delivers lots of new fun. I picked up the game on Summer Sale at a very low price (yay~~~), if you're into 2D RPGs, make sure this title is on you wishlist, or just buy it!Also, the devs must have been updating the game alot  since it's release. I've stuck in several places, looked up the walkthrough videos on Youtube and discovered some levels had been changed, good work!I'll update this review when I finish the game :P			"

												Valdis Story manages to combine a Metroidvania-like genre to an RPG but in my opinion, the game is too dependent on stats. Most of the time I felt the enemies were way too strong but after grinding for a while, it was the complete opposite. Gear also plays a big part but this is to be expected.Overall, if you're expecting a normal Metroidvania-like game, this game may not be for you. If you're looking for something more than just a good example of the genre, try it.			"

OverviewValdis Story: Abyssal City is an Action Platformer / RPG with an engaging combat system which just feels right. The game takes place in the the sacred city of Sitheil, that sank under the waves when two goddesses do battle. The protagonists enter the city by coincidence, and it is their task to find the rest of their crew and get back to the surface.GraphicsHaving a large focus on combat, it is required that the graphics be clean and to-the-point. I found them to be charming and comprehensive, as almost every action has its own animation, like blocking and preparing magic, which lets you see attacks coming if you stay alert.MusicAll the battle themes sound epic, and as a result really ramps up the scene. Most of these themes consist of chanting, electric guitar, violin, and a myraid of others. The other soundtracks are pretty nice too (thumbs up for the Sewers Theme), though a couple in particular are a bit jarring (looking at you, Pit Theme).CombatThis is where Valdis Story really shines. Nearly every enemy has a distinct attack pattern or style, and battling them feels very fluent once you get the hang of it. There are two disaplines of combat in the game: physical, and magic attacks. The first is pretty simple and straightforward, but the second one really compliments the first, making them as a whole a varied experience. Keep in mind that you will likely be required to use both thoughout the game, but that there are two characters each - including a pair you have from the get-go - that specialize in physical or magic combat. There are even support characters that you can briefly call into battle and level up.VerdictValdis Story is a little gem of a game that, I feel, deserves to be better known.			"

												I really like this game except I ran into a problem when using a USB connected XBox controller. The character locks up in a block stance instantly until I unplug the controller. This is really annoying as the game lends itself so much more to controller based gameplay.*hoping for a patch*			"

												This is a great metroidvania.  Aspects of it feel like Dark Souls which is a huge plus..Story isn't so bad, combat feels pretty good although magic is kinda clumsy.Probably my biggest gripe would be the sound.  There's some sound effects in this game that sound very glitched out and jarring.  Don't know what that is all about.  Also... I don't know how I feel about the soundtrack.  There's a bit of beautiful piano and ambiance, but then there's tin sounding hard rock stuff during battles that also sounds not so great.All in all, I've really really enjoyed the game.  It's an awesome RPG action platformer with plenty of upgrades for the character.			"

												Definitely one of the best beat em up games ive played. Highly recommended to DMC players.After playing this game again, I still recommend this to anyone who enjoys metroidvania/beat em up games. The enemies takes longer to kill because the player themselves are stronger and have more abilities to use (Combos becomes extremely intricate). The puzzles are challenging, and takes practice. The developers trust the players to adapt to the speed they've set. I don't recommend this game for people who has a one track mind and don't want to adapt.			"

												This review is after beating the game on normal with the main character AND then beating the game on hard with everyone else... There are 2 further difficulties and then a few ""hard core"" modes (Boss arena mode... No save/retry mode).The game is worth a buy if you are into 2d fighter/brawler/beat-em-up style games.     The story isn't too in your face and can easily be skipped past if you just wanna stick to the game.     There are a slew of difficulties to make the game harder or easier (noobies can work their way up) and hard added in extra moves and worries durring boss fights... so it didn't just make them damage sponges with sharper claws.     The music is good enough for background music, but the majority of it isn't really super into it. You may want to crank your own tunes after your first playthrough.     The boss fights are white knuckle experiences. A few easier bosses do exsist, but you have a slew of odd ""masters"" of an area who will push you when you first see them to even beat them... The higher rank you beat them with, the more XP you get AND at high ranks you can get bonuses to stats...     Unfortunatly the platforming in a few places is just completly aggrivating. These areas hit about 60% of the way into the campaign and are only about 15-20% of the overall campaign (about 5% of the campaign is just nasty). Your character has a habit of doing their wall jump / grabbing ledges when you don't mean to. This is something you can get past... but it takes a deal of practice and a few specific areas are just nasty even after all of my play time on it.     The exploration is fair enough and the world is interconnected well enough you can run from one zone into another. They have some areas that are locked by keys and a few areas that are locked by spells / items that let you get around differently.     Playable characters have 3 alternate weapons each which alter their combat a good deal.Primary character - Fist fighter v Large sword v Bow n Dagger v Dual swordsSecond character - Fist fighter v Bo staff (Just more reach) v Fists & ward (passive bonuses for doing well) v Big♥♥♥♥♥maceThird character - Bulky fist fighter v Gun n shotty v Gun n rocket launcher v Gun n RifleFourth character - Fist fighter magic combo v semi-homing magic balls v sword ranged & magic v Ring thrower			"
