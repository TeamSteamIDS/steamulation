Should you pick this up. #3 reasons for 3 different types of peopleonline boardgame players-love to play your games but want a little bit more flexiblity as if you really were there, browser games of chess and other IPs are great but lack the player control to do what you want.Tabletop Roleplayers-whether it be D&D, GURPS, or some other rule system, these games are hard to put to put into the digital world and if so the software is generally only for you to watch and let the DM move everything, and you can actually build 3d dungeons ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bi5dkk6CIAAwhGt.png:large )Social players-its great to be able to chat over a game, specially when you really dont care about the outcome of the game, in normal games you are forced to make moves till the game is over, in this if you just want to sit with your coffee using the voice chat while you throw marbles and the rpg kit pieces you are free to while at the same time laughing at how bad of an aim you have.overall this is a great tool if you want to just play in a sandbox and do what you want, there is a single player mode that you can spawn anything in or take it to the online side for fun with friends, this actually bridges the gap for some of my friends some that like shooting games, some that dont but everyone can sit around a boardgame and have some fun.

What i found out was that you can play just about any game that can be played on a table, from The Game of Life to HeroQuest, just about anything you can think of. In addition, there are always pick up games and people on every day from all over the world. In short, this game has endless replay value. I can see myself playing on this more than any game I own.

												I created a board game for my wife on our one year anniversary. While I was developing the artwork for the game, I created a digital version of the game via Tabletop Simulator. I bought a 4 pack the last time it was on sale and gifted the others to friends to help me playtest it. I was able to playtest it with a private group of friends as I was designing the finished artwork, getting the cards printed, etc. Because of Tabletop Simulator, I was able to gift my wife a playtested, decently crafted board game, and it ended up being a lot of fun to play, all in two weeks time. Thank you to my friends who tested this with me, and thank you to Tabletop Simulator for helping me make this happen.			"

You don't even know how to play this one."" or ""You don't know the rules? Then get out of here, not going to teach you how to play this game in any kind of way.""

												A simple but innovative concept that delivers thanks to dedicated and continued effort and improvement, Tabletop Simulator is the first mainstream product to explore an unique class of customizable simulation in the field of board games. From a basic setup with a floating table and a background, it provides a physics engine capable of simulating intermediate to advanced tabletop dynamics - from solitaire card games to complex RPGs with hundreds of elements. With a lobby system, up to eight players can play virtually any board game imaginable (unless it involves needlessly complex physics or requires unsurmountable space) in multiplayer across the internet.GameplayTabletop Simulator thrives on one simple concept: To provide the tools necessary for people to be in control of whatever combination of objects that make up the game they want to play, in any way they so desire. The game has no ""AI"" in the traditional sense, in fact it has no rules or scripting at all. It is a large sandbox that allows you to spawn a table and a background as a foundation for a room, then populate it with you-name-it: Smaller boards for traditional games such as chess, a larger one for hour-long social games, a wide array of pieces, blocks, figurines, dice, markers, the list goes on and on. You can add custom objects easily: Custom 2D pictures can be directly incorporated as game objects on flat templates such as card backs and card holder cards, while more advanced designs allow you to incorporate any three-dimensional object you could possibly make.With later updates, you can now also add custom tables (limited) and backgrounds.Once the objects have been spawned into the world, you can interact with them in a variety of useful ways: For card games, an entire subsystem allowing decks to be shuffled, searched, dealt from and kept hidden in pre-placed player zones enables you to perform most standard actions with a breeze. All objects can be grabbed and moved, locked temporarily or permanently in place in any position on the ground or air, raised and lowered, flipped, rotated along every possible axis, thrown or flicked, joined together etc. A variety of miscellaneous actions help with clarification such as an arrow that each player can spawn at their cursor to make sure players are looking at the same thing, a ruler for measuring in-game distances at will, and so on. Hosts and promoted players can easily spawn, duplicate (by Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V none the less) and delete objects at will. And while the signature option to 'Flip The Table' is always present, it never takes longer than a simple Undo to return the entire room to its state a few seconds ago.Apart from simply interacting with objects, the world itself, as well as any individual object, can be manipulated in gravity, looks, material, opacity and other behaviour - to be experienced for yourself as the variables to be changed here are very limitless.The game world - that includes all progress - can be saved at any time, and a load will automatically restore everything just the way you left it. Aside from making long complicated games a breeze to pick up at a later time (hugely beneficial compared to many real-life board games) this is also the main (and only) way you can publish your creations at the Steam Workshop - you simply save everything you want in one file that is then published as a game mode - including all custom objects you include with it, in exactly the position you left every item, down to their names and physics settings.Every single object or collection of objects - custom or not - can be saved separately as well. These go to a player's custom 'Chest' inventory, which is account bound. If the player has host permissions, he can spawn any object saved here (in addition to all the objects included with the base game, obviously) to the shared world. By storing frequently-used objects in chests, you can spawn them in any world and make your own hilarious crossover modes, custom player figurines or whatever, only limited by your creativity. This is also a much faster way of accessing certain objects you need rather than having to open a new mode entirely, which both resets everything and usually takes some time to load.With a recent update, Tabletop Simulator now supports loading partial objects from gamemodes, and many experienced Workshop authors now store load-heavy objects (such as card decks) in the bags that are included with the base game so that they can be loaded on a per-use basis after the world itself has finished loading. Speaking of which, the game also provides a old-school (alarm) clock that beeps when you tap it (for time-keeping), recently an object-based Notepad for scattered variable-keeping (in addition to the external Notepad from Early Access), a simulated tablet(!) that can access webpages and e.g. provide you with custom music from YouTube or whatever.Developer Updates and Steam WorkshopI've moved this section to the comments since I apparently reached some character limit for reviews (WTF). Please read it there.StoryThere is no story. Period. It's a simulator and it does what a simulator should. Still a better story than Twilight many less serious simulators are awkwardly trying to tell.GraphicsThe base tables and backgrounds are assets that serve mostly as foundation, and are not especially aesthetically appealing. However, your focus should be on the board itself, on which every object is as lifelike as you make them. All items from the base game are perfectly modelled and the Workshop provides loads of custom additions, good and bad alike. The game does suffer from performance issues thanks to its very realistic handling of each individual object, but this is negligible in all but the largest scenarios.MediaThe objects have very smooth and lifelike sounds when connecting with each other or the board, reflecting their size, type and material which is of course also customizable to an extent.There is no music. You can incorporate some with the Tablet object if you so desire. They added a fancy opening cutscene when you start the game but it feels awkward.OverallTabletop Simulator is the overall go-to solution if you want to play any imaginable board game (with very few exceptions) with friends over the internet, in a perfect environment with full control over everything and several benefits compared to the real-life alternative. It is best suited for card games and traditional style turn-based board games, though it also supports lesser physics-based games quite well. You have to handle all the details yourself (just as you would in real life) as there is no script support. You'll have to pay for the simulator, but then you get to immerse yourself in a world of almost endless entertainment whenever you feel like it (and can convince some friends to join you).ProsConsUnlimited varietyPerformance stutteringExtreme customizationFixed table sizesExtensive object physics, card game supportNo AI or rule scripting supportDedicated developers, frequent updatesSome game types incompatibleInternet socialReal life anti-socialCreative communityGameplay: 9/10Story: N/AGraphics: 8/10Media: N/AOverall: 9/10			"

												I love board games. There, I’ve said it. Unfortunately, I got my hopes up a bit too high, because it is not what I was expecting at all.Frankly, I don’t know what I was actually expecting. It could have been an organizer for your roleplaying campaigns.  Or even a way to pretend being a guest on Wil Wheaton’s popular board game webseries on the Geek & Sundry YouTube channel for all I knew.  But regardless, it is a tool that allows you to play popular classic games in a total sandbox environment.For a lot of gamers, this might not sound immediately appealing. In order for a game to be a game, it has got to have rules. Otherwise, you won’t know who has won or lost, or even when to call another player a low-down dirty rotten cheater. Without rules, we descend into chaos. But this can be a good thing once in a while.When you start Tabletop Simulator, you are given the option of several types of virtual tables, as well as the boards and pieces of many classic games such as Chess, Checkers, Go, “Chinese” Checkers and Backgammon. There are also card games and other options like an RPG table (more on this one later). There is a quick little tutorial on how to pick up a piece, rotate it, pick up multiple pieces, or randomize things like dice and card decks. Once you have done these thing a few times it becomes like second nature.If you put a checker down on a checkerboard, or a stone on a Go board, the program will auto-correct it to the nearest square or intersection as appropriate. But that is as far as it goes to police anything you do. If you want to move your rook diagonally or put a checker on a red square, that is your prerogative. Go right ahead – Tabletop Simulator won’t stop you.You can play any of these games in single player mode, or you can connect to other players by finding them on Steam or hosting your own table.One interesting aspect of this program is its potential use as a role-playing game aid.  The table for this is rather large, and you can even upload your own background for the pieces to sit upon. Unfortunately, the animations of all the available monster miniatures might use up more resources than you might expect a board game simulator to need. Also, constructing the layout takes some practice and is time-consuming even then. Just to construct a couple 4-square by 4-square rooms and a connecting hallway took upwards of 30 minutes, which is about 30 times as long as it took me to do the same thing with pen-and-paper. But, if you want to spend the time and effort, you can make some decently visual dungeons.What truly sets Tabletop Simulator from any other board game program is, not only is it a complete sandbox when playing, you are free to add any pieces to any of them. Every scenario you load is like a developer’s kit for creating new games. If you want to put some marbles in a chess game, you can go right ahead. Most of the time this won’t lead to much more than a big mess, but you never know – you could invent the next “Double Cranko.”If you do invent something fun, you can upload it to Tabletop Simulator’s area of the Steam Workshop. While you’re there you can also see what other people have done with this program. There are component sets for popular eurogames like Carcassone and St. Petersburg. People have even invented new ones like Portal Chess and a Walking Dead trivia game. Be sure to check them out.There are a gazillion sites out there that will let you play chess or checkers according to the rules. Some might even be a decent opponent. But, if you are looking for a place to experiment with those games or maybe even make a few of your own, the you should give Tabletop Simulator a whirl.Recommended "

								Tabletop Simulator is ideal for all players who are even slightly interested in board games. With a focus on physics sandbox gameplay where you are free to abide by the rules or cheat, playing with friends feels fun and satisfying.The game is still in beta and I've encountered a few bugs while playing. However, the developpers are really close to the community and listen to feedback. The bugs are being fixed every update and while it's still far from a finished product, it is shaping up really fast.Pros:-Physics Sandbox. This is a must for sandbox games lovers.-Revives the old board games we love and allows you to play online with friends.-Table flipping. Who wouldn't dream of flipping a table after losing a game of chess?-Great platform for custom board games. While it doesn't support workshop content or 3d models yet, importing images allows you to create your own games or play games you love that weren't included with the purchase.-Great looking models and shaders.Cons:-Needs some polishing, currently has noticeable bugs and can be ressource heavy at times.-Does not include liscenced games (obviously, but unfortunate. Although, once again, custom content).-Not as fun without friends to play with. While you can play with strangers and still have a lot of fun (I get headaches from laughing too much playing games with strangers), not everyone will enjoy it as  much as playing with people they know. I would recommend grabbing the game with friends if you can.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is well worth the money. I picked it up on a recent sale for $10usd around early December 2014.If you like popular board and card games (or if you just like to spawn my little pony figures and throw them around in zero gravity for some reason), this is the best and practically only game to do it in.If you watch a video you'll see that it's basically a physics engine with some tools to help you play board/card games. Cards can stack, you can right click and deal out cards to players, you can shake cards or dice to randomize them, you can flip cards upside down with the f key, you can have a 'hand' where cards are hidden even when face up, and so on.It took me a day to learn some of the keys and the proper way to manipulate objects so I don't go smashing things around. And it took me a bit of time to learn administrative controls so I could take away the ability for players to flip the boards, or even join games without permission. Sometimes this is good. You can also press L to lock things down so they don't get moved and control if spectators can jump into your game and start throwing things around or if they have to wait for you to put them into the game. If you think that people will just join your game and wreck it -- that happens. But with the right privileges set it doesn't...and even if someone does there is an 'undo' button that works adequately. You can also save the state of the game (and there is an autosave feature) and reload it if things get messed up or if you have to leave or someone drops and you want to continue later. This also lets you set up a board game the way you like to start and then save the state so you don't have to keep doing that over and over. You can import parts of one game into another game and then save it together, too. If you join someone's game and they have a cool looking 3d model, you can save that to your chest and then pull it out anytime and anywhere you have the privileges to!In a recent patch, the developer of Tabletop worked on a NAT punchthrough method so you don't need to set up port forwarding to be able to host your games. This doesn't work for some people, and I still try to port forward so I don't have any problems.Lag can be an issue if you have a slowish connection. I've played with people from the US/Canada, various parts of Europe, and Australia. Players come from all over and some will naturally have bad pings. Even so, I regularly play with people who have a 300ms ping and it works fine.There is voice chat within games. It is set to push to talk by default so you don't have new players with open mics annoying you. There is a mute, kick and ban feature. The ban feature is especially nice since it remembers your ban list so that if you play the next day that person will still be banned. Recently, the ban list was improved so it doesn't get reset when you reset your settings. Griefing is remarkably low considering how easy it is to grief and typically it happens when the host doesn't care enough to stop it.It really comes down to finding some people who will play the games you want -- much like with real board or card games. As far as the game selection goes -- I'm pretty sure this whole thing is illegal but there are many top board games (see boardgamegeek.com) that have cards, boards, tokens and dice models copied into the game. Check out the Steam workshop for this game to see the options. I heard a rumor that the developer of the game Munchkin (I'm not a fan) sent a cease and desist order to Steam and all the munchkin mods were removed. I would expect more of that in the future. That being said, it is not very difficult to create your own card decks, boards, pieces etc or find ones other people have made and then save private copies yourself. The games on the workshop are actually playable and gameplay is not as frustrating as it may seem.  In fact, since it's basically just a physics engine, it is rather intuitive to use. I've tried board game simulator programs before and they had about 500 context menus you had to go through to do anything and they were impossible to use. With this, you may not know the most optimal way of doing things -- but you can easily figure out SOME way to do it.You could even play MTG in this. There's Android Netrunner, too. Plus a whole bunch of great board games. I played some simpler ones...like King of Tokyo, Cosmic Encounters, Dominion, Forbidden Island and one complex one - Eldritch Horror (which just takes a long time) and they all worked great. I also had a good game of 5 player chess which started off chaotic and very exciting and turned into a game of turtling -- so I created a sudden death player to finish up the game (a new player on the board to replace a dead one starting with 16 queens). Really, you can do just about anything. You can play D&D through here, you can play all the classics - poker, black jack, monopoly, clue, candy land...tons of games are here and I would imagine more are on their way. If you like board or card games at all...or want to try some of the most popular board/card games on the market today...you really should pick up this game. There is literally nothing that can compete with it.BIGGEST CONS:I ran into some bugs that are worth noting.1. On my first day, I would be playing with a bunch of people and then everyone would lose connection. This did not happen on my second day. Something may have been going on with their master server. 2. Somehow, at one point in the middle of a long game, I suddenly couldn't push to talk anymore. When I restarted the program it worked again -- I'm not entirely sure what happened there. I was host so I don't think anyone could have muted me (but I admit I didn't check).3. Once or twice after playing for a while the game won't let me load new tables until I restart the game.4. About a week into playing I hit a bad bug where I wasn't able to end turns, search, change settings, or even exit the game (without clicking the X and crashing the window). I'm not entirely sure why that started to happen. I have to restart the game to get it to work. I can still play games and chat while the bug is in effect, but this is definitely not bug free.Check out the list of board games and card games on the steam workshop for this game. If that doesn't excite you then don't buy this game. And if it does, know that I've tested a bunch of them and they are playable and not just piles of garbage. There are some difficult things that you sometimes have to work around...but if you learn the UI they are easy. A lot of problems people have are rolling dice properly without smashing into things or shuffling and stacking cards quickly or even drawing and moving cards around without accidentally revealing them. All of these things can be done very efficiently but it takes a little bit of learning to understand how the engine works and until you do you'll probably find yourself knocking things over by accident...but everything is pretty easy to fix. And it's kind of fun.tldr: 10/10 - no regrets buying this for $10. Would pay full price. You better like card/board games.			"

WARNING: If you are thinking of buying this make sure you understand THIS IS NOT A GAME, it is a tool for playing board games. I have seen some people in discussions who are frustrated because they didn't know what they were buying.So What Is It?: TTS is a platform for playing board games. There are no AI or rules coded into the game, just like a real table and board game you can pick up your playing pieces and do whatever you want with them. If you pick up your chess pawn and move it all the way across the board in one move, or try to balance it on top of another piece, or throw it off the table, the game won't care (the other player might). The Games: It comes included with some classic games such as chess, checkers, backgammon, jigsaw (add your own picture, pick no. of pieces etc) but the main meat of the game is the workshop. It's reasonably easy to add your own custom cards or dice, tokens and boards, and if you can do 3d modelling you can make more complicated  things too. The result is that there are thousands of mods on the workshop to download, some of them are there with the blessing of or created by the creator of the board game version (there are also a handful of paid DLC games), a few may be prototypes being tested by games designers before they consider making physical versions or homebrewed games created just for TTS, some are not everything you need for a game but may be additional pieces to use in another board game  or for  use in RPGs (like D&D). The vast majority though are versions of physical boardgames, and these are something of a grey area, legally, as the copyright holders have generally not given permission for them to be uploaded. Some may not know about TTS or may find it easier to turn a blind eye, a few have allowed their products in the hopes that the mods may drive sales of the physical games, and some, like Munchkin, seem to be regularly taken down only to be uploaded again by someone else.Opponents: There are a number of gameplay options, single player is used for solitaire games, setting up tables before taking the save multiplayer or uploading as a workshop mod. Or just loading up a multiplayer game and loading all the pieces yourself if you want,whatever floats your boat. Multiplayer has options to host a server, browse current servers, direct connection or hotseat (its better to use the proper hotseat mode than single player for hot seat games as you can then each have your own hands of cards, turn counter etc). There is also a global IRC channel which is (optionally) shown in game as well as text and voice communication. Generally public games are pretty good, there are a few trolls but the mods are good at banning them from global and the host of a game can kick them from games easily if needed. You can of course password protect your game so only those you want to join can. How easy it is to find a public game of what you want to play really depends on what game it is. There seem to always be games of secret hitler for example but if you want a game of Heroquest you might have to offer to teach people in the global channel or arrange a meet up through forums or steam friends.Overall: I really recommend TTS as long as you realise what you are buying is a an extremely flexible sandbox playing environment not a traditional computer game.

												This is easily the most recommendable game in my library at the moment. Obviously if you aren't interested in tabletop games or are of the ""I rather play with real life friend's"" crowd it may not be for you, but otherwise there is no reason not to be eyeballing this game.As a simulator it's quite robust. I've found a few small issues here and there but these are minor and don't really make themselves felt until you've played for a considerable amount of time (50+ hours). So far though there hasn't been a game I've tried to play in Tabletop Simulator that I was unable to play due to limitations of the simulator, and although there are a few games I can think of that would be harder to play in this simulator, the vast majority of games play just fine.That being said, the workshop content of this game is what makes it so recommendable. The basic package comes with classic games like Chess and Checkers, but if you delve into the workshop you'll find tons of great games available at the click of a button. Some copyrighted favorites are regularly taken down due to DMCA strikes, but plenty are not (and plenty of Kickstarter backed games allow their games to be uploaded). Take a gander over to the workshop page for this game and search/browse before buying it, I'm sure you'll find more than a few games you like there.Lastly, this game is great with friends, whether they are friends you know in real life or oversea buddies. Grab a mic and a few friends and start working through that workshop content, if you're able to do this I guarantee you'll be happy with your purchase. If that's not possible, I've made my way into a few public games and have had a pretty okay experience there. Many pubs tend to have mics and usually one person is willing to explain to everyone the rules of the current game. I've had my occasional issue with the griefer who comes in and messes with everything but for the most part it's been pretty good. Plenty of tabletop games have solitaire modes as well, so even if playing with friends isn't an option all the time, you can always try your hand with solo play.I started playing Tabletop Simulator and I almost never played tabletop games, now a half year later since buying it I have 250 non-idle hours into this game and I've tried close to 50 different games out and have had a blast playing them all. It's even helped me find a few games that I'd definitely like to buy in person for when I do get the chance to play with real life friends. Get this game. It's worth it.			"

												I had 20h of fun with this game until something fatal happend. I somehow managed to set the games reolution to 1920x0! I don't even know how I did it, but now I was stuck with a game starting up in black screen so I turned to the support. I dotn't think anyone has ever been as clumsy as I when I changed the resolution to 1920x0 (which I didn't know was the problem at the time btw). So we tried everything from reinstalling the game and the drivers to changing the launch options but none of that worked. But support did not give up. They tried to help me for about 3 months before I got the great Idea to start up the game in VR mode. I managed to change back the resolution to normal (without VR gear) and now everything works again!If it were not for the support of Berserk Games I would have given up hope long ago. But knowing someone out there still belived in me and gave me genuilnly good advice even after 3 months gave me the energy I needed to pull through.Best support experience I have ever had!			"

Buy it if board/card games interest you.It's almost hard to believe that this game is legal, what with the fact that you can get almost any board/card game you can imagine for free on the Steam Workshop. I live in Korea and my family is in the United States. Playing board games with my mom just like when I was back home adds a sense of togetherness that we normally can't have. Sometimes I miss my home, but this game helps me cope with it.Why not 10/10? It lacks a bit of polish and is probably not quite as optimized as it could be. Still, great game. Pick it up.			"

												As is, it is well worth the asking price if you have friends willing to join with you. If you are someone that loves the generic chess, checkers, backgammon, chinese checkers, etc. or if you absolutely love card games such as poker, solitare, or even go fish, this title delivers impressively. It is NOT a single player game, but you could (as mentioned) play solitare with the cards given to you. The game doesn't hold your hand. It gives you some luxory controls, but it otherwise wont tell you what you can and cannot do. As the video preview shows off, this garuntees chaos if you allow it to happen. This is more of a good thing (I think) than a bad thing, but it does cause somewhat frustrating experiences in the online play. Because it doesn't hold your hand, people might unintentially break the rules in various games or make some up of their own. This is a good thing for people in various cultures with different rules, not to mention those that want to play house rules (such as not having to jump in checkers, something you technically don't have to do if you are okay removing the piece, but programs force you to typically anyways). This is bad because complete anarchy is expected, it really is a simulator and, like real life, some disagreements are expected. Overall, I'd say it's a good thing despite the consequences; I believe you could say it's a double edge sword.In my opinion, this game's strongest advantage over anything else on Steam that demands much more money for such less content, such as any mediocre chess game on Steam, is the freedom this game gives you. Not just the ability to do virtually anything within reason like the first paragraph poked at a bit, but the ability to create custom games and downloading other's custom games. This, of course, inevitably means about 90% of the time COPYRIGHTED content. This is a huge blow over the board game and card game industry and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. Just like the whole ""people don't want to buy music on the internet"" and then the same morons began wondering why music piracy began to rise, you can expect this tabletop simulator to have a significant role for a similar outcome in regards to board games and card games. We asked for a good *insert trading card game* simulator and we got ignored, maybe humored with half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥games instead, but now we have an alternative. Some copyright claims have been made, particularly Munchkin, this was to be expected but some are yet the wiser and either ignore this game or don't even realize it exists like (it seems) a good part of the gaming community... particularly the people willing to pay $50 for a chess simulator. Regardless, I wont ramble on about that nonsense that doesn't matter to us, the consumers (at least not until our ""freedoms"" start get taken away by lawyers that are smarter, yat greedier, than their own good). No, I will discuss further how custom work *kinda* works, as someone who puts in a heavy load of *cough*copyrighted material*cough*. It is very easy! For cards, you just make a huge picture and put all the cards on it, up to 69 specifically at the moment, and the game cuts it up into pieces. The downside? The quality will be♥♥♥♥♥♥unless it is a very big picture. To make matters worse, the game currently requires you to upload said giant image to a random website for everyone to download it from. This is bad, because there isn't exactly a variety of file hosts to use that would allow such a huge file. I currently use dropbox, but it gave me problems recently that I will forgive because I have nobody else to go through, but I will never forget. With that said, it would be nice if Tabletop Simulator uses an alernative last resort file sharing method, have it between the players.Why wouldn't the game do this from the start? Well, there is the possibility of saving file types with specific names and the game will, for now on, load that specific file instead of the original. If you had it so the game will send the files the players have, this could result in exploits that involve offensive or otherwise illegal materials most of us don't want to see. So, I agree not to have this as a primary form of getting files, but it would be nice to be able to download from the host or whoever upload the item and maybe keep track of the steam id that gave that specific file to you, that way reporting is an option. Hopefully the TTS devs will consider this as a solution to the problem, assuming this problem was the reason they avoided the option of peer to peer file transfer. The game offers so much, but like any early access games, bugs are expected. They fixed quite a few recently, but some still exist. Despite all of them, the game is well worth it. However, I cannot stress it enough that you plan to do this with friends, for randoms only play a handful of games.tl;dr:Pros:Freedom. For something that is just on a single table, it feels as big as a sanbox (I'm exaggerating, but for what's worth, you have building blocks, something you'd see sometimes in a real life sandbox)Variety. You get a lot for what you paid for. Try to look up chess games on Steam. Customization. You can make your own games or copy and paste something else... probably copyrighted most likely. Because of this, you can play virtually anything you dreamed of having in your childhood for the price that is TTS.Online. You can play board games with loved ones from far away, or with near by friends that don't want to spend hundreds on trading cards or RPG materials.There is some anti griefing options in place, but maybe we could use more.Cons:There isn't a whole lot of people in the community, a lot of them are griefers. Players currently cannot just pull card decks out of workshop items without loading it, something that is addressed for other items. Lack of file transfering between players with custom items. Of course, this is probably to prevent porn to be traded around rather than monopoly board images by ""mistake,"" but this is something the devs should look into. Overall, this game is splended. We have building blocks, but could someone for the love of god add in some plastic army men? This isn't the kinda game you wait for a sale for, this is the kinda game you buy with only one regret: not buying it sooner. 9/10 seems fair, but it will be different for everyone. I ♥♥♥♥ing love Monopoly, Yugioh, Coupe, Tsuro, Chess, Poker, etc. so I make the most of this game. For those that are not so into all of that, maybe you wont make the most of it like I do. Regardless, buy it. Seriously... buy it.Edit:Players, including non hosts, can now upload their trading card decks. Initially, only hosts were able to lost from saved chest items but that is no longer the case. Because of this update, I removed this from the cons list.It has come to my attention that someone made software on the forums that indeeds allows hosts to send card deck files to others from their own computer. Clearly the game is capable, but I do not personally know the details behind this. I just wish to point it out that it's possible, but I still will leave it under cons due to it being unoffical software and the game doesn't seem to even hint the possibility as well, again, I don't know the details in how it works.It is worth noting that there is now a tutorial added to the game. It, however, does not teach you absolutely everything players may want to know in the game. Things I recall not being taught includes locking and unlocking items, the L key, changing object sizes with the -/+ keys, or how to navigate the menus which might be a confusing part of the game to newer players. I mention this in regards to my initial comment that this game doesn't hold your hand. Still doesn't, but better.Hosts can now customize server settings fluently, so removed from cons.			"

												Tabletop Simulator is exactly what it sounds like. Through the power of Steam Workshop as well as a lot of well-done built-in assets, you can essentially make any tabletop experience you so desire. Want to make your own card game? Go for it! Want to create your own intricate RPG of some description? You can do that with animated monster figurines! The possibilities are literally infinite.The hosting capabilities of TTS are also really well done. You can kick and/or ban people from your server easily, and you can restrict certain things from being possible within your server. Anyone you've banned is sent to a personal blacklist for any servers you host in the future. If you host anything related to the Steam Workshop, anyone who joins will automatically download the necessary files without having to be subscribed to that particular mod at all. It's one of the most robust systems I've seen.Even the game's DLC, thankfully, follows that last rule. Originally, Tabletop Simulator had a weird hybrid system of everyone owning DLC or just the host or whatever. It was convoluted, and it's been changed to a much simpler system that works like the Steam Workshop. Only the host needs to own the DLC. It makes everything so easy!The only gripe I have is that mod files do take a long time to load, but obviously this depends on the size of the mod and where the images are being hosted. It's really apparent on larger mods, though. But every release has seen improvements to the game's performance, and mod loading has gotten smoother and smoother, so this isn't as much of an issue as when I first wrote this review.Prior to originally writing this, for the record, I had spent two hours in a heated Uno game with 7 random people I had never met before, and all of us were having immense fun. Never in my entire life had I thought that would be possible.If you like playing tabletop games of any kind, you owe it to yourself to purchase this and get your friends in as well. It's a hell of a fun time.			"

								This review is specifically aimed towards anyone looking to play D&D with tabletop simulator. I will also compare it to Roll20.net, a web based system for playing tabletop games. EASY OF USE/HOW INTUITIVE IS THE SYSTEM?Roll20 - If you have a general knowledge of how to control most interfaces related to games, you will likely be able to accomplish just about anything after watching a brief (15 minutes or less) YouTube video about the interface.T.S. - You will choose certain options when you may have wanted something else (Choosing ""Game"" instead of ""Table""), but you will shake off the habit pretty quickly. I did not require a tutorial in anyway to use the system and just dove right in.FEATURESI will say the only feature Roll20 has that you would want in TS is Fog of War, the ability to hide areas and tiles on the table from players. With TS, I have to keep the items off the board until I am ready to play them as to leave some element of surprise for my players.COSTRoll20 choose not to compete in this area. Where TS has the steam workshop with countless tables and models at no cost, Roll20 will charge you$5 - $9 for a 20-40 item set that not only typically looks poorly done, but you also won't like more than 2 models (https://marketplace.roll20.net/). Tabletop Simulator is still in early access and offers a huge catalogue of fantastic, and free downloads.CONCLUSIONAre you worried about leaving Roll20? Are you worried about bringing your campaign online? Don't be. I'd go as far as to suggest you buy a 4-Pack, give them to your friends, and start rolling. I had my first game of Pathfinder a few nights ago and really enjoyed the experience. "

Early Access Review
								Before Tabletop Simulator 2014 came out, I was stuck playing tabletop games with my friends in real life. It was impossible to play any games with them because they repeatedly threw hundreds of RPG figures on the table, pulled cards out of my hand, changed my table to contain pornographic images, changed of all the Chinese Checkers pieces to be the same color, and conducted other shenanigans.Now that I have this game, I no longer have to worry about these problems and can play civil, respectful games with my friends!

Product received for free
												dont let the name fool you. despite the ongoing trend of intentionally faulty ""simulation"" games, this one is true to its name.when you buy this game, you own one of the most substantial simulators on the steam store. if you enjoy casual board games, or simply want to goof around without leaving behind an actual mess, this is the game to get.one of the most shining features of this game has to be the workshop. this game, by default, comes with most of your standard non-copyrighted games. however, with the help of the steam workshop, you can easily fill up your library with all of your favorite childhood games. from magic: the gathering to chutes and ladders, tabletop simulator has it all.my advice is to play the game with friends, or people you trust. consider yourself warned that your 2 hour monopoly game can easily go airborne by the simple click of a button. oftentimes, the ""table flip"" feature can mark a fun way to conclude a fair game of chess. it can also easily be abused by a more deceitful individual. luckily, you can edit the settings of the current server to make it essentially grief-proof, provided you are the owner of the current server.all in all, this game provides endless hours of entertainment. whether your intention is to construct a sandbox of your favorite game characters and send them clattering into a dark abyss, or play a jigsaw game with the face of your pet cat, you cant go wrong with tabletop simulator.

												This is by far the best Board Game / Card Game simulator by far and I highly recommend if you love Board Games or Card GamesI know I don't have many hours on this Game but I've been here from the start.There's no rules to this Game, just play however you want to play. Invite a friend to play Chess or a couple of friends for a night of poker or solve some jigsaw puzzle from an random image you found online. FLIP the table if you lost a game or you're mad. Play a game underwater (HDRI Panorama Images you can use). Draw all over the table or just whatever you like.There's tools you can use ingame that are useful like: Tablet: It's a ingame browser to search around the Internet or Youtube and play videos. And if someone goes to a website/video, It auto ask you if you want to open that link so if someone went to a ""( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"" site, you wouldn't have to deal with itMP3 Player: It's a music player that you can play all kinds music that the Game comes with.Calculator A Calculatorand other objects. (I just dont want to make this review too long)There's also servers you can join if you don't have any friends or if you want to play with some randoms. You can also host one yourself with a Game (any game + workshop).The game already includes stuff like Chess, Checkers, Poker, Backgammon and alot of other things. (There's also alot of DLC but to buy all of them it does cost you some money with the amount of DLC and DLC releasing to this day.) but then theres Workshop support!Workshop support is awesome. We're talking about thousands of things you can get like: Monopoly, Uno, Random Models or whatever you can find on the workshop, or just make your own stuff from a modeling program. (there's also sites you can get things from). You can of course make your own Board/Card Games or Random Models if you like.I hope this review was kinda helpful. :D			"

												I highly recommend this game due to 3 main things. 1. Great simulator, embracing all things that should be played on a table. Having Steam Workshop incorporated in this game, gives everyone a chance to make anything they imagine into a table top game. 2. Fantastic multiplayer, allowing up to 8 players to enjoy some fun games, from anywhere in the world!3. Lots of support from the Dev Team, who is always updating the game or informing us of new things to come. They are a stand out amongst many game companies out there. Hopefully they keep it up!So if you enjoy a virtual world, where any game can be your destiny, then grab this and have a great time! Cheers!Frost's Rating: 5 out of 5 Beers			"

												First of all: don't get fooled by the pictures and videos on the store page!Play board games and card games (not chess or domino as suggested by said videos) with your friends as much as you want and whichever game you want (nearly everything you can wish for, check the workshop!).There is no excuse such as distance anymore.Clear advantage of TTS over real-life board games: You don't have to tidy up the table after you've finished a game.Just reset and start all over again or load the next game.Played more than 70 hours already until now and (hopefully) more to follow.EDIT: Definitely my all-time favorite game in Steam.You HAVE to get this, if you like boardgames (and i assume you do, because you read this).

												VR review.AMAZING.  I had purchased TTS some time ago on a holiday sale for me and a friend.  One particular game became rather laborious to play on a 2D screen as it involved moving miniatures around a board.  But today I noticed TTS sitting in my VR list and I didn't recall that being there yesterday.  So, I checked the news and had to see...I now love it.  Card games, table top games, all in full 3D.  Now I can walk around the table and move my pieces so easily, so naturally. Sadly, I am not buying my friend a VIVE.			"

								This simulator has so much potential, that a single review on steam could not even scathe the surface of depth that it contains within it's walls of creativity and customization.  Do you enjoy the luxury of having every single board game, card game, dice game, and pen and paper game laid before you in an easy to use, ever growing plethora of a database? Do you ever find yourself in a dire situation in which you can not contain the hatred and fury of the rage inside of you which burns like the flames of one thousand suns and lays waste to all who oppose you in such a mood?  Then this game is right up your ally!  At any given time, you can flip the table and watch your game pieces fall into the void of nothingness with the physics unmatched by any ""game"" sold commercially or otherwise.  You will be left in awe when you come to the sudden realization that the game that lies before you could change the way you look at video games, and life in general, forever. Did I mention the deep and vast multiplayer expierence?  Duuuude... it's like, soooo deep. 8 players. Yeah... it's like that. The host also has the ability to lock items or the table itself to prevent those less capable of abstract thought to flip the table in the middle of your session. I think it should be manditory for this game to be in everyone's collection. Just like Obamacare.			"

								Have you ever bought a board or card game, only to never have the requisite number of players around at the same time? I know I have. What an awesome thing it would be if I could take that game and play it over the internet with my friends, without having to schedule it with everyone a month ahead of time. Enter Tabletop Simulator by Berserk Games. It’s not the first piece of software that has sought to fill this niche, but it is my favorite by far.Here’s the deal – Tabletop Simulator isn’t a game in and of itself. As the name implies, it simply simulates a tabletop. That is, the board, pieces, dice, cards, etc. are all physics objects in an engine designed to be manipulated in the same manner you would if you were playing a game on your living room table. There are no mechanisms in place for rule enforcement. If you want to cheat, and the other players don’t stop you, the game will happily let you. The game comes with the objects you need to play several classic games like chess, checkers, marbles, pachisi, backgammon, and many others. There are dice and figurines suitable for various pen and paper role playing games. Standard decks of cards for any number of games. Blocks for building sets. And much more.But the biggest draw of all is the game’s modding potential and the community around it. There are already hundreds of games people have modded in. Everything from Risk and Clue, to Galaxy Truckers and Munchkin. The quality of the mods varies somewhat, but there is no shortage of great mods to choose from. This of course begs the question of the legality of these mods. Since it’s all user generated content, the developers are free of culpability. The creators of a few mods have been hit with DMCA takedown notices, but this seems to be a rare occurrence. Some game makers encourage the mods, or even create them themselves. Most seem to be content to simply ignore them, and it makes sense why. These games are meant to by played in person, and are difficult or impossible to play online. The mods, on the other hand, are played exclusively online, so there is no overlap. If anything, the additional exposure has probably garnered additional sales.Tabletop Simulator is an Early Access title, but it already feels very polished, though not perfectly so. In the 32 hours I’ve played it, I’ve experienced two crashes. Many people have had issues with getting network connectivity to work, including myself. I finally solved my problems by setting a static outbound NAT for the game, but many consumer routers don’t allow that level of manipulation.  In my opinion, the technical difficulties have not made me regret the purchase in the least.All in all, Tabletop Simulator is a fantastic program, and I’m excited to see where the developers take it in the future.

												God this is amazing. Even if the app started sort of like a joke it has and still is steadily evolving into a serious platform for all your boardgame needs. There's still some clumsy things like handling multiple objects at a time, you will definitely need to skim the documentation to learn some control stuff  (doubly so if you want to get into the really advanced things) but with a solid foundation and the hard work of hundreds of modders there is no better way to have an incredible collection of boardgames right there in one place.True, at the moment each mod is incredibly vulnerable to being abandoned and lose assets as their web hosting fails but with any luck you will still find (or be able to make, even) versions of whatever game you might want to play. There's very little automation so rule keeping still falls square onto the player's hands in the vast majority of cases, for better or worse. Legality of each mod is a complicated thing, the community is not enormous so it can be a bit complicated finding new players for the more obscure games... but still, even with all the blemishes and all the fact is that there's nothing quite like Tabletop Sim out there.At least not yet.

												TL;DR (Pros and Cons at the bottom) : Buy. This. Game. Now.Long story:*Cue '80s commercial music*Have you ever looked on the internet or walked into a shop and noticed this board game that looks like it could be so much fun but it costs quite a bit, and then you'd need the expansions or the countless expensive models (looking at you, Warhammer) to fully enjoy the experience and you just said ""Frakk it!""? I know I have. Been wanting to play a frakkton of board games but their prices start at around 40$ and you're not sure if you'd ever play them? Yes sir! Tired of setting up your board game and having to clean it all up afterwards? What a chore! Got sick of the lucky player who keeps winning by pure chance and wanted to flip the table in his frakking face? Ooooh yeaaaaah! Well, I have some good news and some even BETTER news! For just 19.99$ YOU can access almost any board game and card game in existence and play it from the comfort of your own home with anyone in the whole wide world! Does it sound too good to be true? I guarantee you, it is true! This game promises to be revolutionary and can make your whole nerdy life a hell of a lot easier. Dungeons and Dragons? CHECK! Catan and all expansions? CHECK! Cards Against Humanity? CHECK! Warhammer with almost all miniatures ever made? FRAKKING CHECK! Order your copy now for only 19.99$!NOTE: Friends not included and may not be purchased separately as DLC.*Cut '80s commercial music*To start off, I NEVER review games, even though I own around 750 (My only other review is Dota 2 from 5 years ago just for the badge), cause I'm just some random dude on the internet, why should you listen to me? But this time, I desperately feel the need to do a review for this game. Why? Well, to put it plainly, cause it's just that frakking good! This game really is briliant and, for what it's priced, it can deliver literally countless hours of gameplay and can stand the test of time. The premise is simple. It's basically a platform for your typical board games. While it does come with a few basic games included, like Chess, Poker or Jigsaw Puzzles, the REAL fun is in the workshop. As of right now, there's around 14.000 items on the workshop. Not all of them are games, though, some are models or tables that you can use to set up your own game, but most of them ARE games.So think about it, 20$ and you can play almost every single board game/card game ever invented. It's highly recommended to get a friend or two to buy this game, that' s where the most fun is, but public games can also be a positive and fun experience. Most of the games and models on the workshop are imported/scanned from the real deal, which means that models, cards, boards and tables are not placeholders or some other crap, they're genuine and high quality. I've come across games that I had no idea even existed and are insanely fun or games that would physically cost triple what this game does. It's all FREE on the workshop!This game is just amazing! For real, in our days of Early Access and unfinished games for 60$, this gem of a game is only 20$ and can offer more fun and replayability than almost any other game ever.Pros:- Extremely cheap for what it offers- Highly detailed models/boards/textures and well done physics- Workshop is amazing, with almost 14k mods!- Game is well optimized and can smoothly run on even the crappiest PC/laptop- Constant updates- You can flip the frakkin table- Tons of awesome tools- It's got a tablet connected to the internet, on the table, you can browse anything while playing, no alt-tab required!- Don't want to buy DLC but want to play it? No problem! Only THE HOST needs the DLC. How frakkin cool is that?- Don't like any game? Make your own!Cons:- Public games can sometimes have ragers/trolls- Community is relatively small (can also be a good thing, with only the dedicated and serious people sticking around)- DLC might be considered a tad expensive by some, but it's not exaggerated and the way it works (only the host needs it) is pretty amazing. Having said that, would recommend buying at least a few DLCs, if only to support the creators of the game- Not really a con per se but it's best played with friends and preferrably over voice. If you've got both, this is a MUST BUY! If not, I still highly recommend it, you can make some friends easily who can help and play with you!			"

												This is one of the absolute best purchases I've ever made on Steam - its basically an infinite collection of board games. See a game you haven't played in forever? Play it. Want to know if that boardgame you want to buy is any good? Try it. Have an urge to have a lazy conversation with your gf/wife but want to do something while you talk? Load up a random game and try it out. Feeling down? Join a server and proceed to have shenangins with people. The only criticism I have for this game isn't even because of the game itself (the developers are fantastic and are (as I type this) updating the features of the simulator. Its the community. Some people enter lobbies and ruin games. Not with all that much frequency, mind you, but enough so that most people now lock their servers. A handful of open (and legitimate) servers are still around, but its like 5% - 10% of the servers listed. So if your planning on playing without a real life friend or two..... I'd still say get the game (seriously its fantastic), but don't expect to play anything but popular card games.UPDATE AS OF 6/24/16 --Game is in excellent shape, workshop is alive and kicking, and the content in the game is very nicely set. Honestly, its a complete masterpiece as a game.On a different note, I'd like to take a minute to talk about the community. Tabletop has probably one of the best communities for what it is: the game attracts essentially only people who enjoy board games. So your playing a game about playing any board game you desire, with a bunch of people who love board games. Its great, like 80% of the time. 20% of the time you'll be stuck waiting (for people to join games), or playing games your not super into, or getting trolls (who are easy to ban). The server issue still exists, about 80% to 90% of servers are locked and at any give time your looking at 15 to around 30ish open lobbies. I personally think those are decently acceptable statistics. And tabletop is a great place to make friends - I've added at least 30 people in the last 3 months alone from this game. These are people I spent a MINIMUM of 2 hours laughing, chatting and playing with over a game of Risk, Battlestar, Monopoly, or any of over 200 games I've personally subscribed to. The game is honestly a great way to get out there and hang out with people you'd otherwise never meet. TL;DR - A Steam Must-buy, especially if you have real life friends who also have the game. 10/10 Monopoly Boards.			"

												This game makes me question humanity, for the good. I'm not meming nor am I joking. The more I play this game the more I think, wow humans can still sit down, play a game of uno for hours on end? REALLY?Since the information era, you've been brainwashed to think it was impossible, but it is. 10 adults, who know nothing about each other, playing a game of uno, it makes you realize how amazing this world is. Even in a game, a game where these people can be playing the ""Shoot"" games, or out going to a bar and getting slamed (in both senses of the word bar goes in hand and hand with). They play Uno, with a bunch of strangers from around the world.I love this game.			"

												Linux users: DO NOT BUYA big part of this game is being able to download assets from arbitrary web servers. The https client included in the Linux version of TTS isn't able to connect to a modern TLS 1.2 web server. It seems the https client is only able to download assets from https servers running SSLv3. SSLv3 has been deprecated since the October 14, 2014[security.googleblog.com], so the Linux version of this game has been broken for over two years at this point. Many of the most popular game assets are stored on https-only web servers which makes it impossible to play many of the games available in the online multiplayer lobby without manually downloading the assets outside of TTS. So far the devs seem to be blaming upstream game engine issues which isn't really acceptable for something as simple as scripting https requests.			"

												EDIT: I still recommend this game, but nice players are far and few between.  I'm mute IRL and I can't speak because of that, so it's pretty saddening to have people use voice chat to confused others about what actions I did and then laughing when you ask them to stop. :/  Pretty much every game with an element of deception (which is nearly every tabletop game ever) is unplayable for me because of this.  The only upside is nearly no game has rules for if someone wants to quit playing in the middle of the game, so when people do that to me, I just leave and ♥♥♥♥ it up for everyone.  So, I think the only way to describe this game is to explain what happened in my first three hours.Bought the game, started it up, played through the tutorial.  I then went to tools and started playing with that, to learn how the tools work.  One is literally a shared web browser.  If you don't realize how powerful that is, then you've got problems.After learning a bit of the tools and such, I then went through the browser to find a server to watch.  I found two people playing risk, so I started watching them.  Turns out, their risk board was bugging out, so they changed the game to catan.Only problem is, one of them didn't know how to play catan.We taught them how to play through the entire game, and we had zero issues with fustration or anything of the sort.Confusion over whose turn it was on the other hand.. Yeah.  That's when the host spawned in a miniature and said ""Pass this when your turn is over.""In real life, Catan is the kind of game where turns could never end.  You can sit there for hours braindead trying to figure out all the possibilities, at least, wheny ou're new to the game. We started doing our turns in sequence much faster, and we were collecting resources.  I was about to trade in 4 of a kind for one resource, as you do when you play with people who don't understand the concept of economics at all.  People I know in real life.   That's when they traded resources.  1 to 1.  I have never traded resources 1 to 1 in a game of catan.  The people I play with IRL always give you an option.  Either you let them win, or you play a painfully hellish game in hopes of getting the resource you need.And so, we continued to trade resources 1 to 1 back and forth and build.  For the first time, I actually played a game of catan in which the building phase wasn't dragged out over the course of the entire game.We kept the table clean through the item bags and the entire game went easily.Finally, someone reached 10 points, which signals the end of the game in Catan.  The person who won was the one who didn't know how to play at the start.And during all of this, the giant button that says ""FLIP TABLE"" taunted us all.  And none of us clicked it, despite the fustrations a game of catan can cause.100/100, would play with anonymous people who are nicer than my RL friends again.			"

								Tabletop Simulator seems to be one of those games in which you play classic board games from the comfort of your own PC, saving the trouble of getting the real thing out of the box, and fussing over all the extras in the box, and deciding who gets to be the motorcar, the usual sort of thing. But Tabletop Simulator does more than that which makes it more appealing.You could play chess with a friend for example. You move a piece, he moves, you take is knight, he takes your queen, then you throw a rook at his king. Literally. And your friend, so enfused with rage of you being a cheating conniving jerk, flips the table in anger, scattering the pieces to oblivion. Then you try a new game. Ludo perhaps. Adding the necessary parts; marbles, dice, mahjong tiles, RPG Dragon...This is one of those games which may look serious, but seen from a different perspective and you have something that can be a great laugh for everyone. All the more, you can make your own games and put them directly into TS for everyone to try out. Which, to paraphrase NerdCubed, makes it an ideal platform for board game makers to test out their new games before they make physical copies. There is a lot that can be done, it's quite astonishing.There is online multiplayer so you can play with friends across the web. Wouldn't mind seeing local hot-seat multiplayer in a future update, if it hasn't already been included.If you haven't bought this game, I highly recommend you do. It is great entertainment for friends and families alike.			"

								Capable of serious gaming, and pretty much everything else you can do with a table.Tabletop Simulator (TTS) is a legitimate simulator. That is, you can play tabletop games with it in the manner you would a physical tabletop game on a physical table.Currently TTS has all of the features needed to play nearly any type of tabletop game: board, war, card, rpg and so on. New features are added almost weekly. The developers (Berserk Games) are doing a great job adding substantial features, while also paying attention to the player's suggestions. If there's an issue with an update, you can typically expect a hotfix released within a very short time to fix it. They are easily one of the most on-task developers I've seen on an early access title.The controls can be slightly unwieldy until you get a handle on them. Once you play with it for a bit, it'll become easy and a lot of fun. Rolling dice and manipulating pieces is a much more tactile and enjoyable experience then other digital tabletop applications.Don't expect there to be AI or automation, TTS is meant to simulate the actual tabletop experience. Meaning you will need other players to play with. There is an online lobby to find other players, you can also direct connect to a friend or use the offline hotseat mode if you want to play a game with a local friend.Overall, I would highly recommend TTS to fans of tabletop games. It's great, and will only get better. Casual tabletop gamers should also enjoy TTS, as there are a lot of game mods that cater to them as well.			"

								When I initially bought this about a year ago, I felt ripped off. I had paid $15 and the game didn't even work. It would constantly CTD with out of memory errors when I've got 12 gigs of RAM and 1 gig of VRAM; which is not the best, but entirely functional. So I gave it a few months for them to update and iron out the issues, and by that time it worked. It was well worth the purchase.This is a game where you can play pretty much any tabletop game in existence. It comes with a few such as chess, checkers, chinese checkers, poker (in the style of Texas holdem), backgammon, and several others. If you want to play another type of game using the components, you can do that. There's no rules here; it's just the players and the components. If someone is losing at chess, they can chuck a piece at their opponent in frustration, perhaps knocking over the king and a couple pawns. If you want to reach over and steal some cards from your opponent's hand, you can; though you'll probably upset them in the process, and they're more than likely to take them back from you. If you don't know how to play chess, bugger all; move with the pieces however you want, throw the pieces, do whatever. This isn't to imply that the community is a bunch of savages that don't care one mote about the rules; quite the antithesis. I've found that most people whom sit down to play a game like chess, poker, or any other game tend to play by the rules of the game they're playing. Sometimes you have someone who doesn't know the rules and they have to be explained, which is fine; but every once in a rare while you have the person who gives no damns whatsoever, comes in, and starts throwing things everywhere and attempting to flip the table, ruining the game for everyone else. Luckily the admin can kick and ban troublesome players, so this is seldom a problem in public games, and much less so if you're just playing with friends.This game is extremly flexible in what it can do. One of the things I like to play most with my friends on this is a card game called gin rummy. There's not any predefined mode for gin rummy here. Instead, I have to go to a 'chest', which is a tab where the admin can spawn in pretty much anything they want, including custom components. From here I can spawn in a standard deck of 52 playing cards, explain the game to my friends if necessary, and go. That's all there is to it.If you're decent at creating your own images or modelling, the game allows you to load in custom cards and pieces and ergo make up your own game with your own rules. If you're not, then this game has a wonderful Steam community workshop feature wherein you can browse other user created games. Pretty much every board game you can imagine can be found here, and this allows for a lot of freedom in what players can actually play. Most video-games are simple; they have a set paradigm that the player cannot change, or can barely change using mods. For example, a video-game that's designed to be just an Uno game or a game designed to be just a chess game are nothing less, nothing more - they offer the experience they want the player to have and that's it. Tabletop Simulator to an extent has these limitations, of course; it's not an ""everything"" simulator, it's a tabletop simulator - but that range is extremely broad, and within that context you can do whatever you want, either using its predefined pieces, creating your own, or finding some really epic games in the community workshop (Eels and Escalators, anyone?). It's not a game that says ""Do this or else."", or a game makes you lose half an hour of progress because you completed an objective incorrectly; heck, it's not even a game with objectives. It's just a game that gives you a whole plethora of pieces and says ""Have fun."", and for that it's one of my all-time favourites.			"

								I'm glad there is a game like this. It crams all board games into one very well delivered package. What is great is it allows the user to interact with the game as they (just about almost) would in real life. The integration of Steam Workshop really is icing on the cake, as you can just go on and download a huge range of board games people have reworked into the game, like Magic the Gathering, Takenoko, Carcassone, Forbidden Island. The game however is more of a sandbox where you can tamper with anyone's cards, destroy someone's tokens, steal someone's dice and FLIPPING THE GOD FORSAKEN TABLE IN A FIT OF UNCONTROLLABLE RAGE WHEN A LITTLE WHINEY KID PUTS YOU IN CHECKMATE.It starts you off with checkers, cards, chinese checkers and all the bog-standard tabletop necessities before you soon migrate to the Workshop. It includes singleplayer (for literally just solitaire) and the multiplayer which surprisingly doesnt require having to port forward. You can just slap a name on your new server, slam some assets down on a table and await the arrival of some players (hopefully ones of which won't exploit the table flipping mechanic CONSTANTLY, which is the reason 80% of servers are password locked :P) and just have some fun. It also lets you use voice chat and normal text chat to talk to victims of your newly thought up next level plays.As a conclusion, it saves you a helluva lot of money on board games in one big digital package which is a huge WIN in itself.

												Bias: I am a dinosaur. My arms are normally too short to reach a real table for board games. This makes it easier.In my opinion, one of my favorite games on steam. The ability to play most board games with little clean up and expense make this simulator great. Thanks to friends. I have learned new board games, that I have seen in game shops that looked interesting, but did not want to spend $40+ on and find out that its not fun, too difficult to play, or no real life friends who wanted to play. This simulator has led me to purchase physical copies of games like Catan, Munchkins, Love Letter, Forbidden Island and a few others. And also has allowed me to introduce friends to these game in real life, who have also found them enjoyable. I would give this game 10/10. It is a game I will continue to play and use to learn new games. Also if you have this, and have not tried Secret Hitler. You should. :D			"

												It's $20 for a mostly-endless board game library, as the Workshop content is incredible to say in the least. What's not to love?Edit: This review seems to be gaining traction, and seeing as this title just went on sale, I'll add a bit more depth. Basically, this game can become any board game you want it to be, which is what makes the game so incredible. The Workshop content for this game has almost any game you could think of, even if it's in a very simple form (maybe not coded to 'autopilot' game setup and such, but still manageable as if you were using your own hands to play it). And given that installing workshop content is as simple as a button press, it makes loading up a board game for friends super easy and quick. I even use this to try out new board games I'm thinking of buying as physical copies, as usually someone has made a Workshop mod for it, and I can dig up a rulebook somewhere to see if friends or I would enjoy the game. So overall, pick this game up no matter the price. At $20 it's an incredible deal, and at anything less than that it's almost stealing.			"

												Quite possibly the best simulator game out there. At least in my opinion.Does what it says on the tin, Tabletop simulator lets you enjoy tabletop games either on your own or with friends. This is fantastic for anyone, like me, who has no local friends, but still has the urge to play things like Monopoly or Connect 4.Keeping in mind that almost anything that is a licensed game is not in the main title. You can still find basic card decks, D&D style figures and almost any kind of dice you could ask for, among many other things. The amount of detail given to the controls and options is astounding as well. Basic physics on items, but it certainly does the job!However, the meat comes with the workshop. What the developers cannot do legally, the community can do, and for free! This is certainly the greatest part of Tabletop. Not only the licensed games that are available, but people being given the ability to be creative and make their own games or rules, if they so choose!Quite honestly worth the price if you and/or some friends are really interested in playing board/card/D&D-style games, but distance or ability to get together in one spot proves to be an issue.

								In this day and age of multiplayer video games, whether it be by playing Smash Brothers with friends in the same room or Call of Duty through online co-op, tabletop games have become a thing of the past.  Hardly anyone plays them these days, allowing the cardboard games to collect dust in the closet or remain unwanted on the shelves of Target.  Tabletop Simulator helps you remember the fun that those board games gave you as a child.  With a seemingly endless amount of games to select, your fun is only limited by the power of your computer and the availability of your friends.  I do not joke when I say that there is at least one game on here for everyone.  Uno, Scrabble, Monopoly, Sorry!, Cards Against Humanity, and even a game about Cthulhu are all here.  There is no limit to the amount of games, and even then, you can always use the game to lay out a table for a game of your creation!  However, this game does have one major problem.  It's rather buggy at times, and the lag is a massive pain to deal with at times.  There were times I played this game and I wanted to quit because I couldn't move my pieces the way I wanted to.  It was a mess to deal with and it's easy to drive you up the wall.  I realize that this is mostly because the game is early access, but I do hope they fix that soon.But really, I would give this game a try.  Find some friends and play some board games together.  It will help you remember the days before we relied on handhelds and consoles for gaming entertainment.  And really, is there anything better than taking a trip down memory lane sometimes?			"

								This was by far one of the best games I have ever played up until recently.  I don't have a problem with the game itself, but rather the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community/players involved. There are 2 HUGE issues that lie within this games community.#1) Greifers/Trolls - This game is riddled with them. Its so easy to just take cards from someones hand, or throw pieces around while playing a game such as chess or dungeons and dragons. There used to be a TON of unlocked card game servers (I.E. Uno, Blackjack, Poker, Texas Hold'em, Yu-Gi-Oh, Cards against Humanity, Magic the Gathering etc.) and they were always ruined by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(s) that would sit around for a bit and act like they were playing seriously, and then they would just start grabbing others cards, ♥♥♥♥ing with the decks, or just ignoring their turn. Sure the admins would ban these people, but it would ALWAYS happen, and I'm still convinced this is to blame for the lack of servers now. The same type of people will host games that seem legit, and when you join, the board will be some sort of disguisting/scary/♥♥♥♥ed up picture. I have joined countless servers that had a normal name such as ""Chess"" , ""Uno"" , ""Blackjack"" etc. only to find that the board is a photo of goatese, a mutilated corpse, naked old women, a scary face, or something else thats ""WTF?!"" worthy. Not to mention the custom decks will be the same thing. The back of the card would be normal to whatever card game you're expecting to play, but when you draw them in your hand and turn them around, they'll be, like stated above, some sort of ♥♥♥♥ed up photo(s).#2) Servers - Okay now this is just as bad, if not worse than the trolls/greifers. When i first started playing a few weeks ago, sure there were a ton of locked servers, and some of them had vulgular/racist names, but there was still a very good amount of open, legit servers playing exactly what they stated in the game mode/name of the game. Whenever I browse servers now, 98% of them are locked. This is especially annoying for admins who start normal games, and lock the server up as soon as a few people join, so you end up seeing an Uno server (or anything like it) with 3/8 people locked. I feel this has something to do with the plethora of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who play this game in an attempt to ruin it for others. Now out of all of those servers that ARE actually locked, almost (with the exception of 1 or 2) all of them have stupid/vulgular names. You'll see names such as ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" , ""♥♥♥♥♥♥s here <3"" , ""Big♥♥♥♥♥♥cheese"" or anything in between. Its incredibly frustrating because these people are just wasting space on the server browsing list. Due to these things, I personally have only come across 3-4 unlocked servers (that are vacant) at any given time actually playing a game as stated. Half of the games being played I dont know how to play, but I digress.So all in all, this is an amazing game. I give props to the dev's for being so active among the better half of the community on the Beserk forums and on Reddit. I really do love this game, and I spent a few late nights having an amazing time for hours just a few weeks ago! I cant even play this game for 20 minutes these days. Like I said above, this game is amazing, and I have no problem with it at all. I just hate the community. If you're willing to take a risk with this game, then by all means go for it, and good luck to you. But if you're expecting a consistant amount of fun, you'll be greatly disappointed (unless of course you enjoy trolling/greifing).			"

												The game was awsome before it had VR support. But after playing in VR, this game was always meant for it. Currently it only has Vive support.Previously I just used it to check out Warhammer models. Now I want to find games. The table feels like I'm at a game hall, you interact more natural. The controls feel good, need a few more options on the wand and the laser could work better like it does in the SteamVR menus.Great game, definitely a must buy if you a fan of tabletop gaming, but the smell of body odor and Chinese food wear on you, this is a must buy.

												Fantastic game. I'm a busy engineer, with most of my friends living far away. Nothing better than a board game to chat over, and this game is the closest thing to a board game night I can think of. I'm not much for the current batch of pvp multiplayer games; it's not worth the time to get proficient enough that each match isn't a lesson in competitive respawning, but this type of online multiplayer is absolutely wonderful. I'm very excited to have found this game, as it will no doubt be a solid way to keep up with my friends.The sandbox element is wonderful as well. I can definitely see my self contributing to the workshop as time goes on. The game makes it extremely accessible to be a contributor to the community, and from what I can tell, it's a great community worth contributing to.Absolutely a 10/10			"

								As kids back in the day, Most of us used to play Tabletop games, but growing up in a world filled with advance technology changed that for most of us. Now we have jobs, smartphones, tablets, computers, lots of videogames, Social Media sites, and have little time to even consider whipping out an old board game. This game changes that, allowing you to play any board game in an open world sandbox with people from all over the world. You can even make your own games and play them with friends. This game is worth more than its asking price, because the devs put their heart and soul into this game. They always listen on the forums and update this game almost every week, unlike some other greedy developers I know. It's something fresh and new that almost never gets old compared to all the zombie and FPS games out there. They even have a workshop filled with thousands of player made games and steam cards and achievements. You must buy this game even if you wouldn’t even play it much, because it will eventually become an addiction.			"

								Tabletop Simulator is easily one of my favourite games. Not only does the game come with inbuilt games of its own which are all great fun, but also realistic physics, and massive amounts of customisation. Custom decks of cards, tables, backgrounds, even a tablet to browse the internet or have a movie night with friends! I personally find the board games created by Tabletop Simulator's community to be great. Fun games such as Heroquest and D&D can be played with ease, and without having to throw out tons of cash for rulebooks.Not only that, but also the community of Tabletop Simulator is great. I have met very few people that were unkind during my playtime, and it appears to me that the game has a very tight-knit community. Overall, I would say this game is very well made, and a very fun game to buy. Definitely worth the low price as well.			"

								Unlike most multiplayer board games, Tabletop Simulator places no limits. Nearly any game can be played, and every piece and card on the board can be manipulated by other players.You can take someone's hand, throw it on the table, steal all their poker chips, and then flip the table over in rage.JUST LIKE REAL LIFE.

								I have never written a review on Steam until now. Why? because this game is so good I have to recommend this to everyone.   We all know most of the Early Access Games are terrible. Most well known example being DayZ. However, not this game. The Devs are so passionate and caring about this game. If you browse the forum they respond to people who have troubles running the game smoothly, multiplayer issues or anything in trouble generally.  Devs stated the reason why this game is on Early Access is because they received an overwhelming response from Kickstarter and decide to polish the game and bring out more content further. Which they did. Read more on what the Devs said and you can see how much they have added.   Now my comments on this game: This is the perfect game for a bunch of friends to gather around at a table to chill out and have fun if people can't already do this physically IRL. The diversity of the game makes it suitable for any age group. Mods in game allows you to play any kind of games as long as you make them work. Mods also allows you to re-visit nostalgic games in your childhood.  This game's simple controls allows anyone to get used to the game in no time. The game has an in-built decent voice chat that allows vocal interaction with other players. You are not require to own the mod the room is currently using to join. Mods will automatically be loaded. Furthermore, hosts can load individual items from separate mods while in a different mod. Hosts and promoted members can also spawn items from chests and saved items from the game. You can also instantaneously upload an image from Internet as a board by simply inserting the URL in required place.   The community is mostly great. Most people have self-discipline are well mannered. However you occasionally get some trolls that do nothing constructive and are only there for ruining other people's games. Luckily hosts have a ban function and ability to limit players from flipping tables and drawings etc. On top of that you can rewind any amount of times so you can undo if anything messed up. It also autosaves so you can continue the games whenever you feel like.   If you ask me to rate this game I'd give it 8.5/10 at this stage. Atm this game is fairly underrated as well as a lot of room to improve. I hope this game will get out of Early Access very soon so more people will buy it. I'm looking forward to seeing this game having more people playing.			"

												Bought this game thinking that it'd be some fun to play boardgames with my friends online. Boy was I right, but does this game offer so much more. Not only can you take all your opponents peices and chuck them off the table, you can draw wings and wangs all you want. And if that's a bit too elementary for you the tablet offers plenty of that if you're brave enough to surf the web on it with strangers. All in all, whether you actually want to plays games or just mess around with a sandbox physic engine with some interesting quirks (hundreds of giant zero gravity dice anyone?) and anywhere inbetween this game fulfills it and does it really well.

I bought it during the summer sale at 50% off and feel like it was a good value, but know it is almost useless in single player, unless you want a strange option for playing solitaire.  It's all about the multiplayer, either online, or in hotseat mode which would be couch multiplayer.  I have played a few pure online games, but prefer to play couch MP.  The workshop is amazing, thanks to all the steamers that have made amazing content for this game and all the great games that inspired them.			"

Early Access Review
								Although the title itself may make it seem it'll probably be one of those unfunny games like Goat Simulator, this game is pretty fun.When I picked up this game, I honestly thought the community would be a dread and that I wouldn't be able to play a serious game without people flicking everywhere. However, I have met some great people on this game, and so far, there's been very limited annoyance.Workshop support is what really makes this game stand out in my opinion. Without it, it'd may still be a good game, but the workshop allows many other games to be played, whether that is card games or board games. There is an endless stream of games to play created by users, so you're not restricted to a few games that are preset. You can pretty much find any classic board game or card game on there, and if it's not on there, well you should make it before anyone else takes that idea, or wait for a smarter and more productive person to do that for you.However, the game itself doesn't have a lot of players and it can be sometimes tricky to get in a public game. I only see about 5 or 6 public servers, out of the 100s of servers there are, which is slightly disappointing, but that is not really the games fault, but this can be sometimes frustrating as you are only forced to select a few games, and not all of them you will like, so you would have to host a server and wait for a long amount of time to see of anyone wants to play go fish with you, which surprisingly, most people don't. Go fish, more like go ♥♥♥♥ yourself.Also, this game cannot really be played by yourself, bit of a ♥♥♥♥ing no brainer but it's true. If you didn't know that you can't play chess by yourself, I'm pretty concerned onto how you have the intelligence or attention span to read this. I don't even see why to put in a singleplayer option sometimes. It's really boring and nearly impossible to play by yourself. The whole point of single player is to play by yourself, how in God's name can I play checkers by myself? The only game I've seem to found to play myself is solitaire, However, I won't lie that the single player feature is useful, but very limited to being useful. Apart from the custom content creator, if you have friends at your house, you can whip out the single player, but it may be sort of awkward as you would need to constantly switch places to move the piece on the computer. I've never tried it, but what's the whole point of playing monopoly on the computer solo with my friend next to me, when I can just get the ♥♥♥♥ing game out in real life? If you do not have a certain game though, then this can be pretty useful in some cases, but only with board games. However, I do like to play online with friends and sometimes strangers.It's a shame that not more of my friends have this game, as it's spectacular fun and I especially like this game I guess for my interest in board games and card games.  There's a few glitches in it, and it can be annoying at times, but I would say get this game if you're interested in board games, card games etc. If not, then this game may not be for you, but there are plenty of games on the workshop.

												What can I say about this that has NOT already been stated? This is my favorite title on steam. Why?Lets start with the fact that nearly all my board games that I own are available on here. The ability to play them or to test out different strategies in a quick manner is something that has caused my gaming group to play more together. I am also able to save my games no matter where I am at.So if me and my friends want to play a game that we know we cannot get through, but would love to be able to continue it later, well.... WE NOW HAVE A WAY TO DO THIS! Gone are the ""Take a picture of the board, write down what we had here...."" While nothing can ever replace the physical game, and the enjoyment that a game night with a bunch of local friends, it does provide a great way to play with my friends that have moved away, as well as introduce different people to the joy that board games. Tabletop Simulator has given me a way to expand my physical board game collection, introduce people to games, play with friends from a far, and test out strategies, all for $20. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys board games, or perhaps are interested in getting started, and want to learn just how different and enjoyable board games can be from video games.10/10			"

												To clarify, this is an engine to play board games. You can play almost any game you can think of. There have been weekly or at least monthly updates, and they keep adding more features the community requests. I had one issue with the workshop not syncing, and the devs actually worked with Valve to get the issue resolved quickly.The only problem for new players, is finding games to join. You need to look for groups that host TTS games. An easy one is Tabletop Simulator Club (look for that group in Steam Groups).Once you play a few games you will realize how great this engine/sandbox is, and if you find a few people to play online with, you will have hours of entertainment.Last comment, I had to chance to meet the developers at PAX Prime, and they both seemed extremely nice. Can't wait to see where they take TTS next, or their next project.			"

												Once you get over the table-flipping gimmick and spamming items, Tabletop Simulator proves itself as an amazing piece of software for bringing the experience of playing board games with friends to the digital sphere. If there's a board game you like, chances are high it exists as a mod on TTS. In many regards, playing a game on TTS is more convenient than having to set it up yourself. Just hit up a bunch of friends on Skype or Discord, get a voice call going and play a round of Secret Hitler or Danmaku. I've got many hundreds of hours of fun yet to be had with this piece of software.If you're at all into board games and have friends you can play with over the net, this is for you.			"

								Tabletop Simulator is more of a Workshop based game than the game itself, but the Workshop opens up many possibilities, as any individual is able to mod the game to make any board game in the world and upload it to share with the community. The game can be a bit buggy, laggy, and glitchy, but that can be expected as it is an early access game.However, this game is probably not worth purchasing if you are not a board game fan. Also, it would probably be wise to purchase this game along with a few other friends, or if several of your friends already have it, so that you have people you can play it with. I've never got on a random server to try and play a game, but I've heard from other people that people on them can be trolls, which would ruin your experience and change your oppinion of the game itself.

												Tabletop Simulator is a hidden gem that needs to be recognised. Every board game you could ever think of can be played in this one game. This is really the Garrys Mod of the board game genre. You can play any game you want, however you want. You can even create your own board games if you like. This is just a hard game to sell. As I believe you really have to play it before you truly understand how great it is.9.5/10			"

												Tons of fun for people who like tabletop games! I was amazed at some of the games I found available; Tokaido, King of Tokyo, Cards Against Humanity, just about every Tabletop RPG imaginable! Tabletop Simulator isn't a game, it's a platform for thousands of games, I even made rules for my own game!			"

												Great for playing basically any board-,card- or dice-game known to man, and more; Or even for developing and playtesting your own game ideas.Anything from simple coinflipping (yes, there's a coin), Marbles, Yatzee, Solitaire and Poker, to Dungeons & Dragons campaigns or Settlers of Catan; To games you've invented yourself, is possible to play with this.It's basically a table and a chest of pieces, with endless possibilies to get both singleplayer or multiplayer games going on it. It's got both local ""hotseat"", lan and internet multiplayer.Lua scripting and custom boards, cards, pieces or dices should also be enough to take care of anything you'd feel is missing. Simply create it yourself, if you can't find it in-game or at the Workshop.(Personally, i chose to nominate this gem for ""Game Within a Game"" category for Steam Awards 2016.) "

												One of the best investments I've ever made in video games and in gaming as a whole.If you like boardgames, this simulation program is for you.The Steam Community itself has made this game/program worth over 100 times more than it's retail value. Look through the Steam Workshop and see all the premium and popluar games to use for free in Tabletop Simulator. The Steam Community has donated its time, thoughts, and ideas in bringing to us, to each other, the best boardgames and tabletop games in this virtual experience. With this we can virtually own and playtest these games. THANK YOU to Tabletop Simulator and the Steam Community for helping me and my friends save thousands of dollars in boardgames. If you really like a game in the Tabletop Simulator Steam Workshop, please support the actual developers of the game itself by buying an actual physical copy for yourself... or 1 copy for your gaming group... to show your love for that game. We have personally bought games that we felt were more than worthy to physically own (Dead of Winter, Epic Spell Wars, Munchkin, Star Trek Panic, Pandemic Cthulhu, etc).			"

								This game is like a dream come true. It is pretty much the Garry's Mod of board games with a near limitless base from which to expand ideas for games. Be it Uno, Monopoly, Chess, Poker and several obscure card games I've never heard of, it even has (a somewhat limited at this time) tabpletop RPG support. I would have paid  $12 just for a online multiplayer monopoly alone because as far as I know there isn't one on Steam. Also the devs have said steam workshop support is coming soon for this title so I expect this game to be enjoyed for years. Great purchase, I should have bought a 4 pack!			"

												I generally don't write reviews, so I will try and keep this short and to the points.The Good:You can play lots of games in it, with your friends, pretty easily. It's fun, there's lots of user content from the steam workshop to keep you entertained as well.The Bad:The new UI update is aweful. The UI is trash now, however it's not any real reason to not buy the game. Hopefully the Devs will undo it.I generally just play Magic The Gathering on here, as it has a lot of good plugins from the community for that. I have not purchased the DLC as most of the DLC is also on the steam workshop because other players have made it better. So in short, this game is absolutely worth it, just really hope the devs fix the UI.			"

								never, ever in my life have i seen developers be this determined and caring for their own game. an ambitious statement, yeah, but look at the patch notes for every single update for this game and you'll see that they're CONSTANTLY adding new clever features that make it just a little bit more enjoyable, bit by bit.even if you don't like tabletop games, this will still probably manage to hold your attention for at least a little while as you mess around with all the neat little things this game has to offer. i highly reccomend it for anyone, though some definitely may enjoy it than others.seriously though, it's awesome. when game devs go that extra mile to put some extra love and care into their games, it really does show. this is nowhere near an early access game, and if they were to release it right now it'd be even more finished than a lot of games out there on the market today. and as i say that, i know that there's still more cool things the devs are going to add.

								After following this up from Greenlight, this game is truly incredible. The amount of fun you can have with people from around the world is immense. The Steam Workshop really adds a level of creativity to the game.People can make their own games from Uno to Monopoly. They can create their own special versions of games, like a unique Nintendo Monopoly, or a Minecraft Monopoly. I am currently the owner of three Workshop Items. The possibilities are really endless.People can import these games and host a Multiplayer server for up to eight people from around the world. Of course if you live further away you're going to have more server lag unless the host has amazing internet. Currently LAN support is not available, but that's not a feature I usually use in games anyway. You can set passwords for your game room for a private match. You can disable table flip, hands for non-card games. There used to be a problem where people would join a game, table flip and leave, but now the game has a delay before a person can do that even if table flip is on. There are really a lot of options.Rules are enforced by the host, simply meaning if they don't play properly then why would they allow them in the room? The host can kick/ban a player, or mute a player if they're squeaking or something through their microphone.The people on this game are mostly friendly. To filter out annoying people though you can put ""(mic)"" or ""(mic needed)"" in the title, then you can ask them if they can talk when they join the game. People are usually nicer when they have to speak to others with their voice rather than text speak. Seat requesting has been suggested before but has not been added yet.The single player version of this can be played on your own or with others if you share a mouse. This isn't really something I'm too interested in either. This mode is usually the place where people make custom games designed for multiplayer, or simply to get used to controls and mess around. Of course there are single player games you can play, if that's what you're in to, like Solitaire.The physics in this game is really fun to play with to. There is a gravity multiplier which changes the gravity effect of objects in-game. People have made tabletop tennis with a coin. Throwing things around, watching things fly off as you flip the table.  Rolling a dice around a game board. Everything is really well done.I get the most fun though out of talking to people through microphone. Talking through chat just doesn't cut it for me, especially in a silent game as it currently has no game music. I enjoy arguing with people over competetive games such as Story War and Once Upon A Time. I recommend you get a microphone before getting this game in order to have a better game experience, unless you just want to play quiet games.Performance wise the game is excellent, and should run on low-end computers as well as high-end. All the game really has to load is a single table and the amount of things on the table. Performance will likely droop if you're hosting though, but for me this doesn't really show any considerable FPS change. The game looks good on Medium to Ultra, but starts to look bad if you go any lower. (Not that you should need to.)Unfortunately there are tabletop games which are just not possible to recreate at the moment such as Mouse Trap or Dingbats, but hopefully due to the fast updates this game has these games should be possible to recreate in a few weeks/months or so.The developers are amazing and listen to the community. My best advice would be to ask/suggest things on the Berserk Games forum as that's where they mostly hang out. They push out a new update every week or so with new and fun features for the community to try out and squashed bugs. It's great fun being a part of the Early Access community and helping to shape the game into a game everyone would want to be a part of.If you're interested, you should watch some videos and see what all the fuss is about.Anyway, I highly recommend this unique game for anyone who likes playing tabletop games in real life (which is pretty much everyone). This has great replayability.10/10 - Fun!			"

I guess what I am asking is, what is the percieved value for the developers of these games?

												Tabletop is a genius product.  If you're a tabletop gamer and can't find any local games, Tabletop Simulator is for you.  If you're a tabletop gamer that just wants to play online once in a while instead of getting a group together, Tabletop Simulator is for you.  If you want to try out a game before you go pick up a physical copy, Tabletop Simulator is for you.  In fact regardless of any of those thing, Tabletop Simulator is probably for you.There is a rich and growing workshop in Steam, to the point that I'm yet to find something I want to play that doesn't exist as DLC or Workshop.  The interface is fantastic, the tools are fantastic, and the ongoing development is fantastic.I really can't say enough good things about Tabletop Simulator.  For the price tag, you really can't beat it.			"

												Tabletop Simulator is an amazingly simple, enjoyable game. Whether you meet new friends, play with old friends, or meet new friends while playing with your old friends, this game is amazing regardless! Play games you played as a child, find new games you think will be fun, play classic games, and play games you've never even heard of before, with your beloved pals. Going outside is for normies. With Tabletop Simulator, you can experience the joy of playing with your real friends, online friends, and completely random people while in the comfort of your own home and computer. Play games such as Chess, Checkers, Pictionary, Pool, Poker, Mahjong, Chinese Checkers, Candyland, Monopoly, Sorry!, Dominoes, Jenga, Eels and Escolators, Apples to Apples, Dungeons and Dragons, Black Jack, Roulette, and games you've literally never heard of!This game is versatile. You can play board games, play all sorts of D&D games and even set up your own boards and dungeons, and learn new ways to have a blast with your friends. Be prepared to flip tables, laugh, rage, and appreciate with this game.I purchased this game when it was on sale for $10.00. I know that $20 is a bit much for a stupid table simulator game, but it is worth it my friend. I suggest this game to anyone who has or has not friends, because you can always make great friends on this game by joining or hosting servers free to the public.			"

								 For anyone thinking about buying this game I can honestly tell you that this has been one of the most enjoyable purchases I have made on steam. The workshop mods alone make this game well worth the price. I started first looking through the steam workshop and found that any tabletop game I could think of was there and ready to play. Which is great because it is rare I have all my game playing friends anywhere near my tabletop collection. So its nice to be able to roll some virtual dice and play some board games online. The gameplay can be a bit awkward sometimes (kind of depends on the game) but use the hotkeys for functions like, lock down game piece, or zoom in on card, can really help speed up game play and keep you from knocking pieces all over the board. If you do manage to destroy your board or someone gets mad and flips the table, you can simply undo step and the board has been reset to the last play before desaster struck. Another thing you might wonder about is hiding your cards so other players cannot see them. There is an area over your ""seat"" that you can place cards without others seeing, however if you need a larger area simply use the fog of war tool and your cards are safe from other players view.  In the time I have played Tabletop Simulator I have purchased a few tabletop games that I wouldn't have otherwise, due to the cost of some tabletop game titles. Being able to try them out with expansions and get a feel for the game really made the difference for me and I then had no problems sinking the money into the real thing. The game is constantly growing with more from the workshop and polish from the developers. Once again this is well worth the investment and has endless reply value.			"

												There's only one way to say it: This game changed my life!This is an overstatement, of course, but it is true.This isn't just a videogame this is a way to play whatever you want with other people.Tabletop Simulator gave me a way to play a lot of beautiful boardgames online, in a way that is just perfect and so, so close to the real thing, and this is why I have to say ""Thank you"" to the developers and to the wonderful community that plays the game and create the mods.So: if you like boardgames buy this, Tabletop Simulator is not simply the best, it is the only one that offers you this kind of experience.

Product received for free
This was given to me as a gift back in 2014Something to enjoy with friends that are out of reach but want to play a board/card game with them. Table flipping is only funny when appropriate, otherwise it'll be annoying and rude. If you're going for that 1000 flips achievement, don't make it a priority along with the hour benchmarks.This is a good way to try out your 3D modeling & graphic skills for pieces, bags, cards, dice, background etc. Can even upload a custom image to the table (square or rectangle). See if you can create 3 original workshop items to share that isn't already made. :PDo note though and be warned, if your lobby is public it must be appropriate for everyone, otherwise the devs may revoke your key if informed. Be sure to make your lobby private by putting in a password; can do whatever you want in a private lobby. (Yes, can even upload nsfw images on the table or puzzle pieces, go nuts; just make sure it's not part of a workshop item or you'll be in bigger trouble.)$15 is worth it if you plan to play board/card games often with your friends, or make custom stuff with 3d modeling or art, otherwise I would wait for a sale for like $10.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

Early Access Review
								Tabletop Simulator is essentially a virtual version of board and card, an idea that has been done before, but not on the level that tabletop simulator has done, where you are simply given the cards, the chips, and boards for you to set up nearly any game you want. Of course, this is expanded much farther by the steam workshop, where people sumbit games that range from original and genius board games, or just a copy of a well-known game (Monopoly, Uno, etc.)  Everyone in the game has a hand cursor and matching color, and they can interact with anything on the table at any time, the rules for must be set up by players and obeyed for the sole reason of playing correctly (which of course opens the doors for a number of trolls and griefers)  The game, of course, is still in early access and, suprisingly, is updated quite often. People often say that people release early access games and then never update because they've made their money. For some games this is true, but Tabletop Simulator is consistenly updated and so far it looks like the final release will be great. If the game were released now it would still be great! However, it's obviously not perfect. Interaction with objects can sometimes feel awkward and dropping pieces when you aren't looking from a birds eye view is usually guesswork when you aren't placing the piece 3 inches from the camera. Despite its flaws, Tabletop Simulator has been fantastic so far, and it promises to be even better at release.			"

								Tabletop Simulator is an excellent buy if you're a fan of traditional tabletop games. Online 8-player co-op with nearly every popular tabletop game is something that I'm glad exists.Despite the trailer touting silly physics as a selling point, the games themselves are perfectly playable and don't suffer at all from the ability to fling pieces around like a maniac; the ability to spawn dozens of giant orc figurines after beating your friend in chess is just a pleasant bonus.

												This is a physics sandbox where you can basically play any 2D tabletop game in any manner you please. No rules are hardcoded (although Lua scripting is supported for convinience!) and a large variety of tools are available to perform every action you please. They're officially licensing full commercial board games for digital conversion as their growing library of DLC, and most any other game you can think of has already been faithfully recreated in the Steam Workshop.If you are an artist of any kind, you can effortlessly upload new content to use in any way you please. Entirely custom boards, cards, figures, dice, and other trinkets are all things you can produce for any purpose you need.One downside, it unfortunately has a lot of trouble with vertical layouts, making it impossible to play Battleship with upright boards, difficult to play Connect-4 as originally intended (although if you lay it down as a slope it works much better), and very nearly impossible to play 23rd Century 3D Chess unless you're in Vive VR mode.It also tends to have some difficulty simulating the rest of the room, beyond the table. The DLCs add entirely custom table and 3D room models, but when you flip the table, you flip the room with it.			"

								This is my first Review. I started playing this game on Friday and put 28 hours into it by Sunday morning. This software is a simple yet amazing concept. Board game lovers everywhere should purchase Tabletop Simulator. There are over 2000 mods in the workshop that replicate some of your favorite games. Anyone can create or import their own boardgames. The community so far seems amazing. I've encountered only 2 or 3 ""trolls"". I used the term ""trolls"" loosely because a couple of them were just children being children. The host options let you rewind, kick, ban etc so that they have very little influence on the rest of the game. I highly recommend this game. I have already purchased another copy for my guest account so I can let my friends try it out and play with me.			"

												Tabletop Simulator combines the potential inherent in a physics-based sandbox with a wide combination of out-of-the-box board games and easily-subscribed Steam Workshop games. The controls are fun and easy to get the hang of, and you'll need them for everything from Dungeons & Dragons to Axis & Allies to five-player chess.This is a wise investment even if you don't have many friends interested in tabletop games. Although it's generally a better experience with friends, meeting strangers and playing games with them is fun enough.(Laser Light Show is a ♥♥♥♥♥ though.)			"

								Before I played my first multiplayer game using Tabletop Simulator, I knew I was going to enjoy it. Tabletop Simulator lays the foundation for you to reconnect with old friends that you used to game with as well as meet new friends that play the same games that you do. It is a toolbox allowing you to unlock nearly every experience you could have sitting at a normal table except you and your friends can now be thousands of miles apart and everyone has the best seat.The most important aspect of enjoying Tabletop Simulator is understanding the controls. In the beginning, they can be a burden if you don't spend a small amount of time learning how everything works. Take the time and explore all the different ways you can interact with cards, dice, and pieces. Once the controls become second nature, you can instead focus on what you're playing and not how you're playing it.For me, any and all network issues have been resolved. The game plays smooth and everyone can see everything in real time. Tabletop Simulator can also handle a crazy amount of individual pieces before it begins to struggle -- many more than you would ever use in even the most involved miniature or Euro game.Lastly, Berserk Games is working hard to make the experience even better. The game is advanced enough now, in my opinion, to be released, but they are finding even more features to add and updating on a regular basis. They listen to their user base and are working to make the best product they can. When you're looking for an Early Access success story, this is the example you should give. I am a proud supporter!

												Awesome engine that can run nearly any tabletop game. just check the workshop for yourself! there are tons of good games that you'd prolly never know existed or be able to play due to region, price, age, or w/e. It's also a good way to test a game before buying it physically.TTS' still being constantly updated. and the community's really helpful when you don't know how to perfectly play the game. Try read the rulebook or something beforehand, tho.We all know that playing a tabletop games on the pc isn't as swift to as it is IRL, but that's the price we have pay for not having to move to other ppl's places (if it's even possible) everytime you want to play a few games... at least some of the game's functions can be automated with scripts is the modder has the patience to do it... and no one has to clean the table after flipping it :)			"

												Amazing purchase if you are into board games. You are guarranteed to have a very good time playing with some very nice strangers (should you search long enough for a good table). Furthermore, it is hands down the best resource out there for you to check out if a board game is worth buying or not.The only thing, though, is that there are some trolls here and there, but they are not really that common.Impressively enough, I was able to find a considerable number of people from Brazil - my home country - while playing this and made a Discord group for us to play in Portuguese.

The unlimited ways you can create mods currently extends as far as emulating real-life board games, but sooner or later it'll be interesting to see if some new games are created with this engine, which is very possible. In any case, grab a few friends, get a server sorted, play some UNO, Cards Against Humanity, Munchkin, Fluxx, Tsuro, Lords of Waterdeep, or something much simpler like chess and anything with playing cards.

												Despite Tabletop Simulator being in Early Access, it's very much worth purchasing in my opinion. I can't speak too much about the default tabletop games it brings such as dominoes or chess. However, my friends and I have put in nearly 100 hours of game time already because we've found this to be a very fun, social game to play. We've downloaded and installed at least a dozen board games and it's been really fun trying them out.  We've played Cards Against Humanity, Fluxx, Ascension, King Of Tokyo, Munchkin, Red Dragon Inn (a drinking game that we've had a lot of fun playing :P ), Dixit, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Once Upon A Time, to name a few. It's been a fun experience playing all these board games that we normally wouldn't have been able to play online with friends. A few of us have even dabbled into some light Role Playing which we didn't really ever try before and found that we've enjoyed it.The game isn't without its bugs here and there but I can honestly say it's nothing game breaking. The developers have done a fantastic job with fixing bugs and releasing frequent updates. Every time we've found ourselves asking in game ""Wouldn't it be great if they added X, Y, Z?” they seem to add those things in within the next update or two and then some. I feel that the developers listen to their community and actually take their suggestions and implement them. Overall, I most definitely recommend this game for hours of silly fun with friends. If board games are your thing or it's something that you've never really tried but are curious about, I absolutely recommend you give Tabletop Simulator a try.			"

												Tabletop Simulator is not a perfect game -- it still has its moments where an additional feature or a bit more polish is needed; however, TS is undoubtedly one of the most impressive titles out there for those who are willing to put a little bit of time and effort into their games.I use it to run a 5th edition D&D game. The workshop has hundreds of mods allowing you to play anything from complex miniatures games to Uno.It's sublimely simple yet rich at the same time. I highly recommend it if you like to do a touch of modding and/or have a group of friends you'd like to play tabletop games with.			"

								This game allows you with the access of the Steam workshop and the wonderful modding community to play any tabletop game you could possible think of. To really get the most out of this game play and create games with your online firends who you can't physically play tabletop games with. This is a absolutely must if you want to play classics that are unavailible online or if your in need to play with friends you can't meet to play.			"

												As of 9/26/16 I've only had the game for a day, and have less than ten hours played. But the game is incredibly fun, I've played poker, blackjack, and so many RPGs I've never played before. All without playing with a single friend yet. All strangers. The community on the game is incredibly friendly, and welcoming.I plan to use this for my DnD games with friends, once they decide  to not be cheap and buy it..			"

Really cool game, more of a tool than a game but the functionality is amazing. Infinite possibilities with both the basics (card games, chess, jigsaws etc) and the TONNES of workshop content for free (cards against humanity, trivial pursuit magic, top trumps, ANY CARD/ BOARD GAME IN REAL LIFE IS THERE!). You can even make your own games if you can't find what you're looking for.You can play with random people but it's recommended to have a friend in mind to play it with for more fun :) Can also search for prons on the tablet XDI recommend picking up a copy or 2 when its on sale for half price, which it is fairy often, but I'd say still worth at full price.

												Generally speaking, this game ist not much more than a physics sandbox with some tools for administrating up to 8 players and supporting custom models. But this is enough to open up unlimited possibilities for boardgame geeks, don't let the screenshots from the store fool you! This sim can handle way more than Chess, Checkers and other common stuff you'll find online en masse.That said, the workshop support is the heart of this application, because it allows modders to recreate every boardgame, cardgame, tabletop or physically existing game. Lots of historical stuff you'll never get your hands on (except you're willing to pay high collector's prices) like games from Avalon Hill or those nasty american nuclear-themed games from the atomic age. Here's a random selection of well-done workshop items you should try out:- Advanced Civilization- Bohnanza (popular german cardgame)- Carcasonne- Settlers of Catan (including Star Trek mod)- Risk (LotR-mod / Star Wars-mod and more)- Exploding Kittens- Zombie Dice- Starship Troopers (based on the novel, not on the movie)- Alien - Fallout-Monopoly- Escape from Colditz- X-Wing Miniature Game- Warhammer - HotelThere are no limits: Scan your favorite game's cards, reference sheets and rules, import 3D-Models and preserve this stuff for all times. Clearly a totally unterrated game, or better to say, tool. 10/10: Why did I have to wait until 2015 to get my hands on an application like this?			"

								Want to play chess with marbles, Mahjong tiles, and bears?  Sure, you can do it.How about playing poker with Uno cards, Dominion cards, and Magic: the Gathering cards?  Yep, why not?Can you place your checkers on the red spaces, and king them by replacing the checker with a queen from chess?  Sure, but why not replace it with an Ent figurine instead?How about stacking up a bunch of blocks into a castle, and then knocking it over with pony figurines?  Well♥♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't love a good game of Angry Ponies?Go ahead, be a nonconformist; play your board and card games the way you want.  Build crazy structures from game pieces, impress your friends with magic tricks*, stack up some dominoes and topple them over, or...well, play any game you want.  Even one you made up.  Tabletop Simulator simply gives you the table and the ability to spawn whatever pieces you want, and leaves you to do whatever you wish.  And with the ability to create a custom board/cards/figurines, the possibilities are endless.Oh, and if you get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, you can flip the table and watch the board and pieces fly.  Best (and worst) feature ever made.*Quick Silver does not guarantee that your friends will be impressed, or that all magic tricks are possible in Tabletop Simulator. Results may vary.

								Tabletop Simulator is a game where players can host various games, old and new, based off content from the Steam Workshop. A host will have the ability to invite up to 8 players depending on the game. The host and players controls a hand cursor that can be used to interact with game pieces.As host you have the ability to duplicate, spawn, and deal game pieces out to players. Cards and pieces can be hidden in front of the player for privacy when developing strategy.The games contains no music, cinematics, or storyline. Exactly what you would expect from a simulation game. I do enjoy the amount of content that is released on the Steam Workshop for this game. However the controls can take some getting the hang of, even after viewing the tutorial. As well as issue getting pickup groups going with random players.I believe Tabletop Simulator is a must for any board gaming enthusiast. A great addition to any gaming clan or guild's game nightI would recommend this game. "

												If you want to fully enjoy this game, you need to be social ;)But seriously, you would need to be able to play with either random people or friends (if ya hav any) if you want to have the most fun.If you have just bought the game, you might get bored easily from all the basic games.. The reason for this is that any game that you want to play (Besides the basics) are found on the Steam Workshop for Tabletop Simulator, as it is community based, or purchasable DLCs, which are also fun.You do not have to spend half of your freetime to set-up and clean-up, as they are usually set up for you, with a few things you have to do yourselves. Leaving the boring time to a minimum, and the entertaining times to the max! That is if you are not playing chess (Just kiddin).The biggest part of the game, of course, is the workshop, where all the games found! With over 13,500 Workshop items and more to come! Most (Not All) of the community are great people, each game I play has different types of people, so the games never gets boring! And for the price of one game, you would now have access to 13,000+ games that are usually twice the cost of Tabletop!The last, and most important part of this game... Table Flipping Overall, I rate this game a 9.9/10. Depending on the time, the place can be a tad quiet, but there will always be at least 5 games up at a time, if not, more.			"

												So I've been eyeing this game for a while before I bought it and let's just say I'm so glad I got it while it was on sale. Not because it wasn't worth the price oh no no! Because of humble bundle I was able to donate to a good cause AND get an amazing game that's worth way more than what they're charging to be honest.A good thing to keep in mind is this game is like a box of 100 games. Many of which I've been able to play over and over with the fun increasing over time rather than dying down like old games. If you're bored of a game or would rather play something else, just select a new board game, take a little time to learn it and boom! Pros:  Replayability is unrivaled HUGE variety Most part decent community Active community VERY modable! Cons: There's only 3 cons for me and I'd rather explain them then list them: Playing during off hours: Playing TTS while the USA is asleep is a little more difficult to have players join your game. I've noticed the community goes down 2/3s during the late/really early hours of the night but if you have a 2-3 player game that's decently popular, it's not really a big deal. Playing a board game you want to play: Now this is kind of a small issue since everybody has different game style tastes. As for me, wanting to play long strategy and war games, unless you have friends, it's a bit hard to find people that: 1. won't leave mid way 2. won't quit while you're explaining.You always haft to go into a game expecting people don't know how to play which bugs me but hey, you get around it. The ADD stricken kids or small part of the community: There's a good chance you'll run into the younger audience which is fine in some cases, hell, I've ran into a 13 year old more mannered than a 21 year old here. HOWEVER, you'll run into some who will fidget with pieces, rush things, and even flip the table before they leave. (All good though as you're able to rewind gameplay GOD BLESS) It's just annoying at times but like I said, this doesn't happen that often.Also, some people either will join and sit there trying to mess with your players or try to ruin the board by throwing pieces. Simply just kick them and everything will be fine! Like I said, there's a rewind function AND a blacklist so you can keep people off your servers :)All in all, this game is REALLY amazing and is awesome if you have a group of friends or you're bored and need something new to play.

												If you have friends who like any sort of tabletop games, you will all love Tabletop Simulator. It's introduced me to a dozen different games I'd never played before that I went out and bought because they were great. Playing games with friends is easy and fun.If you don't have people to play with though, it's a bit harder to find or start a game. It's a big time investment to explain a new game to a half dozen people who've never played before, so expect people to quit halfway through the explanation and have to start all over again with someone else. Because of that, most of the games you can join on public servers are ones that are relatively easy to explain or have a lot of people in the general player base that already know how to play. There's probably 20-30 different public servers open at any given time with [currently] popular games like Secret Hitler, Betrayal at House on the Hill, X-Wing, Codenames, Red Dragon Inn, Epic Spell Wars, Magic: TG, Bang!, etc. being the most commonly featured.

YouTube™ Video: Tabletop Simulator: Early Impressions 

			Views: 6,108		

			Tabletop Simulator: Early Impressions We take a look at the early access ""Tabletop Simulator"", a versatile sandbox game that features virtually any table top game you could imagine.		

Above is my video impression of the game.I'll be honest, judging strictly from the screenshots and some video, I didn't expect that much from tabletop simulator. After some random online games filled with trolls I expected even less. But once I managed to have a game of MTG with'n tabletop sim with mature, and well organized players I was sold! I saw the light, I see the potential and grand scope that this game has to offer. I am actually incredibly impressed by how well it functions once players are there to play, rather than to troll.The scope and concept, as well as it's versatility is incredibly impressive. Truly the name is as accurate as it could possibly be. It simulates what it's like to play these tabletop games IRL. There's no score keeping by the game, it's upto the player. There's no digital ref restricting your moves, it's up to the player. It honestly does feel close to the real thing.Overall, Tabletop Simulator has a few rough edges as of now, but the potential of this is quite impressive.Pros:- Mimics real life tabletop experience very well- Extremely versatile sandbox that will allow for virtually any table top games to be mimiced here.- Brave and unique design choices- Very fun with well coordinated playersCons:- Graphics are a little crude currently- Too many trolls online- Almost require friends or trusted players to enjoy			"

If you're looking for hours of fun playing literally anything, this is the game for you. If you can't see a good game to play in the list, go into the workshop. I can almost garuntee what you want is there somewhere.  My favorate part of this game is that you can load a mod into your friend's game without them needing the mod. I recommend this game greatly			"

												An oddly good timewaster, Tabletop Simulator is the simulator to buy if you want to play tabletop games. The controls feel a little wonky but oddly they work really well with lots of undo options should something spectacular screw up. There's also perhaps the best feature: table flipping. Also easily undoable.Anyway if you have friends or family far away and want to play games like yahtzee, monopoly, chess, checkers, snakes and ladders you name it in a 3D style game and not in some glitchy 2D flash game with questionable ads you found on a Google search, this is the game to get. It doesn't require a lot of computer power to run and, with some coaching, may even be easy enough for your grandparents to use. Mine got the hang of chess anyway. It's also a lot of fun being able to play a game like yu gi oh and have every single card available even if it's a challenge sifting through all ten thousand of them.Overall highly recommended, this simulator is better than I ever would have expected			"

												Truly indispensable ('sandbox') software for people who love tabletop gaming (and personally I find this the best gift I've been given on Steam in terms of possible fun & most long-term pay off financially). The Workshop is full with all sorts of free tabletop, board, and cardgames, including but not limited to a lot of recent popular boardgames. Besides that, you can easily implement or test your own material, if you'd like to add anything to a game. It's very easy to use. I've nothing but good to say about this program.			"

												Tabletop Simulator is really a hard thing to review, as it is really what you make it to be. The sole purpose as to why I got this was for the Tabletop Roleplaying aspect of it. I am a Game Master and have found many ways to use this before or during my game sessions. I am the founder of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League, a Group that is made up of people, players of tabletop/pen and paper games, and I definitely recommend this to all fo them. Anyway, lets continue on to the pros and cons listsNOTE-This review is based solely on the RPG/Game Master features and uses for Tabletop Simulator.Pros-Unlimited Features, you can do literally do whatever you want to with this thing. If Tabletop Simulator doesn't have an asset that you need like a castle piece or knight model, you can just make one! It literally has unlimited potential for all of your Game Master needs.Consistent Updates, the developers are still expanding the base resources, specifically the RPG assets. This is great news for those interested in these assets, us Game Masters that is.Multiplayer, you can literally play your favorite tabletop game with your friends using this game, either through the internet or using hotseat gameplay. For the internet part, connecting is very easy and allows the Game Master to set the rules.Many others, but lets continue to cons...Cons-Complicated Controls, the controls are not to simple for beginners, remembering which button does what is hard early on. Once you have played with the controls for a while you will get a feel for them. The tutorial tells you how to use the controls, but thats about it.Inefficient Menus, finding the piece you are looking for takes to long, not because they are hard to find, but because you have to search through the menu, then sub menus, then more sub menus. It just takes to long, but I can live with it for now, although it would be nice to eventually change the menu set up. I guess you will never be able to reproduce a real tabletop session 100% in a virtual game.Conclusion-Overall, this is perhaps at the moment the best and most realistic means in recreating the actual feel of tabletop gaming, not just roleplaying games, but any game. I believe that this could eventually become the standard for PC tabletop roleplaying, and look forward to seeing what the developers do with this. This is a must have for any Game Master, or anyone who just really likes playing tabletop games!May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League			"

												Tabletop Simulator is a pretty cool experience. You can basically build or play any game you want. The Steam community has created some pretty cool games and items in the Workshop. Though if you want to create something 3D then you better have some computer modeling knowledge. I also like the feature where I can import my own playing cards or pieces or boards. Though I did try to make a disk type ""card"", I used a .png with a transparent background and when I imported the file, the transparency was filled with black making it a square card. I'm still trying to figure out the card importing thing, since when I imported a card type, it became very pixelated and illegible... But I've seen games on the Steam Workshop where the cards are very clean... SO - one of these days I'll get that result. But overall, this simulates what it's like to be at a real table and the games that you can play or create are endless, and they go as far as your imagination.			"

A perfect sandbox to play board games virtually.A lot of my favourite popular board games have already been uploaded as mods available in the Steam Community.

However, the developers are really good and open to suggestion and have already implemented a large amount of changes which benefit the game.Well worth picking up, just so you can crush your online friends at Battlestar Galactica as much as your real life friends! >:D			"

 Fun and Intuitive, Still Feel Bad About Playing Unlicensed Games.I am currently running Tabletop SImulator to participate in boardgames I rarely get the chance to play. So like those in the Steam Workshope I am equally guilty of playing games I can't afford or do not own. Let's just be honest here, that's what is happening here. The Tabletop Simulator workshop boasts loads of games from various publishers. I try not to worry or even contmeplate over the legality of playing these games, but nonetheless, I try to play them all. As for the game system itself ... it is a very easily learned and intutitve system of 2D VR manipulation. I wish the same could be said for some of the workshop games, but ... beggers can't be chosers. Do I recommend it? Yes.			"

								Tabletop Simulator is in it's infant stages currently. The game revolves around simulating a tabletop and physics, and allowing players to play a variety of games (or create their own!) on said tabletop.Where the game currently shines is the development team. They've formed a close-knit tie with their community and are currently listening to community feedback in a way few other games can. Many features have been straight from the communities mouth, and they're willing to engage the community and discuss with us upcomming features, plans, and gameplay. If there's no game on a table you're interested in playing, TTS probably isn't for you. This isn't going to magically make DnD, Chess, or Munchkin more fun. But if you do enjoy tabletop games, then playing with friends and strangers online on TTS is the way to go.			"

												I am absolutely in love with Tabletop Simulator. I was initially hesitant to buy it for the $20 price tag and wanted to wait for it to come up for sale before getting it, but my group and I really wanted to get started on a Pathfinder campaign and I'm incredibly impatient. This has been worth every cent so far, There are an amazing number of really well done models on the workshop and building maps is much easier than I thought it would be. It's still time consuming, but once you get the hang of what to do and how to move and arrange pieces, it's really intuitive and works out really well.My campaign is going great. The players love it, and TTS really makes it feel like we're all around a table in a room together instead of miles apart. We've tried out lots of other tabletop programs to try and get the group going, but none of them felt as real as this one has and it's added a different element to tabletop gaming that other programs have fallen short of for me and my group. The controls make DMing so simple, and honestly the only thing I can think to improve right now would be the ability to draw more defined fog of war instead of just the squares. Workshop support is A+ and I have had zero problems retrieving items I've subscribed to.Overall, I cannot recommend this high enough to other pen and paper RPG groups. Having the 3d maps and being able to decorate the world with flavor items has been a real treat. I can honestly spend hours upon hours in game doing nothing but building.			"

								This is my favourite purchase of the year. I absolutely love it. Either grab one of your favourite boardgames or set them up yourself for the game, and then play it with all your online friends. It's amazing! It does have a great deal of flaws still, many related to controls, physics and small oversights, but even then everyone I've played it with (some 8+ people now) has utterly loved it. I cannot recommend this enough if you love boardgames and you want to be able to play it with your long distance buddies.I will say though that if you want this PURELY for D&D or other such pen and paper things, do NOT get this. It works, it absolutely does, but there are other far better and FREE alternatives out there. I really can't recommend this game if you're doing it for pen and paper roleplaying at all. Everything else though, heck yes. I'm pressuring all my friends into getting this.			"

								Do not discount this game as a simple board game sim; Believe me when I say it has surprised me time and time again.Tabletop Simulator is a fantastic party game, the ideal solution to anyone who has ever wanted be able to play that one board game with all of their distant friends, or even those nearby without the ridiculous mess that usually goes into them.This game comes with a standard pack of classical tabletop games, such as Checkers, Chess, Mahjongg, and even some RPG tools in case you want to play old-school miniatures. That, however, is not where this game shines. Its true worth is the fact that Workshop Integration and an active modding community allows you to play almost any tabletop game imaginable, from Cards against Humanity to Pokemon Master Trainer to Munchkin to Liar's Dice to Sellswords to Triple Triad. Given time, almost any game, no matter how obscure or how niche, will find its way to the Workshop and therefore be playable for you and up to eight friends.PROS:-a large amount of agency is afforded to players in order to provide an optimal game experience-an almost limitless library of modules is available via the workshop, giving access to hundreds of distinct games-a tutorial explains most of the obscure commands and keys fairly effectivelyCONS:-some functions that one might expect aren't available (no way to import backgrounds independent of game-types, some kind of inventory functions for players for items other than cards, etc.)Ultimately, the game is absolutely worth it if you and yours have ever wanted to play a particular tabletop game without all the hassle of having to be cluttered around a messy game board or table. I absolutely recommend this game and its various workshop modules.			"

												Tabletop Simulator is pretty cool if you have friends. I had to convince roughly three people to buy this game so I'd have someone to play it with, for one person I had to buy it for them and gift it. Once they got it though, they definitely enjoyed it. Using the workshop for content, you can play all sorts of games. It's especially useful if the friends you do have are too lazy to come over to play a board game. You can just play it at your computer; most any game you want for only twenty dollars. Overall good game 10/10, need more friends though.			"

Well, it's not an issue anymore thanks to Tabletop Sim.Secret hitler,DnD,Star Wars X-Wing,BattleStar:Galactica,Monopoly,Risk,Uno and whatever you wish you can play thanks to the great dedicated community that keeps bringing tons of real board games into Tabletop Sim for free via the game's modding workshop.If you see Tabletop Simulator during a sale and have a bunch of online friends who are also interested in playing tabletop games then i suggest picking up the 4 pack when it's 50% off, it's totally frekin' worth it.

												I was gifted this game some time ago by a friend. It's pretty great for playing board games with people. There is a wide variety of board games, and you can make your own games, which is really cool.Since I liked it, I wanted to gift it to some other friends. Looking at the options, I saw the 4-pack, and thought, ""ooh, that's a good deal."" Except I can't buy the 4-pack, because I already own the game... wut? I want to spend money to buy more copies of this game, but I literally can't. My only option is to pay the 1-game cost, and manually gift it x number of times. That's infuriatingly stupid. Great game, but hard to share due to stupid store design.			"

Early Access Review
								We live in a crazy and busy world at times. But what's more apparent, is the fact that we're finding ways to be more connected with one another. We live in a digital age where a lot of the things we do have a tendancy to revolve around some electronic device. Board gaming has been one of those hobbies that strays away from such things and it is something I can appreciate. Despite the convenience and power we practically wield through even just a phone these days, it's nice to take a break from it to gather with friends and forget about such things for the sake of a more personal and human interaction.But, we realize that such gatherings may not always work out, or perhaps you just happen to not have anyone nearby that shares the passion of these games. Ironically, through the use of computers, such experiences can at least achieve second best. Tabletop Simulator allows one to share those experiences with others over great distances, but most importantly, it still keeps that personal feel to a degree that one may not necessarily regard as digital or artificial. The way it plays out with physics and actually seeing what others are doing are the hallmark of what helps make board gaming interesting and engaging. Sometimes because of it, we may accidently tip over a piece or put something where we didn't intend. As much as it seems like a minor inconvenience, such little details are all the same thing we may tend to find in real life scenarios. Obviously, I realize not everyone is on board with such things and there are other solutions out there that fit the bill for those seeking a refined, perfected, and orderly take on tabletop gaming.There's plenty to experience right out of the box with classic board games and cards. Also, the possibilities for bringing in custom content are grand, even given the limitations the program may have in the beginning. In time, we'll see more potential unlock from there. Imagination is the only limit I can see.Quite aptly as it is named, Tabletop Simulator seeks to simulate the tabletop gaming experience. I think what makes this program a great entry is that it doesn't try to perfect the board gaming scenario and make it efficient. Rather, to bring it as close as possible to those who cannot as easily do so, but keeping it as organic as possible. To me, that's where the real beauty shines through.			"

												If you like tabletop games then you HAVE to like this game. It simulates a tabletop and you have to follow the rules for the game, so house rules are accepted here. Also it's an easy way to get together with friends for a few games when you can't schedule a game night. They keep adding in features to make sure the game matches up with what you need to play diffent games, like blindfolding, teams, and even scripting so someone else can make things easier for you by writing that script. Hosting a server is built in, there is kick and ban options, the only thing this game is missing is an FOV slider, but you don't need one. the FOV is fine. I have nothing bad to say about this game.Pros: everythingCons: none			"

								I really like this game it lets me play tabletop games with people i dont know and it gives me the option to litterally play any tabletop game uploaded to the workshop i highly recommend this game if you have friends or not more people have picked up this game and there is always something running you can join and if there is something you want to play just host a room and have people join teach them the rules and off you go playing. This game works best with a microphone easy to explain and ask questions and be social. There is now also a tablet in game to allow you to access the internet can be used for rulebooks or just watching youtube with friends.ps lock your table flip option if you are host but you can always ctrl+z to put it back to how it was just incase you forget and someone wants to ruin the table.

								So far, the only gripe that I have with this game is that when you have active searches on stacks of cards and you absolutely need to undo something, the deck you are searching ends up clipping into the table, rendering the object intangible. I know not if this is an issue that can be fixed, though the preservation of decks when undoing actions would be really nice to see.In regards for suggesting features, I would like to see the implementation of books (perhaps imported from documents on your hard drive?), though one might question the feasibility of such an implementation because at the end of the day, Tabletop Simulator is really just a physics sandbox with a few features to help simulate card, tabletop, and/or board games and I understand if the pages of said books would prove far too taxing on the game's physics engine.Other than that one gripe and suggestion I have, I have yet to notice any jarring issues besides the one above so yes, I can safely recommend this game as it does what it does really frickin' well.

								Tabletop simulator is a game that has everything in the title. 1. I immediately went on the workshop for it and found Cards Against Humanity, with 4 core sets included and more coming in. 2. You can make anything. friend made hexagonal chess in a while, as it's a real chess variant that was famous in britain. 3. Played CAH with friend and lots of people joined, and we carried that into a 4 player chess game when it ended. 4. You can flip the table at any point. And then undo it. 5. It controls amazingly. you can zoom in to the cards, make them smaller/bigger, put them on the side, put them into your hand, flip them to hide them (it autohides if it's in your hand, only you can see it) 6. Went onto the workshop and found an exact recreation of an 80's boardgame for the first Legend Of Zelda game, complete with instruction booklet. 10/10 playing that tomorrow It supports a lot of people, and it has voice chat too.Edit: forgot to say you can make your own boards, card sets, and anything and rules for each variant are on the side, and you can just click a button to see them all We played uno 10/10			"

I wouldn't recommend this game if you plan on playing with strangers, but when you're with friends- it's just like the real thing. It's hilarious and fun, but the game runs on honesty since it's quite literally a simulator- allowing you to flip the table in a fit of rage, or steal another person's cards right out of their hand, or plop down a tablet on the table only to open up a web browser to bring up hardcore gay porn. I'd say Card Against Humanity is the most popular thing to play in this Simulator, but the game offers to many games you can play, even tabletop RPG crap.

								You might say ""Wow, board games! That's fun"" sarcastically, but this game is surprisingly engaging. You can play traditional card games as well as mod your own. People have modded many games including Munchkin, Cards Against Humanity and Monopoly in and you can too with basic photo editing skills. It is tons of fun to play with someone online and the D&D elements are still basic as hell but functional.Should you buy it? If you ever wanted to make your own board/card game and/or want to play some board games with someone over the internet... WITH PHYSICS. If you come here just for the D&D it's basic, but a good game can be managed, but I would hold up a bit with the D&D, but overall the best early access potentional out there.			"

								Allows you to play any board game or card game with people not in the same room.That's the pitch and it's a big one. However, the implementation knocks it out of the park.At it's core Table Simulator  is, well a table (duh) that you have complete control over. Whether you're manipulating cards, placing models,  rolling dice, control is easy intuitive and tight. This places Table Simulator as a prime candidate for modding.And it has flourished, players have imported every card and board game under the sun to be played with others online and all they had to do is import the art assets. Just like playing a physical version the players themselves manage the game mechanics, no additional scripting or AI is needed, only the players themselves are needed. "

Any game you can think of that can be played on a table probably has a mod for it for this game. You can also flip the table whenever you're playing with someone who is a damned cheater!It also looks nice on the vive. I like how you can adjust your size and shrink down and stand on the table surrounded by giant pieces. "

Tabletop Simulator is the best Internet Poker in the world, and would be worth it for that alone. But that's just barely scratching the surface of what this thing can do. What can it do? Everything man. It's like Garry's Mod for board games, only much easier to figure out. It is also a killer app in VR. This is the Holodeck. The Holodeck is real, and it's called Tabletop Simulator.(Editing to remove ""Early Access"" tag from this review. It was worth it back then and has only gotten better since)			"

								Okay, many people seem to have a bad impression about this software after buying it.But, me, for instance, I'm having a blast with this.Why?Easy; in the past me and some buddies used a program called ""Fantasy Grounds"". FG is a piece of software to play RPG sessions over the internet. Like the old skool pen and paper things.Tabletop Simulator let's you do the same, but in a nicer environment. Okay, things need to be ""modded/created"" to make it do the stuff you want, but any creative gamer should be up and running in no time. We've got our first Mythic game up & running within 8 hours. (Custom made card deck included)""Custom""-that's the word that makes this piece of software work or fail with you. It won't do anything for you; it just visualises things for you.

												This game is difficult to review because it's almost positive in a lot of ways. The best way I could put it is, Tabletop Simulator can be reviewed based on how much you enjoy other tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer, Secret Hitler, Cards Against Humanity and even Monopoly. Tabletop Simulator resembes a application specialized in mimicry. It's a faceless manupilator, it takes the form of any thing you want like a 6IV Ditto from Pokemon. It captures you attention, you purchase it thinking it's great until you realize, there's nothing to fancy about it. That is, until you realize you can literally pirate any game ever, import it into its file directory and it just takes of from there, it becomes your life now- for a little while. How did I get into MTG? Tabletop Simulator. How did I get into Warhammer lore? Tabletop Simulator. How did I get into Secret Hitler? Tabletop Simulator. I am telling you, as long there are trending tabletop games out there, Tabletop Simulator will always be something we cherish and something tabletop developers want to remand but really should be thanking for all that free advertisement!

												This game is great because the possibilities are endless. Just like the game title says, virtually anything can be played that requires top of a table. The mods is where it’s at. With more than 8,000 mods available you can find a lot of most popular board games, so you can play them for free instead of actually buying the physical copies. But to play this game, you definitely need some friends. If you don’t have any you could probably find people to play with on forums or within the game itself. Tabletop Simulator is an excellent time killer if you want to relax, chat, laugh, and have fun with your friends.			"

TL;DR Great to play board games with your online friends, without the extra hassle of setting up.Score✰82%✰  ProsThousands of Board GamesMassive replay valueConsControls are fiddlyNot all mods get updatedGameplay:Tabletop simulator is a dream come true for anyone who has ever loved engaging in board games, and just can't find the company to play them with. The core aspect relies on mod-based contributions, like Garry's Mod – except for tabletop games. There are thousands to choose from, ranging from things like RISK, Monopoly, Cards Against Humanity – to Chess and countless other party style board games. Some mods are intricately rendered with original skins for playing pieces, others are cleverly designed and planned out. There are original games, and a good chance to find any of the board games you've loved back at home or for those times where you're forced to put up with extra relatives.The initial premise, of course, is that you're presented with a table, faced against a randomly generated background (which incidently is also moddable.) Depending on if you choose a private or open game will decide if you play with your friends or with strangers. I would probably recommend playing with friends, as there is a high tendancy for random players to “flip” the table, which consequently ruins the progress of whatever is there.  The controls of Tabletop can take a little getting used to, since sometimes a wrong movement can accidentally sabotage things that you don't want sabotaged, or reveal your card hand. (Which then makes you flip the table because it was a really good hand.) This is probably my only real gripe – the chance of a game being killed before it hits the real action, and the fiddly controls. Also, perhaps, people who have excellant mods but don't update them, or don't include rules with their games. :(The gameplay offered is whatever mods you choose to download and whenever you find people who will want to sit around and play all those classic party games. I played Pictogram! Cards Against Humanity, Uno, Threeway Chess and WoW Guess Who! In one session with a few other friends. It's brilliant to be able to pick through the list and agree on games together without doing the packing and unpacking that goes beforehand with physical board games. Obviously there's something special about doing that as well, but when your friends live across the map, this is the perfect opportunity to get them together and tackle that desire to find people willing to sit around long enough for board game sessions.Want moar?

								This is one of the most simple and yet most ingenius ideas I have ever seen and I recommend it whole heartedly. If the idea of playing almost any board game you can think of over the internet appeals to you then pick this game up now.This game has allowed me to play games ive never gotten a chance to play before and I have a lot of fun just browsing the rooms and seeing whats being played. There are no rules, you just sit down and play. This game is also amazing as a simple tool for building your own games. Im a game designer and this game lets me make virtual versions of my games that I could potentally use for playtesting. I could playtest my games from the comfort of my own home. And with eventual Steam Workshop support this could be a truely amazing thing.There are a few kinks that need working out. The custom board and card features could be a little more user friendly but there totally usable and I imagine it will get worked out in later patches.As a hobbist or even a creative mind this game is a must buy. If the idea of bringing all your friends from around the world together for a game of Monopoly sounds awesome to you then pick this up.			"

												Where to begin, This game is just so much fun and I've only scratched the surface of this game. Of course there are your trolls that flipped tables but thats not a big deal and thats probably the worst part. I bought 3 copies of this game, for me and my two other friends and they both love it as well. We are currently in a monopoly session that has been lasting for hours. If you take a look at our board you'll see that it's completely vandilzed with drawings of just craziness and we still play seriously. Once you're in a serious game it'll be hard for you to leave.You won't get bored playing board games anymore!			"

								We played four-player Settlers of Catan last night.  No built-in rule handling or anything, just the board, dice, stacks of cards, whatever, and occasionally we did silly things like pick up whole stacks of cards or forget to collect resources or knock over the Robber token moving stuff around...and I have to say it was a hell of a lot more fun than if the game rules were implemented and automatic.  The whole thing felt very human.  Also we spent a lot of time drawing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the table waiting for our turns to come around.I don't think I'd want to try playing this with people I don't know well, especially internet pickup games, but for people I don't see often enough in person but still want to hang out with, definitely A++++++ would act like a dork again.  You definitely need to use the tutorial to have any idea what the controls are since they're not _that_ intuitive, but that only takes like five minutes and then you're good.  I mean there's only so many buttons you can press to move pieces around a table.Sometimes our voice chat transmission dropped out--on two different machines, so not a fluke of my hardware.  Not sure what's up with that.  Also I feel like it would be really tedious trying to set this up for RPG stuff, like setting up all the fancy walls etc.  But that's super tedious in the real world too, and you can set things up ahead of time and save the table to reload later, so I guess it works.Currently looking at importing a bunch of custom models and seeing how well that works.  We need to have a tea party!...I'm probably up for gaming with people I know any time.			"

												This software is always evolving and the way game developper/publishers can also use this software to promote/sell their games is making it a very interesting option.I consider this a tool for games; as it is supporting as many as you can think of as long as it plays on a table and by rounds. Kind-of.  I would say in solo to make/test your own or make table maps for your latest RPG levels it is great and really relaxing.  It comes with its own editor if you can come up with a stable image hosting site (yes unfortunately it seems it won't rely entirely to Steam workshop to host pictures but I can understand why if we want to develop later games and retain ownership).  It can also be played hot seat as many folks turn by turn in the same house. And finally, when microphone functions don't bug one way or another (but it can be resolved using Steam voice chat), do a whole 2 to 8 players game.  You can add to that a spectator and a GM if RPG is your thing!I can say, for nostalgic folks of the time we met all in the same house to have a real game night gathering without smart phone on the side, but empeched by being far away from familly and friends, or in hospital, or contagious etc...  It is great to break distance limitation and isolation.There are many great features I would like to review here but, I still continue to find them as I go and more features were added since I bought it and since I continue to play it.I would love to buy an additional 4 pack this Christmass, except... as I learned from Steam, once we have a copy the 4 pack must go to someonelse that you have to enthrust to regift the additional 3 copies to the rest of your friends you were hoping to make the gift.  It is truely the only minus part of it.Apart that, TTS is just what you will make out of it.  ^^  Make of it a good use!			"

Overall score: 8/10Did I get my money's worth?: Yes, outstanding valueRecommended input: Keyboard/mouseOne of the few games I would recommend to absolutely anyone, Tabletop Simulator executes its purpose better than I had first thought. Yes, it does exactly what you think it does, but it does it very well and is a great value for $19.99 or an even better value when on sale for $9.99. A one-time purchase for all board and card games ever made that you can finally play with the friends that you can't meet with in person made Tabletop Simulator an excellent buy for me and my friends. Having friends to play with is highly recommended, but the community is very friendly as well and there are always people hosting games online, the majority of which would be delighted to show you how to play their games. I'm happy that TTS has made it possible to play a lot of great games with a lot of great people that wouldn't be possible otherwise.			"

Any game you can think of that can be played on a table probably has a mod for it for this game. You can also flip the table whenever you're playing with someone who is a damned cheater!It also looks nice on the vive. I like how you can adjust your size and shrink down and stand on the table surrounded by giant pieces. "

								The idea behind this game is pretty fantastic.  You can scan in your favorite family game board, upload models of the pieces on the workshop, and it will be completely playable.  With the sandbox environment, anything you can do with your tabletop at home, you can potentially do here.Unfortunately, most of the games on the server list are locked, and the few that are open are not very well coordinated.I recommend this game as something to play with friends who also own it, but not as something that can be easily jump into without them.I've also had problems with the Linux version crashing when selecting from a menu consensually, but the game is early access after all.

But it captures the charm of actually sitting around a table playing a game, in a way that other online board games do not. Playing board games with friends is more about the social experience than about rock-solid competitive play IMO, so I'll take some clunkiness in exchange for that charm.The workshop integration is awesome and also helps makes the game.

The problem is that I don't have closets full of local friends.Everyone got married and or had kids and moved away or grew up, so my pool of potential friends to actually hang out with has been significantly reduced over recent years.This game allows my friends and I to get together and play some games again!A buddy of mine backed ""Kingdom Death: Monster"" as a kickstart project, and we've been waiting to try it out for a long time. Over the holidays, he came home to visit and we played. It was incredible. Now we can play it on TTS, too. Excellent.I have a crap-load of Heroscape sets, but it's a pain to get people together and deal with al the set-up/take-down time. This game makes it possible to play Heroscape again.

A lot of famous board games are available on the workshop including Monopoly and Scrabble. Oddly enough this game also includes a set of tools: A calculator, a tablet that has a built in web browser based on chrome, a digital clock, notes, even a music player that looks like a common MP3 player. These tools can be spawned in multiplayer by the host which can be very helpful.It's very well optimised, doesn't eat ram and doesn't overstress your graphics card. Me and my friend spent 7 hours playing board games when I got the game last night(12/22/2015). I gotta say, I'm impressed.			"

								An earlier review I wrote of this game was just a table-flipping emote, but honestly, that's not the whole game.Table-flipping, while entertaining, is overrated.The real fun of the game comes from actually playing the games, or trying to and failing miserably due to the fact that it's a physics-based tabletop game simulation. You'll often be fumbling around with specific parts due to the controls, or having your friends toss your stuff off the table randomly, or have the admin spawn unrelated parts which someone then swings around. These may seem like bad things. They are, but they make the game so much more enjoyable.At the same time, you can actually play serious games of things like chess, checkers, etc and have more fun than you would playing them in just about any other video game.Just get it. It's beautiful.			"

												Have you ever found yourself playing a video game and thinking to yourself, ""I wish I was playing a board game instead, like the good ol' days."" No?...oh. Me neither....Well I mean if it's on sale for $5 and you've got a few friends to play it while while you chat over Skype I guess. The reason why video games are nice is because they have rulesets programmed into them, with board games you have to do all of the busy work yourself: moving pieces to specific locations carefully, doing all of the calculations and math in your head, trying not to accidentally break the rules or mess something up, and resisting the urge to revert to your childhood instincts of wanting to flip the board over.Rating: Worth $5. Wait for a steam sale.			"

												Tabletop Simulator is the quintessential computer program for virtual computer rendering and computing of a real world tabletop. I find this the perfect piece of software for those who cannot afford a real tabletop. I don't just mean your kitchen countertop. No; this game, with its genius programming and opitmization in tandem with your graphics card, calculating hundreds of millions of different floating point operations quicker than you can blink an eye, has the ability to simulate just about any kind of tabletop.Mahogany? Of course.Fine Grain Oak? Even Call of Duty can do that. C'mon.Oil-Treated Maple with a Spruce Trim? You bet your buttons it can simulate that.Round Glass with an Angled Trim? Yessiree, even non wood materials!Reverse Grain Ash Wood with a Thin Veneer? Possiby, if you've got that new GTX 980 or whatever.This is perfect for those who cannot afford these fine pieces of art many may refer to as ""tabletops"" in the real world, or for those people who wish to expand thier horizons and experience different types of tabletops and don't have the extra money or space in real life to spend on such glorius tabletops.

												Simulator games have frequently been a bit of a joke to a lot of people.  There's a reason why Goat Simulator is so popular after all, so much so that certain devs are starting to look at the name ""Simulator"" with a bit of hesitation.  On the surface, a few people might think that Tabletop Simulator is a bit of a joke as well due to some of the things it offers(Flipping the table, zero gravity mode, etc), but what it offers honestly makes it worth the price and shows that it's more than just a silly little thing.Graphics:Tabletop Simulator's graphics, as a whole, are simple.  They look good enough that they'll get the job done but they won't be winning any awards.  The game allows you to import models and textures, so your mileage may vary, as well.  The backdrop for the ""rooms"" use a 4800x2400 HDRI Panorama shot, which means seams won't be an issue.  Overall, passable for what needs to be done.Gameplay:Tabletop Simulator is, as the name says, a game used to simulate various tabletops.  You start off with a decent number of standard board and card games, most pretty typical for what you'd see.  They're nice, but not exactly something I'd pay 20$ for flat out(But I'm a bit stingy), although the ability to play in a system that's not automated is nice.That leads into my next point:  The game isn't automated for the most part.  Everything is pretty customizable, and you can do various things, such as set hidden zones, flick items around, throw them around, flip tables, etc etc, with almost, if not all of it being able to be changed for your benefit(Of particular note is that you can disable the Table Flip option, thank god).  Leading to a pretty fun experience of just sitting around a table and BS'ing with friends.My one MAJOR issue with the gameplay is that you cannot peek at a card while it is face down outside of moving it into a hidden zone(Which is a bit cumbersome) or returning it to your hand(Which has its own fair share of complications)Workshop Support:This game allows you to create objects, texture them, and use them to make your own various games.  The system of doing so is relatively simple, as long as you know your way around models and textures, and it's pretty open, allowing you to import your own models into the game as well.  This is where the game shines, as almost any card or board game is possible with what is given to you.  The little figure can even be given animations for attacking and the like, to simulate an RPG.Along with that, there are various tools inserted in the game to help you accomplish this.  From counters, to tablets, to MP3 players, to calculators, and more.  And ALL of this can be uploaded and downloaded from the Steam Workshop, with download times being reduced due to the ability of Tabletop Simulator streaming image content from a hosted site(Which is both a blessing and a curse, to be honest).Honestly, all of it is really nice, my only problem with the modular ability of this game is that it seems like you can't plug your own MP3s into the MP3 player and you can't import custom tables, which is a shame, as that would have made RPGs truly perfect for this system.  Both of these can be worked around but it leads to an experience that is less than perfect.Overall:At the end of the day, Tabletop Simulator is a great game that allows people to just instantly pick up a deck or a pair of dice and play their favorite games.  It isn't perfect, and it won't ever be a true replacement for sitting around a table with your friends, but for those who are separated by long distances, this is a great alternative that will be sure to keep everyone happy.  It has a few issues but it's constantly being updated and I hope these will be sorted out in time.  Something else I want to note is that, while the DLC is a bit heavily priced, only one person needs to own it, which is..pretty much how it goes in real life, so I really appreciate and respect that.Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.

Kickstarted, Greenlit, and constantly updating with new features - both in game and for mod makers, meaning Workshop games will only get better.			"

								The Idea is weird, the physics are wonky but it’s an awesome game. You can select out of unlimited amount of games, from the Steam Workshop and play with your friends or with random people in public. I would recommend to play with friends because there are no rules in this Simulator. No one is going to stop someone from flipping the table or trying to cheat.Could you play all the games in real life with your friends? – Yes! But it’s not always possible to meet your friends to play a game of Monopoly. "

												Played Avalon Hill's Betrayal at House on Haunted Hill (distributed by Wizards of the Coast) with my LP buddies, and had a real blast. The only complexity with this comes from the actual game rules of whatever you decide to play - the simulator itself is simple, easy to use, and very straightforward with its presentation.The mod community is great, and it's thanks to all their hard work that we have as many games to play as we do!10/10, will play again.Anyone who has never played Betrayal at House on Haunted Hill before should really do so, as an aside. It's a wondrous game! As of this review, only the first edition is available from the steam workshop as a tabletop simulator mod, which unfortunately contains misprints and vague rules, and other minor errors. Hopefully modders will whip up the revised Second Edition soon!			"

								I seriously didn't think I'd love this game as much as I do. You'll think at first ""is the price really worth it for a virtual board game?"". You're not just buying a board game. You can play literally any board game you want with this and make up your own rules. Not only that but you can also play any card game at all be it Texas Hold 'Em or Magic the Gathering. You're even able to make and upload your own cards. Not only THAT but you're also able to build and manage your own dungeons and dragons roleplay session. The concept is there and they plan on expanding on it but as it stands it's probably the best virtual tabletop I've had the honor of playing Pathfinder on. It's such a simple idea but it's all the little things the developers are doing right that makes this game worth it.			"

												I was able to play Eels and Escalators. 100/10, would play Eels and Escalators again!In all seriousness, this game is great for people who don’t have any friends in real life. Even if you do have friends, the game is still pretty great!! Anyway, I went into this game expecting it to be pretty bad. Well, not really “bad”, more like stupid. I expected it to be pretty stupid. However, after some “experimentation” – we’ll say “experimentation”, but you can call it whatever you’d like – I’ve been having a lot of fun with it. I love board games, you see… Yeah, I know; who doesn’t love board games, right? Anyway, I like board games a lot and I like playing board games. My problem is, the group I usually play with doesn’t like the “complexity” of the games I usually tend to like playing. I use the term “complexity” loosely because my games aren’t very “complex”, but they are more complex than say something like Uno, Monopoly, or Skip-Bo. Anyway, I’m starting to digress. Point being, the game is great and you should play it if you’re either:A.	Into board gamesB.	Into board games and don’t have anybody to play withC.	Into board games and have anybody/somebody to play withD.	Into board games (again)… This game is just great!E.	Or if you just like good games.Oh, and don’t let the name Tabletop SIMULATOR fool you… This is by far the best SIMULATOR out there, or at least one of the best. "

												So this game allows you to simulate a game night with having the need to leave your computer..........which is AWESOME!I sat here for the first 30 minutes staring and throwing around a bottle of fake ranch dressing. So this game is great.Pros:- You don't need to leave your room- You can stare at ranch- Simulate board games- Lots of workshop items- Customizable games- Other stuff I forgotCons:- You need friendsI had a lot of trouble with that con.

												Update: The workshop isnt just good its perfect unless the web hosting for images go down but theres a fix for that. I've started getting well with the community and some people can even help youlearn a game which is pretty nice and helpfull. This game is good hopped on the tutorial and everything was going good until a blast of pieces came over and I had fun with them. The built in IRC chat is nice as it keeps you acconpained throught some things. Workshop content is really good sometimes and the dlc can get really pricey but they are good games the physics the tools all that stuff makes this realistic.Overall: 100% Its really fun if youre a board games lover person like me. The community is great and nice and i cant stop playing.			"

												This is by far the best experience you can get in tabletop gaming without actually being with your friends in the same place.With a whole bunch of mods you can play almost any tabletop game available, even ones out of print, and the best of all for people like me who like to collect (and play) these games, you can use TTS to try out if a particular one will be just for you and save the money if the game wasn't of your taste.

I truly love this game, and got to the 100 hour mark within my first week. If I had more free time, I'd already be up to 1,000 hours. Can't recommend it enough!If you decide to buy it, I'd recommend learning Secret Hitler, Eldritch Horror, Arkham Horror, & Sheriff of Nottingham; all fun games! I'd be willing to teach you any of them if you add/PM me, that's how invested I am in this game.9/10, would be perfect if some bugs were fixed, mainly in matchmaking and ping. The issues are usually resolved by entering/exiting the server, and port forwarding helps a tonne. Expect a lot from this game!			"

								I defenity must say that this is a wonderful game that is a high valued investment. Just imagine hours and hours of fun playing your favorite (and maybe even new) board games, but now you can enjoy them with people you know and love across the globe. The controlls and interface are pretty easy and stright forward to learn (About 5 minutes if you are handy with pc gaming already) and once thats taken care of the games play very well. I have already played multiple games of Uno, Sorry and Cards Againts humanity with my freinds and its actually very reminicent of doing it all in person, but my internet friends dont have to spend hunderends of dollars to fly over here to do it. Obviously it isn't perfect (The game is still in earliy acesss alpha) but even still, it is an awesome concept that is taking form very well. If you love board games, and have a lot of friends that you talk to over the internet that you wish to play them with, Table Top Simulator is a most defiente game for you and your buddies!			"

												Tabletop Simulator is a hilarious but realistic game which has you trying to create something resembling a game only for someone to come in and flick it all into pieces.There's multiple good things about this game:+ Lots of Servers to play on+ Singleplayer if you're feeling anti-social+ Too much workshop+ At least 2000 different games you can create with basic set+ Cards against Humanity will probably be on the list of servers+ Graphics are niceBut also a few cons:- The troll players who come in to destroy your game- Costs more than in the Beta (it cost £11.99 before)- Poker table angles are a bit brokenHowever, because I got this game in the Beta I got it for £11.99.There's also a setting for blocking access to everything, stopping those naughty trolls.So, overall, this game is one to play if you want tableflipping madne- I, um, mean, fun!9.4/10			"

Gameplay - This game allows you to pretty much play ANY tabletop game (as long as the community has made it), and if it isn't created you can make custom decks and boards to make your own (or an already made game).Community - The community on this game are mostly nice, I have entered a few games not knowing a single thing about the game I joined and so far all of them have explained to me how to play it (even the VERY complicated games), there isn't many bad things about the community, but every now and then you get players who join tables who try and ruin other players experiences, but they can get banned from that table by the host and any damage can be undone, so no harm done.Final - I highly suggest this game if you enjoy playing any sort of tabletop game, you can play it with your friends or with public players online, eventhough it's alpha, I dont see any major problems with the game at the moment so it is worth buying.

								A really great concept with fantastic mod tools (recreate your favorite board game!) and a realy solid hook: play tabletop games with your friends who are far away.Unfortunately, actually playing the games is akin to playing games with just your elbows. Games with precise movements become nightmarishly tedious, and even deckbuilder card games become a bit of a chore the longer the games progress. My friends often refuse to play some of our favorite complex games just because of how unwieldy the physics and controls are.Yes, this game is a huge step in the right direction of online board games.Yes, this game will allow you to create/test/play your own games, as well as many retail games.No, this will not substitute playing games in person with your friends- at least not without advancements in input tech.Best with simple, social games that don't require too much object handling.Recommended only for board game geeks. (and friends of board game geeks) "

												First and foremost, this is a sandbox game. The game does not enforce any game rules so you are free to do what you like. What makes this game great is the sheer amount of games users have created or imported into the steam workshop. The community is also pretty friendly and open to teaching others how to play board games. The game supports ingame voice chat which really helps in explaining the rules and gameplay.			"

												This game is a base for tabletop games, don't get this game unless your friends will get it too. I mainly use this game for running my Dungeons and Dragons campaigns which this is pretty well suited to, there is a variety of  tilesets and models on the workshop for the casual user and we can actually have a 3d representation of everyone's characters without having to pay 20 bucks or so for actual plastic models. In short, it's a good tool for D&D, card games, Warhammer 40k (pretty much every army has it's models uploaded so no 3000 dollar models for your army) but remember it is a tool not a game.			"

												A tabletop physics engine allowing more control for an organized social event than tools for griefers; anyone joining a game can slap the cards out of your hand, but the host can almost instantly ban, and reverse the damage done by rewinding time. Everything works really intuitively, objects snap and cascade by physically stacking, like chips and cards. Dice rolls with satisfying thuds like 45 grams of the finest plastic four sided cube on 19th century rosewood table. And if you highlight multiple dice, it tallies the total for you.All game states can be saved and loaded, by any of the 8 players joined, with permissions allowed by the host ofcourse. With integrated voice chat, turn indicators, handzones and private zones for hiding your hand/dice, it brings a lot of games to the table. Also, all types of objects can be customized with its own models, physics, and textures.The game grants you objects like cards, poker chips, coins, dice (d3, d4, d6, d20, etc.,) and figurines (chess/d&d). Objects snap and cascade by physically stacking, like chips and cards. You can shuffle cards by just pressing R, animation takes less than a second and is heard by all players. Then you can deal to everyone's hand just by clicking a button. Where the host controls the permissions of how every player interacts with the environment with a dropdown checklist. With a maximum of 8 players, it is really multiplayer tabletop games.Also, there’s a tablet simulator that links to google and youtube, that can be seen by every player on the table. Movie/music night?The advance features, like tape measurements, allows accuracy POV/LOS action figure games, like Warhammer 40k to be simulated perfectly. All you need is a brain for storing the codex rules, and the figurines available on the mod page. You measure 6” for walking infantry, toss a grenade and borrow the 3” blast marker available on the workshop page. When you shoot, you just lower your camera onto the table, and get an accurate Line of Sight from the space marine’s point of view.Game's good.			"

It is absolutely phenomenal how far you think you can stretch it, and just when you think you've seen the end of the horizon, you discover more you are capable of creating. This has allowed me to play Dungeons & Dragons with my friends from across the United States without having the burden of being in one house. We can play from the comfort of our own homes in Oregon, California, Nevada, etc. Not only that, but the tools this game gives you allows you to create your own game aside from the classics. This is well worth the price!			"

Product received for free
												Let me tell you about my experience with Tabletop Simulator (or TTS for short).. I managed to convince three of my buddies to get the game because it was on sale, They were skeptical, but after I showed them the Steam Workshop support, they were feeling pretty open about the idea. We download the mod for Smash Up and get in a match to start playing, we create our decks and begin the game. Everything was good until one of my buddies, Zach, found out there was a ""Flick"" option, and proceeded to flick all the cards, point counters, etc. Then another one of my friends, Jason, downloaded a mod and changed the background to a 3D Anime Cafe. Then I followed by making the greatest discovery of my life, I spawned a tablet... It was like discovering the internet all over again, we did everything, played flash games, watch YouTube, porn, and we even loaded an old YouTube video I made when i was 8. We were entertained for hours, and it was complete anarchy, There's a seemingly endless amount of activites to take part in while playing TTS, and for $20 ($10 if you get it during the Summer Steam Sale), I can easily say that it is definitely worth it, just think of all the money you'll save from paying for expensive board games!!4/20 - Too Much Water			"

Also, it is kinda like a kickstarter of ideas for any original games you create on it, as the comunity is very polite and helpful. Plus, steam workshop support!Edit: Will make better eventually, but for now, I'm just getting a badge.			"

												This game is a must own in my opinion, especially for people with friends who are displaced all over the world like me. You can play anything you want whenever you want and the list of games on it are going to keep growing for a long time to come. Yes, I understand that the game isn't going to be getting any prettier and there is any issue with latency. But this game does something that nothing out in the market can even replicate and I'm willing to put up with its flaws since the sheer amount of things you can do in it are massive.If you want to read a more detailed review of the game you can find it here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.ae/2016/01/tabletop-simulator.html.

												Tabletop Simulator is, at its most basic, a physics engine that just happens to include a lot of game objects out-of-the box.However, the ability to modify it and easily load games from the Steam Workshop (and only require them of the host, not all players) makes this extremely versatile. I use it to play the X-wing miniatures game with friends from all over the globe, or even from down the street, when we're both feeling lazy. I use it so my girlfriend and I can test out board games we wanna buy before actually getting them as physical copies. I play random games like Cards Against Humanity or Secret Hitler with random players from around the world.I bought it on sale for about 7.50€. But I would feel like it's a good price even at the full €20. So whenever it's on sale - get it!			"

								A physics-based sandbox where you manipulate objects  to your liking. Play Poker, Backgammon, Checkers, Chess, and a handful of other games by default! Download mods for the game to play your favorite card and board games including: Pokemon Trading Card Game, Cards Against Humanity, Risk, Munchkin, Clue, etc.This game is best when played with friends, but is still fun when playing with strangers due to the built-in voice communication which actually sounds pretty good.Grow and shrink objects to your heart's content, knock everything over with a giant hydra that takes up the whole table! Lost a hand at Texas Hold Em'? Flip the table. Win a hand at Texas Hold Em'? Flip the table. Someone flip the table? Flip the table. Trolling in this game is as fun as playing the actual game itself. The possibilities are endless with the new Steam Workshop integration. There will be even more games added, and a bunch of awesome looking objects to be released in time!I highly recommend this game.			"

												Simulator games have frequently been a bit of a joke to a lot of people.  There's a reason why Goat Simulator is so popular after all, so much so that certain devs are starting to look at the name ""Simulator"" with a bit of hesitation.  On the surface, a few people might think that Tabletop Simulator is a bit of a joke as well due to some of the things it offers(Flipping the table, zero gravity mode, etc), but what it offers honestly makes it worth the price and shows that it's more than just a silly little thing.Graphics:Tabletop Simulator's graphics, as a whole, are simple.  They look good enough that they'll get the job done but they won't be winning any awards.  The game allows you to import models and textures, so your mileage may vary, as well.  The backdrop for the ""rooms"" use a 4800x2400 HDRI Panorama shot, which means seams won't be an issue.  Overall, passable for what needs to be done.Gameplay:Tabletop Simulator is, as the name says, a game used to simulate various tabletops.  You start off with a decent number of standard board and card games, most pretty typical for what you'd see.  They're nice, but not exactly something I'd pay 20$ for flat out(But I'm a bit stingy), although the ability to play in a system that's not automated is nice.That leads into my next point:  The game isn't automated for the most part.  Everything is pretty customizable, and you can do various things, such as set hidden zones, flick items around, throw them around, flip tables, etc etc, with almost, if not all of it being able to be changed for your benefit(Of particular note is that you can disable the Table Flip option, thank god).  Leading to a pretty fun experience of just sitting around a table and BS'ing with friends.My one MAJOR issue with the gameplay is that you cannot peek at a card while it is face down outside of moving it into a hidden zone(Which is a bit cumbersome) or returning it to your hand(Which has its own fair share of complications)Workshop Support:This game allows you to create objects, texture them, and use them to make your own various games.  The system of doing so is relatively simple, as long as you know your way around models and textures, and it's pretty open, allowing you to import your own models into the game as well.  This is where the game shines, as almost any card or board game is possible with what is given to you.  The little figure can even be given animations for attacking and the like, to simulate an RPG.Along with that, there are various tools inserted in the game to help you accomplish this.  From counters, to tablets, to MP3 players, to calculators, and more.  And ALL of this can be uploaded and downloaded from the Steam Workshop, with download times being reduced due to the ability of Tabletop Simulator streaming image content from a hosted site(Which is both a blessing and a curse, to be honest).Honestly, all of it is really nice, my only problem with the modular ability of this game is that it seems like you can't plug your own MP3s into the MP3 player and you can't import custom tables, which is a shame, as that would have made RPGs truly perfect for this system.  Both of these can be worked around but it leads to an experience that is less than perfect.Overall:At the end of the day, Tabletop Simulator is a great game that allows people to just instantly pick up a deck or a pair of dice and play their favorite games.  It isn't perfect, and it won't ever be a true replacement for sitting around a table with your friends, but for those who are separated by long distances, this is a great alternative that will be sure to keep everyone happy.  It has a few issues but it's constantly being updated and I hope these will be sorted out in time.  Something else I want to note is that, while the DLC is a bit heavily priced, only one person needs to own it, which is..pretty much how it goes in real life, so I really appreciate and respect that.Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.

												First and foremost, this is a sandbox game. The game does not enforce any game rules so you are free to do what you like. What makes this game great is the sheer amount of games users have created or imported into the steam workshop. The community is also pretty friendly and open to teaching others how to play board games. The game supports ingame voice chat which really helps in explaining the rules and gameplay.			"

												This game is a base for tabletop games, don't get this game unless your friends will get it too. I mainly use this game for running my Dungeons and Dragons campaigns which this is pretty well suited to, there is a variety of  tilesets and models on the workshop for the casual user and we can actually have a 3d representation of everyone's characters without having to pay 20 bucks or so for actual plastic models. In short, it's a good tool for D&D, card games, Warhammer 40k (pretty much every army has it's models uploaded so no 3000 dollar models for your army) but remember it is a tool not a game.			"

												A tabletop physics engine allowing more control for an organized social event than tools for griefers; anyone joining a game can slap the cards out of your hand, but the host can almost instantly ban, and reverse the damage done by rewinding time. Everything works really intuitively, objects snap and cascade by physically stacking, like chips and cards. Dice rolls with satisfying thuds like 45 grams of the finest plastic four sided cube on 19th century rosewood table. And if you highlight multiple dice, it tallies the total for you.All game states can be saved and loaded, by any of the 8 players joined, with permissions allowed by the host ofcourse. With integrated voice chat, turn indicators, handzones and private zones for hiding your hand/dice, it brings a lot of games to the table. Also, all types of objects can be customized with its own models, physics, and textures.The game grants you objects like cards, poker chips, coins, dice (d3, d4, d6, d20, etc.,) and figurines (chess/d&d). Objects snap and cascade by physically stacking, like chips and cards. You can shuffle cards by just pressing R, animation takes less than a second and is heard by all players. Then you can deal to everyone's hand just by clicking a button. Where the host controls the permissions of how every player interacts with the environment with a dropdown checklist. With a maximum of 8 players, it is really multiplayer tabletop games.Also, there’s a tablet simulator that links to google and youtube, that can be seen by every player on the table. Movie/music night?The advance features, like tape measurements, allows accuracy POV/LOS action figure games, like Warhammer 40k to be simulated perfectly. All you need is a brain for storing the codex rules, and the figurines available on the mod page. You measure 6” for walking infantry, toss a grenade and borrow the 3” blast marker available on the workshop page. When you shoot, you just lower your camera onto the table, and get an accurate Line of Sight from the space marine’s point of view.Game's good.			"

This game. Oh, this game.Reasons why this is a game you NEED to care about: Multi-Player. Click-and-host server system, play with friends in minutes! Workshop. Steam Workshop integration already? Hell yea. Customization. Make custom cards, models, table images, set pieces - on the go! Physics. You know what? Flip a table. Do it. (Oh, and make dominoes, card-castles...) Camera. Orbiting a chess nerd flipping a table after a check-mate... yes.So much more, just get this. It's early access with all of this? Oh my, I am exited. Please, support these guys.Just my 2 cents. -Pj			"

												Played Avalon Hill's Betrayal at House on Haunted Hill (distributed by Wizards of the Coast) with my LP buddies, and had a real blast. The only complexity with this comes from the actual game rules of whatever you decide to play - the simulator itself is simple, easy to use, and very straightforward with its presentation.The mod community is great, and it's thanks to all their hard work that we have as many games to play as we do!10/10, will play again.Anyone who has never played Betrayal at House on Haunted Hill before should really do so, as an aside. It's a wondrous game! As of this review, only the first edition is available from the steam workshop as a tabletop simulator mod, which unfortunately contains misprints and vague rules, and other minor errors. Hopefully modders will whip up the revised Second Edition soon!			"

								The Idea is weird, the physics are wonky but it’s an awesome game. You can select out of unlimited amount of games, from the Steam Workshop and play with your friends or with random people in public. I would recommend to play with friends because there are no rules in this Simulator. No one is going to stop someone from flipping the table or trying to cheat.Could you play all the games in real life with your friends? – Yes! But it’s not always possible to meet your friends to play a game of Monopoly. "

												Totally fantastic. I wish more than anything I had something like this growing up. As an only child growing up with a single parent, there was never really anyone to play board games with. I also never really hung out with anyone who was into board games or table top games despite how much I loved them. Even now, I don't have a lot of local friends outside of my husband who are down to set up a game of DnD or Monopoly and play into the wee hours of the night. This has opened up so many opportunities to play the games I never got to when I was younger, as well as a chance to play the games I had to try to play alone. Thanks so much for this. Now I just have to convince all of my friends both near and far to put this simulator on their computers so we can all hang out and play games when we don't have to time or money to meet up in person!10/10 PLEASE GET THIS SIMULATOR			"

												Great Simulator! Missing some sort of paper tracking mod or feature for character sheets. You have an index card...but not enough space to keep any additional info. I give it 3.5 stars in its current state for rpgs..but would happily give it 5 if they would add virtual paper.Update: 3/20/16 - I wanted to also mention as of right now no PDF support (it did at one time). You have to save a pic of a character sheet upload it to imgur. Get the link to the pic. Bring in an additioanl table in game. Paste the image link to the table. This is the only proper way to see a character sheet. The character sheet can not be edited or modified. You will have to bring in a new sheet using a new image with all the above steps.Update: 3/24/16 As of this date I was able to use PDF's on a tablet. We are moving in the right direction. Now all we need is a sheet of paper (e.g character sheet) for tracking purposes. 4 Stars at the time of this review....Come on 5 stars!			"

												You don't need a long drawn out review to be convinced about this. If you like board games of any kind, and can put up with a small learning curve for clunky mouse controls, this game opens up an entirely new virtual board game experience for an incredible value/$. TL;DR, I bought a copy, then bought 4 more for friends.I watched the video for the game through my queue, I wasn't impressed. I assumed it was chess, checkers, some weird figurines, etc. Then I realized that it is really a gateway, or a games platform of it's own. When you get Tabletop Simulator, you are essentially buying access to every board game ever made, through the workshop, posted by other people who have a passion for those games. This includes games you've probably never heard of; Star Realms, Monopoly, Risk, Pandemic, 7 Wonders, Dominions, Citadels, Scythe, Carcassone, Life, and hundreds more.When I started getting into the new generation of board games with my friends, I picked up Tabletop Simulator on a recommendation. My mind was blown.The extra tools make playing better, click a button to shufle a deck, deal cards, roll dice dispense money and more. There are virtual tablets to google rules for games without leaving tabletop simulator, equal parts novel and suprisingly useful.			"

								The Good:  I've only mucked about on this for about 10 minutes so far, and yes, this IS an Early Access game, but so far, I see this as a WONDERFUL tool for table top gamers (board games, RPG's, miniatures, etc).  From what I've seen on the Forums, the Devs are going to update content (a tape measure is one of the ones they've talked about...for miniature gaming), so this is going to add even more variation to the creation and game play.  I love the physics involved in the game, things like picking up and moving the pieces, shuffling cards, rolling dice, and even flipping the table (yes...that flipping the table).The Bad:  It's Early Access...it's effectively a beta...so right now, you pretty much have the basic stuff in the game.  There is a thread on the Forums regarding the use of copyrighted material...this can hamper some of the more popular ""games"" being reproduced.The Ugly:  The ""game room"" is...well...empty...there's the table...but no walls, no floor...just the table (this is something that is added later).That's really it...I enjoy the games so far, I hope that more is added in and that copyright holders allow for their products to be added to the Steam Workshop (when that's added).

With great VR support and handy controlls, this is the closest you can get to really having your friends over.And if your lacking friends in your proximity, this game brings them back together, a fair offer for a fair price.

								I bought the game thinking it was only just about playing solitaire or chess and other games, but after seeing the amount of content the community workshop has been putting into the game, it changes my view over it entirely. If you want to play D&D, there is a mod for it, if you like any kind of table top game especially rpg's this game is for you. The only negative I can say about it is there is not a whole lot of unlocked servers for people to join and play a game you want to play. Sometimes you may find one but playing the game you wanted would require kissing the host's♥♥♥♥♥and waiting for the end of his current game of what ever he fancied when he started his lobby. However, this game is still easily worth the $15 I have paid for it.			"

								After trying out a bit of the game I must say this is a really awesome ""simulator"". The lawlessness of it really makes it feel like you're playing a game with your friends, and really the entire playthrough of each game is entirely dependant on the integrity and self control of the party members. I don't really have too many complaints so far, and I also know this is still in beta however... I feel that this game needs a system that allows for more orginized play throughs. The only other things that I'd like to be changed/added would be the following.       This game really shouldn't market itself as a lawless game where you can just rage whenever, that's just the nonsense-type ""fun"" that is very temporary and well... it makes games boring quickly. (Especially in this ""simulator"" genre). In terms of the game and what it should provide, I do not know the intentions of the developers but these games are the real basic classics, they're very simple games and as much as I love them, i'd like to see some more elaborate-modern type games, heck even monoploy would be nice to see. I don't care if it's made up or based on another board game, I just want more of a variety with much more replayability then these classics. That's really what I feel this game needs. Lastly the game should have a GUI system, one to enhance the playability of game modes, be it one that issues money to players to add gambling, or something that could allow for further development of the games. That'd be great. Overall what I enjoy the most within this game is it's freedom, it allows for an intimacy and looseness that simulates real life board games with family and friends. It's physics are great. (I would only fix the perspective of the table to it's background (Which isn't really a big deal and has little to do with the physics). I just see that this game really has a lots of amazing potential. I know that this game is still in early access but i'd like for the developers to strongly consider at least some of these things. Thanks for reading through my ""review"" or rather rambling thoughts, I hope some of these suggestions come to the attention of the developers.			"

												I think I really underestimated how good this game could be before I bought it. I honestly thought it was just some kind of joke after seeing all the table flipping videos and thought it would just be a physics simulator. The possibilites in this game are quite literally endless. I\'ve already played Tokaido, Chinese Checkers, Blackjack and Snakes and Ladders. This is a really good simulator because it\'s actually so much like real life and you don\'t have to spend loads of money on the real thing. Even the drawing mechanics make this enjoyable alone. You can play pen & paper games like Tic Tac Toe, Hangman or Dots and Boxes.I thought I might not have enjoyed this game prior to buying it because a lot of videos suggested that you need friends for it to work but playing on random servers worked the best for me as this game has one of the best communities I\'ve ever seen.9.5/10			"

								This is as close as you get to playing board games with others irl. The current custom game modes are automatically shown to anyone who joins the server so you don't even need to download any mods to play online (unless you want to host a certain game mode not in game already).The future holds custom 3d model support (for game pieces and the like,) more tabletop rpg support, and more game modes. So far the game is already 10/10 in my eyes, so it can only get better!Also did I mention flipping tables?NOW with tablets, and even more features! Custom models, custom game pieces...

												This is a fantastic game, it lets you do whatever you want, play classic board/card games, create new ones, whatever. I have discovered a few games through this that I either have purchased or plan to purchase the actual real life games. so its a great way to find board/card games too. overal this game is pretty solid. it has a great tutorial, its easy to learn and pickup, it gives good admin controlls, there dont seem to be any bugs or lag issues, I recommend freinds to play with you (which should be apparent) because its just not fun to play board games alone. however for those of you without freinds theres an active community of players online that you can just hop in a game with.

												Amazing game that is well worth the money! Playing board games on Tabletop Simulator doesn't feel as shallow as it would when you play other online board games. I like that you have to move and keep track of everything yourself. This is a blast to play with a group of people! With tons of content available in the workshop, I can see myself playing this for a very long time. It is even easy to recreate games of your choosing since the included deck editor basically does the work for you. If you love board games, I highly recommend.No jump scares but many table flips so make sure to lock down the table to keep everyone on their best behavior.			"

												It's a card game or what we think it is. It's more of a physics sandbox game where you can spawn regular cards or board games and equipment or you can just play by the rules before someone can flip the table out of rage! Including Steam workshop for additional games and fun content to spawn and play.So basicly, my first time playing this game was with a friend of mine to show me the ropes and random workshop items. Next time I launch the game, I was looking for a Cards Against Humanity server, and I did. Played a couple of rounds and swap games as a group. Next thing you know, tablets and porn. I came back to the server and 2 of my new friends were spawning in tablets and started to looking up porn. How am I suppose to explain that? ""I'm masterbating with my friends?""But great game, I highly recommend it. Vote 10/10 for Jackie Chan fighting ninjas while handling a homemade come stained Star Trek uniform (CAH).			"

The variety of the mods cover pretty much every category, from Classics like Go, Mastermind or Ticket to Ride to hidden gems, from Warhammer Fantasy/40.000 or Kings of War to Flames of War and Heroscape, from Betrayal at the house to Dead of Winter, from very complex wargames (GMT and Coin series) to X-Wing and so on.

It does this fairly well, and if you have a group of nerdy friends that are all willing to learn to use an initially awkward interface you can have fun with it.  If you don't, there are public rooms available for games.    This game is quite useful if you design your own board games and are looking for a way to test your prototypes with people online.  There are a few communities of people that trade playtesting on this service.			"

												although theres only a few games that dont work as they should like RC racing around the table, this game is great for people with friends across the country and being drunk while playing this only makes it better which is what me and my friends do due to the fact that the controls are made to seem like youre actually picking up monopoly pieces, so if youre playing chess, you have to pickup individual pieces as if youre there. This game even has board games you probably never even heard of and introduces you to some surprisingly fun board games and with the access of steam workshop the library of games is endless. It might take some practice to get use to the controls but once you play a few games youll get the hang of it. 10/10 for a simulator game			"

												You'll primarily want to be playing things that have at most one or two simple tasks for a player to accomplish at a time. It can get finicky with too many pieces or decks to place things on. Make sure to have a decent mic, it makes a huge load of a difference in ease of play. Overall, if you're careful with game selection, you can hammer out most titles in perhaps 125% of the time they take in real life, which isn't too shabby. It handles Cosmic Encounter, the greatest game, admirably - which alone is enough to give it the thumbs up.			"

												First and foremost this is a simulator of a table top, there is no AI, can you play solo yes and many of the board games allow for solo play especially co-op games.  In most cases you need to know the rules, the games often don't have rules with them. Most cases just go download a PDF of the rules, they are out there  on the internet somewhere, and in some cases the mod developers will put the link in the game.  If you are expecting the game to do the work for you, not going to happen, you are in control, if you are lucky someone has scripted a few things but for the most part it is like walking up to the table, setting up the game to some degree and playing.  I love the coop games, and have played a couple that I own using this simulator and I am quite pleased with the way it works.  They are great for practice runs of games as you try to learn the rules.  So far I have tried Pandemic: Cthulhu version, Arkahm Horror the Card Game, One Deck Dungeon, and just set up Arkham Horror the Core game.  IF you like the games, then you are encourage to go out and buy a physical copy of the game, in some cases not as easy as it sounds.  Final Fantasy, has a lot of games that are waiting to be shipped, reprinted and sadly in some cases are no longer in print.  But Board Game Geek market can be your friend.  I do admit that I find the interface clunky at times, as you have to often bring up cards to see them (Easy using Alt).  But heck with my eye sight I have to bring cards up to read them anyway, so as stated you get a table top feel for the games.  Like in real life, things fall over,  you can even flip the who board if you want.  Thankfully it has a recall last using a back arrow, then it just sets up from the last position of the game.9/10 I think on this one.  Play Games here, buy games and support your local game store.  The interface also has built in hosting and I believe chat too.  So you can host a game with your friends.			"

												Tabletop Simulator allows me to easily share a hobby of mine with remote, online friends that was previously difficult if not impossible.It's wonky and imperfect, but it more than makes up for it in flexibility. The amount of mods available is staggering - and you can always create your own. If you have any interest in making a tabletop game, this is an amazing playtesting tool as well.			"

												Basically you get what's in the title. You can have a table online with other people, and play games together.  Pretty straightfoward, and well-implemented it seems.Of course the main focus of this is gaming.  It comes with several traditional games (chess, poker, so on...and to my delight, Go), and there are optional DLC games, that honestly did not interest me one bit.  But there is Steam Workshop and mod sites which let you play actual games, and more.  Since I have had this, I've gotten to play some new games I've never played before, and I discovered some old favorites on the workshop.  For something like D&D, though, it can take some work.  I haven't tried to run or join a game with it, but I think it would not be too much trouble to import maps.  It can also do not-so-game stuff, if you can find the tools (or figure out how to make your own).  Anything you could do around a table, more or less.  I set it up to do tarot readings, and that seems to work nicely.  The biggest complaint I hear is that it's expensive.  That's really up to the buyer, and what you expect to get out of it.  I would think it's worth it, but for RPGs there are other alternatives that don't cost $20.			"

												I was extremely skeptical when I saw this game. It looked clunky and weird and it was hard to visualize actually utilizing it for anything. Now that I have given it a go, I am nothing but impressed with this. TTS allows avid board game players to play in a REALLY convenient way. You just load up whatever board game you want to play (and there are TONS of mods for pretty much any board game, like how can this even be legal?!), invite your friends to the game, and go. You can even save games and come back to them later, which is super useful for extremely long and involved games. If you are into board games, I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												Cool application, more of a tool than a game, to simulate playing tabletop games with friends.You can tell that it started as a non-serious attempt of a game (just simulate playing chess and checkers on a virtual table with gravity and physics and be able to flip the table, ha-ha), but as it became more and more popular, the developers started shaping it up into a really feature-complete program.Now the game includes almost everything you need (besides friends) to enjoy boardgames, role-playing, or just simulate sitting on a table with another person watching youtube videos and hanging around.I recommend it because it is the best at what it does, and fills a niche that was vacant for a long time. The developers are also very active and keep on adding features and fixing bugs. However I would point out some negatives:-The game has a form of DRM, even though the kickstarter campaign promised it to be DRM-free. Personally I would like to have a tool like this available forever to play with my friends, instead of depending on developer-run servers.-Since it is in constant evolution, updates to the game sometimes break or remove previous features that worked OK. The developers have stated that they do not plan to support older versions, and in fact do not offer them for download.-The game is advertised as cross-platform, but mac and linux versions have lower priority for bug fixing, from what I've seen.Even with these negatives, there are no alternatives to this game with the same functionality, so get it if you need it.I didn't mention VR because I don't own the hardware, but that is another point in favor of this game for some of you.

												Time for a bunch of rambling thoughts in no particular order:As a friend of mine described it, this is ""gMod but for board games"". The Lua update has only made this even more apt. If there's a game you've ever played (or wanted to play), it's in here. The #1 board game product for people with a severe lack of IRL friends, or non-standard work schedules. The board game world is so much larger than Monopoly and Risk, and that's not even mentioning the rabbit hole that is Tabletop RPG's. A great way to make (and occasionally break) friendships. All the fun of table flipping with none of the mess. Digital setup and aids for games that are normally clunky irl and easy saves/loading for games you'd normally devote an entire day to, but can now play in 2 hour slices. No cats jumping on the table. Realistic dice that are fun to roll. Rapid prototyping for any board game you might have in your head. Cheap and easily accessible digital versions of a variety of party games, both official versions and unofficial. Runs smoothly on a potato, but can take advantage of powerful systems too (did I mention VR?). Play games with irl mates that have moved away, no longer does physical separation mean board game night (or RPG night) is over. And more.Buy it.			"

												A must-have for every board game enthusiast.You can play with friends that are far away - or join a completely random party game with some strangers (Secret Hitler is just great, look for servers!). You can learn rules for your new games in a single player mode before getting them on a table. You can try out something from your BoardGameGeek wishlist before buying it, there are tons of awesome games in the Workshop (Star Wars Series, Tragedy Looper, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Lewis & Clark, Android Netrunner - these are just some of my favorites). You can make your own epic DnD campaigns. You can flip the table in a fit of rage and watch millions of pieces falling into the abyss. The possibilities are infinite!			"

												This is a great game - though admittedly I may love for an unusual reason. Creating scripts and mods for it has made this one of my most played games as its such great pratical practice for programming and coding. As a comp Sci student sometimes the codes we write in classes are pretty useless beyond teaching us basic coding premises but here I can make codes and scripts that are usable and has really helped me learn how users interact with things and take that into account and build redundancies for my redundancies. Plus board games are always fun and when you don't have enough IRL friends this is a great substitute.			"

												Great idea. Allows you to play classic card games like Magic, or Lord of the Rings trading card game among hundreds of other board games and things. Physics in game make it feel good to throw cards around and stuff and when you lose you can flip the table over so everything goes flying..... but you can go back so it doesn't ruin people's lives either.

But we have our friend here name ""Life"" that knows how to ruin your fun rather quick. Your friends have confusing schedules, dealing with their family and friends, there's no room for there place to hold this much fun on one table. Well guess what Life, the internet has defeated you once more.Thanks to the Steam Workshop, there can be countless games that does involve a table but you can stay right where you are. Even if we do have to pay for such mods, it won't be as bad cause this game is going to keep growing with games and updates. And for $15, this is possibly the best thing you can buy and save hundreds on your cash and waste hundreds of of your life hours to something useful!UPDATE: This game is still recieving updates and it's going in a good way too.

												100/10 IGNThe first thing I would like to say is that I have over one thousand hours on this game. Each, and every single hour was played. Not a single time did I start the game and just leave it on. That is a small way to sum up how much I truly adore this game. If you dislike tabletop games, then this is not for you. Do not buy this game just to flip tables or dismantle other people's games, because theres an easy banning system which can stop people within seconds. You're not even permenantly disrupting the game, because of the rewind feature. If you actually enjoy tabletop games, whether it's Cards Against Humanity, RPG's, or King of New York, then this is for you. It takes a bit to get used to all the controls, but after your first hour or so you'll have everything down if you went through the tutorial. This game is limitless in it's possabilities. I could litterally play almost any game, even if it's not actually a board game. Someone made a 100% Orange Juice replica in this, which is a great video game. The overall community is great, and eventually you will make friends from this game whether you like it or not. You'll come across people who enjoy the same games as you, and that's something I've yet to experience from any other game. Something that can sit me down and allow me to find someone with similar interests.			"

												Tabletop Simulator (TTS) is exactly what it sounds like. It is a program that allows you to play pretty much any ""analogue"" game that you can think of, on the computer. While it will never replace the tactile feel that you get from holding actual game pieces or cards, nor the joy of sitting at a table with a bunch of other people who enjoy the game you are playing, it has so many benefits that any fan of any table top game needs to own this.First, you can theoretically play literally any tabletop game that exists in real life, on TTS. The mod community has shown a lot of hard work and creativity when it comes to available games on this. Aside from the standard games like Chess that already come with this game, you can play popular board games like the very popular, but much maligned Monopoly, to board game fan classic Battlestar Galactica. Even miniature games like Warhammer and Guild Ball are available to play. Want to play a LCG like Netrunner or Doomtown, but don’t want to shell out the hundreds of dollar’s worth of card expansions? It’s here too. If you have an idea for your own game, you can make it here too. The best part however, is it allows you to play these games at any time, even if your friends live far away, or if none of them are available. There is a community out there who wants to play these games. If you like table top games at all, and wish you could play them more often: get this game.9/10 “Excellent” "

												TL;DR: 11/10 +1 bonus point for workshop having everything you could ever want.This game is absolutely amazing if you spend the time to learn how to make it work. Any game you could possibly want (that can be played on a table top). It has a pretty healthy community of people so if you play often enough you'll start to get to know the different people. Want to learn to play MTG, D&D, Settlers of Catan and many more? just sit down at the table and ask you'd be surprised how many people are friendly and teach you how to play. the only problems is that there is a case of lag if everyone isnt in the same part of the world but it doesn't matter too much because the games can still be played easily. The game goes on sale pretty often but for the $20 price tag its absolutely worth it! "

												Basically you get what's in the title. You can have a table online with other people, and play games together.  Pretty straightfoward, and well-implemented it seems.Of course the main focus of this is gaming.  It comes with several traditional games (chess, poker, so on...and to my delight, Go), and there are optional DLC games, that honestly did not interest me one bit.  But there is Steam Workshop and mod sites which let you play actual games, and more.  Since I have had this, I've gotten to play some new games I've never played before, and I discovered some old favorites on the workshop.  For something like D&D, though, it can take some work.  I haven't tried to run or join a game with it, but I think it would not be too much trouble to import maps.  It can also do not-so-game stuff, if you can find the tools (or figure out how to make your own).  Anything you could do around a table, more or less.  I set it up to do tarot readings, and that seems to work nicely.  The biggest complaint I hear is that it's expensive.  That's really up to the buyer, and what you expect to get out of it.  I would think it's worth it, but for RPGs there are other alternatives that don't cost $20.			"

												An excellent game to play board games with your friends.Sadly my friends and I couldn't play at the same time:-(Edit Jan. 12 2016Finally just got a chance to play UNO with my friends, and this could be my best time recently. This game could give the purest tabletop games experience, and the same amount of fun even when they're everywhere.Also this could be the best developer I've ever met. If you wonder why, just see the comments below.Also ---- Don't forget to flip the table when a game is over!			"

												Writing a review for this is basically writing a review for every tabletop game ever made. So I am gonna ask you this instead:Do you like tabletop games?Do you want to play them online?Do you want to play them with real physics and (theoretically) no restricting rules? Then this is the game for you :D			"

												This is a wonderful game that is extremely simple, but at the same time, really fun!! You get to play board games that you might not even have with people online! If your friends can't come over and hang out, you can just get this game and play with your friends. I recommend this game to everyone who likes board games....which is pretty much 1/4 of the world, but there is an awesome option that will hopefully turn that around. If you want to or if you want to get rid of your rage, just click the flip the table button to throw your table into a abyss. Really fun game and love playing with my family and friends.			"

												Very great platform to play any board games with your friends. As long as you have people to play with, I see no reason to not get this game. The controls can be awkward, sometimes a bit underwhelming. But in the end, you are able to play near endless boardgames with your friends, only needing one game. Highly enjoyable.Also you can use this game for your Pen&Paper needs, as you can create Dungeons and whatsoever with relative ease. The workshop is huge and has almost everything.			"

												In all honesty I'm just writing this review to earn badges, but while I'm at it I might as well write a little something about TTS, no?If you're unsure whether or not you should buy this I can tell you a few reasons you'd want to check to make sure it's worth it for you.1. Do your friends own it and you enjoy playing tabletop games?2. Do you enjoy playing around with physics?3. Do you want/need some sort of software to try out a game before you buy it in real life? (Yeah yeah, not all games exist for this yet, but there's a lot of them and more are constantly added.)4. Want the satisfaction of flipping the table after you lose? (Granted, you're going to need the host's permission to do this, but you know.)If at least 2 of those get checked by you, I say buy it. It's not the best way to play tabletop games, but it is a really good substitute, even more so if the people you want to play with are in other countries. Like any software/game you'll find yourself annoyed at certain things, but in my experience with TTS, these things are so minor that you'll overlook them immediately.A few things that I've found myself getting a little annoyed over include physics not always working as they should because of a workshop item not being completely refined and certain scanned items not being readable.All annoyances are either small enough to just ignore or easily worked around.It's easy to recommend this to anyone who's looking to play some tabletop games with friends in other countries or just wants to try out a few games before going to pick them up in real life.

								In order to understand this game, You have to be a gamer. And not the normal gamer of today, one whose in a college frat playing cod, or a 10 year old who screamed his head off until his parents got him that M rated game... This is a game about imagination, Simplicity, Friendship, and most importantly... Strategy. This simulator allows you to run servers that can play board games. Games like Monopoly, Risk, Life, Ticket to Ride, Carcassone, and many many others. But it also allows you to run card games like Cards against Humanity, or Apples to Apples, or Uno, and again, many many others. And of course this game allows you to play any RPG dungeoun crawler/adeventure/Story-driven game your little heart can imagine. In my years of gaming, This is the most complete version of the physical, becoming the Digital. And i adore it.If you like playing board games, RPGs, or card games AT ALL, play this game. Any gamer should play this game. Its the greatest thing gamers could ask for.Also the graphics are really good...10/10 take all the tens!!!			"

								A game where what you do can do things as though you and your friends were at an actual table playing whatever comes to mind, ranging from board games (such as Chess, Go, and Reversi), card games, to rpg role playing. All without the mess and streamlined actions for dealing and cleaning up cards. It even has gravity settings and blocks to play with.Further possibilities are added when you throw in board and deck importing into the mix. You're basically capable of playing any board game that exists as long as you or someone else knows how to make it. The possibilities are almost limitless, and this may even allow for new tabletop games to come to life, allowing for a potential whole new wave of board games.It can be a brilliant game for classic tabletop fun or for complete hilarity, allowing you to do things you wouldn't normally be able to do in your house, and even allowing you to do table flips. It's your choice.Probably one of the most simplistically innovative ideas for a game out there. I recommend it to the highest degree.Oh I almost forgot, make sure you have friends to play this with- you could always play online, but it's nothing like having you and a bunch of your friends at the same table messing around.

												A physics sandbox simulating a table for the purpose of all manner of tabletop games - Board Games, Card Games, Pen-and-Paper RPGs, Jigsaw Puzzles, etc.  With an extensive Workshop selection of user-made content many popular childhood games can be found.I've used it to host table-top RPGs and card games and even just sitting around BSing with friends is enjoyable.  With some playful props thrown in and everyone chatting, It definately feels as close to sitting around a table as it can get without engaging webcams.  There'sd no AI so rules are not artifically enforced, if a player wants to cheat by moving out of turn or swapping the places of a Knight and a Rook - just like in real life - there's nothing stopping them but honest.  However, there are physics mechanics in play to keep objects from slopping around the board.  Pieces can be hard- and soft-locked in place so accidental nudging doesn't ruin a carefully laid board and pieces can optionally snap to a grid.  -  Just enough framework to allow things to work well and avoid chaos without being restrictive and 'too much like a videogame'.I highly recommend TTS to anyone who enjoys any manner of tabletop games.  I was skeptical but saw that the game had potential and am very pleased to say that it's lived up to my expectations and surpassed them.			"

The ability to physically control your cards,peices,dice,etc. is part of what makes this game so awsome!! Plus how many card/dice games on PC can you actually cheat at if you're sneaky enough. ;) Best played with freinds.10/10Try betting steam games/items with freinds you can trust to make things interesting.

								This game provided a fun alternative to going to a tabletop game store and spending 40 bucks on a board game that will only get use once or twice a month for a few months.The game is easy to mod and so long as you know what you're doing, you can create your own decks of cards with ease and editing the model logic is simple with some rendering software or experience doing so.My only gripe is that you cannot publish privately to Steam right now. I have a custom game that I made that I want to release to my friends but don't want to be posted publically at this point... it would be nice to be able to use steam's workshop for the release instead of having to manually update their files.Overall though, once you get the controls down, this is a good option for trying out new desktop games before you buy them or if you are trying to juggle busy schedules.

								Tabletop Sim is a fantastic addition to the simulator genre. I wouldn't really class it as a simulator though. It's better than that- much more, I can play almost any card and board game(and tons which don't even exist... yet thanks to the creative tools within) digitally with my friends and family anywhere in the world. I move a lot, so having this ability is extremely important and is why Tabletop Simulator gets a strong recommendation from me.+ Creativity (Make almost any game that you would play on a tabletop, and even invent your own).+ Replayability (With the large variety of games and mods available you will find it hard to run out of things to do.+ Utility (Play with anyone and just about anywhere- that an internet connection is available)- Not free (Well worth the asking price though!)

								Picked this up randomly, had been following it for a while.  Upon loading the game after picking a few workshop items I was blown away!  The peices move and animate, the simulation of a table top and all the glory and possible peril of organizing peices combine with the purely endless possibilities.  Just paging through the workshop and loading up tables and messing with it gave me that feeling I used to get when arriving to a friends house in middle school and getting out my character sheet and my tube of dice (which usually lacked a d20 because everyone stole everyones dice).  Its a great idea, implimented incredibly well with room to improve and some pretty impressive features.  So glad this has been made.  Now to get back in touch with my old D&D cohorts and M:TG friends and start a whole new Golden age of tabletop gaming.			"

								I have had more fun with this game in the short time I have owned it than most others. I have games that I have poured 20 - 30 hours into and have not enjoyed as much as this game in the short 6 hours I have played it.One word of warning: Buy the 4 pack, if you can, or convince your friends to buy the game, too. Whilst it is a ton of fun, it would not be much fun without friends. Joining a random lobby almost always ends with someone flipping a table or moving your stuff around and no game actually being played.			"

												    One of the favourite games in my library. It is very easy to learn the controls and jump into an open lobby, but unfortunately there is basically no variety in public games. After about 2 months you will either have to play the same games you've played multiple times before, or host your own game (but be prepared to teach the newcomers).     While public games are fine, the true enjoyment of TTS comes from private matches. If you can convince your friends to get the game as well, you will have much more fun playing with them instead of strangers. Private matches > Public matches.			"

												By far the most robust and feature-complete tabletop game engine out there, and the developers are still very actively adding new features and fixing bugs.Community is quite active, with many game lobbies open at any given time.Very much user-created Workshop content, you can find several versions of almost any game you could possibly name.Creation of boards and decks is fairly easy to do yourself, in the rare case of a game being absent from the Workshop.In a nutshell, $20 to play every tabletop game in existence.

												Tabletop piracy made even more convinent.  10/10 love not paying for things.I usually dont make joke reviews like this, but there is seriously nothing else I want to say about this game.  The controls work, the community can be a bit toxic at times but is overall pretty fun to play in public lobbies or friends alike.  The only reason this game is in my personal favorites is because it allows me to test out real life tabletop games without having to spend money on them right away.  I ended up finding one of my favorite, casual strategy/chess variant games(Input) through the workshop.  But yeah, the workshop contains about 95% total disregard for product copyright.  You play this to pirate stuff, not to prototype new games like the developers shamelessly advertised it as early on.  Please, if you play this game, and you have real life friends to invite over for a night of tabletop games, respect the people who gave you these concepts.  Buy the physical games.  Or at least buy the DLC and not the ghetto workshop versions of said DLC...			"

												Got gifted this from my brother.The name of this game describes it:A way to play ANY boardgame, ANY card game, and ANY dice game you could ever wish to play(as far as I can tell): on your computer:By yourself, with friends, with family, even with complete strangers.This software is a slamdunk deal for $20, when the normal cost/space usage of normally purchasing real boardgames is considered.Please note: Not all games are necessarily available from the get-go. This is mostly due to copyright complaints...This does NOT mean that it's impossible to play such games. e.g. Munchkin.I've never purchased any DLC content as of the writing of this review, But no purchase of DLC is required to play with others who do own them. (Like real life!)That's about all the comments I can think of for this game. My Recommendation:Go ahead and buy it! (Or wait for a sale to purchase it.)P.S:This game is also a table flipping simulator:(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻			"

								This is probably the most interesting use of a physics engine that I've seen so far. Rather than limit you to a series of 'planned' interactions with the 'game' the engine merely responds to how you move the pieces. So this is basically a true 'sandbox' in the sense that you can do whatever you want and the engine doesn't get in the way if possible. It might be a little frustrating for people who are looking for a dedicated poker game, or a dedicated chess game, etc etc, but for tabletop gamers....There's an RPG set that looks like it can be used for D&D, GURPS, etc with an in-the-works 'character sheet;' could this seriously mean that D&D could move to virtual pen and paper?

								Imagine this, you're on Skype with your buddies, when you start saying something like ""I wish we could play board games together"". Yeah, there are sites online with that kind of stuff, but they're kinda lifeless.Yeah, you can buy ""Monopony"" or whatever on Steam, but there's no online multiplayer.With this Early Access simulator game, you can do whatever the hell you feel like, and you just pay once. Plus, if you're looking at this, chances are, you have a Steam account, as well as Steam friends.Just take a quick look at the workshop at the games people put. Monopoly, Cards Against Humanity, Risk, UNO, Scrabble, Candy Land, Sorry!, the list goes on.There are even different themes for games. Nintendo Monopoly, Sonic Monopoly, Mass Effect Go Fish (I'm serious).Being an Early Access game, things are being changed all the time and there's bound to be issues, but even in its current state, it's certainly worth a buy.Is there anything I wish could be changed? Well, yeah, a couple.1. Custom model imports for game pieces.Earlier I mentioned Monopoly. Well, there's no house models, so you have to do like Chess pieces or something in their place. There's also no cats, shoes, cars, or anything. Just standard game pieces. I think adding custom models would make things very neat.2. Adjust the gravity a little for certain objects.I notice when I turn the gravity up, the game pieces move like I want, but then the dice is a little heavy. Maybe there can be sliders for dice, coins, game pieces, and whatever else.3. Tags or Descriptions for game rooms.Yeah, there's the name section, but people put their username or something silly there. Nobody puts what game it is. How about an extra section that lists the game from Workshop currently in use.Like: (Room name) (Host name) (Workshop item name)And if they're using a custom game, just let the user type in the game and that'll show.But even without these, this is simply pure raw fun. Sure, the players have to enforce the rules, but that goes for real board games as well.Recommended for those who have online friends who you really want to play board games with. For 15 bucks, it's worth it.			"

								Quite a nice little game. Basically a board game simulator with the added fun of physics to create a more Sandbox like feel to the game.Out of the box, the game comes with a couple of popular board games to get you started: Backgammon, Cards (Limitless amount of games here, although the game does come with Poker chips should we want to partake any money centred card games), chess, checkers and even an RPG dungeons and dragons style kit so you can create dungeon advantures.Where the game really excels at is the community behind the game as well, a large array of additional games can be downloaded for free from the Steam Workshop with cards and custom model support you can play a number of games.The game also comes with internet multiplayer support can you can mess about with your friends over a virtual table top.Oh and yes, you can flip tables. :)Nifty game, would reccomend purchasing if it goes on sale.

												Excellent simulation of a tabletop environment.  The DLC is very reasonable in price and the resources available in the Workshop or elsewhere give you almost unlimited applications.  I've played a few different games and spent a fair number of hours building tables for Battletech.  I'm very impressed with its capabilities.  Take care, on tables that have a HIGH number of high poly models it can hit your FPS....and cause lag to remote players.			"

												Very, very great and rather fun game. There's an extremely large variety of games/board games to play from the steam workshop, the global chat is usually pretty friendly and there's usually people asking if others want to play a game. As well, if you don't have anyone to play with, finding a game to join by talking to people in the global chat or joining an outside community (like The Red Dice) is pretty easy.Definitely worth getting. The only small bit of frustrating or baffling thing could be learning how to actually play some games because if you're just reading the manual or rules by yourself, it can be a bit confusing how the game works. Nonetheless, that's how it is with real new board games, so that's not a valid complaint. And anyways, it's very simple to either watch videos of people playing the game on Youtube or so, or even just joining a lobby and telling them you've never played before. People are usually pretty good about explaining how to play, and when you do this, you at least know that you're definitely playing the game right.Again, would totally, totally recommend. So fun and entertaining.			"

								A very fun Simulator with great multiplayer. The game is a simple concept, but the details add immensely to the fun and value during multiplayer. Host a server easily or join one. Quickly choose between lots of common games (Chess, Checkers etc.). I play cards a lot- the host can quickly deal cards to everyone and shuffle simply by clicking. You can see where each player's cursor is, and you can drag and drop betting chips. You can chat easily during the game through voice or chat. Little noises liek chips clicking and cards shuffling add to the game. You can manipulate the game chips which adds to the ""physicality"" of the player-game interaction.  "

								Great prototype so far! A lot of features still missing but it's tons of fun already. Playing custom games like Cards against humanity, UNO, monopoly and much more is superb! The server tools for the game host makes for really intuitive matches, where an experienced player can host really profesional looking games and of course messing around with friends is great as well. Overall I'm enjoying the game and can't wait for future updates.			"

												Not really as much of a game in of itself as more of a virtual medium for you to play actual board games with people you otherwise would have either very little or no chance to play with in reality. Lots of options and updates to said options to assist in playing a board game correctly as if you were actually sitting in a room with other people. Definitely get this if you are a fan of playing board games and don't have the ability to play with certain friends. 10 out of 10.			"

												Probably the most versatile game on steam. Literally thousands of games you can play all professional quality. From the biggest names like Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride and Magic the Gathering with all of its tens of thousands of cards to games you've never heard of. 9.5/10. I only take a half off because the user to user interface and ability to find games is severely low tech. A lobby connected to IRC? What is this, the 90s? Nice for global chat but very poor at connecting you to other players for games.			"

												Unlimited possibilities, and it ain't lying.  The only limit is your imagination.There is an absolute minimum amount of hand holding.  If you play Battleship, you will have to vocally call out the attack, and respond with hit or miss.  You have to drag the little piece to the board to fill out the grid yourself.  If you play poker, you actually have to deal the cards and count the chips.  In Jumanji, you're responsible for releasing your own wild animals (0/10).  That's really my only gripe, some workshop maps offer some scripting, but I'd like to see a bit more hand holding (like an auto dealer for hold'em, a chip counter for gambling, persistent servers, some self moving pieces).  You can cheat, you can flip the table, you can rage flick your buddies piece, and you can even play board games.  Highly recommended.			"

												The wonderful thing about Tabletop Simulator isn't it's depth or it's innovation, but it's ability to take a classically local scenario and expand it on a global scale. I love board games, but I often find them painstakingly long to set up and even harder to find people to play with sometimes. But with TTS, I can message my friends and within minutes have a game set up and running. The connection has always been terrific, the base content is solid, and the seamless ability to bring in new content through the Steam Workshop ensures that TTS will have a place in my library for a long, long time. TTS is one of the best social interactions I've had on Steam in a long while, and as more and more people add it to their collections, I can only imagine that will continue to improve.			"

Scripting makes alot of things easy, back when there was none of that auto deal, convert, powerup magic, everything was done by hand, memory, and a couple of calculators. Great game over all, other than the bugs that have been around for awhile. Community can be rough some of the time, but you can find some good games and decent people, even if you get shiteheads alot.Huge workshop full of too much to describe here.360/iluminutty8/10 fix your damn bugsWould flip table and rage quit again ad infinitum			"

												With a wide variety of board games brought to you by the game's harmonious relationship between an outstanding community and developers that actually listen, Tabletop Sim is easily one of the hidden gems of Steam's 2016 summer sale.Aside from just the classics the devs have listed, buying this game has officially given you a swiss army knife that has almost any well-known game you've played on a table with your friends. For those that hate the idea of getting your friends together in person (or just hate people in general), the company this game keeps is relatively small but kind. Occasionally you'll get the tard who excessively flips tables or moves♥♥♥♥♥♥around, but there are mods in place that frequently saves progress and kick features. There's even a main chat at the starting screen to encourage people to play together. In my first 90 minutes of gameplay, I think it's safe to say that I prefer the company of these strangers. The tablet and mp3 functions also allow for you to listen to stock music that you've heard a million times on top of full google access to a small screen that everyone sees in game. Tie that to the games soothing backgrounds, and you've got one of the most relaxing environments to simulate boardgames in. There's nothing like it. In short, the game's got two things going for it - a tremendous community of nice people and limitless game diversity. While you don't need it, you should get the DLCs that appeal to you only to show appreciation for the devs. I'd consider this a must-buy.			"

Friend gets the game, let's play card games with him for hours, flip some tables, do more jiggsaws, flip more tables, browse the workshop, table flipping and jiggsawing.some bulletpoints- Best sandbox boardgame sim available so far- Jiggsaws- Needs more resolutions for custom jiggsaw pictures and needs a higher piece count- great for card games and tcgs, has a intuitive peek function that tells you who peeks at what card.- Official DLC for games with their own backgrounds and more (only host needs to own the game)- great selection of workshop mods to choose fromCan recommend even at full price!

								A game where what you do can do things as though you and your friends were at an actual table playing whatever comes to mind, ranging from board games (such as Chess, Go, and Reversi), card games, to rpg role playing. All without the mess and streamlined actions for dealing and cleaning up cards. It even has gravity settings and blocks to play with.Further possibilities are added when you throw in board and deck importing into the mix. You're basically capable of playing any board game that exists as long as you or someone else knows how to make it. The possibilities are almost limitless, and this may even allow for new tabletop games to come to life, allowing for a potential whole new wave of board games.It can be a brilliant game for classic tabletop fun or for complete hilarity, allowing you to do things you wouldn't normally be able to do in your house, and even allowing you to do table flips. It's your choice.Probably one of the most simplistically innovative ideas for a game out there. I recommend it to the highest degree.Oh I almost forgot, make sure you have friends to play this with- you could always play online, but it's nothing like having you and a bunch of your friends at the same table messing around.

												A physics sandbox simulating a table for the purpose of all manner of tabletop games - Board Games, Card Games, Pen-and-Paper RPGs, Jigsaw Puzzles, etc.  With an extensive Workshop selection of user-made content many popular childhood games can be found.I've used it to host table-top RPGs and card games and even just sitting around BSing with friends is enjoyable.  With some playful props thrown in and everyone chatting, It definately feels as close to sitting around a table as it can get without engaging webcams.  There'sd no AI so rules are not artifically enforced, if a player wants to cheat by moving out of turn or swapping the places of a Knight and a Rook - just like in real life - there's nothing stopping them but honest.  However, there are physics mechanics in play to keep objects from slopping around the board.  Pieces can be hard- and soft-locked in place so accidental nudging doesn't ruin a carefully laid board and pieces can optionally snap to a grid.  -  Just enough framework to allow things to work well and avoid chaos without being restrictive and 'too much like a videogame'.I highly recommend TTS to anyone who enjoys any manner of tabletop games.  I was skeptical but saw that the game had potential and am very pleased to say that it's lived up to my expectations and surpassed them.			"

												Probably the most versatile game on steam. Literally thousands of games you can play all professional quality. From the biggest names like Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride and Magic the Gathering with all of its tens of thousands of cards to games you've never heard of. 9.5/10. I only take a half off because the user to user interface and ability to find games is severely low tech. A lobby connected to IRC? What is this, the 90s? Nice for global chat but very poor at connecting you to other players for games.			"

												Unlimited possibilities, and it ain't lying.  The only limit is your imagination.There is an absolute minimum amount of hand holding.  If you play Battleship, you will have to vocally call out the attack, and respond with hit or miss.  You have to drag the little piece to the board to fill out the grid yourself.  If you play poker, you actually have to deal the cards and count the chips.  In Jumanji, you're responsible for releasing your own wild animals (0/10).  That's really my only gripe, some workshop maps offer some scripting, but I'd like to see a bit more hand holding (like an auto dealer for hold'em, a chip counter for gambling, persistent servers, some self moving pieces).  You can cheat, you can flip the table, you can rage flick your buddies piece, and you can even play board games.  Highly recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								My lands... This game. This game is the game I've been waiting for, forever. I am such a huge fan of board games. My closet is fillled with them! And this game captures the feel almost perfectly. If you have a friend to play with then you have even greater of a reason to play this game! Man even I'll play this game with you if I'm not bust. Only thing that could make this game better is if they could get Fantasy Flight Games to sign an agreement to make expansion packs with their games. I heard they're working on Hasbro right now though. So one company at a time, eh? But back to this review. While I could ramble on forever, I'll try to close this up soon. So, yes get this game if you like board games at all because it captures the feeling. And if you're crafty enough you could play DnD in it now. It comes with some super detailed animated figures for RPG games! So if you and your friends bring thei rown character sheets and dungeon guide, I'm sure you could find a way to make it work! Get mad at it? it even lets you flip the table. So go on and help grow this game! Make it great and let Fantasy Flight see a reason to put their games in it!			"

								Tabletop simulator is one of the most fun games to ever be put on steam,  The possibilities for this are endless.You can play ANY tabletop game you wish,  And if it does not exist in the workshop you can simply create it yourself with the in game editor which is very simple to use.Being yet another early access game I was a little reluctant to play it,  As I have had a few mixed feelings about other early access games.  But this works perfectly and I have never had so much fun with a game.There are still a few very minor bugs but they still don't take away any of the fun.If you like tabletop games I highly recommend this,  And if you don't. I am sure you will after playing this.I will confidently give this game a solid 10/10.			"

												This is my favorite game of the last year. For about fourteen months, I have met more people while trying more games than I have while doing anything else on a computer in my life. It's so easy to join a game or start one up. It works well with total strangers, with complex and simple games alike, with lots of people, or with solitaire games of course. I've modded workshop items, joined communities, even been inspired to go to physical locations to play board games and to buy physical ones.... It's been a lot of fun. This thing definitely needs a tablet version, a console version, and maybe even a mobile version.			"

								If you have any love for card games, board games, or even pen-and-paper RPGs, this is as close as it gets to the real thing.Everything is affected by solid and reliable physics, and there's very little restriction to how you interact with the game pieces. You're open to just not playing the game at all and just screwing around with the pieces. Stage a soap opera with chess pieces, who cares.It's wide-open to custom content. You can make custom card decks with just image files, you can import models for custom figurines and game pieces, make your own custom boards, and it can all be uploaded to the Steam Workshop. Try to count how many variations of Monopoly you see.The online play is simple, stable, smooth, and the most well-synced of any physics-centric game I've played.With all that together, you can play basically any game that can be played on a table. 'Cept for games with moving parts. Like Mouse Trap or something.			"

								Tableflip Simulator.But in all seriousness, this is amazing. True dedication and work has been put into this, and it truly does what it aims to do, and it continues to do it better. PROS:Play with your friends.Play the games you love (Monopoly, Munchkin, etc. Find them on the workshop)Great piece control and systemCONS:Worried about copyright issues as far as games being put up by users on the workshop.Trying to do multiple things at once(I.E. zooming in on a piece you are holding) tends to be buggy for now. Not a true issue though.Initial load into a room is slow even on a high end computer due to intensive memory load and image processing. After this there are no real problems.EDIT: The recent update (v2.7 on 9/19/2014) fixes many of the memory issues, so if this was holding you back from buying this, DON'T LET IT :DWhat I would like to see:Character sheet supportPiece interaction support and health bars/stats applied to pieces. (I.E. Elf Attack-> Orc for 12 damage. -12 image over Orc, health bar, if known/visible, drains an appropriate amount.)EFFECTS! ALL THE EFFECTS! EXPLOSIONS! FOIL CARDS! CARDS THAT PROJECT 3D ""HOLOGRAM"" MODELS!Custom rooms, I wanna play in a nerd cave :PBeing able to lock pieces from specific players (I.E. John can pick this piece up, but Jenna cannot)This game is a Natural 20.Traditional score: 8.0/10.0Projected ""on release"" score: 9.5-10.0/10.0Buy it at $15? If your friends have it, or you have the money to spare, yes.Buy it on sale? I think this one answers itself.			"

												Tabletop Simulator aims to be the ideal platform to play games, traditionally limited to physical contact, anywhere in the world with anyone you want. This game has bridged long distance friendships and keeps board game night going no matter the distance. The game just gives you a sandbox to play in and doesn't force any tabletop game's rules on the players, this allows for any complexity of game to be played. All you need is to scan the board game's assets into the computer to play it digitally with friends. Have no idea how to do that? That's OK because one of this game's biggest strengths is it's mod support. Check out the Workshop and you will most likely find what you are looking for. I think this game should be a must have for anyone who enjoys traditional board, card and tabletop games.			"

Not only can you grab a game or asset from the Steam Workshop to use in the program but you can create your own games, assets and gaming environments to play in! The developers are constantly updating it and adding new features and it has been that way since early access. It is definitely something I always keep installed and am constantly coming back to!

												This has been a game that has been updated constantly. The official DLC is great and plays super well and the workshop content in increadibly well made.The legalities of the workshop content may be questionable, but if anything they have allowed me to play a game I have never seen before with others, then go out and buy the physical copy to share with my friends. Please don't ever change and please, if your game is in the workshop, it's a FREAKING AMAZING PLACE TO BE! I'm still excited over this game after so much time and glad it seems to be well supported by community and developers alike.If you like boardgames or anything tabletop, get this NOW!			"

								Tabletop simulator is an awesome platform for playing board- or cardgames with your friends. It's not for playing with random people online but rather for playing with friends or family. It's easy to use and with plenty of workshop content readily available, and if you are a little creative it is easy to create custom games or even invent your very own.The only thing that it needs is ingame customizable time keeping, like a one-click x-minute timer and I'd be able to create any game I want in it.Now if only you could buy a bundle when you already own the game, then I'd be buying the crap out of this game to gift to all my friends. Steam, PLEASE make this possible...			"

								It's Gmod for board games!Graphics:The graphics aren't anything to shout about, but they are decent and nice to look at.Sound:Agains, nothing to shout about.  There's no music, so supply your own if need be.  The sounds that do come up are nice and sound like they should.Control:I use keyboard/mouse, but it seems it also supports controller.  You can move anythign and everything around and there are no issues that I found.Gameplay:This is where the game shines!  Not only are there several games already included, it supports Steam Workshop, which has LOTS of user created games as well as full recreations of established boardgames such adn Monopoly and Risk!  There are so many, I don't think you could get through them all, though there are a few user created ones that you might wanna pass up for various reasons.  But with up to player 8 online support and extensive Hosting tools, you and friends will have a HUGE blast with this game!  There is even support for Dungeons and Dragons miniatures, so you can host an online D&D session, which is great for those who want to roleplay, but don't live near people who do!I urge everyone to get this game!  This is the most awesome program for boardgame lovers!			"

								In order to understand this game, You have to be a gamer. And not the normal gamer of today, one whose in a college frat playing cod, or a 10 year old who screamed his head off until his parents got him that M rated game... This is a game about imagination, Simplicity, Friendship, and most importantly... Strategy. This simulator allows you to run servers that can play board games. Games like Monopoly, Risk, Life, Ticket to Ride, Carcassone, and many many others. But it also allows you to run card games like Cards against Humanity, or Apples to Apples, or Uno, and again, many many others. And of course this game allows you to play any RPG dungeoun crawler/adeventure/Story-driven game your little heart can imagine. In my years of gaming, This is the most complete version of the physical, becoming the Digital. And i adore it.If you like playing board games, RPGs, or card games AT ALL, play this game. Any gamer should play this game. Its the greatest thing gamers could ask for.Also the graphics are really good...10/10 take all the tens!!!			"

								This simulator is great not only for fun and playing with friends, but also for those who are designing boardgames and want to test gameplay scenarios without the need of printing cards, making components, finding physically available people and places. And it is not that hard to learn how to put your game inside the sim.Also, table flipping is THE game-changing mechanic of the century.			"

								A game where what you do can do things as though you and your friends were at an actual table playing whatever comes to mind, ranging from board games (such as Chess, Go, and Reversi), card games, to rpg role playing. All without the mess and streamlined actions for dealing and cleaning up cards. It even has gravity settings and blocks to play with.Further possibilities are added when you throw in board and deck importing into the mix. You're basically capable of playing any board game that exists as long as you or someone else knows how to make it. The possibilities are almost limitless, and this may even allow for new tabletop games to come to life, allowing for a potential whole new wave of board games.It can be a brilliant game for classic tabletop fun or for complete hilarity, allowing you to do things you wouldn't normally be able to do in your house, and even allowing you to do table flips. It's your choice.Probably one of the most simplistically innovative ideas for a game out there. I recommend it to the highest degree.Oh I almost forgot, make sure you have friends to play this with- you could always play online, but it's nothing like having you and a bunch of your friends at the same table messing around.

												Coming off the back of a long game of Battlestar Galactica, and trying to mod my own game into the system, if you are into board games or card games you can get some awesome times with this. The tech support from the devs is timely and on point, the game interface works (though because of what it does it is a bit clunky, even with scripting), and the community is generally friendly. Yes, it's mostly secret hitler if you look for games, but there's usually at least something else going, or playing with friends works most of the time (there are a few bugs probably courtesy of the overburdened interface).Still reecommended, this is the only software on steam I have purchased at full price, and have no regrets about that (though the sales are plentiful, I was just between them when I got it).

												Probably the most versatile game on steam. Literally thousands of games you can play all professional quality. From the biggest names like Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride and Magic the Gathering with all of its tens of thousands of cards to games you've never heard of. 9.5/10. I only take a half off because the user to user interface and ability to find games is severely low tech. A lobby connected to IRC? What is this, the 90s? Nice for global chat but very poor at connecting you to other players for games.			"

												Unlimited possibilities, and it ain't lying.  The only limit is your imagination.There is an absolute minimum amount of hand holding.  If you play Battleship, you will have to vocally call out the attack, and respond with hit or miss.  You have to drag the little piece to the board to fill out the grid yourself.  If you play poker, you actually have to deal the cards and count the chips.  In Jumanji, you're responsible for releasing your own wild animals (0/10).  That's really my only gripe, some workshop maps offer some scripting, but I'd like to see a bit more hand holding (like an auto dealer for hold'em, a chip counter for gambling, persistent servers, some self moving pieces).  You can cheat, you can flip the table, you can rage flick your buddies piece, and you can even play board games.  Highly recommended.			"

It also does what what it does really well, except for a few things. The controls are a little janky at times and also I've had connection problems in the past. However, overall, this is a great game and I highly recommend it to those who enjoy simulation games.			"

												Tabletop simulator is an interesting ""Game"" if you can call it that, it's very different from any other game in that it's up to the players to come up with their own rules for play. Tabletop simulator is a board game simulation program that lets people play board games you would normally play in the same room across the internet. The game provides a decent amount of premade games and pieces to use with the steam workshop also supplementing this with custom models and game pieces. Essentially the game is very basic at it's core but is loose enough in it's functions that allows a very wide range of things you can do.I would of liked to see a few more features such as more board options and better drawing tools but it can be overlooked as they still update the game infrequently.I would also recommend having a few friends to play with as it's kind of the whole point of the game, I wouldn't recommend the game if you plan on playing alone or are uncomfortable playing with random players.Overall I'd say this is a great engine for creativity that could potentially provide endless hours of content if you can come up with the games to play or use the ones on the workshop.

Both of these things are available, in spades, on the Steam Workshop.  Now, as soon as I can rope some of my friends into getting this game, we will be set for some awesome times XDMost of the controls are really convenient (WASD panning, solid mouse controls, etc), though I find the menus a bit difficult to navigate at times.  This game already has everything you need for a poker night, or any other traditional card game, built in, and has some basics for tabletop RPG's, as well.  Although the vanilla RPG resources are a touch scarce, they are plentiful on the Workshop, as intended.Better than expected physics, and definitely convenient, it has a lot of potential.			"

												I'm honestly not sure if I can recommend this game as the real fun mostly comes from the Mods - and more importantly - the (original) board version of the mod.  You wouldn't rate a game sequel 10/10 if they did just the same thing again without any innovation.HOWEVER, Tabletop Simulator does a fantastic job allowing players to use their own game and offers a great opportunity to play board games with friends far away or even complete strangers. I don't play board games with the friends living close to me, so it's a great that I can simply join a online lobby and get a 8 player game starting in minutes!Playing more uncommon (but soooo good!) games like ""Cards against Humanity"" or ""Secret Hitler"" is a lot of fun, which wouldn't be possible (for me) without Tabletop Simulator. If you are in a similar situation as me, I can recommend getting TTS - but please do mind that a lot of fun is coming from the original creators of their respective board games and they should enjoy your support the same way!

												I've played this game for 72 Hours. It's a fun and nice game to play with friends. The Negative part about it is sometimes when you have too much mods for the workshop in tabletop simulator the loading times can be pretty slow but, I've had some problems with the server too although, those were just one or two times. Besides that it's one of the best games you can get within steam. If you're a fan of board games than I recommand you give it a try. :)			"

												It's time we forget about all the ""monopoly online 2015 free"" games on our tablets and phones. Here comes the Tabletop Simulator, the ultimate tool for having fun. You've always wanted to play some board games with someone you don't see really often? TTS will help. TTS provides the best experience out there, it doesn't ""hold your hand"" - rules are enforced by players, not the game itself. As a master (if the game needs one), you can always do some miscalculations - just like the real board game. No automatic stuff (unless it's scripted, it's possible, but not necessary).The game feels great. I've been waiting for a game like this for a couple of years, and finally it's here.Final score: 10/10.			"

												I don't know why I didn't write a review for this game sooner, but after 200+ hours here it goes.In short: This game is amazing. It allows me to play board games with my friends all across the world. Not only that, but it also lets me try new games that I would have never had the gumption to go out and buy. Sometimes I've played games and it's been okay, other times I've played the game and immediately went to amazon to buy the physical copy.I first encountered the game in 2014 and after watching the video just didn't understand the potential. It seemed like one of many physics simulators and didn't seem to have much use beyond messing around and flipping tables.  Boy was I wrong. Since then, I've bought 8 copies of this game for me and my friends (because I'm a pushy board gamer that wants to play and they were hesitant to try). We have all greatly enjoyed the interface while not perfect, is incredibly funcitonal.The developers are also second to none. They are constantly releasing updates that greatly increases the functionality of the game. When they added scripting it basically made it a new game, greatly increasing the functionality of what the users could mod. Now they've added custom states and the ability to import unity asset bundles.This is no longer just a tabletop simulator, this is now a full fleged tabletop engine that offers an insane amount of freedom to board game developers. Not only does it help bring people together to play games at a distance, it also allows those interested in board game design to create prototypes without pilfering games for tokens.In the end... Awesome game. If you play board games or are even remotely interested, buy this. Don't even think about it, just click buy.			"

												You can play like almost every single board game including popular ones, create your own board games with Tabletop Simulator. If you're into physical versions of board games, you can just test the game here first before buying it to see if it's really worth it which makes perfect sense.It's definitely a price/performance buy even for the base price (bought it when it was %50 off). I'd recommend atleast 1 close friend of yours to play this game with. Love it, 10/10!			"

								Of course it gets the reputation ""hurr flip table"" but in all seriousness, with workshop support, the numbers of games are endless. In addition, the sandbox-y controls work suprisingly well. Being able to play Chess, Netrunner, or even smaller games like Boss Monster and Dominion with strangers over the internet is just wonderful. Certainly a unique title.EDIT:The workshop support is growing ever larger, as is my time with this game. Only recently have I picked up the chest and along with it the ability to save objects. With this, I've been playing A LOT of Magic the Gathering with friends and random people, making a few more friends. This game is just wonderful, and my enjoyment with it never seems to diminish.

								I was really surprised by this game. Its basically a sandbox game with possibilitys to creat your own game. You can play D&D, the family games we all loved or play a serious game of poker or whatever. I really like the controls, they are easy and feel good. Im surprised by the stacking cards feature and it works quite well. Its still Early access but if it fixes the occasional bug and adds more features/make it easier for customisable games like adding your own game objects then its perfect.Its defenetly a good pickup if you like games like that and more to come by the community. You probably can play a turnament with that game because its easy to use and you cant really cheat :PAll in all, a really good game and probably a bright futer!			"

												Have you ever wanted to play those card games from your youth such as Uno and the pokers without leaving the comfort of your computer? Of course not, you're twelve and don't know what an Uno is. But, for those of you who aren't twelve and know what an Uno is, this game is probably for you. Want to play Uno with cards that have Nicolas Cage's face on them? You got it. Eels and Escalators? Sure! A digital version of Space Hulk that isn't completely disappointing? Well, I'm not really a pen-and-paper kinda guy but who knows? Games and gaming objects for any occasion and necessity are available to you, the tabletop-but-not-on-an-actual-tabletop gaming public. ""But, Mr. Speedchunk. I don't see the game I want/I have this idea for a game, what do?""Firstly, you don't start a sentence with ""but"". Secondly, if you don't see something you like, you can make it yourself.  The customization is flexible enough to be part of Cirque Du Soleil probably.You can even flip the table if you feel the rage overcome you. So if you have friends and want to simulate some tables, go ahead and play this game.			"

												Coming off the back of a long game of Battlestar Galactica, and trying to mod my own game into the system, if you are into board games or card games you can get some awesome times with this. The tech support from the devs is timely and on point, the game interface works (though because of what it does it is a bit clunky, even with scripting), and the community is generally friendly. Yes, it's mostly secret hitler if you look for games, but there's usually at least something else going, or playing with friends works most of the time (there are a few bugs probably courtesy of the overburdened interface).Still reecommended, this is the only software on steam I have purchased at full price, and have no regrets about that (though the sales are plentiful, I was just between them when I got it).

Not a single time did I start the game and just leave it on. That is a small way to sum up how much I truly adore this game. If you dislike tabletop games, then this is not for you. Do not buy this game just to flip tables or dismantle other people's games, because theres an easy banning system which can stop people within seconds. You're not even permenantly disrupting the game, because of the rewind feature. If you actually enjoy tabletop games, whether it's Cards Against Humanity, RPG's, or King of New York, then this is for you. It takes a bit to get used to all the controls, but after your first hour or so you'll have everything down if you went through the tutorial. This game is limitless in it's possabilities. I could litterally play almost any game, even if it's not actually a board game. Someone made a 100% Orange Juice replica in this, which is a great video game. The overall community is great, and eventually you will make friends from this game whether you like it or not.

												Tabletop Simulator (TTS) is exactly what it sounds like. It is a program that allows you to play pretty much any ""analogue"" game that you can think of, on the computer. While it will never replace the tactile feel that you get from holding actual game pieces or cards, nor the joy of sitting at a table with a bunch of other people who enjoy the game you are playing, it has so many benefits that any fan of any table top game needs to own this.First, you can theoretically play literally any tabletop game that exists in real life, on TTS. The mod community has shown a lot of hard work and creativity when it comes to available games on this. Aside from the standard games like Chess that already come with this game, you can play popular board games like the very popular, but much maligned Monopoly, to board game fan classic Battlestar Galactica. Even miniature games like Warhammer and Guild Ball are available to play. Want to play a LCG like Netrunner or Doomtown, but don’t want to shell out the hundreds of dollar’s worth of card expansions? It’s here too. If you have an idea for your own game, you can make it here too. The best part however, is it allows you to play these games at any time, even if your friends live far away, or if none of them are available. There is a community out there who wants to play these games. If you like table top games at all, and wish you could play them more often: get this game.9/10 “Excellent” "

												TL;DR: 11/10 +1 bonus point for workshop having everything you could ever want.This game is absolutely amazing if you spend the time to learn how to make it work. Any game you could possibly want (that can be played on a table top). It has a pretty healthy community of people so if you play often enough you'll start to get to know the different people. Want to learn to play MTG, D&D, Settlers of Catan and many more? just sit down at the table and ask you'd be surprised how many people are friendly and teach you how to play. the only problems is that there is a case of lag if everyone isnt in the same part of the world but it doesn't matter too much because the games can still be played easily. The game goes on sale pretty often but for the $20 price tag its absolutely worth it! "

								Yes, I always hear people talk on and on about the beautifull and seemingly flawless gameplay of Tabletop Simulator. However, the neglected attribute that really stood out to me was the stellar plot. The sheer beauty in which the characters developed from the first moment, but never fully were explained until the end is the Tabletop Simulator. Don't let the crowd peer pressure you into ignoring the plot -- it is a real jewel in itself and should not be left shunned as it tragically has thus far.Lik dis if u cri evry tiem			"

 If you enjoy board games and have friends to play with, I strongly recommend Tabletop Simulator for everyone. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+++  Timeless game with infinite board gaming potential +++ Makes you able to play board games with friends living anywhere in the world+++ Great number of workshop mods available++ You are able to create your own game or port an existing one++ Satisfying interaction with pieces and board++ Supports automation via scripting++ Only the host needs to buy the DLC content for all players to be able to play it+ Good physics+ VR Support- Official DLC prices seems a tad bit expensive comparing with the content you can get for free- You need a fixed group of friends who also own this game to play most of the content-- Very heavy load on your computer's RAM, definitely needs more optimization---  A wide variety of bugs, connection failures and crashes (at the time of this review) that can be very frustrating ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~			"

								This game fits any persons desire to play board games and card games.  It comes highly reccomended, but you must realize thtat right now it is still in Early Access and the game has many flaws.  Some of which right now include occasional hard lag spikes, limited boards, and RPG options. However, it has come very apparent that Berserk games is very hell bent on making this work, so I would not be scared of this turning into a no full release early access game like many in this genre.Tabletop Simulator is wonderful in so many ways.  If your like me, Board Games are super fun but harder to get people to come around a table just to play them.  Tabletop Simulator is full of people from all sorts of places ready to play a simple universal game like checkers and chess.  What I love the most is the RPG options, although limited, are still in the game.  I always wanted to DnD, so this makes it easier to get into it without having to buy a bunch of peices. They do plan on expanding these options as well as many more.Finally, the biggest apeal to Tabletop Simulator is the costumization features.  People are playing ONLINE games of Uno, Monoply, and the very popular Cards Against Humanity in mere seconds.  I have also found people making their own boards or making their own games with the features in the game and playing their own wacky crap online.Overall, Tabletop Simulator comes highly reccomended to anyone.  The creativity is flowing more and more everyday from the users, and the game has only just begun.			"

								Digital will never beat the analogue. But digital might as well be the next analogue, if Berserk Games, creators of this masterpiece are considered.While other games are basically limiting players by enforcing rule designs, Tabletop Simulator let the players choose their game and how do they want to play it. If you want to play chess or any other of 15 classic games in Tabletop Simulator, be sure to know the rules because game will certainly not tell you how to play it. The only fences out there are your own knowledge, attention to playset and ability and willingness to cheat.Sandbox nature also bring psysics, so there are no more moves you cannot do. You even have the ability to smash the pieces and flip the table if you're angry and aggressive enough.But the biggest win, as younger generations might say, are the unlimited possibilities of modding - Steam Workshop is already full of mods of licensed games that play and look better than real licensed digital products. Someone might ask how much time until copyright owners decide to threaten Valve to pull a plug on these beautiful, user created mods, but even if it happens - Tabletop Simulator doesn't breach anyone's copyright and mods will certainly be available and easy accesible to everyone elsewhere.Finally, card and board games went digital and the pure enjoyment of meeting up with your friends and having a good time is certainly appreciated, especially by older generation of gamers whose free time and living spaces are getting more narrow as adulthood, family and children are coming by.DEFINITE RECOMMENDATION. Love yourself and get Tabletop Simulator.P.S. And a headset. You'll need one to laugh at other people. :)			"

								Ok first of this game suffers from a bad advertising video.I had seen this game come by a number of times in my reccomended list and everytime i clicked and watched the video i though it was just a dumb physics game like amputea or similar (just randomly throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥around on a table) no thanks.IT'S NOT!!! and i've been kicking myself that i hadn't bought this game earlier.It is in fact every board/card game you can think of just have a look at the workshop you'll find fully playable magic the gathering sets, warhammer, monopoly,uno,cards against humanity and original player created games.This game is amazing I have played a great number of new board games online with complete strangers and had a blast.I have had full mtg nights with my friends and 2 of the games that i never played before i actually bought the orriginal game so i can play it on game night with my friends on a real table instead of a virtual one.So it is also a great way to just try that really expensive board game you and your friends have been contemplating to buy in real life.So bassically when you buy this game you essentially buy 100's if not 1000's of new games all in one If you like boardgames/card games/role playing games or just if you just like games in general you should own this game don't even wait for it to go on sale it's worth the full price.But don't believe anything i say just ahve a look on youtube for tabletop simulator for some good videos on how this game should be used (the devs might learn a thing or 2 about promoting their own game)			"

												Alright, this game is popular many others have already nailed down why this game is so good(Massive replayability, large community, etc.) However, many have neglected some important things that suck about this game:  -Singleplayer exists; in a fashion: You can explore a table by yourself, but there are NO BOTS or any form of AI. Exploring a tabletop by yourself is just a preview more so than anything else. There are puzzles like Tower of Hanoi that can accomdate a single player, one can tell from booting the game up its made for multiplayer. Unless you have friends who'll buy this game, I recommend you stay away, as right now the community can be toxic(I write this as of the Steam Summer Sale, so after a few weeks the community will stablize, no worries.) -Local play is rather complicated. Rather than explain myself: [http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/540743212109092737/]http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/540743212109092737/[https://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/620703493331290757/]https://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/620703493331290757/[http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/622954302091716286/]http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/622954302091716286/ "

								I must be honest my hopes were far too high prior to purchasing this game, and realising that the table is dangling in the air sort of ruined it initially. Yet i persevered, and came to really enjoy playing the game.It must be said that there is limited enjoyibility to be had when  playing single, but as long as you've got at least one obedient friend to join you either online or hot-seat then you're set to enjoy a quick game of chess... or monopoly!The workshop is probably one of the greatest features, every board game of your childhood can be witnessed, played, and then flipped when you inevitably lose. Yet with the ""undo button"", i'm sure the opponent won't mind too much.To summarise, a game with really fun physics, a crazy idea, and a well populated workshop. Well worth a buy both in or out of a sale... Word of advice however, try to ensure at least one friend buys it too, online games are sooooo much more fun than sharing the computer/laptop/rock.9.5/10 Dice rolled			"

								As a person who once played a great many board games, I can say that this is by and far the best board game sim out there. Its not just a physics playground either, the game has all the tools youll need to actually play pretty much any board game and if it isnt in the game, you can just take a casual stroll over to your local steam workshop and grab any board game that grabs your attention.Also the ability to play these games with friends or complete strangers. Its like playing them in real life, except without the scheduling restrictions and paper cuts of real board games.			"

								This is the best game i have ever played whilst im bored. You never get bored inside this game. literally i told myself ok im gonna play for maybe 1 hour then going to go back to CS:GO/League. i ended up playing this for 5 hours. i just couldn't stop. It owns your childhood. this is basically your childhood inside one cheap game. it has every single card/board game you can imagine. the workshop is great for finding the games you want to play such as monopoly and stuff. you dont have to bring your friends over to play board games or card games anymore. You can do it online in such an easy way. +++ if you add this game is cheaper than buying all thoose board games. cause you literally get them for free. This is a MUST HAVE if you enjoy board games and/or are just really bored.			"

								Yes, I always hear people talk on and on about the beautifull and seemingly flawless gameplay of Tabletop Simulator. However, the neglected attribute that really stood out to me was the stellar plot. The sheer beauty in which the characters developed from the first moment, but never fully were explained until the end is the Tabletop Simulator. Don't let the crowd peer pressure you into ignoring the plot -- it is a real jewel in itself and should not be left shunned as it tragically has thus far.Lik dis if u cri evry tiem			"

												A very robust engine for letting you play tabletop games with your friends online.A review for this game is not especially helpful as I can only really review the engine itself, and whether or not you have fun comes down to if you can use the program in the right way.  A game played in Tabletop Simulator is only as good as the mod creator made it to be.  A TRPG is only going to be as fun as the people you play with.  That's just how it works.Your first step should be to look at the Steam Workshop for a few games you might be looking to play with your friends, or think about which you might want to work on yourself.  I myself added a mod to the workshop for a now-defunct CCG, and it wasn't too hard.  Adding some resources for modding could be an important improvement from the devs, but with a little elbow grease, reddit / steam forum searching, and google you can find the answers you need without difficulty.If you've got some tabletop games you want to play online, this is the tool for you.  Still receives regular updates too.

												After playing over a hundred hours in this game, I think I can finally create a good, unbiased opinion on this game. As a disclaimer, I originally bought this game back in early 2015, a few months before it left Early Access. Throughout this time, I have seen many changes to the game. Both good and bad. The BadI'll be starting off with the bad stuff. The biggest complaint I have against the game, is the lack of variety. This has been a thing ever since I bought it, but it has become more obvious as time goes on. Most of the games currently are Blackjack or Poker, Secret Hitler, and MTG. While these games aren't bad, and it is certainly easy to startup your own game, it's also a bit depressing to see these games as the only ones that are commonly open, with the more rare games quickly getting filled up. That said, you do have some other games such as Codenames or X-Wings, that are more rare, but luckily pop up a lot.Another issue I have with the game, is the weird loading bugs that still occur today. These bugs may range from anything to your game refusing to load certain files and forcing the loading symbol to stay on your screen, to the voice chat looping over and over, as the game loads in. While these aren't game breaking, they certainly are annoying.The GoodThe game has an amazingly large selection of games to play, and more than likely you'll learn about new games that you never heard of, or knew how to play. For example, I never knew what Betrayal at the House on the Hill was, but after playing TTS, it has become one of my favorite board games. Also, the community is generally laid back and friendly, meaning that you can easily get into a game and learn it without being mocked or belittled. Overall, the atmosphere of the game is very cozy, and you don't really feel unwelcome.The VerdictIf you like board games in the least, Tabletop Sim is probably one of the best games out there for that. Even though the game originally showed off the 'chaos' element to it, the game itself is much more than just that.			"

								Never in my life would i think something as simple as this would be so much fun, sure its a little weird getting used to for the first hour or 2, but when you get in or make a good game of blackjack, Chutes and Ladders, Uno or BS with a bunch of friendly people you don't know, it becomes real fun and sad when the game is over and you have to go. I would recommend this game to anyone really, its fun, simple, and enjoyable. While ACTUALLY creating your OWN game/hosting your own server may be hard the first time, but you can normally go into another server and ask the ""host"" how they made theirs, and they will normally show you. With this review coming from a TEEN 17 YEAR OLD and not reviewing COD or FPS games or stuff like that, i would say this game is a grab!			"

												Imagine a world where games ranging from Chess, Clue, Yugioh, Magic The Gathering, even Eels and Escalators, are all free and playable after purchasing Tabletop Simulator. Welcome to that world. In all seriousness, this game is amazing. The community workshop offers a wide variety of downloadable mods, which let you play all the classic games you remember growing up playing, or games you wish you played. And once you download the mod with your favorite game, you can play with other people online! And have a blast while doing so! I highly recommend this game, It's a blast with friends. Give it a shot!10/10.			"

												Tabletop Simulator has been my best investment of money yet. I was not really be a tabletop person as things like Monopoly and some card games didn't warm me up. After getting this game i have been playing various awesome games with my friends and there are still huge amount of games in workshop to try. Some of them like Fluxx, Exploding Kittens and One Night Ultimate Werewolf, i bought as real tabletop versions so i could share the great times with my friends and family. This games has everything, dice games, card games, tabletop, RPG elements like figurines, maps etc... Whatever you're in for, you might find great games to play. And if you're creative one, you could even create a game all by yourself.			"

												While I do have a serious problem with the fact that you are not supporting the company by playing it through tabletop simulator I will say it is a great game.Pro- One of the Easiest ways to play games with friends period. If many of your friends live quite a distance from you this is a very easy way to stay in touch and have fun at the same time!- Many people in the community make their own games, many tools are supported to be able to do this and almost nothing limits the creatiability.- The community is usually very friendly. Yes theres always that one guy who likes to come around all the time but it is mostly fine. People are almost always ok with teaching you new games and are ok with being patient as you learn the controls.Cons- The controls can be difficult to learn as a newer player, ive played for almost 1,400 hours at this point and i still do not know some of them to be honest.- Again as i said before i think there should be a better way to support the actual creators. There is some DLC that you can purchase for some games namely Cosmic Encounter which as far as i know does go back a little to the company.Overall i would reccomend this product though it can be a little annoying to newer players to get used to.

												My review will concentrate on 3 areas:1) The simulator itself, and provided (free) and pay content - In a word, delightful. An easy interface, and the ability to connect and play with friends the world over is really cool. Great visuals, and of course the sandbox nature encourages a lot of DIY. For $20, it's hard to beat the value of this app, especially if you are a fan of games that require thought, strategy, and a human opponent to make them their most satisfying and entertaining.2) Out-of-print, rare, old games - The potential for bringing back many out-of-print, never-to-be reprinted games (old SPI, Avalon Hill, etc.) is pretty great, especially with the prices some people are asking for copies on eBay. I understand that someone, somewhere has the ""rights"" to these titles, but as long as they are not using them. I fully intend to try to digitize at least one of my favorites, or at least assist others in creating more content, particularly in the area of wargames.  VASSAL is also great for many of these, but take a hybrid card/counter/hex map/character sheet/encounter book game like the great WW2 infantry solitaire title, Ambush! - the VASSAL interface just isn't made for it. But I think TTS might just fit the bill.3) Existing, in print, readily available modern games. As many reviewers have stated, it's an uneasy feeling. As a musician, I've seen the changes in the recording industry over the past two decades, and how difficult i(nearly impossible) it is to make a living as a recording artist these days. For the consumer, it's the problem of too many great games, too little time and money. My hope is that publishers are looking at what's going on here and hoping that the chance to experience their products on TTS will drive physical sales, and I will admit - I've bought a ton of X-Wing stuff, although that was largely driven by the fact of playing on VASSAL (where you need the pilot cards, secondary weapon/mod cards, damage decks, etc.) in order to play. But as I learn to play on VASSAL and on TTS, it does increase my desire to play face-to-face with friends and family, and that has also contributed to my acquiring physical expansions. I also know that at the moment, I am concentrating much of my TTS time on X-Wing, even though I have subscribed to MANY other games.In closing, you should come play. It's a lot of fun!			"

												Grab a bunch of friends and get ready for value! With multiple classic games as well as new ones coming out on the community workshop this is the type of game you buy with some buds, burn yourself out on it, and then come back later and play it again with some all new games and experiences. If you can find it on a sale, or in a multipack, I would definatly pick it up and get some friends to join as well. In case you couldn't tell, friends are very important in this game. You can find games with others online, but nothing gives quite the same feeling as playing with friends.			"

												I have 3 best friends I socialize and play games with but they live far away across multiple states. Let me tell you, this game is like having them close to you once again, assuming you use a program like Skype of course. We were able to play Monopoly, Uno, Betrayal at House on the Hill, and even expensive Magic the Gathering card decks that I would never get to play. Whenever I just feel like relaxing with my friends for the night, I just climb on this game and it will last us for the rest of the night! Great game!			"

												Tabletop games are some of my favorite pastimes because they are fun, accessable to many different ages, and there's just something great about flipping/rolling/moving your own game peices amid friends.But somedays... the conditions for gaming are not favorable... boxes are everywhere after a move, or maybe you need to save on gas money or your car broke down.  MAYBE you're house/pet sitting and you can't leave.  Well, this peice of brilliant software solves all that and is the next best thing to real life tabletop gaming.I would give this 5 thumbs up if Steam would let me.			"

Really this game puts a little hope back in humanity where the game itself does not reconize rules, it is up to players to use honor and respect to abide by the gameset rules. It is nice to know that a new experience is just a load up away, and lots of good hosts who make games fun and teach.			"

												My friends and I almost never play board games on Tabletop Sim, mostly we just use it to play our Tabletop RPGs over the Internet (not just D&D), and if you put in some effort, you can make it a really cool experience. My friend GMs a game that is actually more fun in Tabletop Sim than it is playing it in person, because of the way he streamlined it for this game.			"

												Tabletop Simulator brings the joy and fun of playing a tabletop board game with your friends without the hassle of pregame setup, postgame cleanup, and setting up everyone's schedules. Not only does it have a ton of games out of the box, with more virtual downloadable board games, there are tons of community workshop mods for your old favourites. If you don't find what you are looking for, you can make it yourself with a host of creation and custom tools. Probably the best part about Tabletop Simulator is the fact that you can try out a virtual version of a board game if you're iffy about purchasing it. If you like it, great, go support the developers! If not, try out something different.I definitely reccomend Tabletop Simulator.			"

And only in Tabletop simulator can you play a game of LIFE with Furry Cards and laugh at the disgusting cards you draw at every pay day. The main reason to buy is if you want to play board games or card games with friends but a second reason is some of the cringe content you and your friends can have fun with on the workshop.			"

												Ive owned this game for a while but havent gotten into it before. I jumped in to this wanting to play texas holdem and then I got introduced to some tabletop games via other players at first through texas holdem. One of the blackjack tables is very fun with power ups, silly and cool rewards and fun people. Secret hitler is also an interesting table top game, where you have to try and figure out who is a fascist and who is hitler. People will lie and will try to convince you that they are your friend and then stab you in the back if they succeed. I havent had much time with the others, but I think that you can play all table top games in the universe, in this game. With firsthand experience of the fun, and with the knowledge of VR support I can see that this game has a very, very bright present and future. It does not deserve less than 10/10. Its just really really good. And if it doesnt stick at first, give it a go now and again and Im certain you will enjoy it.			"

Lots of content from the community and ability to upload your own decks is a huge plus. Great gaming potential.			"

												Tabletop Simulator is the kind of game you are either going to play once for an hour with some friends, or spend hundreds of hours with your friends playing a variety of board games. The community support behind this game is excellent, and there's is a massive host of games that you can get. Quite the excellent purchase, not only economically ($20 CAD or $10 on sale) but it also provides a unique experience for those of us who can't get together in person to play board games. The automatic scripting that some of the mod creators have put into their games can often times save loads of preparation time,  while enhancing the games themsleves by automatics many tiresome features. This game is definately worth the purchase if you have friends to play with on a somewhat regular basis.			"

												Tabeltop Simulator by itself is a barebones user interface that gives you a digital space to play tabletop games: A table, a background, game pieces, and simple UI tools to manipulate game pieces.Where Tabletop Simulator shines is the Steam Workshop Community.  In fact, I would say the longevity of this software/game entirely is dependant on the efforts of the community.  The active community is always creating new game assets and digitizing popular board games.This game is really the best way to connect with friends who cannot get together physically to play board games or role playing games.

												Great platform for organizing tabletop games with people across the world, what you can do is pretty much only limited by your creativity and imagination. Adding your own art and objects is not the most straightforward though, as it requires you to upload it somewhere online first, but is not too difficult and allows for easy distribution to all players.Drawing on the table allows for taking quick notes, but of course will mainly be used to sketch crude pictures of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥At first it's easy to do simple mistakes with the objects such as dragging the whole deck instead of one card, but after a while the mechanics are pretty simple and flexible.

												Have you played Monopoly? It's here. Mafia? It's here. Settlers of Catan? You guessed it. WARHAMMER 40 FREAKIN' K?!? We've got you covered! I can guarantee you will find any table top games you may have played irl*.*With the small exception of small, local and obscure games****Even though I've seen such in the Workshop.Buy this. Why? Because it's cheaper than ANY tabletop game. And you get ALL OF THEM. Of course, you're limited to the imagination of others who upload (not necessarily) their creations. All you need to do is subscribe to the collections (games) you need so that you may host them.The community. It's great. I've made so many new acquaintances I enjoy playing a sesh of any game you can think of.The value. Enormous. Good example - I've always wanted to start playing Warhammer 40k however due to financial reasons (and living in a second world country) and crippling debt, I was never able to order and/or play Warhammer 40k with anyone irl. Not that anyone here has any models. ANYHOW, back to my point - you can literally almost always find a Warhammer 40K game hosted here. It's like a dream come true!The reasons. Plenty. You will make new acquaintances, you will play games, both old and new, you will have FUN.The learning curve. Anything but steep. It took me approximately three days (not 72 hours in total) but rather three days of playing every now and then a game or two to learn most of the controls and key bindings to make the most of my gaming.My thought on the game? Initially I was skeptical. The price seemed expensive, but let me tell you. Deciding to buy this during the Lunar Festival sale might have been the best decision I've made while I have been on Steam. This is probably my favourite game now. I'm not even overestimating. This is it.If I have to rate my experience, I'd go with 9/10. Why? Because despite the variety of the game, there are always small bits and bobs that can be improved, or games and models can be imported with more HD values, but these are all minor inconveniences and should not impact your decision whether to buy the game or not.Get this. GET THIS. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS REVIEW!?			"

												This game is awesome with a great community they are currently adding the zombicide dlc the workshop is always updating with people adding awesome mods.  It's easy to use with an easy to understand U.I and there isn't a game you can't just jump right into or set one up yourself and play along with friends. Got a great idea for a game make your own with the custom boards and pieces and have the cummunity test it out with you there are always people willing. I highly recommend this game to anyone of any age.			"

												If you enjoy tabletop gaming, whether classic games like monopoly, card games, etc, or more of your niche games like the kinds you might find in a hobby shop, this is a game you may want to pick up. This is a perfect piece of software for those friends who love playing table top games, but either live far apart, or simply can't easily get together in the same place very often.			"

												This is really fun if you have people to play with.  It's great for long distance relations for family and friends and a good way to play free board games you don't have at home - assuming you play board games at home (though a physical copy is better).  It's a good buy if you're gonna use it, otherwise....eh.  You can play global games though if you don't have any friends on hand.			"

												Worth every penny. The amount of board games available from the community is amazing to the point where it is almost impossible to measure the amount of value this game has. One board game from a local book store would run you, on average, $40. For one $20 purchase on Steam (I paid $10 when this was on sale) you can have access to thousands of board games. If you're wondering if you should buy this game ask yourself one simple question: do you like board games? If the answer is yes, buy this game.			"

												When I first got this game, I didn't think much of it.""Oh, cool. I like tabletop games,"" I thought to myself.Dear God was I wrong. I was so wrong. This game is scripture to me. The community are full of genuinely nice and funny people, only some of who happen to share idealogy with an infamous German dictator. The games they play consist of Secret Hitler, Uno, Cards Against Humanity (which I think isn't as good in the simulation), and other stuff nobody has really heard of or cares about.When I'm not collecting lotion or vintage cat figurines, I am ALWAYS playing this game. It's the greatest game ever made.			"

												Do you have friends who live a ways away from you, but find yourself wanting to play a board game with them? Do those friends have Steam? Because if they do, you should both get this to play these games with each other over the long distance.

												C'mon, you can flip the table when you win!  Or lose!The beauty of this game is that, in a nutshell, you're given all the bits and then you play with little to no guidance beyond basic controls.  You either play the game right, play the game wrong, or you throw around a bowl full of dominoes and play bowling with oversized chess pieces while ""Through The Fire and Flames"" is blaring on a virtual iPad.  I don't think there's any better way of playing board games online.			"

You can invite a friend to play any of the pre-existing games or download one of the many great games from the steam workshop. Heck, even if you don't have any friends that have the game you can still have a lot of fun playing with strangers. If you love board games, get this game!			"

												This game is fantastic.  I love being able to have a game night with my old buddies even when we can't all get together to do it.  If the game doesn't have it, odds are the extensive collection of mods holds what you seek.  That being said, the game does seem to be pretty demanding on the system, so be prepared for some lag if you don't have the best gaming rig.  Another issue I recently encountered was that the audio from the server host I was playing with the other day was quite choppy, likely due to his computer trying to balance hosting with chatting at the same time, but hey, that's more than likely the fault of his system and not of the game.  Overall, I give Tabletop Simulator an 8/10.			"

								After playing a small amount of this game, I am already convinced that this is going to be big. Pretty much any game is possible as long as it's not got a large 3d board. Games such as Carcassonne are not currently possible but will be upon the addition of custom block shapes and designs. For a game that is early access, it has a lot of functionality and will improve with mods and work from developers. Don't expect multiplayer to be civilised without friends of your own to play with, you might find a few but for every person who wants to play properly there are two who don't understand the game and flip the table for lulz.Get it.(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻			"

								Great Simulator for an Actual Tabletop. It lets you play Boardgames and other Tabletop games online with other people, without taking up the space required by traditional boardgames and the need to meet in person. It comes with some classic board games by default, but you can download and host some other board games on the workshop, or even make your own. Its a lot of fun, there is some potential for griefing, but if you're the game's host you can turn some of those features off so that you can play your games through without a problem. If you like boardgame pick this up, if your friends have it pick it up. If you don't like board games and don't have friends to play with, I wouldn't reccomend it though.			"

												Tabletop Sim makes it possible to play virtually any board game over the internet...properaly. It comes preset with some classics (Chess, Checkers etc), along with lots of objects you may use for other board games (dice, various tokens, even monsters that actually move if you want to setup a role-playing game), as well as the tools to creating your own board game. Having Steam Workshop makes this game have endless replayibility, where you can download and play virtually any card/board game you can think of (Munchkins is really popular on here). Although most of these mods are copyrighted, and they have a chance to be removed. Tabletop Sim has straightforward UI, with a very quick tutorial to get you used to basic controls. Hosting a game is extremely easy, and it's very stable as long as you don't load up too many objects. Go for it. ...and I thank the devs for supporting Linux :D			"

								A really cool game, that is like realistic game board, where you can do anything with any game boards possible. Really great for a Surface Pro 3, as it meets the full requirements of specs. This is better than any of the basic microsoft board games, like solitaire or Poker. This is really when you're bored, you have nothing else to do, and you got time to waste on, this is the game for you. For others to play, they need a steam account I think, and just buy the game. I love flipping the table over, of course. This is the ultimate sandbox game I've ever seen on Steam, beside Valve's ""Garry's Mod."" I wish there were more of these games that are on Steam...			"

								So even though I do believe that games that have the ""Insert something Simulator"" name are usually horrible, and the people that made this probably lost money from customers just because of that name, I do believe that this is one of the best games out there.  You will get your money back from this game instead of having to buy the games, the expansions, and drive across the world to play with somebody when you can spend a couple of hours creating the same exact game, and play it right in your house.10/10 because you can literally play any game on this and every update has been great.

								I was interested when I first heard of this game back when it was on Kickstarter. I regret not getting the game earlier then and helping the developers out with my money.Since getting this game I've had fun playing tabletop games with friends whom I don't get to see in person as often.On top of a bunch of classical games (Chess, checkers, etc) the modding community for this game is HUGE, allowing many games to be created or imported (Cards Against Humanity, Monopoly, MTG, etc, etc, etc, etc).While this game is still (as of the time of writing this) in an early access phase there aren't many bugs or errors you'd expect in some other early access games. The worst bug you can expect is random crashes, but those are few and far between (in some cases it is the mod's fault and not the game's, such as having very large file sizes that wrecks your computer).All that being said, I highly recommend this game and would like to commend the developers for delivering a great product. I cannot wait to see what else can be added / refined as this game grows.			"

								Like board games? Card Games? Minatures games? pen and paper RPGs? Then you'll like this! It does exactly what it says on the tin. Hundreds of mods on the workshop to replicate anything from long-dead CCGs to modern board games. There are a few rough edges owing to it being in early access, but so far this seems to be one of the good ones. It plays perfectly well, just has a few finnicky little things here and there (exiting the program by closing the window always results in an error message, for example). But it's perfectly stable while you're playing. "

								In an age of silly physics based simulators, Tabletop Simulator is a true oddity. While still early access( and still not having the tablet working for mac or linux users), It still feels very fleshed out. The ability to add new games, recreate real games, or create your own games with friends, be they on a local area connection or miles away could almost be considered a godsend. Overall I highly reccommend this to anyone that enjoys a good game of monopoly here or there			"

												Tabeltop Simulator by itself is a barebones user interface that gives you a digital space to play tabletop games: A table, a background, game pieces, and simple UI tools to manipulate game pieces.Where Tabletop Simulator shines is the Steam Workshop Community.  In fact, I would say the longevity of this software/game entirely is dependant on the efforts of the community.  The active community is always creating new game assets and digitizing popular board games.This game is really the best way to connect with friends who cannot get together physically to play board games or role playing games.

You can find plenty of randos playing poker or cards against humanity or even Magic the Gathering (if you can agree on Formats and houserules), but ultimately, you're probably better off with friends with headsets to be able to quickly and easily negotiate the goings-on of any particular game.Oh, and the ability to flip the table can be disabled by the host.

												Tabletop Simulator is one of those sucessful Kickstarter campaigns. It's a great game, even if you could call it a game, it's more of a tool in which you can play board games, people are porting real life board games into the steam workshop, and even making their own games especifically for tabletop sim. There's a lot of playtime here, even though my hours with the game can't prove it, i would strongly reccomend you get some friends to play this game with you. you'll probably waste more time with friends than with strangers. Also, DLC, Right as the time of this review there are only 2 DLC(SuperFight and Cosmic Encounters) which for people to play, need to also buy the especific dlc. but you can also pay for a more expensive version of the dlc but it let's you play with anyone that doesn't have the dlc. at the end this is a great game, i've been playing it since it was on early access and i can say that it is a must have if you want a game to play with friends.

This software simulates the everyday interaction of the genre, such as picking up figurines, tossing dices, shuffling cards, and so on.While it takes a while to set up, it is simply the best experience online for RPG such as Pathfinder and D&D.The only downside to it all is how easy it is to pirate copyrighted stuff from the workshop.

												Its 20$ regularly, and about 12$ or so on sale, for infinite tabletop possibilities, from monopoly to warhammer and magic the gathering, as well as the ability to make your own games and play them online with friends and faimly. Not only is this a great deal, its on a great physics engine with hundreds of features and the dev's are always out to improve; the game gets better and better constantly. Its litterally infinite games within a game. The 3d graphics are smooth and enjoyable, there are so many small things you can do that make this game a masterpeice. The mod community is great, and the deal here is amazing, 10/10, worth every penny. The only downfall the game is that there isnt a very extensive community for playing games, it seems like you have to wait a little to long to start a game of anything other than secret hitler or cards against humanity. Reguardless of this, its still a much easier way to play games with freinds and family at any given time on the go.			"

												A must buy for any board game fan. And especially for those people who always thought board games looked like fun, but it just wasn't convenient enough for their 21st century selves. Either way, you'll be happy you bought it. It is an absolute blast playing a game previously only played irl. Many said games can be obtained from the Steam Workshop, which imo is one of the best decisions the devs made. My son and I played a game of Axis&Allies 1941 Anniversary Edition and it was some of the most fun I've had in a game in a while. It was in the workshop along with many other great board games. So basically, you can have any game you've ever wanted but couldn't get because they are approximately 80 dollars each. 1. Purchase Tabletop Simulator2.

Currently trying to get my friends involved xD If anyone wants a game feel free to add me, I'd like to learn to play the more updated versions of some of the games and some of the ones I've never experienced due to lack of money before.Visit my steam workshop page as I'll probably work on some mods for this, aswell as other games I have recently purchased.

								Tabletop Simulator is a wonderful tool that allows you to play a massive range of board, card, and dice games, whether they're from the Steam Workshop or built into the software. The controls are simple and easy to learn and almost never feel finnicky, there are a huge variety of pieces and items that are included in the software to create your own games and more with, and with options for online and hotseat multiplayer, playing with friends is incredibly easy. If you can think of it and it can be played on a table, you can probably make it in this game. My only problems so far are stacking cards (you need to be quite precise) and dropping counters into exact places (sometimes, the piece falls at an odd angle, even if the cursor is still and the camera facing straight down). Despite being in early access, this tool is well worth a buy.PROS:+Huge amount of games on the Workshop, as well as built into the software itself, meaning there's a huge variety of games available.+Simple to use, easy to learn.+You can make your own games.+You can flip the table.CONS:-Some issues with precise placement/stacking cards onto a deck.-Requires multiple people to get the full benefit of the game.

												This is probably among my most satisfied steam purchases I've ever made. It's not so much a game as a simulator used to play a bunch of other games. It's basically a physics simulator built around board games, but also has alot of great modding tools, which has resulted in pretty much every board game or card game you've ever played being recreated by fans in a digital format. I don't think it's possible to ever run out of fun stuff to do in this program. Lots of good tools for multiplayer but I've had quite a bit of fun in single player as well. Frankly, my only complaint is that more of my friends aren't already using it.			"

This game is simply great if you even remotely enjoy board games, card games, tabletop pen and paper games (such as DnD, pathfinder, and so on) and even random yelling at your friends for flipping the table 50 too many times after you have had to reset it for the last hour of idiocy at its finest.But really though, with how well all of this is put together, and the community 'mostly' being pleasant to teach a game never before learned is amazing, and makes it honestly worth the price tag.

												Before I begin my review, I was gifted this by a friend.  That has no impact on my review however.Tabletop Simulator is exactly what the name implies.  It is a great way to play board, card, RPG tabletop, and other types of table games with your friends online.  There is no end to what you can play.  From Chess, checkers, Uno, Monopoly, party card games, pictionary, and so many others.  The controls are simplistic and easy to understand.  There is a short tutorial that will show you how to grab cards, use objects and figures, and roll dice.  A mouse and keyboard is all you need.  Graphics are also nice, although some different types of games can lag the program a bit.  Usually a refresh fixes that though.Overall, it is well worth the price I believe.  Even without the DLC you can find an endless number of games to play with friends.  As long as you enjoy tabletop games, you will thoroughly enjoy this one.			"

												This game is exactly what it looks like, it allows to concievably play any possible table-based game.The controls are easy to manage, and things function as you'd expect them to, although sometimes the objects interact oddly.Note full enjoyment of the game requires you to use mods, because the base game only has a few games in it. Which is also its strength, since it can essentially have infinite games in its library if you include the mods.So if you like board games, and want to play them with your online friends, buy this game. And then convince them to buy it aswell.			"
