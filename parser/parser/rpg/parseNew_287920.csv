												With a couple of hundred more hours played then it shows, I also played pre Steam release for a short amount of time.The Positives: Mortal Online has alot of things hardcore players will love to have. Its steep learning curve. unforgiving pvp, Those nerves that tingle when your most precious items and your guilds assets are on the line. It has an amazing crafting system that I have yet to see in any other MMO.  The combat system takes some time to get used to it but feels rather clunky at first. Mounted combat was really fun to me.The taming and breeding systems are pretty decent.The Negatives:Some of the systems in the game are broken and incomplete for a title that has been out for 5 years. For example spear stance, the backstab mechanic, the akward hitboxes for certain melee weapons, the ranged combat with bows is very erratic. There are virtually no combat encounters that do not involve hit and run. Unless you include Seige mechanics, that involves players destroying your assets when your peak players are offline. No different then Ark Survival.   The UI is very simplistic for a game that has been out for so long. So many Inventory bugs happen daily that  doing /droploot to check your gear for invisible items is a thing. Many lores for creatures that are not even in the game are still cluttered in the players skill list, making it even more diffcult for players who already have a hard time learning the game.The community is so secretive about everything that its hard for new players to even thrive. You can barely even get someone in your guild to tell you the correct recipe for weapons and armor to make them worthwhile. Sadly it is because most of the players in the community are on a huge powertrip. They are afraid to be on an equal level of playing as newcomers. It is also why you find very few guides about the game. The official reddit for MO has less then one thousand registered people. I am sure this pushes players away from the game.if you ever really want to know how full of themselves these kids are just take a walk over to the offical mortal online forums in the media section and watch the videos and the trash talking that these guys do on a daily basis. Soon after check the guild politics section and just read the constant pe nis wagging that happens.The last thing I am going to say about this game is the community is downright TOXIC, There are a few players that exist to try and make the game a better place. But overall the game is filled with either present or past hacks / hackers. Undercover gold and asset selling for real cash money.  GM's that abuse power by not hearing out two sides to story or warning you about things before punishing you. Veterans who think that you have to respect them because they have mastered the combat system and therefore will even grief thier own guildmates. (Msg me if you want twitch recordings) and the WORST OF ALL.A community of players that will use DDOS programs constantly on each others Communications during times of war. Or just for any kind of revenge they deem necessary. Abuse of TS adresses. IP adresses, to anyone in thier own guilds and to other guilds. Alot of the functions of the game are client side and can be exploited very easily. Its why duping of items has and more then likely is still is a problem that is reoccuring and hard to track and ban people for.I think thats about enough. I just unsubscribed and will take another year long break from the game and check once again if they have fixed any of these issues or the community has changed. Sad thing is I dont really hold up my hopes. =(As a side note, the pet pathing is the absolute worst I have ever seen. Three to four tickets to a GM a day just to have them returned to you after they dissapear through the world.Edited for grammar, because I am a scrub.			"

												Played game - loved game - spent lots of hours in game - got killed - lost everything. Ok, no problem, it is a hardcore MMO after all. Kept playing game and got ""blue blocked"" (that is when a normal not criminal player intentionally puts himself in front of your attacks so you hit him and you turn criminal and everyone can kill you now) and ganked by 8 people to my death. Lost countless hours... Again... got BBd and killed again... Paying OP player killed me just for the lolz in a starter area where I was farming calmly. Lost couple hours... Again...I get this game, I really do, and I love its concept so much. But the community is SUPER TOXIC. Period.Full of griefers, trolls, OP playing players who just RDM fresh spawns just 'cause they can. It's a cluster♥♥♥♥ of who can be the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I mean LITERALLY, you can just do nothing and wait for people to do the hard work and kill the mobs and then quickly take the fallen loot, just like that, and if they hit you for taking their loot then THEY become criminals. Such logic.There are a LOT of active GMs and saw a dev once and they answer most questions, but when I and countless others asked ""why don't you fix Blue Blocking and accidental hits? With like making it 2 hits at someone to then become a crim"", they just responded: ""that's just how the game is, adapt"". Wow, that 100% confirmed me that the aforementioned problems will NEVER be fixed.It's a shame really. For some reason people choose to show their absolute worst in this game.I don't recommend this game UNLESS, you have: unlimited time to waste, unlimited patience, and don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about other players5/10 - Great concept, cancerous community.

												Been playing this game for 3 weeks and still cant successfully do anything without being murdered by reds at city gates, theives taking everything i own, blue blocking players, and being killed at vendors my criminals. This game is filled with nothing but griefers that will pray on new players making sure they wont leave their starting cities by killing them and taking their stuff. I had to keep on starting from scratch and back up to where I was just to be killed by a vet on horses who armor are almost indestructible and whose weapons can cut right through your armor and kill you with one blow. Even 2 AI guards has a hard time killing them and the guards are powerful. Thats how strong these players are. They even camp the graveyards in the cities where noobs go to make money.Also other players will keep on killing your horse/donkey, the ones you bought with your gold that takes you a couple of days to make, just for the heck of it anywhere even infront of guards just to watch you rant. Most vets in this game are murderers which are worst than criminals. They prey on noobs and gets a kick out of killing them while they're trying to learn the game. They do this because they know they have years and years exp in this game before it came out on steam. You will barely get to explore the world alive because they are also patrolling the lands outside the city to track and kill you. The only way to explore the lands is as a ghost. Be warn, when you revive at a priest, there will be a vet with their name in bold red letters which signals they are murders and they will kill you. Do not download this game because this game is made to support griefers. Im ending my subscription and hanging this game up. I was so excited to see a game like this but once you exp it, you will be let down. Nothing but bad community and too many criminal RP. Today was my last day. What did it was, I bought a horse which cost 4 gold and 50 silver. Went to go buy equipment for it. Had a large bag equiped on my horse so I can carry items to trade. Bought a 1000 food for the horse which cost 1 gold for the journey. I put on my armor and equiped myself with my shield and weapon. got on the horse and was ready to explore. Soon as I stepped out the city gates i made it 100 yards away from the gate. All the sudden POW get hit by a powerful mace and my guy feel off the horse and died. Then I watched my horse fall from one blow. A screen popped up with the murderer name saying report murderer. For what? He is already red and enjoys killing! So far I died more than 30 times in within 16.6 hrs from blue blockers, murderers, and criminals. I lost 4 donkeys and 2 horses from criminals. 10 of those deaths was me trying to leave the city and 2 of those 10 deaths was from me reviving at a priest in a town i traveled to as a ghost just to die from a murderer patrolling the town buildings. For those that dont know what blueblockers are, they are players jumping infront of you while you are swinging your weapon to kill a animal or the dead just for you to accidentally hit them so you can turn grey which grants everybody to kill you and take all your stuff because your now a criminal. Until this game is fixed and im done. Good luck to anybody who decides to download this game.			"

												Enter noob wearing some leather as a robe and leggings, with a helmet which may or may not be metal and equipped with the METAL SHORTSWORD OF UNMANLYNESS and WORN SHEILD OF LIFE.I was so overloaded with dead animals that my run speed was comparable to a fast ant. I needed to get to a vendor, who's entrance was over a hill, far along the wall to the city I had to circumvent. I was going to be rich.Yet at the same time, I knew it would look suspicious to be seen moving at such a slow speed while running. Enter my adorable deer like pet I called NotaBear who I would stop and turn to whenever another person was in sight.As I neared the arena I had to pass before closing in on the city gates, I knew encounters would become more frequent. By this time my daughter was cheering me on! I made it past the arena, only stopping to socialize with NotaBear 3 times, the end was in sight! And then it happened. Enter a man in silver robes covering his body. Blinding me and filling me with fear, he asked what I was doing. How much gold I had. What I was carrying. He told me the command to type that would drop all the loot in my bags, and he would let me live if I dumped my gear. I told him I only had meat. He told me to dump my gear. My daughter told me to dump my gear. I continue to back up with my shield out, hoping to stall for 20 minutes as I walk backwards to the city. You have no idea how slow going this is... I am losing all hope. He is telling me he going to kill me. The end is near. Behind him I see a man on a horse with the largest bow I have seen in the game. I yell out that I am being robbed. He stops. My robber turns and greets the man by name with humility and fear!!My Savior asks what is transpiring, and I repeat that he is trying to steal all my meat. My Savior retorts with a funny meat joke and we all laugh. However my robber still attempts to get me to drop my gear. My crawling backpeddle to the gates looks more hopeful, as my Savior tells me to continue into the city and that this man will leave me alone. I offer my thanks. And then the robbers horse attacks me! Shield up I quickly learn to parry this magnificent creatures attacks. Life is dropping, at 60% life my Savior notices what is happening and runs to the rescue. The robber runs. The horse runs. The Savior gives chase. Moments later, my robber lays dead, and I am free to head into the city, proudly displaying the wounds I earned to keep my treasure!Best 43 silver I ever made.			"

												I am a long time player of MO. I had me and my girlfriends personal information released by a forum moderator because they did not like us. When confronting the moderators, I was permabanned from the forums. This was an account with 16,000+ posts, and I even donated 1000$ to the game in the past. STAY AWAY FROM THE FORUMS. THE STAFF IS CORRUPT.			"

												I started downloading this game with visions of a sprawling medieval land, where I was free to forge my own path. As I watched gigabytes tick away, I dreamed of my homestead. I knew it would be hard, but I was ready for the challenge.Boy, was I disappointed. I started playing the game as a ""fledgling."" During that time, nobody could attack me and I couldn't attack them. I used the time to gather resources. I found a bank, made some deposits. I was disappointed immediately that the only quests in the game were the tutorials, which were an absolute mess, but I kept going. I bought armor, managed to craft a few things but kept feeling like the work was going to far outweigh the fun had in-game. The graphics were sub-par, the UI was reminiscent of Ultima Online's, terribly outdated, the servers were fairly laggy at times, the controls themselves were less than responsive, the items in-game were somewhat cryptic and disjointed and the help system looked like someone just put some filler text in and moved on.A messaged popped up, ""You are no longer a fledgling!"" ""Woo-hoo,"" I thought, ""Now it's time to conquer."" No such luck. Within a minute of getting my upgraded status, I was murdered. I figured, ""Oh, well. It's a survival game. I like those."" I shook off the fact that I lost all my inventory and set to respawning. I found the priest, told him to bring my back and was on my way. I grabbed only what I needed this time and decided to flee to a quieter area. Just outside of town, I was murdered again. This happened over and over. I gave up for the day.I came back to the game the next day and set out, only to accidentally target what was apparently someone's pig. The game punished me and the guard killed me. I set out again. I found a quiet area, it was nice. I was murdered again. I was way out this time, far from a priest. I asked the game to send me to the priest, which takes 60 seconds. I patiently waited, ""20 seconds... 10 seconds."" To my dismay, the game popped up with its message that I had been transported, but, guess what? I hadn't been. I tried again, ""I'm not walking that far."" Same thing happened.I started hoofing it only to come across priest after priest that would only service their guild, with no distinction between the ones I could use and couldn't. This meant walking endlessly, going to priest after priest, just hoping. I thought, ""I could make a new character. That would be easier."" If it's easier to create a new character in a game, and go through the leveling process again, than to simply respawn, it has problems. That realization brought me full circle and I gladly exited. Of course, it made me wait 10 seconds. I ALT+F4'd just to show them I wasn't going to be their plaything anymore.The concept of the game is great, but it is poorly executed, poorly supported and lacks direction. This feels like a college project, not a game meant for production. For anyone wanting to proceed, despite these words of warning, I only say to you, ""I bet you're going to be disappointed.""UPDATE - 10/3/2015------------------------------I still wanted to like this game after my review so I popped back in to give it my full effort before I uninstalled it. I was pleased to find that my spawn issue was corrected (probably due to the server reboot occurring when I logged on) and I set off to a new town. I found that town less ""murdery"" and was able to setup a haul near a banker as to quickly deposit my funds. Although the murders came less frequently, they were still of great impact. Unless you want to run back and forth constantly, you need to amass a decent amount of resources to make the time worth the effort. The murders wipe out tens of minutes of work and are really disheartening.Now, don't get me wrong; I know it's a survival game, but it shouldn't also be work. A murder shouldn't necessarily come with less impact, but should definitely be less frequent. There needs to be a greater penalty for murders, just as is the case in the real world. They provide guards, but that doesn't introduce any real preventive measure, and players are apparently allowed one murder of an innocent before the murdered player can call guards (I'm not sure of the cooldown). I understand what they're going for, but, unless there is some sort of policing when it comes to other players ruining others' experience with the game, these types of reviews will keep coming.So, unfortunately, I still can't recommend the game. What would it take for me to change my mind? Stricter penalties for murdering other players, such as a jail period that equates to actual time lost in-game. I'm sure the problem would decrease drastically. The survival aspect would still be intact, but players would be able to somewhat comfortably navigate the world. If you want to create a pure survival game, then do that, developers, but if you want to create a game players will come back to and can take pride in what they've accomplished, make the question of their survival one that can be answered, not one led by the whims of a murder bound five-year-old with an itchy finger.Developers: Make this Moral Online by doing what any responsible government does: protect its citizens. I won't uninstall the game just yet. I'll ensure I continue to check release notes for these types of changes. If I see a similar dynamic has been introduced, I'll come back and give it another go, consider a subscription and, of course, update my review. The game has potential, and I would love to see it all come together, but I must admit, I won't be holding out hope considering how long the game has been in development. Please, consider the value of a wider player base. Simply satisfying the relatively small group of existing subscribers isn't the best route for funding your development.UPDATE - 5/5/2016------------------------------I just realized I hadn't provided another update. The game never got better and, after seeing how the developers responded to the community, I just got rid of it. Don't hitch your wagon to this horse. It's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will just call you names.

												I've played Mortal Online a bit before it came to Steam and this game has a wealth of good ideas. Alas, there are far too many problems with the game, the hardware backing the game, the devs, and the community for any of those good ideas to shine through.  Here are a few of those good ideas and why they don't work.  +Mortal is now on Steam  with all the benefits that come with it. For the game and the playerbase, I think this is sorely needed, but I'll get back to that.  -Unfortunately, the servers simply cannot handle the influx of new players. Multiple tries are required to log in and gameplay in general is laggy and unresponsive compared to how the game used to run. Especially with Mortal's dynamic combat system, this can make the game almost unplayable.  +The character customization is very unique. Your character is generated by choosing your heritage. The not often seen feature of having your age and height affect your stats is an interesting addition as well.   -However, the distribution of stats can be rather confusing, as there are no tooltips that tell you exactly how each stat point affects your character, forcing you to just guess which stats will match your playstyle.  +The game has open survival-esque PvP in all areas, only limited to how long you think you can last without getting killed yourself.  -This is poorly implemented, however. You will find yourself accidentally taking swings at players, especially in the densely populated starting zones, labeling you a criminal and being killed shortly after. The combat itself is very clunky and slow compared to the speed people can move. Most PvP battles consist of bouncing at your opponent, hoping your attack will connect first or being assaulted from behind while your attacker flees.  +The game has a rewarding loot and crafting system  and you can even loot the items of dead players.  -The latter being inappropriate for this type of game. Mortal is supposed to play like an RPG, not a survival game. You can spend hours amassing materials and crafting items as a simple craftsman with no intent of combat, only to be slain and lose all of your items rather unceremoniously.   +The economy is entirely player run. Most items are made for players, by players. This game may be the only MMORPG I've seen that actually has honest to goodness crafting guilds that function like a real business.  -The economy is broken as hell. Unlike games that have a player run economy that is gently shifted by the judgment of the developers for maximum fun, this one was just left to its own devices. Low level gear is oversaturated and difficult to sell, making the early game merchant completely implausible without first having a high level beefstick to harvest better materials.  Just as well, high level market is cornered to the point of it being cheaper simply to spend the time and effort to make it yourself. Since there is such a high risk of losing all of your items upon death, it makes you question why you'd want to put in the effort at all.  Now that I've covered most of the 'good' aspects of the game, here are some of the purely negative ones.  -The playerbase is horrible. As I hinted at before, I'm hoping Steam will make this game's community a bit more bearable. Almost all high level characters will kill lower levels to grief them. Most are unhelpful and others are downright caustic. Of course that doesn't go for every player, but the sheer number of simply mean spirited people are scarily high.  -The developers don't care about the game at all. I must admit that it has improved a small amount since the last time I played. Unfortunately the game still seems to be in a constant state of neglect. Bugs and issues are everywhere and some are still present since I last played in 2011.  -Most of the GMs are unhelpful. Again, this doesn't go for every mod, but there have been recorded cases of GMs repeatedly scamming players for real world money. On a smaller scale, GMs will constantly 'play' with their privileges in ways that actively disrupt the game, such as spawning bosses in low level areas or even verbally attacking specific players in global chats.  -The game has some very seedy business practices. Not limited to: Capping player skills at a ridiculously low value unless they have a subscription, asking for weirdly personal information such as your address and full name unless you are a subscriber, and lifting any ban if you donate.  -If you are a subscriber, you are allowed to take items from other player's inventories. Plain and simple. You just... take stuff. Like... What the hell, right?  That about wraps up what's wrong with this game. In this state, I absolutely cannot recommend it. The game has some great potential and fun gameplay, but a hardcore reorganization is in order before this game becomes anything that's worth your time.  +++You can also see some top notch elf♥♥♥♥♥♥ "

												Mortal online should be called Potential: The Game.  It is a game full of unlimited potential, from its elder scrolls-esque combat system to its open world.  Unfortunately, after years of playing, I found myself constantly waiting for it to meet that potential.  From constant bugs, terrible combat balancing, to staff corruption, it is one thing after another with this train-wreck of a game.  First things first, the CEO, Henrik Nystrom has no clue what goes on in his own game.  Having dealt with the guy in regards to the testing of new mechanics and game bugs, he is clueless.  There are mechanics in the game from years ago that do not work and he still has no idea whether or not they do, requiring him to hear such feedback from the playerbase and sometimes getting quite indignant when faced with the problems of his game resorting to calling those who bring them up trolls even if the feedback is provided in a respectful manner.  When assisting on the test team, he would blatantly ignore feedback regarding bugs, pvp mechanics, etc and simply to whatever he liked.  He does give the appearance of interacting with the community, though this isn't hard when they remove any type of criticism from the public view.  He is also blind to the corruption of the game, allowing players (of low moral character) to perform GM duties for his game.  One of the previous counselors is actually well known for monetarily scamming money from other players multiple times via various schemes.  This player-based GM system ends up being a major issue in a full-loot game where assets and the element of surprise actually matter.  GMs scout locations for other players, spawn demons and other monsters on top of other players in an attempt to soften them up for their personal friends and major game decisions in terms of cheating, hacking, etc are made by players who have and hold obvious bias.  This is greatly apparent after the donation system where some of the largest backers have experienced some of the greatest success by having relics (items that provide guild specific buffs) dropped in their backyard the day after losing them to other guilds.  I've also seen players with high donations who were banned from their forums for breaking the rules immediately unbanned afterward.  It is pretty safe to say this occurs in game as well.  But that aside, let us get to the game.  The game's graphics look like something from 2010.  Textures are recycled unreal engine 3 type fluff.  It was excusable for a time, but not for a game attempting to make it big on steam.  I'd give them a six out of ten as the game can look beautiful at times, lighting-wise, but any close look is a mess.  It isn't unheard of to get stuck in the mesh as the whole thing is a mess and you can get stuck on something in the middle of a fight and end up losing the equipment you worked hard to get.  Thankfully, they did some work a year or so ago and this improved it in some areas, but made it worst in others.  UI is your typical fare and is reminiscent of an elder scrolls game/clone.  I won't even go into mechanics deeply as it is a very touchy subject.  The game favors large numbers and zergs as they call it.  There was a long period when skill mattered and it was possible to consistently go against the odds, but those days are gone after large donators constantly complained as well as week old players.  If you play now, then combat is simple enough with directional swings and blocks, but you're best finding a guild with a decent amount of players as you'll just end up getting zerged.  If you have grand aspirations as a new group, be prepared to merge or ally into another as that seems to be the norm for newer players.  Once again, this is a full-loot pvp game.  Murder system is iffy.  Five kills and you turn red which means you can't go into a town.  Some feel that is harsh, some feel it isn't harsh enough.  You burn murder counts every 8 hours.  Get under 5 and you're back to blue.  Taken from another review to give you a newer player's idea of the game, ""A thief can steal from you and if you attack him he is able to kill you without getting a murder score.  There are some people on this game with over 1000 murders that have been free from murder score and they walk around in the cities all day.  This is hardly justice at all and any new player will see this as a troll game and quit once educated to this process.""  Take from that what you will.  The community...Well this game features one of the most toxic and destructive communities that I've ever seen.  It is very small and includes those who would lie, cheat, and blackmail using out of game information.  Many will grief you, attempt to badtalk or insult you or even accuse you of cheating while having a recorded history of using cheatengine within the game.  Of course these players still play, which brings me to another point; bans.  Bans do not matter in this game, players who have used cheatengine, players who have duped items/gold, and players who lagswitch still play this game.  They may get caught and receive a short ban, but you usually see them again, typically after making hefty donations.  Some just because they have close associations with the higher ups.  Very sad state of affairs.  Most of these guys are so nasty, I'm sure I will be attacked by name in their reviews for posting mine.  This is the worst part of mortal online.  If you're prepared for all of this then enjoy.  The game is worth a try, but I just can't recommend it.  Even worst, these players, most of who I know, agree that they hate this game, and that if a decent replacement released, they would leave in a minute, but due to some weird stockholm syndrome type deal, they just keep putting up with it.Quick update for those attacking me in the comments (which I expected).  This game has been out for years (standalone) before being released to steam, this is why my playtime is so low.  I played mortal actively on and off for years constantly telling myself it would get better.			"

												Mortal Online....No other game will you ever play be the same as Mortal Online.I played this game for a VERY short time during it's beta in 2010, and I've been playing almost daily since Febuary 2013. I still don't know half the crap that you can do..... (Remember, game was released June 2010, this is just it's release via the Steam Platform).This game truly defines an open world, free aspect. You can do just about anything you want, even with a ""free-to-play (Better called Unlimited Trial) account, excluding a few items and skills that REQUIRE a Subscription (Thievery, Building/Owning a House, couple of mob drops that are used to buy skills that f2p's cannot uteilze efficently, but if you want them, you can pay gold instead of collecting the items and searching for the vendor and get them anyways),  - REALIZE THOUGH - You can never truly succeed in most categories as a f2p. It is NOT a free to play game, it is UNLIMITED TRIAL - Steam forces the Devs to claim it as f2p. (Updated to help with many people's confusion over f2p tag - April 12, 2016)In this vast game, you can do everything from spend your days fishing off the docks of a coastal mediterranean city, to fighting other players in the pitch black Minotaur Dungeon, where a lack of light can mean disaster for everyone involved. Any player can find something to do in this game, as long as you open up your mind, and have the dedication it takes to get your feet in the ground.Now, lets get more practical with some pros and cons.Pros-*Unique PvP System, extremely skill based and rewarding, featuring Full Loot Game Mechanics (Almost every item you have is dropped and open to being taken on death), plus indepth PvE that can be devestatingly powerful and require Siege  Equipement just to defeat. Cons to this system as well, check below for better details it's the first in the Cons list)*Guild Warfare to the MAXIMUM - Players can join guilds, build their own keeps (Or Houses, Towers, Sheds), and create amazing towns from scratch.... Or they can dedicate themselves to the destruction of everyone and everything around them. Most NPC towns can even be taken control of by Player Guilds.*Amazingly vast areas to explore. Everything from ancient ruins of lost civilizations, to the darkest pits, filled with beasts of untold power can be found in this game. All this, along with an AMAZING sound design, from the ambient sounds of the Sewers to the epic Soundtrack of Sarducca.*Extremely complex and in-depth crafting system where players must start by retrieving the materials via Extraction, Refining, Butchery, or picking them up off the in-game map before you can even really BEGIN to make the items you need to level lores to craft efficiently. The possible combinations are nearly limitless once you start digging in, and there are plenty of unexplored areas (Like Alchemy).*Consistent changes are being added, like ingame voice. It's really buggy, but they're working through the kinks to see if they can make it work efficiently. As of right now, it's a buggy mess. (Added this bit April 12,2016)Cons-(Removed the Toxic Community Part - It's not that bad anymore, just get some thick skin and it's no worse than many others. Improvements have happened! April 12th, 2016)*Combat is extremely difficult, and relies quite heavily on your CPU's Ability to perform. If you've got an old PC/Potato, you're going to fail at PvP, struggle in PvE in this game. A fact of life. *If you live far from the server, stationed in Northern France, or have generally terrible internet, you will have INCREDIBLY high ping. It WILL pose a problem, but many players have managed to get around it. A fair warning, players have been banned before for having TOO high of a ping. A downfall of the client side choice, cannot be helped. On the same note, if you get better internet and prove it to the GM's, they will undo said ban, as it's only fair since you fixed the issue. There's a decent population of Aussie players in the game, some have had this situation occur. You want lowest possible ping (Added to help understand that internet connection is important in this game. April 12, 2016)*Filled with bugs, that are always coming and going as they please. You can never tell when something that currently works might break, or another bug will show up again. (I expanded upon this, adding a Pro in, it refers to a great idea that is currently craptastic and bug riddled. Small teams work slow - April 12th, 2016)*Game takes a lot of time to max skills, create gear, and even travelling can be a challenge. A subscription is a MUST if you wish to ever make decent gear in the game, sorry. *AI can be a bit wonky at times, and the tutorials can leave a newer player confused. You must learn to rely on in-game player assitance, and even the forums on the website to learn as much as possible, as help-chat is time-limited (Time limit was extended greatly recently for Help Chat. You can still be kicked out for being a nusience after warnings - April 12th, 2016)*Occasional game-breaking balance changes (Usually fixed in 2 days or less) occur. I name this because it's a pet-peve, but do not take your anger out on this small team of Devs, as they're just trying to improve the game and keep it fresh.*Literally the steepest learning curve in any game I've ever played. It's crazy hard.*Subscription is truly a MUST for any player wishing to truly succeed in this game. I know, I know, it says F2P, but it's not. Sorry, it's just a part of life in joining the Steam Community that it went that way. It's BS.*If you tick off a GM, expect to get treated like crap. There aren't many, and they don't forget names. You will be put on a crap list, and don't expect them to do anything. Ask, and you shall recieve. Demand, and you shall get ignored. It's BS, but they have dealt with too many guys over MANY years who played the system, along with many truly corrupt GM's in game from the old Player-Councilor System. (Added to warn - BE NICE TO GM's OR IT SUCKS. They're jackholes at times, but that's almost always because you did something to tick them off. Please and Thank You, along with sincere questions are the best way to get some real support. April 12th, 2016). *Game takes up a huge amount of space, and is BEYOND poorly optimized. It'll run just fine on most modern computers, don't start claiming you run Witcher 3 and Fo4 on perfect and crashed and couldn't run MO, we all know you probably are just trying to hide your poor little potato that mortal fried into some nice warm french fries. But that aside, even guys who can run those new, graphically intense games have issues with this game. It is poorly optimized, and will crash randomly, might not want to start, etc. etc. Game is weird, any problems that are consistent should be reported onto the forums (MortalOnline.com/forums) in the bugs section first, then go to the Round Table and ASK for help. Don't be whiney/demanding or you're going to get some real h8 from the community, including me probs. (Added April 16th, 2016. It's a fair note).*Game is full of griefers and trolls. They feed on mechanics that are imperfect. Accept them, beat them at their game, or even join them, they're here to stay. They recently added in an option that disables your ability to hit players who are blue, so as long as you turn that off, the common complaint of Blue Blocking is a thing of the past. (Added for greater impact on the extent of the subject. It's not as big of a problem as you might think, because if you can't handle these fools, you're not right for this game probably - April 12th, 2016).This game might very well take your life over....Do you think you have what it takes to become a Mortal? Or will you just become another casualty, unable to cope with the brutal difficulties of day-to-day life in the world of Nave?Why don't you come find out.EDITED - April 14th, 2016 for new changes.

												Mortal Online - More than a first look.If you have the majority of reviews of this game, most are written by either users who:1. Played for 10 minutes.2. Played for maybe a week.3. Complain because others are better at the game.4. Don't understand all games have bugs (Yes this one has quite a few, however this game is so good it doesn't matter since they are not game breaking, just irritating.)5. (Probably the worst... ) Can't handle the player community of this game.. Yes, it's probably the worst community, not going to try and ignore this.  It's a Full loot PVP hardcore sandbox... its going to bring out the worst.Me, I've played for several years, before mortal came to steam. With steam its getting alot better, and at a much faster rate. But it's brings COD fans, idiots, and immature user's who do not understand, or even like these sort of hardcore games.  I've dealt with countless bugs, the horrific community, and sadly, terrible customer support. But none of this, would ever weigh heavily enough to stop me from playing this game.  I've always wanted a game like this, and this is exactly it. No other game offers what mortal online does. The combat: Melee: You have directional attacks, directional blocking, different damage types (Blunt, peircing, slashing) And armor/resisting the same (Blunt, peircing, slashing). So not only do you have a variety of how you attack, you have a variety of damage types. Once you learn the game enough you can look at another player and seeing their armor type, and materials it's made of, knowing what its weak/strong against. The combat in this game is the MOST fun I've experienced.  And the absolute best part, It's not super gear reliant. Myself and many others have defeated players with higher end gear, while being naked with a started sword known as ""worn shortsword"". So your not 100% screwed if they out gear you. This combat system is skill and knowledge based, not gear reliance based.  What is there to do in mortal? Plenty. You can be a crafter, weaponsmith, armorsmith, cook, alchemist, tamer/breeder, miner, woodcutter, extractor, refiner, butcher, bowcrafter, engineer, and more. You can be a Footfighter with swords, axes, daggers, clubs, poleswords, fistfighter, mounted combat, mounted archery, a mage, a dominator who utilizes pets to fight with/for them. You can build your character to be however, and whatever you want. There are no restriction besides the total skillpoint usage. As far as the F2P, P2P, P2Win, etc. This game is NOT F2P. It is P2P with an infinite trial. However, you can play this game as F2P.. Just not as efficiently, and with crafting no one would not recommend it since you cannot make very good items without having max skills/lores.  PVE though, you can do everything a P2P player could do, if you have the combat skill,To experience this game the way it is designed, and meant, then purchase a subscription, it is most definitely worth it.If you do choose to give this game a try, don't be like the majority of others and just hang out in the starter zone. You will get angry, you will be dissapointed, and you will most likely quit playing the game. I think the starter town and how you start this game should be completely redone and reworked. But in the meantime, if you hang in there, ignore the idiots around you, then you will experience the game as it really is, and when looking at these reviews feel the same way I do which lead me to write my first game review. No matter how bad it pisses you off, no matter how angry people make you, you will always come back to mortal online, because its just that damn good.			"

												Mortal online can be a great game if you sarround yourself with the right ppl.This game is a true sandbox mmo which is very hard to comeby now a days with a skill system similar to the elderscrolls series.I personally have had a blast with my guild through the highs and lows that this game can bring. To adress some of the negative comments i have been reading here are some tips to get the most out of mortal.1. Get out of the starting cities Morin khur and tindrem as fast as possible. This is where you will find the most thieves and the most griefers who come there to take advantage of your inexperience. Avoid toxai as well since there is a well known guild that gets off at killing newbies there.2. You are going to die and lose stuff at some point. This can be frustrating but it is a pvp full loot game so become smart about banking stuff you dont need to carry around.3. This game is meant to be played with a guild. You will have a really hard time without guidance and help from vets in the guilds. This isnt like any other mmo where you can just look up a guide from newbie to vet and be fine. A good place to look for guilds is the mortal online forums guild recruitment section where guilds  display their playstyle and tell you a little bit about themselves. Join a helpful guild as soon as possible but do your homework on what kind of an outfit you are getting yourselves into.Most of all have fun with the group you play with. In any game its the quality people that i laugh in teamspeak with that keep me coming back.Good luck ingame			"

												I've probably played a total of 2500-5000 hours, the majority of them pre-steam.So much unused potential.One only has to go as far as check the reviews and steamcharts of this game to see the sucess of the steam release.http://steamcharts.com/app/287920For the past one to two years they've been progressing backwards in development effectively removing features from the game.The game lacks sufficient funding and competent developers in order for the game to be developed at an acceptable phase. A certain stubborn CEO made sure the steam release wouldn't succeed.There's so many placeholders in the game of content that hasn't been released yet being added into the game over three years ago.A proper magic system,Tailoring,Fletching,Sarduccan papyrus,pottery and the list goes on.A toxic and stubborn community. Granted the game was released back in 2010 and a big portion of the people that still play the game have been since release.Anything negative posted about the game on the forums will end in a swift locked thread and anything too critical will be terminated. The Mortal Online Forums has a no tolerance policy for negative criticism. The Forums are regulated in a similar fashion of an oppressive regime.Are you willing to play a game which is basically in a pre-alpha stage with various bugs such as items in your inventory becoming invisible same for your bank, pets getting stuck,enemies being invulnerable to damage and mind you all of these issues exist in a full loot pvp game. And getting help usually takes a very long time.Aswell as having to deal with a support team that's terrible.Overall the game suffers from lack of funding,incompetent develeopment,support team and the CEO has personally interfered with the game disregarding what's best for the game in order to fulfill his ''vision''.Also.. The game's lore is supposedly written in 'Advanced Swedish' a language unknown to myself and being a swede myself that's rather odd. Appearently they haven't been able to find a person to translate it for the past 5 years.The game lost roughly 81% of the steam population during the first 4 months of it being released.The population of the game is not large enough to support the ingame economy that it is designed to have forcing everyone to be self sufficient, subscribe 1-2 accounts and have 4 character slots each and you have to pay.  This Game is poop  "

												This game would be amazing, great concept poor execution and upkeep. It has impoved greatly since the CEO became wealthy enough to support more devs and art designers. But still it lacks bug fixes it requires to be a finished game, whilst more ""content"" is added over underlining issues being bandage fixed. The mechanics of the game are poorly thought out and if you want to be competitive you will have to understand the ""prediction system"" in the game a system that compensates for latency between players and the server and abuse of this mechanic makes the top players the ""best"" ontop of stamina management and positioning in fights. The truth is its a greifer game and steam is bringing alot of sheep in so it has injected more life into the game, because the game is so tedius and unpollished the steam charts have shown a decrease of 1000 active players daily down to 500. Were before steam release it was around 200(That is being generous). Not that this game is hard it has a very low skill ceiling and simple combat mechanics, the crafting system is very indepth and time consuming being the real grind of the game. It takes a few days to skill a new character and the meta is constantly shifting due to the devs incompetance to properly decide on the direction they want to take. Along side the player gms who still exist under a veil of lies stating there is no gms/hcs that are allowed to play. It is all deception in order to create the illusion there is no bias wen it comes to the people who run the game. The game has a long history of abuse by the children given power to answer petitions because Starvault can't fund outsourced or payed Game Masters and Councelors they use their comunity as a source instead. Obviously anyone can understand the issue with that. My point being if you want to get a sandbox game to fulfill your desire to full loot people and risk your own loot at the same time, this game might be for you if you can get past the curruption, hackers, duping, annoying bugs that seem so simple to fix but have been in game for over 5 years, the♥♥♥♥♥♥comunity filled with people who want to play a greifing game competitively then sure maybe this game is for you. I only log into to pvp its all I can enjoy to do but gl getting the resources to support only doing that. You will have to farm tedius unexciting pve content that is lack luster compared to veterans farming spots and never beable to compete with people who have 5 years of experience ontop of nearly unlimited resources. I personly will continue playing sparatically because I have so much time invested in the game but I dont see many people continueing playing as a new/begining player.Sincerely -CDXX			"

												Where to begin? Mortal online, as I'm sure many reviews will point out, is not for the faint of heart. You will die. More than you intend to, but rather than analyze the gameplay I am going to tell you my experience, because that is what MO is all about. (summary at bottom)Day 1: Wow this game is beautiful *cue dramatic opera music* the blume is perfectly balanced to add effect but not obscure the marvelous garden before me complete with a variety of trees, flowers, and an aqueduct. The person that convinced me to play eagerly awaits my arrival, and laughs when I ask about quests. There is only one quest in the game and that is the tutorial, it teaches you the absolute survival basics and nothing more, but you get a lot of free stuff at the end so that's pretty cool (some of it actually saves you a LOT of gold).Day 3: This crafting is amazing. No other word for it. The depth and variety of recipes you can try be it cooking, alchemy, armor or weapon crafting, simply dumbfounded me. 100h in I can barely craft any useful armor. At this point some will say ""ugh 100 hours to get almost nowhere?"" and stop reading, but don't. Because what I will tell you is that due to the depth of crafting, infinite possibilities, and unique difficulty of getting useful materials, every piece feels hand forged as though it is a part of me.Day 5: My first encounter with a red. I just bought my first horse, it is a magnificent purebread desert horse, agile with high stamina. I tab out to check the map while riding my horse at half speed. Before I can tab back I am on the ground, my mount is dead and my friend is running for his life. Utter chaos. A large man on a horse the size of a car mows him down, I am desperately dodging his moves but to no avail, I die on the spot and he loots my corpse... Peasants unite! I, while hopelessly rummaging through my bank wondering how to make up my gold hear that a group of random players went out, fought and carted him to death, and that someone got my gold. They promptly returned every single piece without so much as asking for a thank you.Day 7: Things are going pretty well, I can consistently gather materials safely and outrun most threats on my new horse. Enter someone I now consider a very close friend. We joke about rope dresses and whatever other manner of ♥♥♥♥ed up things in the help chat. You'd be amazed at how much you can come to like someone spending 40h with them in 3 days lol. I couldn't help but trust them because well... they got my jokes and seemed like a really chill person. Come to find out a bit later that this person is slow to trust and I think I'm crazy because they trusted me pretty quick. Point I'm making is, no MO does not always have the best community (I personally know how bi-polar help chat can be as I am a frequent user), but among the common rabble there are real people, with real feelings, that can actually be pretty nice. Look for the diamonds in the rough, not the sticks in the mud.I drowned because my horse threw me into a river while I was wearing heavy armor. I have been pk'd twice (which some would call lucky). The armor I make could barely suffice for PvP. But you know what? I love this game. And it is not F2P it is unilimited trial, I should make that very clear. A lot of people say ""skill caps are 60/100 for free players"" but might I point out ALL players are limited to 1100 primary skill points. I am still free, and ya know what? I don't mind, if anything for the time being it allows me to have a wider variety of skills than a paying player. Do I plan on subbing? yes. I do. Do you necessarily have to? no. But that's all I have to say, decide for yourself :) and if you want free stuff from time to time, feel free to add me on steam and message me when you're on MO, I can spare some better than average gear. (This message was approved by 5 other people I was on skype with at the time of writing)			"

												I will keep it short and real. This is an 8/10 game. If you liked Ultima Online before trammel, if you like Eve Online,  and if you like and could handle darktide Ac, then you will love this game.  It is an old school mmo, which I have missed so much. Actions have consequences, death hurts, player politics impacts the world and you! You can be more or less anything you want, BUT you cannot be everything you want. You must choose what paths to follow. You want to be a great swordsmen? You can do that, you want to be a master smith? Sure thing, but you wont be both on the same character.The game offers tons of freedom, and with such there will be childish griefers that camp the noob spawns and pick the pockets of the unaware in main cities etc, but the freedom to do so is what makes this great. You can be a total tool, OR you can walk a more noble path and help defend the innocent from the griefers of the land. Join a guild or form one, build a house, or a tower, or a town. Change the face of Nave!... yes you can do this if you work at it.I have now been playing for several weeks and as a mmo vet of most that have been released, I find this game so refreshing.Why then is it not a 10?..... Bugs. The game is still not 100%. There are mesh holes across the map. Getting stuck or losing a pet into such is not uncommon, though the gms are quick and helpful in fixing this. Pathing issuse occur, some of the features are not fully enabled ( like dynamic weather).   There is also a painful lack of knowledge available where I feel it should be readily available. Guild interactions, wars, Housing placement etc are all far more difficult than they should be. I also think the newb experience is very painful. Enough so that it likely scares off a lot more than it should. Players are given a short grace period of peace, but they often find themselves targets as soon as this runs out. They are given the impression that THIS is the game, and sadly quit before they can get out into the world and realize what a wealth of adventure awaits them.These issues aside it is a fantastic game with enormous potential. If you are new, Stick with it!  Start in Tindrem as advised, it is a safer city.. and DO not let the morons that seek to scare you away suceed.Learn what you can, bank often, and seek friends. There are many villains out there but there are also tons of very nice and helpful players.Last thing. I was shocked and pleased to find out that there is a very decent role-play community out there. Good luck all and have fun!(feel free to message me if you have questions or leave a reply/question and I will check back now and again)Galiswyn Ta'Kier Order of the Grifffin			"

												Let's first ignore the toxic community.  In the help channel you're just as likely to get a smart♥♥♥♥♥answer as you are a correct one.   Next, let's ignore the fact that even in the tutorial zone, you'll get killed and/or your pets will get killed.  Then let's ignore the fact that the very first place where noobs are sent to train and level is a cess pool of random ganking by high level characters and neither the players nor the devs seem to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥that it only serves to chase potential players away.  The game promotes high level characters running around naked with nothing but a weapon, smashing random noobs or their pets and suffering only the loss of a cheap weapon.  If they do kill you and manage to get away from the guards, in TWO MINUTES their flag goes away and they can walk past the guards like nothing happened, with all your gear in their pocket.  Thieves are broken to the point it encourages them to run around totally naked.  You can become a criminal and be killed just for looking at another player's inventory. Mages cost an absolute fortune to get started and to be any good, you need to spend hours using autohotkey to spam damage spells on yourself in order to skill up.But ignore all of that.Here's the real fun.  If you own an AMD processor, you're screwed.  You'll have to reduce your audio settings to CD quality or you'll lag out immensely when you die.  Next, you'll have to turn the game's graphics down to the absolutely lowest settings, otherwise the memory leaks after an hour become so intense that you're running at 5 fps.  And then there's the random crashes with render errors.  They always take place at the most opportune moments, like when you're in a pvp fight, or you're running from something trying to eat you.  The help channel will tell you precisely why these crashes happen.  The game has not been optimized.  I think it's been out for what, 7, maybe 8 years and they still haven't optimized the graphics code?  Compared to fps games like Rust, the graphics look ancient. And when you turn the settings down in order to keep from lagging out, they look even more horrid.  Bugs abound.  Creatures falling out of the sky, rising up through the ground.  Crossing the bridge to the 'new' continent with pets and you most likely won't have any pet afterward or you'll find yourself hundreds of feet above the ground.  And that new continent came out in an expansion 2 years ago and they still haven't fixed half it's bugs.The game really had potential once upon a time.  I really wish I COULD like this game.  But the fact that noobs are given ZERO opportunity to learn the game (there isn't even a wiki to document things) before they get swords shoved up their asses by griefers who've played for years makes this game a closed loop.  Only those who have been there will stay there.*** Response to comments ***I understand Mortal perfectly, and I understand it's market. It's for seal clubbers. It's for puppy kickers.  It's for people who feel better when someone else feels worse than they do.  Randomly killing player mounts in town is not PVP.  It's griefing.  Camping the area where noobs are sent to make coin with high level toons isn't PVP. It's griefing. Killing minutes old players in the tutorial area is not PVP. It's griefing. All of this is promoted because the consequences for griefing are a minor nuisance at most. If you're the type person who'd enjoy setting ants on fire with a magnifying glass, you'd love Mortal. That's the niche it fills. I played EVE Online. For YEARS as a matter of fact.  Yes, there is griefing in that game.  However, you're not going to grief in EVE without consequences.  You grief often enough those consequences force you into low sec or 0.0 where you have to WORK to restore your status.  In this game, just wait a few minutes and you can go griefing again.TLDR: This game promotes and makes money off the disinhibition effect. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect.  So, whether you enjoy trolling, griefing or just standing in the middle of a populated area spewing obscenities or racial slurs over voip without repurcussions, whether you're a narcissists, psychopath, or even a sadists, you'll love the fact that you can PAY a gaming company to ignore and even cater to your psychosis and the game breaking bugs will seem irrelevant.

												I pushed a guy off a ledge with a shield and he came back up and flipped me off.REAL REVIEW:Another reason to not believe Steam reviews. This game is unlike other MMOs in that it DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND AT ALL. You wanna learn how to craft armor and weaponry? Well, go do it then! You don't know how? Well find the trainers! You don't know where the trainers are because the game doesn't have a map? Well look around then!People are getting massively butthurt because the game is not supposed to be easy and simplified for idiots. It's meant as a spiritual successor to Ultima Online, and so far it is in the sandbox elements at least. The game almost entirely lacks quests, too, and that is also♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥people off.It's a sandbox MMO. I thought people like sandbox games? Oh wait, they do if they're simplified to the point that children can pick them up and play them like a master. This is not that kind of game.			"

Posted: September 4, 2015
 Disclaimer:  This game been released for six years. After this time, you no longer get a free pass on bugs for being indie so quit with the excuses.I’ve been along the ride from the start till about half a year ago, when I quit even playing casually because of the blatant GM corruption and forum censorship. So let’s get this going. On paper, the concept sounds amazing. Open world, free PvP, full loot, skill based progression. What is there not to like? The implementation of all those grand ideas, apparently. MO puts you into a car with a broken steering wheel, no dashboard, gear in reverse by default and then smirks at you saying ""lol what, you can't figure it out?! I'm not holding your hand, how cool is that!"".It feels like the devs equal ""annoying"" and ""time consuming"" to ""challenging"", something that is seen throughout most of the game's mechanics. In their strive for realism they made the crafting system vast and imho unnecessarily complicated, but ended up with only a few dozen viable recipes out of thousands combinations. This approach of adding unnecessary complexity (or depth, as some may argue) in an attempt to simulate realism goes through the entire game and all its mechanics, making every task more difficult than it really needs to be. Not more challenging, mind you, as many players would argue, but simply more awkward and time consuming. Every UI interaction is awkward. Every other mechanic feels awkward. This is a small company and indie company, but again, after 6 years.. I expected more. This quote from another player sums up the problematic dev attitude that doesn't differentiate between challenging and annoying imho: ""It's a VERY annoying start, and someone in /h suggested that I just go afk chopping wood to raise my attributes. I did just that and it helped.""Then there are GMs. Being on limited budget, devs recruited some players as volunteers to act as GMs in the game. Some of them were underage and most of them had ties to guilds. That went pretty much as expected – favoritism and corruptions ran rampant and any discussion about GMs’ actions such as choosing to restore a destroyed asset, or spawn assets, were censored from the forums. And that is in a PvP game. Devs showed little interest in addressing the situation, but instead, according to many, had a hand in it. According to some it got a bit better, but it already made many including me quit and I would still hold devs accountable that it even got that bad in the first place.That being said, the concept itself is interesting. The open world and almost free building, aim based combat, rather complex skill trees. I really enjoyed the first months in the game until the novelty wore off, and my time with others. The combat is probably the only thing that is as complex as it should be, and is actually skill based (bugs aside). But the rest just feels so.. clumsy and unnecessarily complex, instead of actually challenging your skill as a player. The majority of the challenge in MO comes from how awkward everything is, rather than player skill.  You will find fans defending the game as being too ""hardcore"" for critics, but it's not hardcore, it's simply badly designed, unbalanced and buggy. Dark Souls is hardcore. DayZ is hardcore. People love those, but for some reason not MO. Even after six years, the game is not ready for Steam release.. The launcher options did not apply to my game, I had to rescale from within game settings. I couldn’t even log in, after seeing queue ticking down to 0 it just vanished and I was left staring at the login screen once again. After two days of trying, I finally got in, only to realize the node lag is still an issue, after six years of development, and the server can’t even handle 1k players currently playing (according to steamcharts). It’s ridiculous.The concept itself, again, sounds very promising. But its implementation falls short and I honestly can’t recommend it. It’s just awkward and annoying instead of challenging. But if you are desperate for a full loot PvP game and love the challenge of trying to navigate the UI – go ahead and give it a try. It’s free after all, although capped at a skill limit. You’ll make a nice cannon fodder for the players camping newbie areas.			"

												Let me just say that I played Mortal Online for MUCH longer before having downloaded the Steam version. That said, let me begin.Many people have a problem, or several, with Mortal Online. Some of them:-""The game is too hard!!!"" - Yes, it is. It's probably the most punishing game I've ever played, and I have played the Souls games. It's a matter of taste. If you're a casual gamer, and there's nothing wrong with being one, this game is definitely not for you.-""It wants you to put too much time into playing it!"" - Again, that's true. In Mortal Online, you're not a valliant hero of the day, not at all. You're a mere peasant, a worthless sack of flesh and bones, and you need to actually work on improving your character. I suppose many like that aspect in theory, but not so much in practice.-""There's no auto-travel and it takes a long time to move between areas!"" - I don't like this aspect myself, but it's there to make it more likely for you to get murdered along the way. Don't like the fact that your character is fragile and can get ambushed at any time? That's perfectly understandable, but it also means you probably won't enjoy the game.And...-""The skill cap!"" - Absolutely. I definitely hate subscription-based games myself. I'd rather Mortal Online cost something like 30 euros and let you play without the skill cap, and you could buy cosmetic upgrades etc. with real money, or something like that. In Mortal Online's defence, many MMO games can't be played AT ALL unless you're subscribed, and you can still play Mortal Online for free if you're that way inclined. Is it enough of a reason to not make me recommend this game? No, it's probably my favorite MMO game of all time.Those were the cons, 3 of which can be pros, depending on what you like.What about the ""pure"" pros, though? Let's see...-The community. It may seem weird, since you have tons of unfriendly RPKs (Random Player Killers), so why do I like the community? It's not just the occasional banter in the chat, but also the fact that when you get ambushed and slain, you can go back to a town and report the murderers to other, more combat-savvy players, who will then group up and take out your enemies - it creates an amazing sense of unity, at least for me.Or you can form a caravan with other players before venturing out of town and only hope that they don't backstab you. This sense of constant danger is, in my opinion, AMAZING for immersion!-The mechanics. The combat is quite in-depth, you have an incredible amount of various skills, you can do anything from cooking to forging weapons, which brings me to...-(Almost) endless possibilities. You choose who you are. Want to be a great hero? No problem! Want to tame powerful creatures and then sell them and ride some of them yourself? Go for it! Or perhaps you want to be a miner? Can do!... Again, this brings me to another point, this one might be either hated or loved...-You choose your own story! There are no quests apart from the tutorial part. Maybe one, where you're simply told that you can slay the undead in a graveyard and you'll get some money for it. You're not controlled by anything or anyone. The only quests that you might get are from... other players/guilds!Also, one thing that needs mentioning: The skill cap, again!The skill cap can limit who you can be. If you're subscribed, you'll be able to craft excellent gear, but if you're F2P, not so much. You can still be a great F2P tamer or a warrior, though, or just be a bit less-skilled weapon/armor-smith and sell your items for lower prices, to less-demanding players!TL;DR: You either hate it or love it... and still hate it a little!

												It's like a never ending alpha for a game made 10 years ago that you can pay a subscription fee for. I can't in good conscious recommend you try even the free version. The 9 hours I have on steam are only a small amount of what I've played. In the many years I've been following this exactly bugger all has changed, it looks and plays like a uni students pet project.			"

												Listen boys, this game has had some real growing pains. This game launched back in to 2010 with many bugs and a new dev team with wide eyes. A lot of mistakes were made and a lot of players were lost, but this mistakes were the result of growing pains, brand new developers trying to understand the industry.As time has gone on the game has gotten better, now we are at the point where the game is a finished product. Saying that now compared to 3 years ago would of been a joke, but SV stepped up to the plate, grinded out countless night and have made quite an addictive game.Just be careful, this game is potent.

												If you want to be able to explore and defend yourself you need to build your character for combat. Once you have a character built for combat you have very limited ways to get equipment. You can’t do anything else effectively if you focus on more than one thing.  Nobody wants to pay a subscription fee to be a miner. Seriously who is playing this game and saying “wow the mining is so bad as*. I hope I can join a guild and mine for them.” What really pisses me off is I like this game, but when the easiest thing to do is build a fighter and kill people for their shi*, well you’re going to have a world full of people who wonder around killing people for their shi*. I get you have to work together; a miner gets materials for an armorer etc.  That’s cool, but if you do not master fighting you will just die. All the red assho*les in the world are not miners and waiting for a knight in shining armor to log on and protect you while you mine is as fun as it sounds. I don’t think you should be able to solo the game and acquire every skill, but if I am a master weaponsmith and a spider comes along I should be able to do more than say “eeeeee spider somebody save me!”			"

												I played almost 1000 hours. The positive side is this game is amazing except bugs and crashes. The idea is same with ultima online. But, i had 2 subbed char 5 slots so i played almost with full efficiency. I built my first town, my banker got lost every 10 minutes couldnt use bank i had to call gm 10 times in a day because they said you built on a node line. Why there is a house spot on a node line? it is not my fault please move bank because we didnt know. They said no you have to deal with that problem we dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ So i built another town in another continent name sarducca. Again a node line. Can not build any♥♥♥♥♥♥in our territory because they say they blocked it. wasted like 3000 gold. they say they wont help. So why put house spots just near the node lines? I dont even talk about rotten community. ***If you are newbie and just started the game, you will get blue blocked in first 30 minutes in graveyard trying to kill walking dead.*** THEY MADE AN UPDATE THAT YOU CAN NOT ATTACK BLUE TAGGED PEOPLE IN OPTIONS. LIKE 5 YEARS LATER. THANK YOU. Because this is how human being is. they are all rotten. Just dont waste your time with that game. They dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their customers. By the way every old player of that game, they know all exploits and they will use exploit on you. i got killed inside my house because if you push from door of house you are able to see through door and you can aim with magic and they can kill you like this. they can log off near the wall and login, when they go log in they will login top of the wall. So dont make that mistake. Play something else.			"

												Been playing this game for a while now (despite steam hours) and it's exactly everything I look for in an mmo. Sandbox with full loot? Check.Detailed crafting system that can encompass an entire character build? Check.Skill based pvp/pve combat with many many varied builds? Check.Player on Player looting and thieving? I'll kill you if you steal my gold.Mounts? Pets? Taming giant 2 ton bears? exploding heads with your fists? This is not a game for everyone, that's plain and simple. It is very hardcore, you WILL die MANY times to both the environment and other players. This is how you learn, this is how you flourish. Mortal Online is a game that will not hold your hand and coddle you. It is brutal and unforgiving, and this is why I play it, not many other games will give you an actual thrill for adventuring, or pure excitement when you finally battle down that mob the 2 shotted you. No game but Dark Souls (on launch week for the 360 when no one had any clue what was going on) gave me the same feels as this game.Imagine Mount and Blade meets Ultima Online, hardcore sandbox MMo fans you have found your home.Edit: Just to add, this game IS free to play, but I would say the f2p is more of a trial than anything else. Your skills will cap at 60 (albiet they will continue to level regardless so if you do go p2p you will level to those skills automatically to wherever you capped as f2p). The game is not p2w but there is a sub wall. I urge you to try it, and if it's your style you'll see why the people who play this are subbed. No other game, especially an MMo, gives you the freedom that Mortal Online gives you.			"

												There is absolutly no way i can in any good faith recommend this game to anybody. The game is good in and of itself but the community is toxic all the ones who have made it higher up troll the low areas killing anybody who is new thus forcing the game to stagnate which is unfortunate I thought it was a good concept.

												Edited review after 20+ hours in game.I'm a transitioning carebear.  I *never* played PVP games because of the fear-mongering of other carebears on various MMO forums and blogs. I didn't want to be 'ganked' or 'camped'  and all my precious loot stolen.  I tried this game and found out that while it is hardcore and you ""will"" die, it is still fun.  Join a guild, hunt/gather with friends in a group, bank often. Also, if someone is camping you...just respawn somewhere else. There's tons of places to farm.I said in my last review that the suspense of the game wasn't fun.  Actually, I lied. I was out in the wild scavenging. I completed geared up, plus some, from some dead adventurers. I don't know who killed them or if they were coming back for their gear. I stole their stuff, turned gray and it was odd feeling knowing they or someone else could come back and kill me to take their stuff back.Later, I had full mount bags and inventory of caresses and other things worth many, many gold (well to me). It was my biggest, most expensive, hunting trip yet and it was a long way back to town.This is just the tip of the iceburg, but I don't know if my poor carebear heart can handle all this...Crafting is amazing. I hear that there are several potions and food combos that haven't been discovered my players yet. That was one of the things that drew me to the game.  I've read many, many ""Looking For Game"" threads on various MMO forums looking for deep crafting systems and this is it.  People want to make a name for themselves for being *the* weaponsmith, chef, etc.  You can do that here. There are players who have found really good recipes and guard them fiercely, since they are making a killing on the market or keeping it for their guild's use only.I really get a kick out of the fact that you kill people hard enough that their carcasses fly out of their skin. Also, I skinned a player, made a robe out of him. Then, fried his head with some mushrooms and rice. I was disturbed for a moment and subbed shortly after.8/10. Will cannibalize again.			"

												To me, it is currently the best MMORPG available and here is why.What I value in a mmorpg is a combination of 'Sandbox', 'Fantasy-setting' and 'Immersion' and this game meets those demands. It is unique to me because while I'm an altoholic in most other mmorpg's I'm still currently playing the character I created during initial launch. I made a name for myself as a experienced tamer and mount breeder, selling high quality mounts (mount attributes system) and sticked with it since I enjoyed it so much.In this game you will not become just another ""hero"" wearing the same end-game equipment as the others spamming the same skills. Instead you can become a unique personality known to others whether it's due to your unique fighting skills (think mount & blade style of combat), knowledge (guild politics, secrets and exploration) or professions (creating the highest quality potions or equipment).Pro's:- Open sandbox world- Skill based combat- Full loot (adding risk)- Territory control (own keeps, earn taxes)- Player housing- First person (adds to immersion - personal opinion)- Realistic art style- Breeding system & Mount attributes- Player Economy (all worthwile armor and weapons made by players)- In-Depth Crafting systems (Armor/Weapon Crafting, Alchemy, Bowyery, etc.)Con's:- The (current) focus on PvP and Territory Control (which is a pro to others)- Slow development (small dev team)- Subscription pretty much required if you want to compete with others- Lack of meaningful PvE- Bugs and glitches (though declining in numbers)A review from an active player since 2010, which alone is reason enough to give it a positive recommendation.

												Memory Leak: The Game, AKA Ultima Online's mentally challenged brother. I don't want to sound rude, but there's a difference between hardcore experiences and buggy, unoptimized glitchfests disguised as such.Do yourself a favor and play UO instead.			"

												When I saw free to play that kind of deterred me but I'm really glad I tried it.If you liked Ultima Online before the facet split - this might be for you. :)-People can murder you at any time and take everything you have on you-They can steal your things (from your inventory)-They can make armor out of your skinTo a lot of people that might be frustrating and at times it can be but at other times it turns such occurances into epic tales of survival and triumph when you live through an attack despite overwhelming odds or recovering your belongings from your corpse before other people get their greedy mits on them.Plus points:-Very interesting crafting system with no (very few) fixed item recipes-Taming, magic, archery, mount breeding, the works-Incredible degree of freedom with according penalties (you can eat leather but dont complain if it gives you problems :P)-Interesting weight system if you work out a lot like running or fighting or whatever and only eat ♥♥♥♥♥♥ food with low sustenance values you will waste away to a skinny twig (with penalties to your strength etc) - the opposite is also true if you only eat fatty food all the time and rarely move because you stay in town all the time crafting you will get fat ^^-Be what you want to be, a thief, a feared murderer, trader, crafter, adventurer, tamer you name itThis game is not for you if you like:-brainafk farming in the same spot without any awareness of your surroundings (you WILL die if you don't stay vigilant)-keeping everything on your character or at least way more things than you are prepared to lose-the idea that people can pickpocket you and steal stuff from your inventory-questing sprees or any type of themepark-like game experience - you make your own adventure If you give this a go never keep anything on you you're not prepared to lose - even in town.A lot of the negative comments mention Blueblocking which is annoying but this mainly happens in the starting town and the graveyard but this once again comes down to situational awareness, always keep track of your surroundings if people lurk around you behaving suspiciously without actually doing something themselves they ARE probably out to get you in some way or another.Keep enough distance from others so that if you swing your weapon they wont have enough time to run in front of your swing and generally don't swing your weapon around like a madman especially in the graveyard where lots of players are in a small space trying to get the spawning mobs.Or leave town altogether and try to find your luck there where blueblocking is generally not an issue (but player killers are more prevalent so watch out)Long story short I love this game so far it is strongly influenced by ultima online and the degree of freedom is fairly unparalleled. And while that of course opens the door to thieves and spawn killers and other things like that, it also enables you to have a very rewarding experience if you can weather the storm.I enjoy the rush of knowing that training a skill outside of town or gathering things or whatever can turn into a fierce battle at any time - the risk is what makes things that happen in this game memorable, death has an impact.Also beheading someone who killed you before and then making soup from their head or feeding it to your dog is incredibly satisfying :PTLDR; Very rewarding experience if you don't let deaths and loss of items get to you. It is a hostile environment but that just increases the impact random acts of kindness have when a stranger passing by saves your life or hands you a suit of armor because you seem to have lost it all. (Dont beg for things it's unbecoming and everybody hates it ^^)Strongly recommended but don't say I didn't warn you ;)Cheers Wes			"
