												I loved my first playthrough - it was eerie, tense, fresh, and fun. I hoarded coins, I explored every nook, and I took in every giant texel of the environment. I dealt with the enemies carefully, and triumphantly beat the first stage. I was in love.Then I died and respawned. At that point, I realized that the elements I'd loved so much were not appealing upon replay. I understood how the monsters operated, I knew what the sound cues meant, I had figured out how many bullets I needed, and how far away from monsters I could be before they noticed me. I'd ""gotten"" the game in under half an hour of gameplay, and afterwards the whole veneer of tension and horror fell away, revealing a game that's still tough and can be fun, but has none of the thrill that I experienced before I could predict its every move.Worse, the enemies have no apparent otherworldliness other than their appearance. When I think of horrifying things, I imagine creatures or forces which aren't predictable. These threats are very predictable - they don't vanish around corners, they don't change the environment without your consent, they don't even do much with their wandering/patrolling routes. To make this game effective, it needs to keep you from fully understanding the enemy - but it doesn't. It's  the same one-track-minded stateful AI that's plagued games for 20+ years. Even the more interesting enemies (like the statue) follow very strict rules. The game falls into the tedium being too predictable, and offering punishments to the player for not predicting it - when this could have been a game that broke the mold.The game is also not well served by being permadeath. Permadeath only works when you give the player some reason to replay. Maybe you let them play different classes, or pick different abilities, or try out new unlocks they got last playthrough, give them a new goal to chase, or even just give them a persistent gold storage that they can buy useful items from. This game doesn't do any of that. The store is limp and useless, and a replay just feels like rehashing what you've already accomplished - rather than picking up again with determination.Ultimately the game is competently made, it has good generation, some fun textures, a neat premise, and a good opening. It's technologically solid and ticks all the boxes for a good game. But the gameplay melts in your hands - the longer you examine it, the less solid the it feels.			"

												Do you like stoning fish-men to death with big rocks?  I know I do!  But if you're like me, it's a private pleasure and no one must know.  So you creep out at night, ducking behind cover, keeping low to the ground, slowly rotating your irregular bit of rock (sedimentary perhaps), finding the grip to put the perfect english on it, listening for the hop-hop sounds of the fish-man as you slowly peak out, glancing briefly to see that his dopey face is turned away revealing his moist, tender cranium...What was I talking about?  Oh, yeah, Eldritch.  It's pretty good.No, scratch that, Eldritch is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ miracle.  Procedural generation and permadeath, the marks of the roguelike genre are two things that used to send me running like I'm trying to outrun my fat, juicy friend, who is also trying to outrun some squamous monster from the primordial deep.  But somehow the dark wizards behind Eldritch managed to create the perfect combination of play to reach all the way deep into this previously forbidden zone of mine.  Well, that got weird.Anyway, what does Eldritch do so right?  Well, it allows you to move in the least efficient way possible!  Crouching low to the ground to move slow and silent, sliding from a run, peeking around corners while still counting as being behind the corner, jumping and pulling yourself onto ledges you can't quite clear (i.e. mantling).  Those up on their gaming history might recognize these as the controls for the early Thief games and any game that has them and implements them correctly gives me a stiffy.  Next, the game traps you in a nightmarish loop from which you can never escape... something, something, profit?  When you die, resurrecting is only a click away, ensuring that you can get right back into the fray armed with new knowledge that may save your dumb♥♥♥♥♥next time.  The game also takes a bit of the edge off the permadeath by allowing you to store artifacts (the game's currency and fuel for your magic) in banks that will carry over if you die.  And the in-game map is brilliant.  Really?  I'm trying to sell you a game based on its in-game map?  Yes, I am bloody-well trying to sell you a game based on an in-game map!  The procedural generation works nicely, never feeling like you're being led nowhere.  Every square on the map has something to reward your exploration and the map I just touted comunicates it to you brilliantly.  The map doesn't show you fine details, but simply breaks the dungeon into a leveled grid, marking off which squares you've been to and if they contain a major feature.  You couldn't ask for a better companion in seeking out forbidden items spewing particle effects for you to get your sticky human hands on.  Finally, the main game is just the right length.  Doing a patient stealthy run, you can easily finish in about three/four hours.  You'll definitely feel incentive to be careful once you make progress, but every death will make you feel like you're one more corpse in the pile you can climb to victory rather than feeling like you've just graduated college only to light yourself on fire.And that's just the main game.  Eldritch also includes two complete scenarios that lesser games would call DLC and charge you for.  One simulates a cocaine and dynamite fueled rampage through an asylum to bust souls out of the walls and escape to safety before a cosmic horror chases you down and eats you.  This mode will teach you that berserker raging your way through your problems is a perfectly valid solution in Eldritch, even if the stealth is so strong you just want to smear tanning butter on its pecs.  Also included is a long endurance dungeon to test your stealth skills with tough foes, few resources, and no trips back to safety for a breather like are found periodically in the main game.As for the overall aesthetic and treatment of HP Lovecraft's work?  This game was made with love.  Love for unfathomable abominations from beyond the stars that just want to dissect your brain and stick it in a jar.  As Lovecraft fans know, old Howard P. spent a lot of time dealing with the intangibles of cosmic horror where terror comes from not being able to percieve or understand vast entities to which you are little more than the dirt beneath their heels.  He also wrote schlocky adventure stories about explorers fighting monsters and zombies and♥♥♥♥♥♥  Eldritch pulls off the balance nicely.  Most of the enemies you face will be out of Lovecraft's more tangible gallery, but even with the Minecrafty graphics and squishy fish-men, the indestructible monsters like the Shoggoth and Yog Sothoth feel amorphous and dangerous.  You won't spend too long looking at them because you'll be running the ♥♥♥♥ away.  The bigger ""cosmic"" side is represented in the minimal story told only at the beginning and end with text boxes.  You can't represent that sort of thing visually and Eldritch knows well enough not to try, but rest assured it's there and you will confront it along with your seeming immortality.  And on the note of knowing what you can't do visually, Eldritch makes up for it with it's awesome sound design.  The Minecraft look might be a little too goofy to be horrifying, but damn if the sounds don't manage to freak my♥♥♥♥♥♥out. There are few indie games that I think are worth their normal asking price.  I'll admit, I got this game on sale for five bucks and won't blame you if you do the same.  But after having played it thoroughly, fifteen may well have been fair.  Though as a fan of Thief and HP Lovecraft, it's almost like this was tailor-made for me.  Bottom line: if you like stealth games, get Eldritch; if you like HP Lovecraft, get Eldritch; if you're really into roguelikes, I have no idea.  Maybe this is too soft for a dedicated fan of roguelikes, but if nothing else it might be the gateway drug for somebody (me) who is put off by them.			"

												Great fun. Pretty easy on the first run-through. NG+ pushes the difficulty up. The thing I like the best about this game is the fact that your tactical choices have real impact on how you play the game. Do you use your magic and burn through your money, or do you save the money for weapons and health and forgo the magic. Very fun, lookingofrward to the rumored expansion.			"

												I don't think I've had this large a change of heart on a game in a long while. Going into Eldritch, I lost hope almost immediately. A combination of mediocre voxel environments, cartoonish bad guys, goofy sound effects, and stab-happy gameplay just didn't really jive with the whole Lovecraftian aesthetic it claimed to be rocking. Thirty minutes in I'd realized I'd come across pretty much every item I was going to see. An hour in and I'd conquered the first world, having at no time felt threatened by anything I faced. I entered world 2 for a few minutes, finding more of the same. Apart from my grudging admiration for the simple-yet-effective 3D minimap the game uses, I came to the conclusion that there was nothing here worth playing any further for. Bored and angry, I set the game aside for a while, wondering why anyone would publish so straightforward and sloppy a first-person shooter and decide to slap a Lovecraft theme on it.Coming back to it on a whim, I re-entered world 2 and dug a little deeper. Suddenly, things were different. The difficulty spiked up nicely, adding opponents that required actual strategy, that I couldn't just flail wildly at and never worry about again, that left me feeling more than a little nervous. And then I died, though I'm not exactly sure how. I rushed back in, suddenly stripped of all my magic armaments and life boosts, and last less than half as long. Eventually, I figured out what's going on, learned how to dodge the traps, realized that stealth and discretion are actually necessary to survive, and on I went to a fun, twitchy, jumpy run through the rest of this Eternal Darkness / Spelunky / Minecraft hybrid. It's not terribly deep; as I said earlier, you find the vast majority of the items you'll ever see in level 1, and while the monsters do evolve over time, there's not a huge amount of variety here. Oftentimes, new monsters will simply be beefier and shoot faster, but there's enough weirdness thrown in to keep the game fresh. Also, be aware that this is in fact a roguelike. Dying sets you back to the start with just short of all your progress erased, but thankfully this is a game which rewards knowledge every bit as much as it does lots of ammo and a pair of stealth boots.Don't go into this expecting any kind of dignified cosmic horror experience. It's sloppy, it's fun, and it's got some nice retro vibes to it hearkening back to the first person shooters of yore. If you're not sure if Eldritch is going to be for you, gauge your reaction to the phrase, ""Cthulhu vs. the Ninja Assassin."" If that mental image doesn't♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, well hey, here's your chance to see it in action.			"

												The last few years have seen a huge influx of Roguelikes, games that feature permadeath and heavily randomized elements. Roguelike FPSes are few and far between, so finding a good one is a rare treat. Eldritch is just that, inspired by the works of Lovecraft and pitting you against dungeons of lurking horrors. It started out solid and has only grown moreso over time, thanks to the continuing efforts of its single developer.Eldritch plops you into a mysterious library full of books that spirit you away to unearthly dungeons. The main game is three books linking to dungeons holding the souls of elder gods. Once you find the soul in one dungeon, the book to the next opens up. Each dungeon is three areas with three floors each, split into randomized chunks and scattered with items and enemies. You'll find artifacts that work as both currency and spellcasting reagents, weapons like knives and guns and dynamite, equippable gear that gives you very useful abilities, and altars that teach you new spells. These tools will help you navigate the floors and deal with the host of unsavory types trying to stop you from claiming the souls.Despite the cosmic horror backdrop, Eldritch works best as an action game. The movement of your character is reminiscent of older games like Quake, letting you slide around at inhuman speeds. The enemies are a mixed bag, with some like the frogmen and cultists being little more than cannon fodder. You will encounter others like relentless, all-consuming shoggoths and tall creatures that cannot be killed that will complicate your travels and send shivers up your spine. Each book has a clever cross-section of foes that form a confounding package and demand stealth and caution. Some can be frustrating before you learn how to deal with them, but the challenge is well-balanced.The enemies are the real source of fear and tension in the game, despite their cartoony appearance. A lot of games have tried to ape the look and feel of Minecraft, but Eldritch pulls it off well, imparting the same dread that skeletons and creepers do in tight spaces. The block grid nature of the levels can help you space your jumps and keep your bearings, and there are even tools for breaking through walls and creating new blocks. The sound design is minimal, and while a few of the ambient enemy noises don't work you will learn to dread those of the more troublesome foes.In addition to the three main dungeons, there's an extended ice-themed dungeon based on At the Mountains of Madness, and a timed score-attack mode set in a hellish asylum. The developer added both of these post-launch, and continued to re-tune the game to great effect. I played Eldritch back when it launched and it is an even better game now, with more threatening enemies and better balance. As a Roguelike, an FPS, and even a horror game, I can earnestly recommend this one.			"

												Eldritch is a lightweight but fun action-roguelike with a Lovecraftian theme.Eldritch is a roguelike, but it's a surprisingly easy one-- I finished the game for the first time after only about 7 or 8 total hours of play. Certain strategies make completion much easier, and the most difficult level out of the four is the second one. Since you can take the levels on in whatever order you like, you can optimize your playthrough to make beating the second level easier. If you're used to recent commerical roguelikes like The Binding of Isaac, The Dungeons of Dredmor, and others, Eldritch may seem very lightweight, very easy, and kind of simplistic. The bizarre difficulty curve-- with the second level being so much harder than even the secret fourth level-- may also be a bit of a disappointment.Nevertheless, it's fun, well-made, and a good way to entertain yourself for 8 hours or less. The simple art is charming in its own way, and exploring to find your favorite strategies and item synergies is certainly entertaining.			"

												The minecraft-esque graphics turned me off from the game initially. But as I discovered that it was a rogue-like in a Lovecraftian setting, my interest was piqued.I've played and beaten the game--a few times. Aspects of it were frustrating for me, as it seems it has been for most people. But I enjoy the gameplay. You are rewarded for whatever actions you take. Rush through a level? You are rewarded with progression. Rely upon stealth? You are rewarded with safety. Spend a lot of time searching around? You are rewarded with tons of resources and powers that can aid you in a time of need. Manage your resources properly? You can save a little bit for your next run, and you can easily progress and bypass challenges. This game rewards your playing style, no matter what it is. There is more than one way to progress.This game, in truth, doesn't have a lot to do with Lovecraft. It is more of a back-drop for the gameplay. If you are looking for a real Lovecraftian experience, it might be best to pass up on this game. But if you're looking for a fun experience with a spice of something familiar, it's always nice to run screaming from a shoggoth who seems to follow you everywhere.			"

												A highly delicious and aesthetically pleasing stealth ""Rogue-like"" FPS mash-um-up. I'm particularly fond of good gameplay and Eldritch definitely delivers. It has character. It has atmosphere. It has giant tentacle blobs that phase through openings and chase you down until you're crying for more bullets! On the surface it may appear rather dullishly action packed repetitive nonsense, but the simplicity and attention to detail is what makes titles like Eldritch so awesome. There's a high degree of insanity to be had in a hundred different scenarios if you are willing to reach into your creative coffers and pull out a magic rabbit. There are times when you've out-maneuvered and out-brained a few dozen baddies and start wondering where the challenge lies only to slip on a broken tile and be man handled by a couple of living statues that certainly have nothing but sinister intentions. You ressurect and steel yourself for another run only to realize it's even MORE difficult in deprivation of your gadgets and fancy schwahza (Props if you get the reference). How to continue but change your playstyle to suit your capabilities?By challenging you to use your smarts in one wickedly strange environment that increases in difficulty you get a definite ""edge of your seat"" feeling at almost every moment. Highly captivating in almost every way, I just can't help but feeling like I want more. Give it a larger and more persistent map, as well as multiplayer with even more scaled difficulty and a bunch of new mobs/items/spells and Eldritch would be one of the most amazing titles ever as far as I'm concerned. Without a doubt, highly unique and worth every penny either way.			"

												This one surprised me. I remember reading reviews of it a few years ago, but didn't grab it until it was on sale this holiday season. Despite being a huge fan of Lovecraft mythos, the graphics were painfully reminiscent of Minecraft, so I wrote it off as a cheap knockoff trying to sell itself by meming Cthulhu. i was wrong - there is a very clever dungeon crawler underneath the deceptively crude visuals. The cryptic non-traditional game structure succeeds in evoking the sense of ""cosmic horror"" made famous by HP Lovecraft's classic stories. The writing is pretty solid, the atmosphere is appropriately bleak and tense, and the various Deep Ones, Cthonians, etc, are immediately recognizable to any fan of HPL. The creators of this game have succeeded in capturing the spirit of the mythos moreso than some much larger and better-funded developers who have attempted to tackle the same subject matter. The best part is, the devs showed reverence to the classic stories without fancy graphics, cutscenes, nor cheesy schlock horror jump scares - they left the true horrors up to our own imaginations. Players will find themselves wanting to explore deeper and deeper, even though nothing but ever-increasing entropy awaits. The sense of being punished for our own curiousity is the true essence of the Cthulhu mythos, which has been lost general audiences ever since Cthulhu became a meme. This game was lovingly crafted.It's okay, you can thumbs down this review for that last bit.			"

												The visual aesthetic in this game is very similar to that of Minecraft, but it doesn't at ALL take away from the spooky atmosphere. In fact the graphical simplicity is oddly easy on the eyes, and allows you to absorb the eerie ambiance and the minimal - but still great - soundtrack without being completely oggled by flashy visuals. It goes to show you don't need the most advanced graphical engine to make a solid horror game. Eldritch is genuinely creepy, and outright terrifying once you run into your first Shoggath. Or four. Like I did. It really is an unnerving and fun game, and captures the feeling of helplessness and paranoia that Lovecraft is so famous for.Plus the Shopkeepers are Fishmen in cute little bow ties, and a Shoggath in a giant Bowler Hat. Its surprisingly adorable and I love it. "

												A first person action game inspired by Lovecraft, you’re stuck in a strange world, starting off in a library filled with books that can transport you to ever stranger worlds. With fish-lipped people. Because why not.Graphically the game takes a lot of cues from Minecraft, working in a highly cubic fashion, and with the right items you can even destroy or place blocks, although you never reach the point of actual crafting. The whole game is focused around exploration, survival, and eventual escape of the madhouse that is this universe.Then you die, and you get sent to an ACTUAL asylum. The Minecraft-style graphics are pretty decent, the sound design is acceptable, but the gameplay, whilst it works, runs the risk of becoming repetitive before long, if there aren’t more items introduced at some point than what we saw thus far.Still, not a bad title all round!

I can't imagine anyone not getting at least some enjoyment out of it.  Look past its homespun visuals and simple mechanics and you'll find a sophisticated experience that's best described as Dishonored seen through the lens of Binding of Isaac, written by H.P Lovecraft, with Minecraft's makeup and wardrobe, and a little sprinkle of adorable terror.  If that doesn't sell the game to you, I don't know what will.			"

												A game that presents you with everything you need from the start, and casually waits for you to learn its rules. It's a really refreshing time, and a pretty player friendly entry point into the roguelike/immersive sim genre. Levels are procedurally generated, but work from established tile sets that lead to familiar feeling levels; despite their randomized nature. It never feels unfair.

												As a fan of Lovecraft's writing, this was a surprise gem. Minecraft-based first-person exploration and survival set in the Cthulhu Mythos universe. You find yourself waking in a strange old library and have to examine several magical tomes to find a way to escape. Each book is a portal to a different world and contains an orb that traps the soul of an Old One, which can be used to unlock further books.Each world is based on the works of Lovecraft (ie. a winter-set world to the tune of ""At the Mountains of Madness"") and include roaming terrors from the inspired story. You can find a variety of weapons with which to defend yourself (or take a stealth approach if you prefer) and several utility tools to help you better get around. As you proceed you also collect ""artifacts"", which act as the game all-purpose currency. You can use artifacts to pay for in-store items or power abilities.Great level design, atmosphere, creatures, audio and overall experience. "

												I'm not quite sure where to start with this, so I'll just jump right in.In case it wasn't obvious, it's a first-person dungeon-based adventure / roguelike with a definitive goal and end.  Quite interesting for its simplicity with a good amount of replay value.  Difficulty provides a constant sense of tension, but I feel it's far from unfair or impossible.  Very easy to drop in and drop out, making it very accessible at all points of the game, and makes it available for short spurts of attention - not something you have to dedicate to.  Graphics might be simple, but I do think they're appropriate, and far from truly ""minecrafty"".  Length of the game itself is very highly dependant on your skill, tactics, luck, and level of exploration and curiosity, but it isn't very long, relatively speaking.You get a lot of freedom over your tactics and approach, what with destructible blocks, a stealth system, and a small variety of tools that all serve their own unique purpose.  Finding a special power from a shrine adds to the creative mix.Going into much more detail would spoil some of the fun of discovery.  Lovely game, especially on sale.(Apparently I had never given this game my good graces till now.  Unfortunate!)			"

												A bland and derivative dungeon crawler with a millimeter-thin veneer of Lovecraft glued on top. Uses only the most superficial elements of his mythos as window dressing for a game that could just as easily use a generic fantasy or sci-fi setting. The source material does nothing to inform or shape the core gameplay, and this game could easily be retextured to any number of themes without any detrimental effect. Entertaining for upwards of half an hour, before you realize how shallow the game's sytems really are. For a game that actually does some of Lovecraft's ideas justice instead of merely paying them lip service, I recommend Eternal Darkness.			"

												I first heard about ""Eldritch"" from a friend,  When I checked it out I was like, ""Ooooo goody ANOTHER '8bitesque' indie FPS"".  Well it was on sale for 1.94  and I had some spare change and my friend finally pressured me into checking it out.WOWThis game is really, really, REALLY cool.  I have never played anything like it.  First person, randolmly generated, dungeon crawling at it's best.  Also the game really doesn't explain itself so it is up to you to figure it out.  Really neat little game.			"

												Eldritch perfectly captures the strange worlds of HP Lovecraft. Chosen graphical stylisation suits here, between pixels, my imagination fills the gaps, it invokes images of unknown terrors and alien landscapes. Eerie sound design gives this game another (otherworldly) dimension, i was so drawn in, that i tried to look beyond corners from my chair :) Danger of permadeath only heightens the immersion, it coerced me to give my best on every try - to hide from monsters, search every corner for useful items and avoid deadly traps. Eldritch truly evokes sense of wonder and dread, as the player explores these strange and unknown worlds. "

												To go off of what another reviewer said, don't trust how the trailer makes the game atmosphere seem. It's way more tense, especially if you play cautiously.What's interesting about this game is it can be completed in different ways. You can get lots of ammo and shoot whatever moves, you can quickly run through areas and dodge attacks...or you can make the game take three times as long like I did and take the ""must stealth kill EVERY enemy approach"" (protip: Not looting corpses prevents them from respawning somewhere else!).Despite its cube-styled graphics, I think depending on how you play this game, it can be a very rewarding experience. Even after you beat the game, you can also check out the Mountains of Madness, or the Asylum if you're one of those time-trial highscorer types :)			"

												I beat this game after 2 hours and I see no reason to play it again. It just has too little content, there's no character progression, there's barely any items to use. You will find daggers and guns (specifically a revolver) everywhere, I used them the whole game. While there is very few additional weapons, they are one time use for example bottles and dynamite. The problem here is that you can only have 2 weapons on you so if you want to pick up a dynamite you have to get rid of either the gun or the dagger and that is not something you want to do. Since the gun has limited ammunition and the dagger has no range.There's just so little stuff in the game. You will have pretty much the exact same experience whenever you start a new game since you will use the same weapons and there's no class/leveling system or anything to make your character unique.

												Eldritch is a first-person stealth roguelike.That said, the stealth aspect is optional, fighting things head-on or making a mad dash for the exit is just as valid.Everything's carefully crafted and tuned so the game feels like a scarier Spelunky.Yes, it's scary. Don't let the blocky graphics fool you, Eldritch is very unsettling thanks to its sound design and and enemy behaviour. You're always a few mistakes away from death, you can see and hear them, it makes you want to hide and never get out of your corner, but you need to proceed and face them.However, as you learn enemy behaviours and feel more competent, you'll also feel safer and more in control. Each of the 5 levels starts out terrifying and becomes familiar with practice.			"

												Eldritch combines a decent survival like gameplay with lovecraft inspired story. The latter contributing to the recent abundant  fun oriented lovecraft derived game topics (""Chtuhlu saves the world"" et.al.). The game mechanics allow for a minimalistic yet enthralling gaming experience. The player starts in a library and loses him- or herself in different books, which signify as levels in the game. The levels offer a variety of enemies and challenging architecture.As much as the game itself is fun the topic is entirely misplaced. Any decent reader of Lovecraft will be astonished by the lack of proper realisation of lovecraftian topics (i.e. ongoing degeneration, non-explicit creation of gothic elements to name just two).  Anybody interested in the game type itself will probably not be disappointed - anybody who is on the lookout for a decent adaption of Lovecrafts literature into a videogame should just keep searching, as he or she will not find it here.

												This game is a fun game for those who like action games with a challenging difficulty and for fans of H. P. Lovecraft. As a fan of both, I enjoy the gameplay of Eldritch as the graphics have a retro yet updated feel to them that makes the game more appealing for me personally. It's a fun action game that combines the challenge of puzzles in fighting enemies taken straight from the mind of Lovecraft with level names such as Nyarlathotep, it really is a unique game. Highly reccommended for all.			"

												A Cthulu mythos inspired advenutre with rouge-like elements that will pretty much dictate your enjoyment of the game. Procedurally generated levels will challenge and almost certainly frustrate you; since you lose all of your progress upon death. Despite it's Minecraft-like graphics which leaves some monsters looking silly or even cute game can be creepy and downright stressful at times. This is mostly due to it's great sound design that will teach you to listen and identify what enemies are shuffling, wailing, thumping or snoring in the next room even before you see them. Risk/reward gameplay agumented by locked secret rooms that may or may not have some crucial health or ammo, and shrines that will give you spells powered by artifact you can collect around levels combine to create a stressful, disheartening experience that remains true to it's source of inspiration even though It did occasionally left me feeling like I'm just repeating the endless cycle of dying and resurrecting until I get that perfect level setup. However, despite how many times I got killed by a dodgy platforming section literally two feet before the game ending, there was always a presence of that ""I can't quit now. This game will not break me !"" feeling. Definite reccomendation if you like rouge-likes and Lovecraft.			"

												Just like Crypt of the Necrodancer (fantastic game btw) this game combines two concepts which wouldn't seem to work well together on paper. Those two concepts are stealth and dungeon crawling. Somehow, Eldritch manages to pull this strange combo off excellently, creating a difficult, tense, edge-of-your-seat experience so chalk-full of the Cthulhu Mythos it's practically got a Hound of Tindalos emerging from one of the corners of your monitor. The campaign may be short, but it is challenging enough to stump you for a while and it makes up for the short length with excellent replay value. The only major shortcoming of the game is that death, while not permanent in any way, feels quite defeating after staying alive for a long time, which has caused me to stop playing on more than one occasion, even while streaming. This is not an issue unique to Eldritch: many drawn-out roguelikes also suffer from it, but it is still unfortunate where it pops up. That being sid, the game is extremely enjoyable, and certainly worth your money, especially if you know your lore.			"

Don't be afraid to take a sneak peek. It's better you find the monsters before they find you. Enemies can hear your steps and follow you all the time. They even can open doors, so you'll never be safe. Also, you'll do everything to don't die. Every life matters.All in all, Eldritch it's a game to be played slowly. Keep in mind that there's not much action here. Instead, there's a lot of tense moments and a great feeling of satisfaction when you can finish a stage alive.How long can you survive in this hostile world?			"

												Eldritch is a first person rogue-like game where the levels are always randomized and you go around collecting weapons to help you survive until you reach the exit. The atmosphere and sounds are very well done which really gives you the sense of spookiness and horror of H.P. Lovecraft. The game does get somewhat repetitive after dozens of rounds as the concept is the same over and over (collect items and get to the exit), however the levels become more challenging and require some strategy to complete the levels.

												A proceedurally generated, Lovecraft-themed, first-person action rpg. Elderitch has an engaging retro 3d art style and great sound design. The stealth action gameplay feels great. Enemies are varied and interesting. The large levels have impressive geometry and are very atmospheric, and also fun to explore. Environments are fully destructible (which is an awesome yet underused game mechanic). There is an impressive amount of content here, including free DLC, secret endings, and a new game plus mode.

												For the truth, I want to recommend this game, but sadly in it's current form it's not much of a whole game.It will be interesting, sure but it has for me very little content. This wins some points for being uniquely minimalist and for random levels, spooky atmosphere, and the great framerate. But this also means that there are a great deal of meaningless rooms, freaky but not challenging enemies, and minimalist graphics. If the developer had made the hands less ridiculous looking and gave the game a difficulty setting where enemies would be faster and such, then the game would really pack a greater punch. It's worth getting on sale though.			"

Recommended: While the art aesthetic that Eldritch uses is tired at best, underneath that aesthetic is a well-designed roguelike first-person shooter.  With the resource management you have to do, enemy variety, and interesting lore, there's a lot to like in Eldritch.  If the price point is steep to you, then wait for a sale and pick it up - if you like roguelikes you probably won't regret it.Full review is available here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												In theory, Eldritch really should not work. Cthulu has been ruined by the internet, procedural generation and pixelly blocks are things ripped straight from Minecraft, and roguelikes have been said and done time and time again.Yet Eldritch works, and it works beautifully.The visuals are obviously not mindblowing, but the simplicity of it all adds to the pick-up-and-play feel of the game, and enemies somehow become generally creepy. Sound design is absolutely superb. There isn't a lot of music but there is a hell of a lot of ambience. Not only do you hear various random noises, but you also can hear the sounds of nearby enemies, which makes you tread the levels of Eldritch ever more carefully.There are a limited amount of weapons and items, but this allows you to easily adjust your playstyle whenever and makes you master the combat right off the bat so there's no struggle with a learning curve.There are 3 levels that are entirely different from eachother (and also procedurally generated so they will never be the same) and if you beat these levels in one life, you get a bonus 4th level (which I have yet to play). There is also a free expansion included, with a different snow-themed level.It's difficult, it's creepy, it's everything that I shouldn't like, and yet Eldritch finds a way to keep pulling me back in again and again.

												Im not well known for my ability to write reviews, so i will make this as short and as readable as possible.-Description- Eldritch is a game about how you got yourself stuck in this dungeon-library type room and need three keys to exit. The way you get these keys are by reading three glowing books in the main part of the room, once you read one of these books (you have to start with one specific book then continue to harder books) it drops you streight into a dungeon, this is where the main part of the game begins. from here on you have to scavange  the place for weapons such as knifes, pistols, even trip wires. and with these you will be able to, obviously, kill the enemys. as you will find out, no-one will beat this on their first try its just way too hard, you will need to learn how to mix stealth AND combat to be able to beat it. this is all im going to say about its description as i do not want to spoil anything (else)Now i will say the pros and cons to the game as un-biasly as possible.-Pros-+The game is easy to run - this is a big one, who likes a game thats laggy? i dont, thats for sure. and this is especially good if you have a simple laptop like mine which cant handly the power savvy games of today.+The game is aesthetically pleasing -  the game looks nice, pixel games are pixel games but the way  this game puts them toghether with all of its shapes and colors just seems 'right'+The game is fairly unique - i havnt seen a game much like this before and definatly not one with the same mechanics.+The game has a sweet and sour feeling - when i first started the game, it scared me...alot just enough to make me lose out of not useing critical thinking. but before the game could lose its fun factor out of being 'scary' i had gotten used to it and was able to play it normally, allowing for a different type of play giving strategy a whole new meaning.+They are STILL adding more updates - name says it all-Cons- = It does eventually get Extreemly hard - this happens around the third and last book, enemys will kill you either one or two shot and it becomes very difficult to play. some will find this as a pro but to me, it could be just a tad easier.-END-Thanks for reading and i really hope this helped your decision on wether to but the game or not, would i recommend it? YES this game is unique in many ways and is a must play. if i find any more necessessary pros or cons, i will add  them but for now the only bad thing i can say about it is listed. Wow i made this alot longer than i planned on making it, anyways, goodbye ^u^9/10 - Great game			"

												A charming take on the roguelike genre and an endearing interpretation Lovecraft's work. Eldritch is the perfect game to pick up and play in those spare 10 or 20 minutes you have, clear a dungeon and retrieve a soul and then call it a day.The environments in the three books are each different offering unique challenges for you to overcome. I personally found the Book of Nyarlathotep to be the most difficult, with its lizard men, tall and creepy elder mummies and weeping-angel-esque lizard statues. All of which can spell doom for the unwitting explorer. The lizard men have powerful ranged attacks and will also dodge to evade attacks. Meanwhile the taller mummies can spot the player more easily due to their height, deal 2 points of damage and have the unfortunate property of being immortal, only being stunned temporarily by the players attacks. The final, most terrifying denizen residing within the book of Nyarlathotep is the lizardman statues. The only creature in the game to legitimately scare me as I thought they were only a decoration. They act much like the weeping angels from doctor who or SCP 173 from SCP Containment Breach. Unless you keep them within your field of view they will spring to life dealing 2 damage per hit until the player looks at them again. However they will not attack until awakened, this is when a player either strays too close or makes a lot of noise from combat. This terrifying moment is signalled by the sound of cracking stone and a shower of dust from the statue. The player must then keep the statue in their line of site until there is a wall between them and the statue, all the while avoiding whatever other creatures are lurking around. Oh and did I mention the only way to kill them is with dynamite... and it doesn't always work. Yes, the statues are easily the most dangerous enemy in the game.Now these are just the denizens unique to Nyarlathotep, each book including the free DLC; The Mountains of Madness all have there own monstrous menagerie of creatures from fish men to flying polyps all intent on ending your little frolic through their subterranean homes. The monsters are my favorite part of the game and for me are what gives Eldritch its charm.However that's not all. The game also has a variety of powers to choose from. Only allowing the player to equip one power at a time makes for difficult decisions as to how you play the game. I personally found the teleport power to be very useful for a more stealthy approach being able to avoid enemies or entire rooms. The player also has different equipment to choose from, boots, kits and amulets all providing different bonuses allowing for a different style of play each playthrough. Interestingly enough this playstyle is often very much dictated by what you find whilst traversing the dungeons. Which brings us on to the next aspect the Dungeons and overall level design. Eldritch features a procedurally generated, tiled dungeon system, meaning every dungeon crawl will be different. The dungeons themselves are diverse, filled with traps, loot and hiding places often giving the player a variety of options as to how they proceed through the level.Overall I thoroughly recommend Eldritch as a light hearted take on the Lovecraftian genre and a fun roguelike experience.

Plays a little like a 3D version of Derek Yu's Spelunky, but that's a poor comparison. Involves a nice blend of action with stealth (required on the later levels). Roguelike elements - level generation, item placement etc. makes each run feel fresh. Graphics are really nice, particularly the enemy models, and the atmospheric music and sounds are perfect. Whilst the main levels are pretty short, it'll take you some time to actually finish them. The new game+ mode is challenging even for veterans. The two ""bonus"" levels offer a great amount of additional playtime: a super-long level and a challenge level, that you will be playing again and again to get that 500 souls achievement. The inspiration from lovecraft is a nice touch, especially since I'm a fan of his works (although the relationship to his original literature is pretty weak). Overall: Excellent game, fun with a lot of replayability. Also contains achievements that are damn near impossible. I'LL 100% IT ONE DAY, MARK MY WORDS.			"

												What Eldritch lacks in depth or content, it certainly makes up for in atmosphere. This pixelated blend of Minecraft and an H.P. Lovecraft novel is a journey that should not be missed by anyone. The gameplay is simple: Enter a dungeon, sneak your way around taking out creepy enemies, collect goodies to boost your character, and live long enough to claim the souls at the bottom. While by no means Slenderman, Outlast, or anything of the sort, Eldritch has its share of jump scares. Thanks to the wonderfully spooky sound design, the moans of enemies around every corner is sure to send a chill or two down your spine. The only negative here, as mentioned by many others, is the punishing and unrewarding permadeath (of sorts), which robs you of all currency, inventory, and health boosts, sending you back to the hub. Find yourself a good strategy and understanding of the levels and enemies, and you can avoid this altogether, but it's definitely annoying the first time. This is not Dungeons of Dredmore. You won't find yourself boosting stats, running through the story multiple times with various builds and stat trees, nor will you rake in dozens of hours of gameplay. This is OK though. Eldritch is a small but beautful package well worth the look. It won't last you long, but Eldritch is certainly enjoyable while it lasts.			"

												Being a Lovecraft fan, this game catched my eye a few times and I finally decided to grab it when it was on sale. It turned out to be a great decision. Elditch is a game that could be the example of 'roguelike' genre in game encyclopedias. It shows that permadeath is not the only issue for being a roguelike. In this game, there is a chance that you will suffer a horrible death while equipping a pickaxe and a revolver (best equipment combination in my opinion), while at the same time you can finish the game with a single piece of rock. With the RNG factor, game gives you ultimate freedom for designing your build. You don't start with selecting a class, you choose your own class with your tactics. You can avoid enemies with being silent and invisible, you can kill everyone on your way with a load of bullets and weapons,  you can even be Sanic with proper boots and equipment and run to the exit while ignoring everything.   Atmosphere is simply brilliant. Difficulty is well-balanced and sountrack just fits the dark atmosphere. Like the enemies weren't already tough, with their noises, you always feel their breath on your back. Better than any thriller. You will sh*t bricks with enemies jumping from corners, especially with a headphone. I also have to mention the invulnerable enemies. Especially Lizard Statues makes you believe in god and beg for mercy from him.  Floors are really well-designed. Traps can possibly be anywhere on a floor and in some cases, you have to be really careful in order to dodge them. So you know, you can always run from scary enemies but you can't escape. If saying those haven't made it obvious, replayability value is really high. If you somehow become able to steal multiple items from the shops without a scratch, congratulations, you have won the game.  The only flaw I could think of would be the limited item pool, but considering that current items provide you basically everything you could do within the game mechanics, it is not a big issue.  Overall, this game is right in every possible way. A true gem. Can't recommend it enough.			"

												Eldritch is the kind of game that makes me wish I had a 'noncommittal gesture' button between the Yes and No buttons. It's definitely got something going on between its muted slap-happy adorableness and Lovecraftian horror aesthetic. I like the way the game presents no clear-cut solution to the problems the Lovecraftian Theme Park makes you suffer through, but at the same time it's easy to collect a bunch of upgrades and turn the game into The Adventures of Catherine McGunhaver, Kicker of Cthulhu Faces. It's pretty easy to win (so I've been told, I can't quite grab all the orbs in one life which is pretty much grounds for invalidating my video game cred), so you may end up coasting through the game with your abilities, kicking Cthulhu Faces and listening to the ghost of H.P. Lovecraft scream in anguish as you put bullets through his life's work.But at the same time, I can't help but feel this game's a bit insubstantial. The developers have been pretty good at releasing new content (see: The Mountains of Madness and the recent Asylum updates), but I've felt like I've seen everything three hours in. Worlds are limited to three levels with orbs to find at the end to unlock the final level or whatever, and I think you have to get them all without dying. The game has severe difficulty spikes - you can pretty much coast through the first world and expect the entire game to be like that right up until one of those ♥♥♥♥ing Weeping Angel lizards eats your ♥♥♥♥ing face, and even then that's the most difficult thing about the whole playthrough.I guess Eldritch hasn't quite clicked with me, mainly because I've been walking around putting bullets through anything that looks at me funny and throwing beer bottles at all the acolytes milling around the dungeons like a frat boy on Spring Break at ♥♥♥♥sticks University. It requires a softer touch when I just want to walk around and kill everything. I'm not going to fault it for that. Try it, I say. Try it!			"

												OKAY LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT ELDRITCH: THIS GAME ♥♥♥♥ING OWNS. In case my brutish and direct vernacular has sullied the credibility of my review already, allow me to expand upon why this game ""♥♥♥♥ing owns."" (Disclaimer: I played most of this game offline. That's what my time played is so low for it. So don't you ♥♥♥♥ing knock me for that one. Okay? Okay. Good.)I can't even recall my first reaction to the game. It was like wonder mixed with possibility mixed with fear mixed with paranoia. I thanked my dear brother for getting me this game (I had no money at the time, Or now) and resumed playing after changing my♥♥♥♥♥♥soaked scrubs. The sensation made me realize that randomly-generated dungeons aren't always complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ I found myself worshipping the entropy. And the controls are perfect and fluid. But I digress.You evolve with the game. Okay, ♥♥♥♥ perspective or whatever, I'm gonna do this my way.I evolved with the game. I wasn't told I was better at exploring the dungeons or anything by arbitrary numbers that simultaneously define my character. In fact, I started out like a true adventurer; head held high, fists at the ready, I was ready for anything. Or I thought I was. And then I realized I was wrong. I had to carefully analyze my situation and determine the best course of action via my own wit. THE FIRST TIME PLAYING THE GAME, I WALKED AROUND THE DUNGEONS LIKE A ♥♥♥♥ING COWARD, TRYING TO AVOID ANY AND ALL CONTACT WITH MALEVOLENT MASTERS OF MONSTROUS MENTIONINGS. I WOULD HEAR THEM MUTTERING NEARBY WITHOUT PREVIOUSLY KNOWING OF THERE EXISTANCE AND I WAS SCARED. I SUCKED. Eventually, I died, but I managed to pick up a gun, a teleporty thing (Hey Dishonored, this game used your only good mechanic better than you. Take that! That's what you get for letting me down,) and a lump sum of those ♥♥♥♥ing blue coins or whatever. Tablets. Slabs. Coins. Whatever. I started at the hub level again and worked my way back into the first dungeon, once again randomized. And I had none of the previous spoils I had earned by my....brave adventuring? Yeah that. So instantly I was likeOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIII♥♥♥♥♥♥THIS GAME ACTUALLY HAS CONSEQUENCE TIED TO DEATH MORE THAN KICKING YOU IN THE SHIN AND SAYING GO GET EM AGAIN, JOHNNY!! (looking at you, Ni No Kuni) All right, so I will skip ahead in my adventures.I became a ♥♥♥♥ing legend in that first dungeon, marked by multiple deaths and the blood of my enemies. I typically used the teleportation thingy and always carried a knife with me, maybe a gun. METAL GEAR SOLID MY WAY THROUGH THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.I would sprint through rooms, slide under low obstacles, climb to the high ones, use my velocity to drive my knife through the throat of some fishman or faceless Magic The Gathering player. I ♥♥♥♥ing ruled. I carved out my destiny through that first dungeon. I completed it and felt on the top of the world. Brought the artifact down to the hubworld and all. I was unstoppable. After all, the second dungeon would be a breeze with all this jam at my side.My♥♥♥♥♥was handed to me. The enemies became scarier exponentially. There is this guy who is essentially the Dead Hand or whatever from Ocarina of Time except INVINCIBLE. And then there are those weeping angels in the form of crocodiles (never seen Dr. Who Gives a ♥♥♥♥) and I nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥myself. I had no idea what this dungeon had for me. I died. That was the fall from grace. I was about to enter the second dungeon again with the fresh start, but I felt the overwhelming urge to check the artifact thing that I had brought back from the first dungeon. It was no longer on the pedestal. I had to go back and get it again.Let me repeat that for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed emphasis.I had to go back and complete the first dungeon again. The first death was a slap to the face. That death was the game yelling at me to grit my teeth before reeling back and punching me in the face with full might.That game handed me my♥♥♥♥♥ Now I have to go back and play it again. And you know what?I'm glad. I'm gonna beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game someday. As hard as it pushes me down, I will just keep pushing back. This game can set as many limits as it wants to for me, but I will just keep breaking them. I WILL KICK♥♥♥♥♥AND FIGHT BACK. I WILL ♥♥♥♥ING DESTROY THESE HORRIFYING ENEMIES. I WILL CONQUER AND CLEAR AND CRUSH.I WILL BEAT ELDRITCH♥♥♥♥ YES I RECOMMEND THIS GAME, YOU ARE A JACKASS FOR NOT ALREADY OWNING IT. BUY IT NOW.			"

												“Welcome stranger! Please buy something, Gulp! Gulp! I have so many good things in my shop.”You wake up in a library, you don't know who you are and why you are here and you set off to explore every nook and cranny to overcome your amnesia. When you first begin to explore you realize you’re in a giant endless library where no one is around but you and the piles of books. While further exploring you will be introduced with the game’s way of interacting with you through books you find in the library, things such as the games tutorial and the history of the library and finding a no where to be seen explorer’s journal.Soon after you explore the library you will understand that the library serve as the hub-world of the game, There are three magical books that when touched any of them you will be teleported to another world infested with enemies, traps and what lays beyond the cosmic horrific veil.You have to navigate your way level after level looking for the exit and if you were to be killed in the process all your possessions of weapons and Artifacts (in world currency) will be lost, unless you exit the level and without dying and stash the Artifacts in your treasure chest, which located in the library.Engaging enemies directly, stealthily or even avoiding the enemies are all possible in Eldritch, but i have found avoiding enemies while searching for the exit is best as it sets the mood with the creative ambient soundtrack, the soundtrack is so smartly composed as it give you the feeling that someone is constantly brushing his hand on the back of your neck, keeping you constantly looking back and forth looking out for enemies while searching for the exit. Many fascinating gameplay elements can be found in Eldritch, such as if you kill an enemy you can loot him BUT if you loot him he will spawn once again within the level, this is such a smart element to implement in a roguelike game as it test your greed to upgrade against your fear of losing it all.The level design is wonderfully imagined with different themes in every world changing the art direction, enemy design and music. In Eldritch the world is randomly generated which make every play through rich with the feeling of exploration especially since the gameplay design revolves around you navigating your way to the exit and this is wonderfully complemented with the use of the Dynamite that let you open destroy walls and floors granting you further progression into the level.The enemy design is very simple on paper but when experienced within Eldritch’s world it’s a totally different story as the richly ambient world shines some of these enemies such as the crocodile statue, if you get too close to him and look away he will attack you when he isn't in your field of view. This is only one example of how the enemies act and react to you in Eldritch.Your arsenal consist of what can be found within the worlds you travel to, laying all around the levels or bought in one of the shops that are also located within the levels. but you may only carry two weapons at a time, you can find weapons such as a pistol or crossbow that can shoot traps, a knife, a bottle or just a rock or my favorite, Dynamite that not only serves as a mean to kill enemies but to also destroy walls and floors to get to other areas. You may also go bare bones and use your fists to take down enemies.Moreover you can find equipment to help you in your journey, you have three equipment slots one for an amulet  that can increase the damage you deal to enemies or a compass that will guide you to the exit or a lucky charm that will let you find more loot.The second equipment slot is for training kits such as a kit that will let you eat the corpses of certain creatures for additional cost. Another is a medical kit that will grant you a second life without resurrecting to the library, as long as you have the artifacts to pay for. Another is a locksmith kit that will let you unlock doors and put locks on doors. The third slot is for your foot wear, as you can equip boots that let you jump higher or run faster.More powers can be acquired to help you on your journey can be granted after you pray for a statue, you will be granted powers such as higher jump or creating a portal that when you use your power anywhere in the level it will return you back to where you created it. These powers can be used with the cost of artifacts for each use.In Eldritch the narrative is told through the art direction, in a dream like world or through another traveler's diary log as you find them all throughout the game. But the player’s story is told by the player themselves as they travels through three worlds escaping every danger met or facing it head on.The horrors you encounter in in your journey tell a story in their movement, sound and actions. Every escape you accomplish and every stealth kill you execute or even every time you look back with the feeling of an enemy sneaking up behind you; all of these scenarios are plot points built by the player in his journey. Soon after further exploring the library you understand who you are and what is your purpose in the world of Eldritch and you travel through three worlds to collect three souls to save the world from the near approaching doom.The sound complements the gameplay and amplifies the ambient cosmic horror Lovcraftian flavor with great sound design that mimics a simple squeak of a door or a wind blowing through a narrow opening. On the other hand the sound design of the enemies is taken with a bit of comical approach whether it was an intended design choice or not, I've found that it compliments the Lovecraftian flavor.Eldritch is a simple looking first person, roguelike indie game with a graphical presentation reminiscent of Minecraft but galvanized with the cosmic horror flavor of Lovcraft’s Cthulhu mythos mixed with the aspect of the randomly generated world and a new game plus mode I can see myself sinking hours after hours playing Eldritch with a great sense of freshness every time going in. I can highly recommend the game to any fan of the genre.SCORE: 9/10			"

												Your first playthrough of Eldritch will be great. Its all downhill from there, however, as with each playthrough the current content grows staler and staler as you realize you have basically seen everything the game has to offer. The game has a wonderful premise, and suprisingly good atmosphere. But the issue is that once everything stops being fresh and new, the shallowness of the gameplay is revealed. Eldritch is not a bad game by any means, but 15 dollars seems a bit steep considering the ammount of content.  "

												Yes, the graphics are pants. The rest of the game, however, is a pretty decent roguelike and from the somewhat more unusual first-person perspective for those kind of games. The gameplay and gameplay polish are both solid, which is a lot more than one can say for games that look a lot nicer. The story is a bit through-away, however. I did want more... in terms of items, types of monsters, etc. $15 is maybe a bit steep for it, but if it was on sale, then if you like roguelikes, it could be worth it.			"

There are plenty of items for a relatively short game. I have played this game quite a bit, and the game can get really hard at times. When you get a soul and progress, you can unlock the new areas, but if you die, you lose that soul, and you do need that soul to unlock something. I have no idea what it is, but that still means there is more to this game. Its really fun, creepy, and cool. I really recommend it.			"

												I love this little game! It's basic characteristics are perhaps best presented in list form:- first-person- procedurally-generated- stealth, exploration, combat- permadeath- limited health and items- low-poly art style- ""cartoon lovecraft"" themeI'm not great at FPS games (not terrible, I hope, but not great), and for me Eldritch has a  perfectly balanced difficulty curve. There are three worlds, which are generated on each runthrough, and you have to make it through all three to unlock a final stage, and then survive that stage to win, all without dying once. This only takes an hour or so, but is tricky to pull off. (I've only done it twice, both times before Steam acheivements were added.) The first world is easy; the second one seems impossible at first. On each successful run, you deepen your knowledge of the game's systems, and gradually attain a pleasurable sense of mastery. There is also a ""New Game+"" mode and some additional challenges if you are way more hardcore than I.Despite the cartoony art style, the game has many genuinely tense moments and I think the visual and level design is really quite effective in conveying a weird and spooky world, governed by unfathomable rules and forces. And as with any good randomized world, I've had lots of hilarious/awesome emergent encounters/stories with the various beasties and environments.One of my only issues with the game is that certain combinations of abilities are really unbalanced. So much so that, once I find them in a given run, it's hard to give them up if I'm trying for a winning run. Withouth giving too much away, this is due to what I can only call game-breaking exploits that certain abilities enable. However, the issue of balance is certainly outweighed by the sheer joy I took when I first discovered the power of these degenerate strategies. I felt like a brilliant magical ninja. In any case, there are a modest number of abilities that are all really fun to play with even if they are not all equally powerful.All in all, I have huge respect for this game's designer (a single guy!) Eldritch shows a lot of care, dedication, restraint, and clarity of vision. There are a lot of simple but brilliant ideas in here, executed beautifully. (for example, after playing Eldritch I can't imagine why anyone would make an FPS without a run+crouch ""powerslide"" move.) It makes me want to make games myself.To top it off, the developer has released two *huge* free content updates since the game was released in 2013, and the game is pretty modestly priced to begin with. ($15, with frequent sales and bundles.) I highly recommend supporting him!			"

												In the year 2009, I had decided to purchase a game on Steam entitled ""Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth"", an atmospheric horror game grounded in the world of H.P. Lovecraft. It was an extremely buggy game on PC, and the graphics had aged terribly, but I played it and I loved it because there just wasn't anything quite like it. The sort of fear that it instilled in me as I played it built up over time - there were no jump scares, only an oppressive atmosphere that left me wishing I could hide behind the corner, maybe find a small room and barricade myself in... I didn't want to subject myself to the horror lurking around every dark corner. Sadly, a bug in playing the game on modern operating systems prevented me from completing the game, and I have not gone back since. I guess the reason I'm saying this is because Eldritch provides that same sense of dread and immersion. It's a rogue-like, yes, but above all it is a horror game that relies on creating an atmosphere that's driven completely by the player's own actions in the world. I'm writing this review mere moments after coming face to face with my mortality in the game and dying after multiple strokes that were too close for comfort. It was in the second area of the game, on the third level. I had finally found an exit after dodging past unkillable enemies only to discover that it was guarded by no less than ten statues. These statues, you see, behave much like the Weeping Angels in Doctor Who in the sense that if you take your eye off them for even a brief moment, they strike you down. With my mind too set on escape, unable to think straight, I made a wild dash through them all hoping that I could possibly outrun them... And, somehow, I did. But I'd made a mistake. The door to the exit was closed shut, and I had already spun around to face my foes, frozen only a few feet away. I was stuck in a waiting game that would only end in my death, and so... I dropped my knife, emptied my gun, and slowly turned around, bracing myself for my death. If you enjoy games with a strong atmosphere and/or simply enjoy being the driving force behind every occurrence (as nothing is scripted), I highly recommend you try out this game.			"

												You ever see that movie ""Reign on Me"" where Adam Sandler plays a guy whose family dies and literally all he wants to do is play Shadow of the Colossis forever? This game is like that for me, it's pretty much a masterpiece of roguelite. It's taken me almost 10 hrs to complete the game on my first playthrough. You can beat the game with very little but there's a lot of equipment to try out and I still haven't tried everything. Is it repetitive? Yes, but in the same way OG Demon's Souls was. You will die, you will lose everything (just like IRL), but I'd say there's enough variety to keep it interesting, multiple expansion levels a time attack/survival level and NG+. Every time you die EVERYTHING randomly generates all over again but you can save some currency in the bank. If you don't use any guides like me things will stay fresh and it'll take you much longer to beat but you'll have a better experience. If bad things keep happening in your life, an hour of Eldritch is much cheaper than therapy.			"

												Eldritch somehow reminded me Montezuma's Return. In fact, Eldritch is unique old-fashioned thriller game with good gameplay. Game itself is hardcore, that means if you will die and can't revive yourself with Medical Kit, you have to start over again with different level layouts.Summarized pros and cons:+ Old-style distorted graphics (as in PSX games)+ Story is decent+ Simple but well made inventory/item system+ Randomly generated levels+ As i know, it has multiple endings.- Actually it has replayability (New Game+, Asylum and unique levels) but in the end, game itself doesn't make you feel like you have to play it again.- Even though it has a level generator, time by time some patterns are pretty same.- Stealth isn't a good option in this game.

												Absolutely love the atmosphere in this game. Simultaneously chilling, yet comforting. A fantastic play on a rainy night.The exploration feels labyrinthian without feeling tedious or repetitive. It's balanced, too - the character pacing is nice and item placement is fair.I bought this game after watching someone stream parts of it; even if I'd seen most of what there was to see, I wanted to experience it firsthand -- definitely worth it.

I have never played anything like this game before, and was hesitant due to the graphics and procedural generation resembling minecraft (and everyone hates minecraft right?) but the overwhelmingly positive reviews made me spend the $1.49 US that it cost's at the time of this review. I must say, that $1.49 was well worth it. The first book is a great introduction to the game mechanics, and then the second feels like a completely different game (I may or may not have kicked my desk in fright after a screaming ghosts attacked me and i got penetrated by a statue). This game is full of surprises and is ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING! "

												Eldritch is one of the finest examples I have seen of a game that has both simplicity and complexity harnessed in exactly the right measures. The result is a game that is both infintely enjoyable and completely understandable, which is a real rarity. When you couple that with the incredibly well-executed theme, and the sheer polished feel to the whole thing, Eldritch has earned itself a slot on my shelf of all-time-favorites.The concept is simple: get to the bottom, stay alive, retrieve the thing. But along the way, so many things can go so horribly, horribly wrong that the sense of satisfaction when you finally put your hand on your goal(s) is profound. Each world playes by its own rules and demands different approaches, while everything is at the same time built upon a consistent, understandable basis. Amazing. This is rogue-like done extraordinarily well.And, it's got Shoggoths. What's not to love.			"

Great atmosphere, inspiring level design, and a good variety of different monsters each with their own behaviour to kill or run away or simply hide from. A pleasure to play. Highly recommended!			"

												Wow. This games simple appearance doesn't accurately express it's charm and atmosphere. This game is immersive beyond most modern titles, the sounds and the sound track for each level are diverse and unsettling in every sense. You might feel that the game is easy off the bat, and in some ways, the game is easy - it's not the difficulty of the enemies that provides all of the challenge here. But the game falls back on players making the errors, in some ways, klling themselves due to lax in mindset, or not paying attention and falling prey to the games many traps. The environment is what is deadly,  and when coupled with the certain abilities of the enemies.. even more so. Risk/Reward is built in to almost every aspect. As the currency in the game, Artifacts- is the same thing that you use to cast spells. Making every action when low on health and artifacts incredibly on edge, and can lead to a very intense playthrough where pressing escape to take a breath is a advocated practice. I've not managed to beat the game, but I've gotten pretty far. The game offers 3 diverse, Lovecraftian based worlds, with enemies correlating to the particular demi-god of that world. A hub world, which is very cool- and 1 special world in which I've not managed to beat. All of which are procedurally(randomlly??) generated, which makes the levels seem very maze like, yet fresh and exciting- with twist and turns, ups and downs that can leave you feeling lost and desperate.  Be careful though, 1 mistake and death can cost you your entire run. Caution is of the upmost importance. The lore of this game is sparse, but told in a simple straightforward way that works with your imagination, over blasting you with cinematics, or long explanations.  It's worth mentioning, that I've delved into lovecraftian fiction works almost exclusively because of this game, just to learn more of the names of these gods, and to try and figure out these odd creatures I'm encountering. I've left out a lot of things from my words here.. because they are worth finding out for yourself. Don't skip out on this unique experience, for it's current price, and even full price. It's worth it.			"

												The graphics are minimalistic but the art and design actually make it work. The Lovecraftian inspiration is turned a bit cute and comical, but the art and some scary opponents are surprisingly effective and feel a bit creepy and uneasy at times to times. Especially with the great sound design, reminding of Doom with the weird sounds of the monsters that are lurking around.First person view is very very suitable to this exploration of randomly generated dungeons. The fighting feels good despite being a bit easy, but some opponents (especially in the second world) are so dangerous that the player experiences a genuine fear to be trapped by them.Despite the very good variety in opponents, the gameplay feels a bit repetitive after a death when the player has to try again from the start. Replayability is kind of the biggest problem I have with the game. At least some items allow to resurrect (at a cost). I think I would have preferred if the Dungeons/Worlds did not have to be all completed in one life, but instead were independent and harder to complete.So to sum up, I really liked the Lovecraftian theme, the exploration, and the dangerous and original opponents that sometimes made me feel as if I was in an Amnesia game. I didn't exactly like the way progress is registered. Overall, I was very surprised to actually have a very good time in this game despite its minimalistic looks.			"

												A fun rogue-like stealth title you can pick up and play for a few minutes at a time (game saves on exit), or be drawn in for significant periods of time - even if you initially intended to play just for a bit. The enemies may look all cute and cuddly but don't be fooled: after the first temple you're up against some mean SOB's and you have to either get good at dodging or really make use of your stealth skills. The difference in difficulty actually works in the game's favour for me; I can use the first temple to go and stab a few fish men when I want to just refresh in the middle of the day and get an actual challenge from the later levels.In addition to stabbing, shooting enemies you will get to make use of the powers of the Elder Gods, like hypnosis, and there will even be special weapons up ahead after the first temple. I won't spoil them for you, however. The strength of the game isn't in the gadgets though, but in the nicely polished gameplay that balances between sneaking, paying attention to your environment, looting and making a run for it when you find yourself in a sticky situation.If you enjoy stealth and want a title you can pick-and-play whenever you wish Eldritch is well worth the full 12€ price, and if it's on sale it's an absolute steal!

												Are you into lovecraftian horror and roguelikes? Ever wanted a three dimensional tough as nails dungeon crawler with a creepy atmosphere and loads of creativity? Then this is the game for you! Add another game to the pile of amazing roguelikes that you'll sink hours into. The game's goal is simple: Find the souls of three great old ones, which are god-like figures of complete insanity, and use them to open a portal through a library while dodging the shoggoths and elder ones that plan your destruction. This game is not for the feint of heart, for just like the HP Lovecraft novels, the alien creatures and strange noises will send a chill through your spine, which is unexpected for such a blocky game. You have two weapon slots, a spell slot which can be filled by praying to eldritch statues of horrible ancient deities, and three equipment slots each with it's own item type: Kits, Amulets and Boots. There are currently 7 worlds to venture through, but you'll be going through the labyrinth-like halls over and over again both from Eldritch's roguelike nature and how replayable it is. And don't even get on the Asylum. If that isn't enough for you, the game is being updated as we speek, the most recent expansion being the Mountains of Madness.The game is a love letter to both fans of HP Lovecraft and roguelike players everywhere. Worth the higher price tag.			"

												PROS-Cool visual design-Nice monster/trap variety-Good array of gadgets-Weapons and movement feel satisfying-Soundscape contributes to the spooky atmosphere-The procedurally generated levels are well made-Mountains of Madness is a great expansion, with a lot of tension, especially after the blinding cloud starts following you-The concept of an interdimensional prison compressed into a library is very interesting - I like the use of books as portals that contain worlds of monstersCONS-Stealth is too easy (monsters barely look for you if spotted and give up almost immediately)-Knife/Pistol is the best weapon combo, and you will rarely use any of the others-Ending is a bit anticlimactic-Melee combat is too easy. Most Dagon enemies can be killed without risk simply by spamming your dagger, even when you have been discovered. This is also true of the giant penguins in MoM, which is supposed to be more difficult.Overall pretty good, worth buying.UPDATE: Recently started playing NG+ and some of my complaints are addressed. Enemies are tougher in direct combat and resources are rarer. However, there are some things I still would change.1. The artifact bank should be removed. Artifacts are easy to find anyway, and with the bank you basically don't have to worry about spending your artifacts on spells, kit use, or in the store, which removes a strategic element. Especially true in NG+ since the resource scarcity is meant to be a major feature of it, so at the very least remove access to the bank during NG+ runs.2. Add some sort of end-game cutscene depending on which ending you get. Monsters being drawn to the candles and then the books sealing for the good ending, for example. And showing the plane take off at the end of MoM.3. Add an actual search pattern for when enemies spot you. Have them do more than walk to where you were and then go back to their route. It's very easy to just move a couple feet from where you were and wait for them to leave.4. Add some better ranged-attack monsters to MoM. I beat it on my first try after only doing a quick run of Dagon to prepare. With jump boots or teleport, you can easily escape the Mi-go, Shoggoth, and penguins by climbing three block or higher walls. The cultists and polyps can still hit you with their fireballs, but both of those are weak and easy to kill.5. Add one more monster to be introduced in Book Three (R'lyeh). As it is, Book Two has the most interestingly designed and difficult monsters, and Three is a step down both in terms of difficulty and creativity. Book Two features jumping lizardmen, immortal mummies and teleporting statues. Book Three just goes back to basics, with what are essentially just upgraded versions of Cultists and Flying Polyps.

												   Well, let me start this review off by saying I am a huge fan of H.P. Lovecraft, and this review will be somewhat biased because of that. Sorry.   Eldritch is a FPS Rouge like game. The term ""rogue-like"" is used quite liberally, so I consider this game to be more of a rouge-like-like, or my personal favorite, a rouge-lite. The game's aesthetics are quite simple but also very pleasing. A Minecraft-esque visual design is easy to look at, but the pixelated art is somewhat overdone. But, you shouldn't base a game off of it's graphics. The meat of this game is what matters. Lore is hidden around any corner. The dungeons that our hero, you, explores are honestly small, but many levels must be completed. Because each level is random, the player is forced to figure a way out of a situation. It's very fun and simple to get into. Many levels can be explored, although most are the same level-setup with different textures or enemies. Still, this helps the game from seeming repetitive. After only 11 hours, I started to get a little bored. This can be solved with a healthy dosage of Cthulhu reading, but I was a little disappointed that the game gets tiring. The atmosphere is where the game shines the most. It's eerie, creepy and fun. Each corner holds danger or reward.   All in all, I personally love this game. For a fan of Lovecraft, I recommend this. It's a 8.5/10 for us.   For a fan of rouge-likes and procedurally generated game, this game would be a 8/10.    If you don't fit that category, stay away. If you fill either, I think this game is a good pickup.			"

												By the Elder Gods, I feel like my pleads have been heard. So, there are few things in life that I love, some of them are: Girls with dyed hair, my earplugs, writing, Lovecraft, From Software, and rogue-like games. This game covers two of those six, my favourite game of all time covers 3 (Bloodborne, It's got Lovecraft, it's by From, and my character can have dyed hair), this game is near perfect, there's just one thing I personally disliked, but I'll get into that later.In Eldritch, you wake up in a mysterious library, and in the ground you find some explorer's notes, claiming that there is no way out, aside from the mysterious books that somehow teleport you to another realm, each belonging to an Elder God, and in the library, there are also books that tell it's story, so the game has a nice bit of lore to it, inside of one of the Elder God's realms, there are also the other notes left by that explorer, telling you who's the reigning god of this realm, and also that each realm possesse s some sort of artifact that might assist you in your escape, so you venture into there weird realms, so you can find your way out.This game is a Rogue-Lite, but the only thing that makes it lite is the fact that you can store your currency in a bank for future runs, you still lose everything you were holding onto and start over when you die, and it is really easy to die, you have a very small health bar, and some enemies deal a lot of damage, thankfully, there is a stealth mechanic, and it works really well, the AI responds as you'd expect to hiding.The AI in this game is really good, there's infighting between enemies and they patrol everywhere in search of you, it's really good. Most of the enemies are superbly designed, there are cultists, fish people, lizard people, flying eyeballs, wraiths, lizard statues with a really cool mechanic to them, and even SHOGGOTH! All of these enemies are very well designed, complementing the concept very well, and, even though the game has the Lovecraftian Gods and locations into it, the real reason it gives the feel of his books is the atmosphere, this game absolutely nails in that department, it truly feels like some of his best works.The game also has a variety of weapons, gear, consumables, and powers. There are melee, ranged and trap weapons; for your gear there are boots, amulets, and kits; the consumables are really basic, artifacts (currency), keys, and ammo; the powers are really interesting though, there are plenty of unique ones, and they all use up your artifacts, to get your powers you have to pray to an Elder God, and there are statues scattered across the map, each one granting a power unique to the statue.The main game has 3 books, each book contains 3 “worlds” with 3 layers stacked on top of each other, it sounds complex, but when you get to play it's actually pretty simple. The “DLC” books might be a little different though, all the DLCs are free, and there are 3 of them currently, all offer a brand new realm with a new objective. There's also a token character creator, just saying.Graphically, even though it has a Minecraft style to it, the game looks pretty good, and it conveys the atmosphere even with the pixelated art style, all the enemies and locations look great. The music is almost unnoticeable, but when you pay attention to it, it really build on the whole feel of the game, but it's not something one would listen to outside of the game.My only real criticism of this game is the fact that it kind of “lacks” content, like, it doesn't have the replayability that the Isaacs and Gungeons have, so that's a bit sad, but it doesn't take anything away from the experience, it's short, but incredibly sweet.Overall, I love this game, like, I REALLY love this game, buy it, you're doing yourself a favour. If you like Lovecraft, Rogue-likes or breathing, it's a must have!Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!Read more video game reviews at cassus.org "

												Think ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of Dishonored and HP Lovecraft"" in the form of a lightweight stealth/action/horror game with roguelike elements such as permadeath and procedurally generated voxel-based levels.  *Also, please don't judge the game by the tone of the preview video's energy and music.  It does not capture the feel of playing this game in the least.  Watch a video on youtube before making up your mind.  This game is generally slow-paced, a bit creepy, and involves a lot of meticulous exploration.Despite having roguelike elements and a more oldschool-gaming attitude, it's not terribly difficult if you're experienced at stealth games.  Hell of a lot of fun, creepy and unsettling, and each run will challenge you about the same as the last due to the random terrain/maze-like levels.  Do not be fooled by the ease of clearing the first world; the second world is by far the most hazardous!Simple gameplay with several ways to fight, a stealth system including the ability to ""lose"" a pursuer, and a ""sneak attack"" system for bonus damage.No cumbersome inventory management; simplified equipment system with a few upgrade slots, and a slot for 1 power/spell that can be changed easily.  High jump boots, lockpicking kits, magical amulet/token, etc.Voxel-based procedural world with nice atmospheric sound, music, and lighting.Great use of vertical space for levels overall and for each given floor, with lots of crawlspaces, hidey holes, ceilings, and cover to hide in. You can crawl, powerslide under low passages, sprint, or climb up ledges.You won't get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of this, but it's a great little game and has great potential if modders or the developers design additional levels to explore and enemies to fight.  And it stands on its own feet just fine.			"

												While a cute rougelike with no glaring flaws, Eldritch comes off as flat, the stakes are only given through fear of death and that fear can only exist when the game creates a genuine desire to see more, the combat has no punch and not a whole lot of satisfaction with it. I'd reccomend this if it wasn't in such a crowded market, but it is. Download any of the classics that have been set in stone if you're craving a good rougelike			"

												I really liked the atmosphere, but the games just to simple for me and lacked any depth.Played for a few hours to get the hang of it, then beat the game start to finish in little over an hour. You're never really rewarded, the combat doesn't require much skill, there are no bosses and theres very little variety amongst weapons and items.There are a total of 6 dungeons, 3 you have to collect orbs from to access the final dungeon. The only reward for completing the game is an orb to make the game more difficult.You mostly wander around looking for a hole to jump through to access the next floor on every floor until you collect the orb, then return to the library hub, start the next dungeon and repeat. The dagger and revolver are the main weapons you'll be using as the other few are not worth picking up.Guess it's okay if you get it on sale. Really wish it had more content to give it some diversity and it would of been exciting to fight a unique boss at the end of each dungeon. Don't really feel like there are any items in it that change the play style unfortunately, which inhibits replay imo.			"

Another Rogue-Thing... [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]A random-generated minecraft/roguelike game in a horror-fantasy world? Wow it sounds awesome! It isn't. I was bored after only 30 minutes of play: all you have to do is enter a level, find a key, kill one or more mobs, find the exit and repeat. I didn't find a story either.Graphic is blocky but nice. Controls are responsive... levels are random generated so you will always find something different... but these are all the positive points I can think about.Maybe somebody will like this one more than I did. In fact, I don't really understand all those good reviews. Did we play the same game?!Best played with Keyboard and MouseRecommended Buy Price < 5$Score 6/10 "

												EDIT: Going back through my older reviews, I was a bit dissapointed in my past self for giving such a short and poorly explained review. Brevity does not equal quality, especially when the majority of your original review becomes your final paragraph on re-edit.Eldritch is a tense, dark, and interesting little game with a lot going for it. As one who grew up with Lovecraft's influences all around me, this seemed to be a dream come true. The added bonus of rogue elements cemented it as something I would love. As a staunch lover of Isaac and Teleglitch, I'm used to losing everythng. That fear of a run gone sour is always fresh in the back of my head, but that's often the motivation to jump back in for one more go. At the death of my first character, and the loss of every single key item needed to advance the story, I lost interest almost immediately after jumping in again and stopped not long after. Where did Eldritch go wrong?On a big scale, Eldritch couldn't be better for the gaming market. A voxelized rogue-like with horror elements and a semi-retro artstyle is basically a fusion of everything popular in the indie scene, and they still manage to make the look all their own.Where the problems emerge is from the very hook; roguelike elements. The gameplay is simple and a bit charming and silly to boot, yet with no stats or leveling, there is nothing for you to improve over time. Of the two weapons in the base game outside of your fists are a knife and a revolver. No more, no less. No upgrades, nor perks. To counter this, there are about 6 magic spells to use with their advantages and disadvantages. Some are useless, while others completely broken in their power. There is some equipment that you can find or buy too, but only a few are worth picking up, but there being about 10 in total makes it easy to find what you want quickly. Money, bullets and keys are your collectables. You can throw rocks and bottles. That's it. Randomization can't change much when you're going to see the same things regardless.This, sadly, also applies to areas as well. Everything looks the same, and always ends up more or less in the same spot. Different geometry, yes, but once you see it once, you've seen it all. The enemy A.I. is overall mindless as well. Save for the Weeping Angel-esque statues which may make you♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself first time through, everything follows a simple routine of chase you til you're either too far away or dead. The minecraft elements are fun but make it much easier to circumnavigate trap rooms and such. Once you understand the core game, the threat is minimal, and the game grows dull.This would be easily forgivable if death didn't obliterate your progress, demanding you do the exact same things in nearly the exact same areas with nearly the exact same challenges, destroying any willpower I had to see it through. Apparently, the ending is a dissapointing text message, so I'm pretty sure I didn't miss much.Eldritch suffers from an identity crisis. The areas are wonderfully fun the first time through, but there is very little to offer on multiple playthroughs. Whereas Isaac had a wealth of items and combinations to urge you on, and teleglitch entire world shifts with each run, Eldritch sits at a very indecisive middle, with too little of each to justify extended play, and the great parts spread so thin and far with padding, it highlights just how short a game this would be if it didn't wipe all your progress. Good for a weekend if you want something different and it's on the cheap, but ultimately not at all worth full price.			"

												Eldritch proves low poly art style can still be creepy in this Lovecraftian style rogue-like game. If you are an actual fan of the author you will be fighting creatures from the mythos like anthro-fish creatures called Dagons, Shoggoths, and cultists. You deal with reserving ammo and being granted magical powers to help your expedition to find the souls of the Old Ones.Only issue with this game is that you could find yourself being bored somewhat quickly but can be pretty entertaining if you keep it up with slow bursts of gameplay.

												""Eldritch"" is a strange case for me, as I am not a huge fan of dungeon crawlers. But this one intrigued me, being the fan of Lovecraftian works as I am. The randomly generated dungeons offer a huge replay factor, as does the New Game Plus feature once you complete the man story. (Which depending on skill level can be done within a half-hour of running and gunning.). Even so, there is a decent amount of additional content beyond that. Including three other worlds to crawl and chant in tongues through. A worthy buy for any dungeon crawler or Lovecraft fan.			"

												Recommended. The game has its flaws, but they are overshadowed by its successes.Before I begin, you should know that I do not play many first-person shooters, and almost no horror games to speak of. Eldritch is not a ""horrror"" game per se, but seeks to encourage a similar atmosphere and as such was a newer experience to me than it might be for many others.Eldritch is a strange combination of Lovecraftian horror and first-person-shooter that somehow managed to blend its disparate elements together very well. Anything with a Lovecraftian atmosphere should attempt to mimic the tone and atmosphere of its inspiration - the entire point of which was to make the reader feel not only helpless and hopeless, but utterly insignificant. First-person-shooters, on the far end of the spectrum, are most often about empowering the player to often absurd levels, though recently the trend has been to take a more 'realistic' disempowering approach.If you're willing to jump into the game with your eyes closed - which is easy, as the trailer gives off the entirely wrong atmosphere - the game can begin as very disempowering, and even very unsettling. The use of FOV, lighting, background noise and uncanny help to establish a horror setting early, but still leave the player plenty of room to maneuver.The feeling of uneasiness is sadly fleeting for most of the game, however. Once you learn how the stealth system works and how the enemy AI reacts, most of the game is actually fairly easy. The ""eldritch abominations"" usually die with a few whacks from a knife or shots from a pistol, and an easily-locatable backpack item lets you revive as many times as you have enough artifacts (in-game currency) to afford.Towards the end of the game, presuming you have the presence of mind to find the three special (useless) equipment items, the tone shifts toward disempowerment again. Some enemies will either be very strong or downright invincible, and once you're no longer able to slip past them like a whisper or revive yourself after death, the feeling of uneasiness returns as you realize that it will only take a few mistakes to end the game. Usually, that is not a terrible consequence, but because dying in Eldritch results in having to start over from the beginning, it (often) means losing hours of progress. This was a good design choice, I think, because it makes the closing of the game difficult and forces the player to adopt extra caution in their movements. This game is not the strongest example of first-person-shooting, exploration, Lovecraftian horror or even unease-inducing atmosphere on Steam. But it does each job well enough to blend into something interesting and, to my eyes at least, unique.			"

												I reaaaaally really want to like this game - and I did! - for about 5 hours. As good as this game is, there just isn't enough content to justify anything more than a few hours of play which is a shame as there is some imaginitive art design going on here. As is the case with a lot of procedurally generated games, the random nature of the game makes for a lot of replayability but the level generation follows quite samey logic and it never really -truly- feels all that randomly generated but hey. Thats subjective.Fun game and all but - please release more dlc!			"

												Eldritch is one of those games that strip out all of the fat and leave only interesting and fun interactions. This is pure, organic gameplay from start to finish, and that's why I love this game.Eldritch randomly generates levels by compositing premade rooms in a 4x4x3 3d matrix. Most rooms have little nooks and crannies to explore, and the effect on gameplay by one environmental set piece is affected by adjacent rooms. What you end up with is a 3d labyrinth that forms an interesting level on every single playthrough. In my opinion, this method of level generation is superior to alternative methods used in Delver or Tower of Guns.Stealth is simple yet effective and intuitive in Eldritch. You can lean around corners and crouch to lower your profile and avoid making noise. Attacks on unaware enemies deal more damage, and you can augment your stealth with silent boots, the cloack power, or even the teleport power. (A la Dishonored) In later levels and new game plus, you will need to have mastered stealth to survive.Not every enemy can be defeated in Eldritch. Shoggoths can not be fought; you must run away. (This can cause moments of terror that remind me of Amnesia.) Similarly, you will encounter wraiths which always revive after a couple of seconds and ""weeping angel""-like lizard statues that can only be killed with dynamite. (Just don't wake the statues.) In addition to that, new game plus makes direct combat with many enemies a bad proposition, so you may want to stealth around even the killable enemies.Because of the block based world, the environment is destructable. You can blow a hole through a wall or floor with dynamite or by use of the destruction amulet. In addition to that, there are tools that increase your vertical mobility and ways to circumvent locks. All of this leads to a Deus-Ex like system where every situation has multiple solutions.Eldritch features permadeath, which I believe is necessary for this game to work. Every time you play the game, you get a new level. You can not memorize a level and go back and try again. The fact that you can't fall back on memory means you must always rely on your skill and wits.You are limited to two weapon slots. This is a weakness in the game, since you will probably want to stick with the pistol and dagger for most situations. There are also very few weapons availabe, which limits gameplay variety.While I personally prefer equipment based systems over standard RPG progression, one should take note that you may get all the powerups you need in the first world.There is an upcoming expansion coming, and information released by the developer suggests there will be more items and weapons when that comes. I will likely update my review at that time.In short, Eldritch is an amazing and highly interactive gem of a game. This is a game that tests your ability to think as much as your ability to shoot, and fans of immersive sims will be satisfied with the variety of interesting and well designed interactions that Eldritch has to offer.

												Pretty interesting game. I like how you are immediately thrown into this mysterious world and have to find out what is going on and fight for your life against weird creatures. Dungeons are randomly generated, which adds to the replayability factor. You can use Rocks, Bottles, Daggers, Revolvers and the occasional Explosives to deal with the hordes of enemies you'll find - from fishmen to screeching worms, from floating eyes to Cthulhu himself.All in all, great game, although a little short. Recommended! And oh - don't turn your back to the Lizardmen statues. You've been warned.			"

												A rogue-like like we like them. Huh, too much like isn't it? Well, it is only to avoid saying love as in Lovecraft. Because there are so much old ones.I love the concept, you have nothing and you need to escape of a weird dimention. There are different ennemies with different attack patterns. At first, it didn't seem like a big deal, but I've seen myself drawn back to the game again, and again, and again. The further you go, the weirdest the ennemies get.If you play this game, you'll die a lot. Once you die, you start from stratch but keep the unlocked worlds. Your goal is to collect the 3 souls of each worlds. Once you get them, you'll be able to get free. Or will you?			"

												A fun first-person rogue-like that uses voxel-based environments. Game mechanics are simple and easy to learn and you will likely encounter 80%+ of the items in the game within the first half hour. The game can be beaten in only a few hours but the procedural generation of the levels makes replayability fairly high. This helps keep gameplay from being too repetitive, along with the fact that many items can used in multiple ways and there are a variety of spells you can learn as the game progresses. There is a quality stealth aspect to the game as well. Enemies can be alerted to your presence by sight or sound and you can crouch to minimize your footsteps. You can also throw items/use spells to distract enemies. Overall it's a very unique game that is worth picking up on sale.			"

												I reaaaaally really want to like this game - and I did! - for about 5 hours. As good as this game is, there just isn't enough content to justify anything more than a few hours of play which is a shame as there is some imaginitive art design going on here. As is the case with a lot of procedurally generated games, the random nature of the game makes for a lot of replayability but the level generation follows quite samey logic and it never really -truly- feels all that randomly generated but hey. Thats subjective.Fun game and all but - please release more dlc!			"

If you love H.P. Lovecraft you really should play Eldritch. It's very sad that we don't have a lot of games based on Lovecraft mythos. This game is pretty simple and defiitely worth a try.			"

												I remember receiving this in a humble bundle package and finding it to be a bit disappointing in terms of its rogue-like  repetitive level design. For H.P Lovecraft fans, this would be an adequate fanfic adaptation of some of his lore with a unique rogue premise. Enemies can be punishing as they are fascinating. There are numerous enemies and environments to justify the purchase of this game, it's just that they can become more of the same rather quickly, and there's no real concept of story. Just levels inspired by the lore of Lovecraft's books. If I didn't get this for next to nothing, I wouldn't have went out of my way to get it. But the enemies, weapon choice, and nifty environments make it a worthwhile way to kill an hour or two.			"

												A while ago I did a pretty ""meh"" review of this game, so I've decided to roll back my sleeves and do a good old fashioned pros and cons list.PROS-Lovecraftian monsters are really great because fans of the Cthulhu Mythos get a fun chance to pull out their spotter's guides and get to work. -Glorious replayability. Just glorious.-Decently difficult, it will take you a few tries to beat the game, and even I have not beat the game to get the special ending.-Challenge for speedrunner-Spell system which functions similarly to the spell system from dishonored or whatever those things are called from Bioshock (Sorry, have not played Bioshock in a while).-Its a roguelike... What more do I have to say?-Good amount of rooms to expore in randomly generated levels.-2 campaigns, a special halloween level, a New Game+ mode, and the Arkham Asylum. No not that one.CONS-A few monsters are just reskinned.-All free sounds, so if that bugs you, I don't know, go into the files or something.-No co-op multiplayer.Alright, now time for the ratings!Story: 6/10 It is okay, but mostly just a backdrop for the gameplay, which is alright in this kind of gameGameplay: 10/10 This is where the game really shines, and it shows that a lot of work was put into it. I mean you can slide around if you crouch while running. Its amazing.Replayability: 8/10 It can get somewhat repetitive, but is still amazing.Atmosphere: 6/10 I'm a little torn on this one. The sunken city of Ryleh was not exactly up to my standards of Lovecraftian horror, but some bits are quite nice. Not that great though.Total: 75 This game is very good and I love it to pieces. I would honestly rate it as one of my all-time favorite games. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY IT.			"

												World 1: I scoffed, I shrugged, I triumphed.World 2: I hid, I ran, I cowered.Eldritch, very brazenly the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of Minecraft and Spelunky, bides its time, initially presenting itself as easy and cartoonish and a shameless coattail-rider, before blossoming into a sort of oddball terror . A simple setup, exploring a dimension that’s in equal parts Lovecraft and Minecraft – CraftCraft, then – and accessed from portals in an occult library, yields randomly-generated, peril-packed levels in the current post-roguelike fashion.It’s hard to get past the Minecraft thing, naturally, and there is a part of me which bristles at the apparent attention-seeking nature of it but it doesn’t at all play the same way.I’ve been quite enjoying this game and so has anyone i've shown this game to,i would definantly recommend picking this one up.

												I'll be frank about it, it is fun to play but some gameplay aspects could have been handled better.First of all, you can't choose the difficulty level until you finish a complete run of the game. The game mechanics are pretty easy to learn so, depending on your experience as a gamer, you may feel a sense of unsatisfaction from the lack of challange the game initially presents (this is what irked me at first). Things really get better when you unlock the higher difficulty.The dungeons in the game are each composed of 3 floors, each floor is composed of 16 room blocks on a 4x4 grid. The dungeon structure is randomized, but the room blocks are presets and after a while it gets a little repetitive, though it keeps things simpler.The game offers stealth gameplay, equipment to make your character capable of certain feats like higher jumps or higher speed, magic spells, a little set of balanced weapons and permadeath, which is always nice in these games. It also supports a substantial number of languages and has basic video/audio option settings (and a FOV slider! yay!).Not for everyone's taste but, if you're into it, it will keep you entertained.

												As a massive fan of H.P. Lovecraft I can whole-heartedly recommend this game. As a massive fan of rogue-likes, as well, I can recommend this game. Eldritch delivers a simple objective: escape the confines of a cursed library by collecting the three hidden souls of famous Lovecraft beings. Good luck getting to them, though: this game is tough.The controls are straightforward: you can run, you can crouch, you can punch, and you can use items and spells. Items include weapons ranging from rocks and knives to pistols and wire trap guns. Spells grant you the ability to open locked doors, hide yourself, or charm enemies. The occasional piece of gear also grants you the ability to run silently or disregard fall damage. These items are important because they're your best bet for getting out alive.The core elements of Eldritch are executed very well: survive the ever-changing dungeons of Lovecraftian horror by sneaking and/or fighting your way past a multitude of cultists, lizardmen, shoggoths, and other UNNAMEABLE horrors (thumbs up if you get that reference.) Every floor is fraught with tension and peril as the atmospheric music and groans of the otherworldly follow you wherever you go. Considering the game gives an achievement for beating it in under 10 minutes or less, it's pretty cool to know this game is actually really short, but also really hard. I died more times than I count, but I never felt cheated. Overall, I say this game is definitely worth a buy. It isn't a scary or horrifying game, but it has atmosphere in spades and it's a fun take on the classic Lovecraft formula. The always shifting and changing dungeons fit the source material very well. Yog-Sothoth would agree: this game is cool.			"

												Eldritch is a really nice little game. The gameplay is fluent and there are some creepylooking monsters to kill. But I have two little complaints for the game. Firstly I wish there are more weapons, I get it that you only have one arm to use them, so shotguns and machine guns are out, but I would have at least liked a flare gun or another pistol. Secondly the enemey respawns can get annoying sometimes. But I definiteley recommend this game (I later found out that you can stop them from respawning by simply not looting their corpses)The graphic may scare possible players off but because of the game´s pixelated look runs smooth like butter. Also worth a mention is the game´s soundtrack, it´s just great, really atmospheric and it sets the mood perfectly. The randomly generated levels are a blast to play, I personally really liked the second book and the mountains of madness free DLC area. These levels often include a nice gimmick, for example tiles that crumble when you step on them or invicible enemies. The levels often end with a special building, that really looks quite impressing and stands out from all the randomly generated stuff you have seen throughout the level.Speaking of randomly generated, this feature works surprisingly well. I have never seen any weird constructions during my playthrough and the game still has a feel of leveldesign even though it actually shouldn´t be there.To sum it up I would definiteley recommend this game. It took me about 20 hours to get through the whole game (visiting every area and dying sometimes) and nearly every minute was great and tense fun!Also the game includes one of the best snow levels I have played in a long while ;)(for a more serious take on the Lovecraftian mythos you should check out the long forgotten ""Shadow of the comet"" and ""Prisoner of ice"" and the more popular ""Dark corners of the earth"")			"

												Based somewhat loosely on the writing of H.P. Lovecraft, Eldritch is a fairly easy ""roguelite"" with emphasis squarely on the ""lite"". The story, like much of Lovecraft's pulpy output, is paper thin (I'm a fan, but he was very inconsistent). You're trapped in some kind of magical library and you have to collect certain artifacts to close a portal and save the world from monsters. Elder-gods, I suppose. It doesn't really matter, to be honest. Apart from the occasional paragraph or two of flavour text, there's no real narrative. The game has you descend through three seperate dungeons to collect the ""Souls"" of various powerful creatures, though they aren't bosses and you won't see them represented in the game. These dungeons are loosely themed as a cave, a sandy temple, and a poisonous jungle. Whenever you collect a soul you can return to the library and open a new book; a new dungeon to explore. These stay open even if you die, so once you've unlocked them all you can attempt them in any order you like, though as the first dungeon is so easy it's a great place to stock up on useful items and is the sensible one to do first. You can, if you like, dash through the mazelike levels and just head for the stairs down ignoring any items and enemies along the way, but sometimes you'll have to take a circuitous route. That is, unless you make your own path. Yep, levels are destructible, meaning you can use dynamite to simply explode a path to your goal. Great fun.With its vivid colour palette and chunky voxel graphics, evocative of minecraft, Eldritch looks fairly cutesy and gentle, but this belies a genuine creepyness. Admittedly, this is barely apparent in the first dungeon, which is so easy that you can simply sprint around it, running circles around the enemies and laughing in their silly, fishy faces. There is one enemy here, a shoggoth, whose thick gurgling and grotesque alien appearance should give you cause for concern. Now, stealth seems a better option, and as you're crouched in a corner peering into the murk as the heaving blob hunts for you, vulnerability and fear creep up on you. The shoggoth will have softened you up, but it's the game's second dungeon that really shakes things up and definitely stands out as the one most deserving of respect. You might want to tread carefully around those curious, croc faced statues; they aren't so innocuous as they appear. And watch out for the softly moving wraith, which can't be dispatched by mortal means. There are enemies that are common to all dungeons, like the shuffling, sighing cultits (sounding not unlike Grandad pottering about the house in his slippers) or bad-tempered bugs which seem to fight with anything they encounter. They'll seem like old friends, now. Eldritch has finally got its claws out, and they're sharper than they look. In truth, the lack of variety in Eldritch means that it will be only a few hours before you're used to the tricks and tracks laid out in the various dungeons, and you'll be back to sprinting confidently from room to room. In four hours, I've beaten the game and a longer optional dungeon, and it's fairly telling that there's an achievement for speedrunning the game in under ten minutes. It isn't a long game, but it is quite charming and easy to get into. It's a shame that often, the fear comes less from the atmosphere than from a run ending prematurely, meaning having to start over. If there were a bit more variety, it would soften the blow, but if you can get Eldritch for a few quid, you'll not feel hard done.			"

Posted: November 2, 2014
												I want to be clear here; I really, REALLY enjoy this game. The atmosphere is great, the art style is interesting, the gameplay is fairly fun and the Lovecraftian source material is just tops. The maps are pretty interesting while changing just enough in their layout to feel different from one another. Weapons are fairly interesting, with the more powerful ax or pickax being much slower than the quicker knife. There's also a sort of tactical choice in the spells and items you can carry.Do you want to be sneaky? You'll want Stealth boots and melee weapons, as guns will alert enemies nearby to your presence. Want to avoid combat as much as possible and be able to make quick getaways? You'll want to probably be carrying either a bundle of TNT or a Grappling Hook with you so that you can either quickly climb to safety or make your own escape route by blowing a hole in the nearest surface. Maybe you'll want to equip the Teleport or Lift to get away fast over big ledges. There are quite a few options here.  While this game is great fun as a dungeon crawl, I do have a serious problem with one of the mechanics, and that is the fact that you lose literally everything you have accrued save for any money you've put in your bank chest and any new level you opened. This poses a serious problem.Throughout the time you character remains alive, you gain more hit points by drinking from fountains, can stock up on ammunition for the revolvers, find spells at idol statues, and, most importantly, find the souls of the Old Ones needed to escape the library hub of the game.However, when your character lives, you lose literally everything they're carrying; any spell you may have, additional hit points are reduced back to the starting 3, all ammunition, any artifacts (money) you have on your person, all of your gear includeing weaponry, AND any Old One souls you may have found and placed on the three altars to escape the library? Yeah, they're back at the end of a now newly randomized zone. There is a way to revive yourself, if you're carrying a First Aid Kit, but that costs 50 artifacts to use. I suppose unless it disappears (I didn't notice if it was still in my inventory after the one time I was able to use it) that 50 Artifacts to not lose everything is a fairly good deal.I don't usually take issue with punishment via losing precious items. Games such as Minecraft have made me very familiar with this mechanic, but the issue is that in Minecraft you can store items and the enemies are at a constant level of difficulty, while in Eldritch, the enemies are stronger in each new zone.There is a sneaking mechanic in Eldritch, and if you can find the Stealth Boots and snag them from a merchant (honestly, who would blow all those artifacts?) you can even sprint without enemies hearing a single footstep, but with the randomized terrain and the fact the enemies actually wander the map it's eventually going to be inevitable that you have to square off against something, and if you've just died and are trying to enter the Mountains of Madness, or are fighting a Snakeman with nothing but your bare fists and three hit points, it becomes more or less a necessity to have to slog all the way through the beginning area again, which is now completely re-randomized, and you are forced to re-collect Dagon's soul.

												Eldritch is a First-Person Roguelike, a sub-genre that seems to be growing rather large and unwieldy at times when people want to call it a Roguelike-like or Roguelite, based on the short stories and novellas of H.P. Lovecraft and as you might can guess such an idea very well sounds like a wet dream for many horror readers, myself included.Luckily it works out, Eldritch is a very well executed and fun Roguelike-like-lite-whatever that blends in elements from procedurally generated worlds to mix well with the horrific atmosphere one tends to expect when it comes to Lovecraft. You start in a library that you are stuck in and three mystic books that transport you to other worlds, Dagon, Nyarlathotep, and R'lyeh, your objective is to reach the end of each world to get the three souls needed to unlock the door and escape from the library.Much like other Roguelikes you start with low hitpoints, little to no equipment, and when you die you lose everything except for any money you deposit into the bank, with your one life you must gather money, keys, ammo, and equipment, and find fountains to add more hitpoints or statues to give you magic powers, all the while dodging Fishmen, Cultist, Shoggoths, and other eldritch horrors.The controls and gameplay are very well done, combat is done with relative ease, you can stealth past enemies or sneak attack them, knives for up close attack, rocks to throw, bottles to smash onto walls to lure enemies away, guns can be found though with scarce ammo and sometimes you can find dynamite that will let you blow open parts of the level, most of these items as well as keys to open locked doors can be found in the world, but some can also be bought for money by finding a shopkeeper, this also goes for equipment such as Jump Boots and Good Luck Charms.Most of the story is told through books you find laying around, and overall despite the great atmosphere, the plot lacks quite a bit and the endings are nothing to write home about, but in the grand scheme of things it is a minor complaint to an amazing game.Overall this game is well worth playing, though a bit lacking in content, for the price and fun you will have playing it and exploring the very Lovecraftian world it builds, I fully recommend buying this game.

												At first glance, Eldritch appears to be a cheap minecraft clone, but what you actually get is a much more fufilling experience. It's a rather charming little game that doesn't try to be anything that it isn't, but at the same time it is also a very intriguing adventure through several levels and labyrinths that become more challenging (or less, depending on the power-ups you find) as you progress through the game. It is not a long game by any means, nor is it too complex, but what it lacks in complexity it makes up for with it's sheer curiousity; You have absolutely no idea what to expect from this game. In short, this game was very pleasant to play through and I definitely recommend this little gem.			"

												This game is Fantastic! It's a randomly generated dungeon crawler with some really cool things going for it. Every fight you get in is terrifying, due to your low health and Weapon mechanics (stronger the weapon, harder to find ammo it is). Once you unlock a level it's permanantly unlocked, though every time you die you lose everything (including the items you get for beating a level). PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT IN THIS GAME. You will farm money, you will die to the same enemy type over and over (looking at you lizard statues), and you will get frustrated, but you will have more fun than any full priced game i've bought in recent memory. GET IT NOW. Only thing that could make it better would be coop play. *Crosses Fingers*			"

												This game is a lot of fun.  It's a rogue-like game with procedurally generated levels and fully destructible environments, and it pulls this combination off very well.  You can blast holes through walls, sneak around and explore, and defend yourself against enemies very well in the environments it produces.  I feel like I've mastered the base game, but the NewGame+ mode and Mountains of Madness expansion still beat me senseless, and I'm loving the challenge.I really enjoyed the stealth aspect, and combat is simple but very fluid.  You can sneak behind an enemy, peek around the corner, leap out and stab the unlucky fishman.  Now rush to the next place of safety while his buddy furiously attacks.  Fun times.  :D  This game avoids the regular trappings of holding a button to hug a wall or other gimmicky stealth methods -- it's very approachable, and remains effective as you master it.  I never felt like the controls were inhibiting my ability to sneak or fight effectively.There's a variety of strategies, including sneaking, sprinting, keeping to high ground, and so on.  Your limited item set increases the challenge, yet still gives you a wide variety of tools and options.  Do I want a destruction amulet to burrow through walls, or a compass to find my way?  Which spell do I want most -- conjure blocks or cloaking?  Do I need the medkit, or tinning kit?This is not so much an ""ooga-booga-booga"" scary game, but it can build to a very tense and even creepy atmosphere, particularly after you complete the first book.  It ranges from being funny, to tense, to action-packed, and even freaky.I recommend it to fans of stealth and rogue-likes in particular.			"

												If you like cute games, I heartily recommend Eldritch.  It's a Lovecraftian first person sneaker/roguelike with Minecraft aesthetic.  The shoggoths are particularly kawaii.  Fans of Thief will be immediately at home as this game has Q/E leaning and edge mantling with the addition of sprint sliding!  There's no gaining levels or choosing a class or skills or anything - except finding a few weapons, equipment, keys, spells, health-up fountains and currency(artifacts).  The latter is the only thing that can be saved post permadeath in chests.  Best of luck giving those Elder Things the laugh.tl;dr version: Iä! Iä! Cthulhu Fhtagn!

												I picked this up on the Halowe'en sale and can't say I recommend it.It has a strange ambiance to it that doesn't really feel of anything. Navigation is stressful, the graphics are ugly (and that's from someone who appreciates the charm of Minecraft's visual style), and combat is uninteresting. You can only carry two items at a time, which ends up just making me attached to rare things like dynamite, hoping to find a use for it.The game's only saving grace is the possibility that if I had played it more, I would have gotten into it - but I doubt it.I recommend this to people who like Lovecraftian-themed games, and don't mind the weirdly oversimplistic gameplay.It's hard to explain why - but this game just isn't my cup of tea.

												An incredible game. Super addictive, with an incredibly supressive atmoshpere. Although the graphics may look a bit goofy, the sound really gives the game the atmosphere it wants to give. Through my first run, I had so much fun with this game. It was a bit easy, truth be told, but I had an absolute blast nonetheless. The easy issue was brought to attention with the New Game+ mode that one unlocks when they complete the game for their first time. The only real issues I have with this game is that I'd like the Star Headed Elder things that show up in the [free] DLC levels to have seperate sound effects from the Flying Polyps, but that isn't too big of an issue, and the fairly easy difficulty the first time through.Other than that... I absolutely recommend this game. It is so much fun to play, and that's all that really matters, right? 8.5/10			"

												Eldritch is quite a lot of fun, though somewhat simplistic. There are not a huge amount of enemy types and tilesets, nor are there very many items. However, the levels are very well-generated and interesting, the monsters are creepy, and sneaking around the levels is a LOT of fun. Reviews have said over and over that the game is too easy, and I do concur that the actual act of attacking and killing enemies is typically challengeless as long as you remain unseen or strike quickly. In particular, the first book (level) is very easy. This is not always the case however; sneaking around avoiding combat is very important in the 2nd and 3rd books, and is very tense. I died quite a few times trying to complete the second book, but the third book was fairly easy overall. The end was exceptionally anti-climactic. I haven't tried the New Game Plus mode (unlocked after finishing the game, much harder), but I'm definitely going to give it a play-through (I rarely play a game again after finishing it, but I will with Eldritch, which says a lot).I would definitely recommend this game to fans of stealth games, those that like the retro blocky look, and Lovecraft fans (the Flying Polyps were particularly disturbing). Also, there's a free expansion coming out in a few weeks, we'll see what it adds.			"

												Eldritch is about as much horror game as a horror-wuss like me can handle. It's basically Minecraft Cthulhu, a first-person dungeon crawler with blocky cartoony environments and monsters. The creepy evil of the Lovecraft mythos does come through, and there is definitely a survival element to the game.Your investigator character is not a superman. He/she is a normal person, with fairly limited health and ammunition. The monsters are not too bright, but they are legion, immortal and relentless. Should you slowly progress through a level, risking injury, death and getting trapped in order to stock up on more items? Should you race past the dangerous elite monsters, and risk facing a major baddie or trap later, under-leveled and empty-handed?The audio design, while initially cheesy (most of the monsters sound like the developer's buddy growling into a microphone), is quite effective at instilling a sense of danger. You will find yourself using your ears to judge where a monster is, how far away it is, and what it is. And you will have to make tough choices with that knowledge.As a newbie to the genre, I recommend this as a fun horror-lite first-person dungeon crawler. I suppose if you like concentrated terror and wearing brown pants, you could go play Amnesia or Alien: Isolation. But this is about as much creepiness as my britches can handle for now.One paranoid investigator's thumb up!			"

												An incredible game. Super addictive, with an incredibly supressive atmoshpere. Although the graphics may look a bit goofy, the sound really gives the game the atmosphere it wants to give. Through my first run, I had so much fun with this game. It was a bit easy, truth be told, but I had an absolute blast nonetheless. The easy issue was brought to attention with the New Game+ mode that one unlocks when they complete the game for their first time. The only real issues I have with this game is that I'd like the Star Headed Elder things that show up in the [free] DLC levels to have seperate sound effects from the Flying Polyps, but that isn't too big of an issue, and the fairly easy difficulty the first time through.Other than that... I absolutely recommend this game. It is so much fun to play, and that's all that really matters, right? 8.5/10			"

												I'm a huge fan of metroidvania style games. I like a challenge. But games like Eldritch are damned annoying. If you die, you lose all progress except for any levels that you unlock and money that you've stored in the bank. Any cool items, spells, weapons or ""experience"" upgrades are lost. So you might as well start over each time that you die. Oh and good luck finding that sweet combination of items, weapons and spells again: everything is re-randomized upon death. I died a couple of times not because of the difficulty of the monsters, but because of typical accidents that occur in FPS games: one step too far and falling off a ledge, dying instantly, for example. Or mis-judging the range of a monster's hit-box. This game is brutally unforgiving and falls into the same old mis-placed nostalgic hard-on for ""old school brutality"" which was nothing but a shallow, cynical design by the developpers to get kids to spend more quarters. Not because of some mythical love of the gaming ""craft"". Pass on this if you have precious little time to waste. Get this game if you want to maintain your ""old school"" gaming cred.			"

												Going back to the slightly simple graphics of classic games such as Wolfenstein 3D does not mean the quality of the game will drop. On the contrary, a lesser priority on graphics allows for more focus on gameplay. Eldritch gets the gameplay right, and even the simplified graphics suit the game, instead of looking dated.Eldritch is a difficult game, forcing you, the player, to maintain a constant vigil against anything that could deprive you of your meager health (3 hits, and you're down). Then you've got such difficult decisions to make such as do I take the gun, or the knife? Knife is melee, gun is ranged. Gun runs out of ammo, where the knife lasts forever. Now add in shrines to the forgotten Old Gods which grant you powers when you pray at them, angry penguins, fish people, and soul munching shoggoths, and you have Eldritch.I've not seen too much of the game, having repeatedly died in the first book (it'll make sense when you play the game, but think, level), but that's the nature of rogue-like games, and it does nothing to detract from the fun.Is it Steamified?Yes. Yes it is. Eldritch has both Steam achievements, and Steam trading cards. I have no idea how you'll get some of the achievements though, to my limited skills at least, they are all but impossible. Fun trying though.I received this game free, as part of the Steamified review program. For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com].			"

												I've played for hours now and I still find it fun. I've completed these with 9 resurrects and countless Medical Kits revival. For spoiler reasons, there is an alternative ending.Once you have managed to finish a playthrough, there will be a orbm when you resurrect, for you to pick up to drastically increase the difficulty.Overall, this game has limitless replayability. The dungoens, items, and enemies are randomized every time you resurrect. All 4 dungoens has its own set of enemies and items. There are 3 levels per dungoen, and in each level there are 3 floors. Because of this, the game encourages the player to explore.The player has the ability to destroy and create blocks if they have visited the Destruction Amulet and the Materialisation Shrine. The player also have an option to use the dynamite to destroy walls and/or floors to create a new path. Eldritch also has some good stealth elements. It is up to the players to either go stealthy or just rush through the dungeons. But the more dungoen you enter, the more harder is it for you to escape without dying. Enemies will chase you until you are out of their sight for a few seconds.There is also a shopkeeper per level. Stealing, attemping to directly kill him or setting off the shopkeeper's dynamite, he will come after you. Shopkeepers are one of the most hardest to kill when the player enrages them.Albeit the game's lack of content, the equipable items and magic are enough to satisfy multiple aspects of Eldritch.			"

												When I first saw this on Steam Greenlight, I was both interested and skeptical. Interested because of the concept, and skeptical because it looked kinda meh. When it did have a Steam release, I decided to wait until it was on sale, and boy was it a mistake. Let me get the only good thing out of the way first. Eldritch has a wonderful concept. An FPS with rogue-like elements mixed in with some Lovecraftian lore sounds like a great idea. Scratch that, it IS a great idea. But sadly, as mentioned before, this is the only standout feature of the game, as the rest of the game is pure mediocrity. I would like to start off with the gameplay. You start off in a library, which is a base of operations of sorts. Here, you can take out or put in currency that you have obtained throughout the game, enter into levels (of which there are only three, plus that one level introduced in the free expansion pack), and cuztomize the look of your character (you can actually make yout character look like the god of rock and roll frontmen, Freddie Mercury, but this doesn't change the fact that the gameplay sucks). After you enter the level you wish to enter, you are put in a randomly made dungeon, and that is where the♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan. The game is so stupidly easy, and it feels like the game was designed for kiddies who have never played an FPS, as you can only wield two weapons at once, and you can only have one magic spell at a time. The AI isn't any better, as it is dumb as bricks. Currency in the game is used for two things, and that is to buy♥♥♥♥♥♥and to use magic spells, which is sadly the only other standout feature found in this game. The rogue elements are minimal. In fact, the only rogue part about the game are the randomized levels. Everything else is just look for the items and drink at wells to increase your HP. The FPS gameplay in the end feels generic and lame as ♥♥♥♥, and the rogue elements do not help to stir things up. Graphically, the game looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ as it wants to look like an NES game, following that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trend in indie games that needs to ♥♥♥♥ing die. Now, you would think that because its graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥ the framerate would be fine. Instead, you have some very noticable lag in windowed mode, and it is even more noticable in fullscreen mode. This shows that the game is poorly coded and has optimization issues. Overall, not worth your money. You would probably have more fun playing a full rogue-like game.			"

												Aesthetically the game owes a lot to Minecraft, which is reasonable when you consider you can blow apart walls/floors or create new ones with spells.  It didn't add anything to the game, but it didn't detract as much as I was worried it might.  The enemy models were still entertaining (I loved the fish people and the cthonians).  The sound design was well done, keeping things extremely tense, but still being necessary to know when someone was walking up behind you.  Gameplay-wise, it was somewhere in between true rogue-like and the kind of game I prefer where most of your advancement carries over between attempts.  Unlocked levels and artifacts carry over (or CAN carry over, in the case of artifacts, provided you found a chest to store them in before you die), though trying to jump into the later unlocked levels without the advancement from the earlier levels is foolish at best, so I found it better to just restart at the beginning anyway.  One thing I found interesting was that the strategy that ended up working for me was finding a shop in the first area that had a health pack (the only way in the game to get ""continues"") and, instead of trying to save up your artifacts to purchase it (since you'll need them to buy continues) just save up bullets until you have a dozen or so and kill the shopkeeper.  Then you can loot the health pack, maybe a luck amulet, and a pair of boots which will keep you going for the rest of the game.  The game isn't long, though I haven't played through the Mountains of Madness DLC.   There is a spell system in the game that I never even bothered with, since that spends artifacts and I was hoarding them for continues, though I do like that you get spells by praying to different elder gods.All in all it was an entertaining, tense, dungeon-crawly rogue-like with just a sprinkle of Lovecraft mythos on top.  No buyers remorse here.			"

												Eldritch lets you choose your pace most times, you can blitz around or stealth about.The allure of exploring the dungeons, getting health upgrades and buffing relics seemed like a bit of good fun.Within a few hours I've found he game has become tiresome, but for the wrong reasons.The enemies in the game are good, they vary and can prove to be a challenge.The exploring aspect first drew me in but I quickly saw the patterns and decided the rewards are not that great except for more max hp or ammo.It became a choir to search for these things.Also you are limited to only holding two weapons at a time.  This at first makes sense, but just becomes annoying later on.The only statue buff I found really worth it is the jumping one (mobility is a big thing in this game).The weapons are so-so but nothing I will remember- except for the TNT.  They are fun.My main gripe is the way the special 'you get the good ending' relics work, they do nothing but eventually take up 3 of 3 slots that normally grant additional buffs.I found by taking away these buffs the game is hurt as the player loses mobility and power, to me it made the difficulty feels artificial.When you die you lose the bonus hp you've collected, which is acceptable for a rogue like, but in this game it adds to the grind of searching to get it back up.The shops are ok but offer nothing you haven't already found.The pattern and repetition to the asylum was not for me.The aircraft ice level was fun at first but soon became highly annoying with falling stalactite.The humor and wit in the tailor is not in the game.Overall I feel like it was missing something, something that aids you to speed up the game or upgrades.. or just something, Alas due to the 'yes' or 'no' nature of steam, I would rather prefer to be in the middle for this one but side towards 'no'.

That's pretty much Eldritch right there - and holy crap, is it fun. I may have to uninstall it until my class projects are done. (No prior knowledge of the Mythos is necessary!)Runs cleanly and fluidly even on lower-spec hardware, thought I'd have to draw the line on trying to play this on an Atom-CPU-powered netbook for example. Plays very smoothly on an i5 notebook with Intel's GPU.Anxious for Linux support and better STEAM integration (including cloud saves, achievements, and trading cards). Highly recommend!			"

												Eldritch looks like the developer wanted to take the spelunking from Minecraft and slap some Lovecraft on it.That sounds good enough for me to get the game, but sadly it doesn't live up to the expectations.The thing is, when you dig down in Minecraft, you don't know whether you're supposed to survive that. The caves aren't even made to be traversible, you could fall through a hole any time. You could hit lava, water or sand. The enemies aren't made to be killable/survivable with the most basic of equipment. If you take this out of the sandbox and make it a game on it's own, there's this implicit contract between game developer and player that says: ""this is doable"". This takes all of the tension away. This is something that should be apparent in the prototype stage of a game's production.Eldritch has easily traversible rooms which are ""clean"", compared to the messy world of MC. You can run so fast, that you don't even need to engage a single enemy. You can just run past to the exit (especially easy if you have a compass).There are so few items in the game, that I kept finding the same dagger and pistol over and over again. The dagger swings very rapidly and stunlocks enemies, so that there's really no need for other weapons.Most enemies die to a single hit. You can even throw the empty revolver at them and they keel over.			"

												One of cool games in my inventory. Like my friend once sad ""You like Minecraft. You like FPSs. You like puzzle games."" and he gave me this game with hope ill like it. Game is really great, and once you get into it, you can really enjoy. Choose the way you want to play it, stealth or run n' shoot (btw i prefer stealth). Story is preety cool and all who buy this game, don't forget to read all of the books inside :D. Game is really great, 9/10! (-1 becouse story is kinda short when you run trough game, took me 5h to complete the game.)			"

												I like stealth games, and roguelike elements.  It seems like minecraft version of a primitive stealth game.  The developers seemed to have really put some effort into it.  So it delivers the experience as pictured.  It isn't assasin's creed, but they have fleshed out a world to lurk around in.  However, for the blocky graphics just gave me a headache and made me a little nautious.  The framerate was fine, but I found it hard on my eyes playing it on a 47"" TV when you get close to a wall and you are just staring at huge pixels.  In the end, not for me.  I much prefer games where my TV seems like a window to another world, not staring at a wall :) ... it actually made me nautious.  But if you play minecraft, then perhaps this is for you.			"

												Full disclosure: I worked with this game's creator, David Pittman, back at 2K Marin.Eldritch is a first person roguelike-like with atmosphere and fiction inspired by the Cthulhu mythos, mechanics inspired by immersive sim games like Thief and Dishonored, and it's a really astute synthesis of those things.  Don't write it off just because it looks like a gloomy Minecraft in screenshots; Eldritch is full of tense, unique gameplay moments.  Can't wait for NEON STRUCT, Pittman's next game!			"

												So let me start off with a pros & cons list...-----PROS------Randomly generated worlds-Sneak mechanics in a randomly generated world is a nice twist-Surprisingly spooky & ambient-----CONS------Poor graphics that don't seem thematic, but lazy.-Very short, and with little replay value. (You can see that I've only played for 3.1 hours, more than enough time to beat the main campaign with absolutely no previous experience)-Enemies are all very, very similar. There seems to be about two different AI types, excluding the rock lizards and the slug thing. They pretty much either fly around or walk at you, and sometimes they shoot energy blasts. I got this game during a Humble Bundle, and was glad I didn't pay full price for it.  While I've oftentimes seen this game compared to spelunky, making that comparison is similar to comparing Minecraft and Terraria. Yes, there's mining and building and exploring, but that's about as far as you can draw the comparison. The biggest, most notable difference between Eldritch and Spelunky is the fact that this game is a roguelite, not a roguelike, like this game seems to advertise. Once you complete a world, the next area is permanently unlocked, with zero reason to visit earlier levels. You can also store the games currency at different parts of the level, to be withdrawn at a later time, or a later life. Another big complaint I have about this game is the fact that the graphics do not play to their strengths, much like many other indie games do. These graphics feel lazy, and oftentimes just make the game feel less professional. Yes, it's an indie game, but must indie games when confronted with graphic issues take a simple, more retro style and play to the strengths of that particular style. While the gameplay is solid, I don't feel like replaying the game. I don't feel like it has anything more to offer me than what I had experienced on my first playthrough. The game offers a New Game+ feature for those who beat it, but it feels slapped on, as if they just altered a few numbers in the code and called it good.This game is alright, but I don't reccomend it. If I still haven't swayed you, the only advice I can give to you is don't buy this game for anything over 50% of the full cost.			"

												If there's a rogue-like you have to buy, it's Eldritch. Based off the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, this game combines cute and creepy in the perfect manner. You have a variety of worlds to unlock and explore, with a very simplistic HUD and inventory system. That makes it easy to get into the game and start exploring. From throwing rocks to blasting with dynamite to a variety of magic spells to choose from, the player's bound to develop their own unique method of getting through the game. The library is where you start, and from there you can go to the Mountains of Madness, or explore the book-worlds of Dagon, Nyarlthotep, and R'lyeh. Each book-world has shops, traps, evil denizens, and quirks, all procedurally generated so no two journies are alike. If you wanna see a Cthulhi wearing a monocle or if you wanna punch a penguin to death, I would suggest this game before all others.			"

												This game is really cute and a lot deeper and more fleshed out than the crude look and description make it sound. This game is deep in the way that nethack and most it's text based decendents and it is a rogue-like, not the minecraft clone it may appear to be. It just uses the simple block style art and geomtry to make it more graphical than  going pure text. If you like rogue-likes and you like HP Lovecraftian style settings then it is worth checking out, though I would get it on sale if you can.			"

												Eldritch is a Firstperson roguelike game with a lowres art style, which sort of resembles minecraft. I remember hearing about this game and instantly being interested, so I bought it for 15bux... only to be let down.For 15bux, this game doesn't really have that many features (especially for a roguelike, which games usually have tons of features and be free as in free beer and freedom) and feels more like a 5 dollar or less game. I guess it is a little fun to do in short bursts, but it's not worth the extremely high price of 15bux, nor would it be worth 10bux... yet some how, this made number 50 on top 50 best fps games ever made, which really makes me question why the hell it would even be on that list, when it's so minimalistic in graphics and features, and there's barely any shooting (literally just one gun, maybe 2 if we're talking projectile weapons that shoot). You're pretty much telling me that every game that isn't mentioned on that RPS list is WORSE than this. You're better off paying for Vulture			"

												Tl;dr - Get this game! Eldritch is a wonderful mix between Dishonored's FPS Stealth gameplay and H.P Lovecraft's Eldritch Horror themes.You can play the game at a relaxed, stealthy pace to avoid damage or speed through levels in a test of skill.The visual style is basic, but effective in it's design. Enemies look unusual, otherworldly and disturbing.The soundtrack is fabulous, with an omnious ambient soundtrack and creepy sound effects to further immerse the player in horror.Content is fairly expansive, with three worlds spanning a total of 20 minutes - 1 hour to complete depending on your playstyle as the main questline. There is also a 'Mountain of Madness' Storyline and a time attack 'Asylum' mode.			"

												Elderitch is a game where you play a librarian who explores horrific temples/caves/libraries and traverses his/her way to the bottom of the level picking up various items. Its a roguelike, with randomly generated levels and permadeath. I only wish it could have done more. The base identity of Eldritch is good. A game with lovecraftian horrors, a stealth combat system, with innovative item choices. If someone described that game to me I would probably buy it. The monsters are scary (at first) with weeping angels and giant immortal shoggoths. The asthetics are nothing to write home about, but arn't bad either. Same with the soundtrack.However Eldritch doesn't do enough. Theres diffrent types of items, but only about 3 per item slot. Theres a stealth combat system, but it never expands on it. It has lovecraftian horrors, but since it's a roguelike, you get to see them a lot, and they become less horrific.With this alone, I could say that maybe you should buy the game on sale, and play through it then, if it wern't for one major issue.The game is just too damn easy. First, theres no boss fights. Which means the challenge of each 3 levels of a book (world) is the same. Second, the two items you can pick up in the very first level, the dagger and pistol, are enough to carry you through the entire game. In fact, only one other type of weapon shows up in the later books, and it sucks. Theres no reason to explore and test out new items, when there are two that are clearly the best. Speaking of item balance, the stealth boots take away any form of stealthy mechanic that the game tried to instill. It turns eldritch from a stealthy crawl into a dash up behind the monster and stab them.I beat the game in 3.4 hours. My final run was an hour long, meaning that it only took me two hours to figure out how to win.Spend your money on other roguelikes. Only buy this game on sale if you've already played all the good ones.TL;DRBuy this game if:You have already played all the good roguelikesYou REEEAAALY like lovecaftYou have trouble with most roguelike games, as they are too hard.DON'T buy this game if You want a challenge You like bossfights You enjoy the ""new item"" feeling that some roguelikes bring You are new to roguelikes "

												*This is entirely based on personal opinion but I think its worth sharing for a few people who might save their money.*I honestly like the themes and principles of this game quite a lot. It has unique and linear gameplay that still feels open-world and has consequences. The lovecraftian influence is a neat novelty, with interesting flavor.However:The game is very, very easy, relying mostly on grinding for supplies and unlocking powers and such. Most of all though, and this is entirely on me, I just find the Minecraft-homage graphics very ugly and distracting from the experience. A game meant to be so immersive and involved just loses all charm in faux 8-bit choppiness.To anyone this doesn't seem bad to, go for it! Neat ideas here.

												This game seems like it tries to be too many things at once, and fails at all of them. Though eldritch aspects are clearly evoked (shoggoths, lizardmen, and other things with altogether too many eyes and tentacles and not enough pleasantness), the game inspires no cosmic horror, instead creating jump-scare horror at best. The graphics and design don't feel pleasantly nostalgic, they simply feel like the creators didn't try too terribly hard and just labeled it a ""voxel"" game to ride that trend. The controls and interface are not user-friendly, and the gameplay swiftly becomes dreadfully same-y.As it is a roguelike, of course, your gameplay experience will be a bit different every time you play. But my experience was not one which made me at all interested in playing the game more than the earnest try I gave it; you can look at a pile of rubbish from many different angles, but that won't change what it fundamentally is.

We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

Four worlds as of the time of this review, each one based upon various stories and beings within the Cthulhu mythos (including the infamous Mountains of Madness), brought to you in a Minecraft-style first person perspective.  Randomly-generated procedural labyrinths, some rudimentary resource management, mystical powers, irritable shopkeepers, dungeon exploration, death traps, invincible Shoggoths...  it's all there, watching.

												I'm on the fence whether to downvote this game or to upvote. I'll post it as an upvote for now, but I'm teetering on the edge, simply because of a few factors that are pretty noticable once you start playing for a while.The biggest factor being that it's too easy. Yes, sure, there's a new game plus, but the base game was so easy that I'm pretty sure that a new game plus wouldn't be too much harder to be honest.Another factor to consider is the length of the game. Had I not experimented with different features of this game and always played stealthily taking no chances, it's probably a three hour game at the very least.Now the good things about this game are that it has a stealth system, strikingly similar to that of Dishonored's. Dishonored was a great game to me; I replayed it many many times. So to have stealth similar to Dishonored's really made me ecstatic.I also like roguelikes, and this is definitely a roguelike. Although like I said before, it's a pretty easy roguelike, so it's not a ""true"" roguelike, if that makes sense.All in all, Eldritch IS a good game, but again, as I have said before, this game's VERY short and a little on the easy side. Definitely pick it up when it's on a sale.			"

												This game seems like it tries to be too many things at once, and fails at all of them. Though eldritch aspects are clearly evoked (shoggoths, lizardmen, and other things with altogether too many eyes and tentacles and not enough pleasantness), the game inspires no cosmic horror, instead creating jump-scare horror at best. The graphics and design don't feel pleasantly nostalgic, they simply feel like the creators didn't try too terribly hard and just labeled it a ""voxel"" game to ride that trend. The controls and interface are not user-friendly, and the gameplay swiftly becomes dreadfully same-y.As it is a roguelike, of course, your gameplay experience will be a bit different every time you play. But my experience was not one which made me at all interested in playing the game more than the earnest try I gave it; you can look at a pile of rubbish from many different angles, but that won't change what it fundamentally is.

Easily worth the purchase if you can get it on sale, or if you don't mind paying full price for a good game.

												A rogue-like dungeon crawler with graphics similar to Minecraft. The main objective of the game is to go through 4 different levels with 3 floors on each level, and collect the orbs awaiting you at the end of the dungeon. Once you collect all 3 orbs you can continue on to the last level. Keep in mind you have to do this all in one life, which makes the game somewhat difficult. After you beat the game you can play new game+ or play the challenge dungeon and try to get a high score. 8/10			"

I have only my knife and a rock to keep me safe in this cyclopean hell and I must make it back to the relative safety of the labyrinthine library. A giggle rises from my lips, but I quickly silence myself. I cannot afford to lose my sanity in these deep corridors. I creep forward, darting my view in all directions. Suddenly, there is a dreadful noise behind me! I turn whilst steeling myself against this fresh horror… Awwww! It’s just the sweetest looking Deep One I’ve ever laid my eyes on! Come here, li’l guy! Come – OH GOD, WHY IS IT KILLING ME?Eldritch, by Minor Key Games, is a first-person roguelike set in a blocky Lovecraftian fantasy. It’s unforgiving of mistakes, and it’s so dang adorable, you’ll want to hug every deadly enemy you see. Next thing you know, you’re looking at the death screen, getting ready to resurrect back in the mysterious library.Like any good Lovecraftian horror, Eldritch begins with forbidden knowledge. You awaken in a library. Endless shelves of books, tables, and reading lamps surround you. The only exit requires the acquisition of three magical orbs to unlock. Reading one of three glowing books in the middle of the library will transport you to a deadly realm filled with traps and monsters. Your exploration of these three randomly generated dungeons will net you loot, weapons, and the orbs that will free you from imprisonment. Dying puts you back in the library. The catch? You have to gather the orbs in one life. If you die before you unlock the exit, you’ll lose any orbs you have returned to the library, forcing you to gather them again.The first dungeon you go into is easy. It’s baby’s first roguelike. You’ll be punching cultists, Deep Ones, and beetles to death. You’ll run through the halls with abandon. You’ll be given a magic spell by praying at a statue of Dagon and the artifacts that power your spell will litter the ground. You’ll find a revolver and you’ll never run out of bullets because looting the dead gives more ammo than you spent. The knife is god-tier. You’ll grab the first orb and you’ll teleport back to the library thinking, “This is it?” It’s a trap. In the second dungeon, you’ll run into deadlier monsters that will laugh at your ineffectual flailing. Your gun will never have enough bullets. The hissing Serpent Men will chase you. You’ll begin hoarding the increasingly scarce spell-powering artifacts. You’ll realize that the gameplay resembles Dishonored with its sneaking, spells, and assassinations. Just as you’re getting your groove again, a Shoggoth will crush you with it’s cuddly black tentacles. Awwww. You’ll wake up back in the library.That’s when the deeper mechanics of Eldritch start to make sense. There’s a lean button for a reason. Crouching makes you stealthier. Looting the enemies you kill makes them respawn somewhere else in the level. A rock can be the best ranged weapon because it’s quiet and you can recover the missile after you’ve thrown it. The knife is best used in sneak attacks from behind or above. Bottles can be thrown as a distraction. The Shoggoth will kill other denizens of the dungeon for you if you lead him into them. Spell-powering artifacts can be banked in a treasure chest so you don’t lose everything when you die. You’ll discover that you can purchase weapons and power-ups from oddball merchants. Do you want to keep your artifacts for spells, or spend them on boots that let you leap higher? You can unlock shortcuts to deeper dungeons, but zipping right to harder levels without getting some better equipment is a mistake. Finally, a Chthonian Worm will bite you to death with its lovable lamprey mouth. Awwww. You’ll wake up in the library again.The screen that informs you that you’ve died again has a button that lets you tweet the manner of your death to the world. It’s a painful reminder that Eldritch could really benefit from leaderboards or at least achievements to chronicle your struggles against the forces of cosmic terror. It’s hard to play any roguelike without a scoreboard after Spelunky’s wonderful daily challenges. No matter. Unlike Spelunky, most players will see the end before their hundredth death. Onwards! There are cute monsters to kill.This time, you’ll use the run-and-crouch move to slide through a hole as a Spawn of Cthulhu chases after you. This spell lets you teleport behind that Deep One and stick him in the back before the nearby cultist knows what happened. There’s the orb! If you can only reach it before the moaning horror catches up to you! Nope. You weren’t watching your step and the collapsing floor dropped you right next to your Shoggoth friend. Awwww. Back to the library with you.Recommended "

												It's Minecraft! And by Minecraft I mean an action platformer style roguelike with gameplay mechanics right out of Thief: The Dark Project and a casting system like Clive Barker's Undying so you know, it's not really like Minecraft at all. It's also short and deceptive, the first few levels are pathetically easy as is most of the game in general, then you get to NG + and it devours your soul.			"

												I did enjoy the game, but my opinion doesn't usually fall under the same category as ""everyone"" for most games. My strategy was pretty much the same for the first couple of hours of playing (stealth everywhere and avoid enemies). After dieing for the 20th time, I decided to try just speed running the game. By doing so, the game became a bit more enjoyable; however, I wouldn't recommend it for other players.			"

												Very interesting game. Every level is split into 3 floors and every room can have some small building, so you really navigate in all 3 dimensions, and third dimension is used a lot. You often can sneak above the enemies, jump from one roof to another then fall down to stab someone from the back and then slide to a cover. Stealth system is good, fighting is simple, different magic spells, different items, everything is very cool. No stupid cutscenes or tons of dialogues.Also, you can throw a rock at the enemy, and it can ricochet back at you and deal damage to you! Totally awesome!			"

												Awesome game so far! this game is pretty interesting and appears to be quite in depth. One downside though, is how easy it is. As i've only played this for a small amount of time i cant really provide much information. But on my first runthrough, i completed the first book and ended up with 263 of the currency (alot) A destruction amulet, a lockpicking kit, a revolver, some tnt and 8 bullets. I also have 5 keys, but they are now useless due to the kit. Overall, a brilliant game and i'm looking forward to more of it! Also, bunnyhopping is in this, i'm unsure if this is intentional but its really usefull to run away from things, unfortunately it makes a LOT of noise, so use it wisely!EDIT: as i've progressed, i've seen the game get harder, if ease was a problem, it isnt later on :D I love the enemy design and how the dev expanded on it, making more worlds!

No idea what I'm supposed to be doing other than find some mysterious objects (god only knows where), and for a new player, with no direction and no clue, it seems to be incredibly easy to die - unfortunately to the point where I'm not learning anything about the game in each life.Terrible game, completely lacks any sort of entry point for new players.

												Here is why I - DO NOT GET THIS GAME.Yes, the videos make it look kinda fun and enjoyable. Its not. I was looking for a game that I could start and stop randomly that never got boring like Nuclear Throne. When this game was on sale for a dollar, I got it so I could at least see if it was fun. it wasnt. I got bored in the first 5 minuts. Here's a list why.Bad-Only two usefull weapons: the knife and the gun. Everything else is useless, weak or only lasts once.-Grappling hook does not even work like a grapple. It creates a ladder which is very glitchy.-Graphics get really annoying-More boring and extrmely repetitive (more than minecraft story mode)-Stupid. If you dont know what to do, find dynomite and blow up the dungeon.-The saggoth is incredibly hard to kill. I used 20 shots from my pistol and it didnt die. Most creatures die from one shot.-You dont have a body. You can barely see your arms if at all, and you cant see your feet. -Most monsters are super easy to kill and are really boring.-You will die everytime from the stupidest thing and get annoyed and bored very quickly.GoodN/A			"

												I was attracted by the Lovecraftian theme, but I was repelled by lack of save option. This game has something about it, but I guess that ""something"" is not my cup of tea. You learn this game by trial and error and exploration+memorisation is a large part of the game. There are few multi-level maps in this game. Your objective is to enter them, survive and find the exit. You accomplish this with 3 lives, keys, weapons or praying statues that you find throughout the map, while sneaking past the enemies or killing them (not all enemies can be killed, though). If you fail, you loose all your items and artefacts, resurrect and start again...and again...and again...and again. Get the idea?As I've said, not my cup of tea. No story either.7/10 for the concept. Thumb down for the difficulty.p.s. Although, if you're patient enough and learn the maps and tricks, the game becomes managable. That's the challenge.... and fun (for some people)! But it takes time.			"

												Here is my issue with this otherwise good game. There is no inventory system even though there are a decent number of tools and weapons, and money is the only thing you can stache. I don't mind the lack of interaction with NPCs or the fact that you can only do ""quests"", which is probably the wrong word for it. you can only steal from shop keepers, you're the only human, or person really. The stealth doesn't really feel like it even works, or is possible with the behavier of enemies and their placement. I wouldn't recomend it but maybe that's because it's not for me.			"

												Eldritch is more of a fever dream than a game. It’s an absurdly unfair feeling first person randomly generated dungeon crawler which neither looks the best or feels very good to play.I never understood where I was going or why. There were so many enemies that felt like there was no way to handle without taking damage, and in the rogue spirit damage is a very serious thing. I gave the game a good hour of play and just did not enjoy it. I would definitely pass on this..thing.			"

												The game is extremly easy. For a game that dare have the Rogue-like tag, its a damn shame.I played the game for 2 to 3 hours, died 4 times (1 was because I went inside the DLC world which is the hardest) and I managed to finish the gameJust by having the stealth boot and a knife, I was litterally set for life. Ammo isn't scarse. I could end up very quickly with 40 ammo, and only run out of it at the near end.The powers you can get ingame are either useless or overpowered, luckly you can only have one on you at all timeOne could make me unlock doors, making the keys uselessThe second one was teleport, which was utherly uselessThe last one was the Cloaking power, which I never used because I had stealth boot could have made me overpowered if I wanted to, be invisible AND unheard makes you unkillableFor its current price (15 US$) I do not recommend it. Its boring after the first playthrought, it took me less than 3 hours to finish it and I feel scammed out of my money.This aint a Rogue-like game...			"

												This game came out when ""pixellated first person roguelike"" was the genre du jour and every one man indie studio with dreams of becoming the next Phil Fish was tripping over themselves to throw one of these up on steam. It's kinda cool, and as a game it delivers the first person roguelike experience. However, first person roguelikes are not fun because first person roguelikes miss the entire point of the roguelike experience: turn-based gameplay that rewards strategy.The only enjoyable part of this game is the ""derp"" sounds the fish men make when they hear you in the distance.

												It's a great unique stealth fps with levels like you have never seen before.Don't buy it for those reasons:- It's only a light Roguelike, ie the difficulty isn't high, the randomization is just fair, don't buy it for this aspect.- It uses Lovecraft lore as thematic and there's some parts with a nice mood plus some interesting implementation of some monsters, but don't look for a Lovecraft game.But you could buy it for those reasons:- It is very fun from the fps stealth point of view, the stealth gameplay is quite intuitive and feels more natural than usual.- It has huge large levels with an extreme exploitation of heights as almost no fps made use at this level, one exception I know is the old fps Po'ed. That levels design would be enough to justify the use of sample graphics, to allow such large and complex levels inside descent production cost.- The levels have a fair randomization, but they have also an accurate tuned design for the exploration and progression point of view.- It offers a good range of tools to manage the levels in different ways.- Some monsters are quite unique, without to spoil anything, one really worth the quote, some statues you really need experiment in the game.Overall it's a game aimed to be relatively short but quite intense. The rogue-like aspect uses the fair randomization and helps increase the duration. It's a light fps stealth game with unique large levels exploiting intensively the heights, some parts succeed generate a rather good mood despite the low budget on graphics and sounds.			"

Even the graphics can be looked over in favor of story. The problem is the price. Fifteen dollars for ANOTHER exploration game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ - sorry, stylized graphics - is just too much.

												This game is redundant, plain and simple. I rarely leave reviews, but seeing this have a Very Positive review status while doing so little, I just had to comment on how pointless the game felt.It doesn't evoke any kind of real sense of horror or mystique, and as an FPS, it is extremely basic (you get two weapons and very little incentive to use anything other than those two specific weapons). Upon beating the first dungeon and dying, I didn't feel determined to try again, I just felt disappointed that I would have to trudge through that boring dungeon to advance. I had really only completed the first dungeon at all in hopes that maybe something interesting would happen when I did so, but no such luck.			"

												No thanks. The game wasn't bad to start, learning some things about how the game worked, killing a few bad guys and praying to a few Old Ones. It wasn't flashy but it was somewhat enjoyable. I'd explored for about half an hour, no hint of a save point but that hadn't bothered me because I'd still yet to take any damage from the dozens of bad guys I'd encountered. I actually wondered if I had it on easy mode and if I should ramp up the difficulty. Then I a find a bad guy in a room....BOOM I put a bullet in his face. Follow it up with 4 more and still nothing. Then he spanks me with a one hit kill. I ressurect and have lost the gear I found so far. It felt cheap and it felt stupid. OK I learned that maybe that particular bad guy was to be feared but I wasn't going to drudge around a mediocre game to have more surprises like that thrown at me. Putting this one in the never-to-play-again pile.			"

												Fun at first until you realize all the flaws. You barely get any health so you have to watch your step at every turn which is a pain and then all the levels are random so you might not get any good weapons or anything and the only ways to upgrade is to find a shop somewhere in one of the levels or some other random thing you need to find and most of the time you can't get there before dying. There's not even any point trying to get upgrades or anything because once you die it's all gone, making it feel like you're making no progress at all. There's currency which you can use in the shops but it's pointless because when you die you lose it unless you store it in a safe box but then you need to take it out just to spend it so there's no point taking any out cause you'll probably die before using it. Also you pretty much can't beat the game at all unless you do it all in one session because there's some orbs you need to get and sure when you get them you unlock another level and that stays but the orbs you place on some pedastal which unlocks some door don't stay so you have to redo levels all over again anyway. Some of the enemies aren't fair at all like stone monsters that attack you when you aren't looking and they don't bloody die and some other monster that just doesn't die no matter how many times you knock it down so really this game is just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Fine if you like replaying the same random levels over and over again but it's not for me.

												Delicious. Put the shooter mechanics of Bioshock in a Spelunky-esque action roguelike, and mix with a Minecraft(ish) aesthetic. Oh, and there are Dishonored style magic powers, really smooth movement mechanics (dash and crouch to slide), solid stealth mechanics ... and enemies that are basically the Weeping Angels from Doctor Who. The game scratches a lot of itches for me :-) "

												I really like this game. The dude who made this game knocked it out in a few months, then made the MoM expansion later, and that shows in the variety of gameplay shift from the early levels to MoM.This game is best played with a friend or two that you can switch off with on each level/death, on a big TV, with big picture and a controller. This is a horror game, but it isn't literally frightening like Nosferatu, it is just super tense and amusing. Go for it if you are a fan of action/stealth/exploration.			"

												This game is quite some fun, though it's not going to be for everyone. The story is pretty simple, wake up in library  with no memories and the only door locked with the keys in books that you must get through. While the gameplay is also simple the difficulty quickly works it's way up as you go through the the 3 books, with various challengs unique to each one. Once you get the keys you can leave, and you unock the new game plus mode which make the game much harder. The enmeies are quite varied and take plenty of unfluence from the love craftian side of horor. With basic cultists at the start, working you way all the way to unkown horrors that I really can't explain besides godzilla.This is a very caual rouge like. Death actaully means something, and dying means getting sent all the way to the start since there is no way to save besides starting at the point you left the game. If your looking for a nice game to play for a good 30 minutes or so, should definatley pick this up.			"

												When I first played Eldritch I was torn between hating the merciless permadeath features and absolutely loving the lovely (ish)voxel art and action-packed caving (sort of) then I forgot it and for a whileit lay dormant in my Steam Library, then it was rediscovered just as the Mountains of Madness free expansion was released. When I rebooted it and tried after a month I was surprised by how much more I understood about the mechanics and ways to defeat the enemies and in an half hour I had unlocked the second book! Overall I would say that if you don't mind dying over and over with no saves or item recovery, definately buy it.			"

												I enjoyed Edlritch as a small Pixel Dungeon game. The combat is instantly awarding in the beggining of the game as you scrounge around for ammo decide on if you are going to loot that corpse or pass to prevent them from respawning. (Enemies only respawn if you loot corpses.) There were a few disapointments though. Spending time on combo is simply not worth your time compared to how efficient it is to use a pick axe to just dig your way to the final room being able to skip past all of the enemies. *SPOILER ALER* If you spend any time in the libarray you will know that opening the libarray will allow the monsters of the dungeons to escape their prisonment meaning that after the first world you should skip to go for the 4th ice world and just dig your way to the end of the game, use a grapling hook to climb back up and juse use the path you digged out to reach the bottom of the dungeon to get back to the plane to fly off to the games ending. Any who if you get the game for a few bucks when it was on sale I would say that this game was well worth your cash but, if it's at full price just wait.			"

												Great graphics, enviroments, and fun.The downside is the map system and level layout are pretty dang confusing, death basically means you have to start all over from scratch so progression is difficult, and someitmes the game is a little too ambiguous in what you are suppose to do, or what things do.

												 I have a particular interest in first-person realtime roguelike dungeon crawlers. If you've stuck around for that 8-word (or 5 combo-word) genre description, stick around for more because I'm gonna tell you what I think Eldritch does right and wrong by that genre.I want to sing some praises of the game.Character Control - Lean (left and right), crouch, slide (run/crouch), mantle (ledge climb).As simple as these four mechanics are, I feel they are essential for making a player feel like they are actually interacting with the environment instead of just... sliding through it with WSAD and jump alone. Third person action games are practically all Prince of Persia with the amount of climbing you do, but first-person games rarely attempt much. I appreciate Eldritch's effort here.Interesting Enemies - There are a couple that really force you to play differently, and one in a way that I had never seen in a game before. Others provide some fun flavor that's just enjoyable to interact with.Stealth - Most roguelikes don't feature any meaningful stealth mechanic. Thanks to the character control, Eldritch is very rewarding of careful, thoughtful advancement through its mazes. Since your character has little HP and healing is not terribly common, remaining in control of how you advance is essential to a sense of agency in a game that is otherwise random.Here are some Meh issues -Uninteresting Enemies - Most of the enemies have a boring fireball attack as their only offense. They are also highly predictable when pursuing you.Shops - Too sparse and expensive. The ""bank"" system which allows you store the game's currency from life to life isn't easy enough to access to make spending money worthwhile, which is a shame because some of the items really improve the experience.Length and Difficulty - After 5 hours and only 8 deaths, I beat Eldritch.  After you learn the enemy behavior, deaths only result from stupid mistakes or unlucky coincidences, so it doesn't give that broad sense of growth and education that good roguelikes have. The game also allows you to collect orbs to unlock ""shortcuts"" to the later dungeons (there are 3 to unlock), but to actually beat the game you have to collect all the orbs in a single life anyway. So the shortcuts are only practical for practice, not for actual progress. The result is that the length of the game feels artificial and tedious, rather than hard-earned and rewarding.The Ending - Getting to the end of a roguelike typically takes a lot of effort and it's nice to feel like your effort is tracked somewhere or you have some incentive to... do better or something. Eldritch says ""you won and it's anticlimactic,"" in not so many words.Feature Light - The game feels a little hollow, probably as a result of lacking variety in the game mechanics, enemy, and level event variety. This makes me appreciate the control mechanics even more.Anyway, I'm glad I played Eldritch. It's made me aware of problems I'd have never considered for my own interest in the genre and it had its moments of excitement and inspiration.  I'll definitely continue to play Eldritch as they release more updates.			"

												Not Bad Not greatEldritch is a Rouge lite exploartion game set in a Lovecraftian world and done in a Voxel graphic style.  Think sillent hill if it was done in the minecraft engine.  You search several worlds inspired by the works of Lovecraft trying to decend or acend further into the level until you find the exit. along the way you'll encounter a number of monsters like, deep ones, mummies, shogotohs, flying polyops ect.The game is okay. they did a decent job of depicting a Lovecrafting atmosphere and your character is very weak leading to a real sense of danger. you feel small and helpless which is exactly how you should feel in a lovecraft game.saddly the voxel graphics take somthing away from the experince and theres only a handful of enemy types and only a couple are particularly intresting.  There a number of items and weapons you can get but these too are limited and most of them you'll ignore in faovor of more pratical things like the gun and dagger.  The rouge like nature of the game does add replayablity but greatly limits what can be done with the narrative which is somthing you don't want to skimp out on in a lovecraft game. If your a fan of Lovecraft this might be an intresting distraction for a bit but you'll likely grow bored of it quickly.  If your just looking for a strange indy horror game, there are worse games then this.  If your looking for a great story or a more dynamic game...i'd say get sillent hill or fatal frame.It was fun for awhile but i don't see myself replaying it anytime soon.			"

												A fantastic rouge-like styled after the classic horror novels by H.P. Lovecraft with difficulty only matched by its tense atmosphere and wonderful diversity in each play. It's by no means simple and you most certainly won't complete it in your first ten, twenty, fifty attempts! Heck, even with a huge statement like that I've only put a hearty 12+ hours into it so it's most certainly ""learnable."" It all relies on how quickly you can gracefully adapt to the game's changing environments... And I do mean gracefully. After mastering the game's controls (running, jumping, sliding, leaping and all that will be used quite frequently) you almost feel like you're being thrown around the map! On top of that you have a simple but hardly repetitive group of enemies to deal with ranging from fish-men to flying... organs? It's easy to conclude ""well this is just impossible"" but the game actually does have quite a few ways to completing it! Throwing yourself into the storm over and over won't do you much good so it's always good to take on a strategy. I've recently found stealthiness to be the ultimate path but you do have to be ready to lose some 35-50 minutes instantly from simple mistakes. If you don't feel like taking on all ""three"" worlds at once (it's difficult beyond comprehension but I've done it multiple times!) you can also try the Mountains of Madness: 10 levels of pure hell to retrieve your plane keys (keeping close to the books as always) and then heading all 10 levels back up to the surface! Fun alternative, right? Except.... Well, It's super tense and you'll get lost more than once as it begins to feel more like a labyrinth.  SPOILERS/TIPS A great way to start any campaign is by grabbing the compass from Dagon [The first world ] and returning to The Library. Next you'll probably want to do the Trick or Treat world [ the pumpkin in the bar area ] be prepared to spend about 2-5 minutes here gathering materials for your next run! After you've grabbed a grappling hook and a gun with over 15+ ammo, return to The Library and re-enter Dagon. Complete the first world as so:[for beginners]:-Always look for a way down and try not to re-enter previously entered rooms-Avoid looting dead bodies... and don't waste ammo on those that don't need to be killed!-Press Z to throw items (great if you need to drop your gun/grappling hook for a takeout punch)-Hold spacebar to lift yourself over ledges! It took me almost 8 hours to realize this... it'll save you keys and such, allow you into new rooms, and save you from getting stuck in holes-run and press C (the crouch button for sneaking) to do a power-slide! You'll look cool AND it'll make your jumps longer![For returning players]-Approach levels slowly! Pay attention to the map! Knowing your surroundings is almost necessary to escaping any level-If the opportunity to rush through a floor is available then you should most certainly take it; especially in later levels where there are tons of baddies chasing you down-don't hug walls unless you're sneaking; enemies can easily get the jump on you-try not to forget to peek around corners if you're uncertain how safe a room is (C+E/Q). You can shoot and cast spells when you're in this position-It took me nearly 70 attempts to complete the game and I have no doubt it'll take plenty less for you. Keep at it, soldier!			"

The first few times I got AAAAlmost all the way made the endgame SO much sweeter, and there is plenty of super secret stuff to keep the hardest of cores coming back with a ridiculous amount of added difficulty added on top.

												Personally, I love this game. I do agree that originally, it was really short. I was SUPER excited when I found out that they included the mountains of madness... Which I haven't beaten, of course. What scares me about this most of all is the sounds. The constant sound of them and the feel that I don't really know what's going on is awful. There is nothing worst than the sound of a shoggoth somewhere in the level, and you've got no idea where or how many there are. Even worst is when its wife is the shop owne, and you decide to steal. *shudders*The game can be short, sweet, and to the point. This can mean that you've won by being one smart little sh**, or that you died. Repeatedly. It's definitely a roguelike in that when you die... You start all over. So don't die.I question myself whether it's worth its listed price. Right now, with the MOuntains of Madness, I think it is. I wouldn't mind more updates in the future, say, adding more notes and minor references to Lovecraft's works. This could be in secrets, too, and in maybe a couple new weaons. Doesn't have to be fancy; like, a special type of bladed weapon in the sandy level, and so on and so forth.That said, above all else, I do recommend this game- IF you like Lovecraft's works. Otherwise, you may not get it, and it may not be your taste. Lovecraft isn't nearly as dry as Poe was, but he can definitely be dry. This game corporates his type of fear- that you are vastly out-gunned, out-manned, and just out of your league.			"

												Geniales Game. Sieht zwar aus wie Minecraft, aber außer dem Grafikstil haben die beiden Spiele nichts gemeinsam.Man schleicht durch prozedural generierte Levels in denen alle mögliche Horror Figuren aus den Werken von H.P. Lovecraft lauern und muss sich Ebene um Ebene weiter nach unten kämpfen, mit zunehmend steigendem Schwierigkeitsgrad. Die Grafik ist zwar sehr minimal gehalten aber die Spannung wird hier (wie in vielen Horror-Games) hauptsächlich durch die Audioatmosphäre erzeugt, welche in Eldritch sehr gut gelungen ist.Um sich gegen die zahlreichen Gegner zur Wehr zu setzen gibt es verschiedene Waffen und Powerups, z.B Unsichtbarkeit, stärkere Angriffsstärke usw., die man im Level findet, hin und wieder in Shops kauft oder von getöteten Gegnern lootet, die dadurch aber wieder an einer anderen Stelle im Level spawnen, also sollte man sich öfters überlegen ob es das loot Wert ist, besonders mit niedrigen Leben.Fällt man allerdings doch einem der Gegner oder einer der Fallen zum Opfer, bedeutet das in guter Roguelike Manier Permadeath und man kann ein neu generiertes Level von vorne beginnen und sämtliche vor dem Tod gesammelten Gegenstände gehen dabei verloren.Eldritch ist kein hardcore schweres Spiel, was es für mehr Leute zugänglich macht, aber kann besonders in den fortgeschrittenen Levels doch anspruchsvoll werden. Das, ergänzt von dem sehr guten Sounddesign und prozedural generierte Levels, die theoretisch unendliches Wiederspielen ermöglichen, macht Eldritch zu einer klaren Kaufempfehlung.			"

There's story dispensed through text in the ""hub"" world, and it's a little lackluster. The gameplay itself is fun though, and it's always satisfying to toss a bottle at a Shoggoth.

												Pretty cool little game. It's a 3D/FPS rouge-likeThe only con I see is navagating up and down lvls is tough because sometimes you go up a level and its just a tiny dead end room, then you have to back track. so you need decent memory otherwise youll be wasting lots of time looking for ways to advance down the dungeons.Another con I just experienced is low FPS. It doesnt happen all the time so I thought it was my mouse making me rubberband but it looks like certain parts of the game cause bad FPSI reccomend it if you like rouge-like games. cool concept with the 3-D/FPS			"

												This game has blocky graphics, but ignore it, it is intended to be so. The game has an unique, nightmarish feel to it, eerie soundtrack, good controls and gameplay, it is cheap, and it has unusually many languages to choose from. Even my mother tongue finnish. So I'd say you can't go wrong when investing a few coins in this clever little atmospheric masterpiece.			"

Has a high replay value.The esthetic also does it no harm. Some people might object to how cute the enemies can be when they are supposed to be lovecraftian horrors. But I think it works well because it is unique. The simplcity of the graphics also serves gameplay and the game runs very well. Looking forward to New Game +, and hard mode.			"

I recently came back and read through the books and took a look at the game as a whole and i started to love it. It for me was really quite fun, it has a creepy atmosphere as you get deeper into the game and some enemies are really quie scary. I personally just love how this game plays out and if your a fan of lovecraft's work then you may find this peculiar game to you liking.			"

												Eldritch combines stealth, survival, and exploration in ways that I have yet to experience in other games. While the normal campaign is rather short and easy, the new game plus mode will put your roguelike skills to the test. I would have preferred having access to this mode from the beginning of the game, but even as is, I would say that this is a great buy for roguelike veterans. While it might not have a deep RPG system or a lengthy item list, destructible environments and some great random level generation make Eldritch a unique experience.			"

												Surprisingly a good take on Lovecraftian fiction. Many games don't do the genre Lovecraft created very well, the only exception in my book would be 'Dark Corners of the Earth' and the 'Call of Cthulhu' paper and pen RPG. This game isn't 'THEIF' or 'Dark Corners of the Earth' or the next revolution in gaming, but if you are looking for a game to kill time and have a good time, 'Eldritch' is the game to play. Using simplistic rogue styled gameplay, the game is suprisingly well created. The player has the ability to run and slide, look over corners, sneak, and many more. It also has a refreshing play-through, because every dungeon is different. With the additional 'Mountains of Madness' DLC that comes WITH the game, this is, FOR SURE, a great buy.			"

												Eldritch is an FPS, stealth-horror, rogue-lite in which you delve into dungeons full of monsters and traps that you have to deal with using the tools and abilities the game gives you along the way. It features a strong atmosphere that keeps you on your toes; not knowing what might be waiting for you around the corner.This is how the game experience was for me, and I loved it. However, as time went on the game's horror-elements began to peel away as I better understood the mechanics and how easy it was to avoid the enemies in the first place. Find the right gear and know how to cheese the enemies' AI and the game loses that creepy edge it once had.Regardless; the game is still a lot of fun although it doesn't have the same replay-value as other rogue-likes of its kind. However I don't think it really needs to. It lasts just long enough and I don't think it would benefit from being as replayable as something like Spelunky or The Binding of Isaac.It's incredibly simple and incredibly effective, and that's what makes me want to recommend it.PROS:- Simple yet charming graphics.- Strongly atmospheric SFX and ambience.- Fun and interesting gameplay mechanics.- Great gameplay progression.- Lasts just long enough.CONS:- Very little replay value.- Loses its strong atmosphere as you learn the mechanics.SCORE: 9/10 "

Those beasts can´t be killed. Or is it a dark young? I can´t tell anymore.Then you casually walk to the 'Ye olde Mythos-Store' to buy or steal even more fancy loot and start all over.Be careful not to catch the shopkeep´s attention when stealing - he´s one tough mothfer....Anyways.

Eldritch is a procedurally-generated FPS dungeon crawler with rougelite and stealth functions built in. The premise of the game is to collect 3 orbs, one per world, and use them to escape the hub area, known as the Library. Each world exists within a book on a pedestal within the Library, and each contain differing enemy types and hazards. Within the Library, 3 extra worlds exist, including the Mountains of Madness, Trick-or-Treat, and the Asylum.Within the game, you can find basic items, such as artifacts, keys, and ammunition. Stonger items include boots, gear, kits, weapons, tools, and much more. You even discover shrines that give you magical abilities. Artifacts act as a form of currency and as fuel for your magic, and can be stored in bank chests to be used in future runs.You begin the game with no items or build at all. You find everything needed within the books to make a build. You can take a stealthy approach, using silent weapons to subdue foes or tossing items to distract them instead. If that doesn't suit you, then try going in guns blazing, shooting anything that moves and blowing through walls. With certain builds, you can even just outrun everything, not really fighting them at all.Death is that of a rougelite, removing all progress that you have made in the worlds. However, artifacts that have been banked and opened books stay unlocked, making death a matter of trying again.The game is really easy to get into, but takes time and dedication to perform well in. With it's high replayability, it shouldn't be too hard to continue trying.

												(Ignore the hours played, I've put at least 50 hours in playing it off steam)Sets a new precedent for quality in a first-person roguelike. Eldritch has huge replayability thanks to its great demand for skill. It's the best example of ""hard but fair"" I've ever played. You'll die a lot, especially on the extremely tough New Game+, but there's always multiple ways to approach any challenge. The controls are simple and tight while still providing a ton of room for mastery.Oh, and the art and sound design are great as well, and the DLC is free, and there's no DRM.10/10, one of my favorite games ever.

To The Point Review:+Roguelike+Unique-Mix and Match Tactics +Challenging+Lots Of Play time+DTH Ratio: 0.41$+Great Atmosphere+Strategic+Unique Enemies and AI-At times brutal difficulty-Somewhat repetitive exploration-Surprise EndingFluff Review:Eldritch is a great game with a weird name. Even though this game never explains the origins of its name, it might be linked to the definition of the word: “weird / spooky”. This game certainly is spooky, and unique. The worlds you explore are randomly generated in this 1st person roguelike. The tactics you can employ can be as diverse or simple as you need. You can sneak up on people and stab them from behind for a critical hit, you can shoot from afar, or you can distract your enemies and never face them at all. Personally, I would summon Shaggoths (what look like giant furry heaps of hay painted green with bloody teeth and creepy eyes) and have them lash out at all of my enemies, whether it attacked baby cthulus, wizards, or lizardmen. I am somewhat ashamed to admit that I took a savage pleasure in strolling into a shop, talking to the clerk, and then summoning a mighty shaggoth to murder the clerk while I looted the store. But that is the beauty of the game. You can choose what you do, how you play, and risk your safety. The game is permadeath, so the penalty of getting hurt can be brutal. I played 36 hours before I beat the game, so my Dollar to Hour Ratio was 41 cents for every hour I played the game, which is great. The enemies you face are unique. Different species sometimes fight each other, wizards hate you, and Shaggoths want to kill everyone. Shaggoths are invincible, so I ended up adapting my strategy to locking them up in little huts I encountered. The difficulty can be, at times, brutal. I remember at one point being halfway through the game, and falling into a hole in which I could not get out of, and I was forced to restart my game. Once you play the game a lot, exploring can become repetitive. The end was very much a surprise, and not a good one. I liked where the story was going, but as it reached the climax, you click ‘f’ and the game is done, just like that!Overall, I would give this game a thumbs up.			"

												I personally would say that this game can be worth the $15 it asks for. Most people talk as if this game is simple and easy to beat. I do not find it to be that simple. The whole goal of the game is to go into a dungeon to get an orb to unlock another dungeon. That's what i've found so far at least. I haven't progressed farther then the second dungeon as I died while playing in it. Upon death you lose all of your items and money (Aside from any money stored in the games ""Bank"") and can either respawn in the normal library you start in or go into another dungeon that is timed. I tried out this timed dungeon a few times after dying but found it to be a lot harder then the other two dungeons. It throws all the enemies and items into the dungeon with a (rouhgly) two minute time limit to get to the next floor or be consumed by a block smoke of death. This being said, if you do make it through this timed dungeon I assume you get to go back to the library with the items gained and have an advantage over whatever you are facing in the next dungeon. The only problem that a player may encounter in the game while fighting is the amount of health that is givin at the start. You can find health boosts to raise your health from three, but it only does it by one. This adds the difficulty as the only hard enemy in the first dungeon is a blob that you can't kill. The second dungeon however has a ghost of sorts that will hit for two points of health and is infact unkillable as well. (Though however hitting them causes them to ""play dead"" for a couple seconds) All in all this can add some challenge if, like me, you play the game without the intent of speed running it but instead taking in whatever it has to offer gameplay wise. I couldn't help but feel like a more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character from Dishonored due to the powers that can be gained along with the dagger that can kill most things in two hits. In short:=The game can offer a more play time then the two hours that most people complain about. I assume they get that result because they bum rush as fast as they can.=The main disadvantage a player will have in the game is the lack of health and the rarity of places to increase health (Though food to heal can be rather abundant)=The varying difficulty in dungeons can be seen rather clearly.=The graphics aren't really anything that bad. Honestly, in this time period people can make games that look anything from the original mario to the latest AAA FPS game and you'll still get someone complaining about the looks of something. So if you don't like the game from the first look of the provided video or photos and already let it spoil the game for you then you probably shouldn't get the game.			"

												Eldritch is a game that works out a bit however you want it to; what feels like a stellar fusion of ambient horror and rougelike for the slow and cautious can be an entirely different affair for the sort who wants to run in guns a-blazin'.  This results in a game where your experience can be highly personalized, which is far from a bad thing.Eldritch has you taking on the role of a lone Librarian who must delve into sinister realms in their search of escape, dealing with Lovecraftian horrors while salvaging resources and managing whatever hand they're dealt.  The monster variety and what they bring to the table is impressive for the game's scope - one achievement tasks you with finishing the game in under ten minutes, so this is hardly the lengthiest of affairs, though there's a fair degree of difficulty in the obstacles one must overcome here, and that's ignoring the increased challenge of new game+ and newer areas released over time after the game's initial release.And those extended additions are well worth mentioning: the main game sports three worlds and a final challenge to fight your way through, each with its own distinct flavor with regards to traps, archetecture and monster variety.  It's a solid package in and of itself, but the addition of a score-chasing, fast-paced scavenger hunt through the Asylum, the lengthy and absurdly challenging mountain expedition, and a fairly friendly bonus feast of a Halloween realm are all welcome additions, adding to the game's replayability and depth.Eldritch isn't the prettiest thing you'll see by any stretch, but the audio atmosphere is strong, and the player's vulnerability only adds to the tension.  Your decisions as you progress greatly impact your odds of survival, and the obstacles you face are overwhelming in number.  Whether you choose to take your time and soak it all in carefully or run in screaming like a banshee, there's a lot here worth your attention.			"

												Eldritch is as cool as it sounds. It's fun, well-designed, surprisingly atmospheric, and even a bit terrifying at times (there's at least one enemy that will keep you extremely paranoid).My favorite part about the game is the 3D design of the levels. Each floor has multiple ""sub-floors"" and there are a lot of ways to move between sub-floors. Finding the exit is usually not too difficult, but finding your way to a shop or other area of interest can be surprisingly involved. There are also ways to get around this such as dynamite and pickaxes, which really take advantage of the 3D maze design.While the game itself is a bit short, it can take a good number of attempts to complete it, not counting the extra campaign that can be accessed right from the start. Survival means learning the hazards of each area and how each enemy behaves. There's a lot of challenge to this game, but it ultimately feels fair.There's also a decent amount of extra stuff to go for when you beat the game, such as a harder new game+ mode, a super-tough extra area with a leaderboard, some challenging achievements, and more.As someone who was just getting tired of roguelikes, this game was refreshing and fun.

												A simple, first-person RPG inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. The sound and the visuals definitely give you a creepy Lovecraft vibe.

												I definately recommend this game...while it's on sale!Honestly I wouldn't have touched this game at it's original $15 dollar asking price. But while it's on sale, everyone should pick this game up.Eldritch really ain't half bad. A basic rogue-like but it is very fun to play. Though I learned quickly that the knife and gun are the best weapons and I basically ignore everything else unless I'm desperate or curious. Cloaking and Teleport is also good, but you're never guaranteed those powers.I only use the gun on enemies that can fire projectiles or are hard to kill with the knife (I learned the hard way that Shaggoth is unkillable). But anyway, there is just enough variety to let you experiment with your play style and how you want to go about traversing the levels. Sometimes I try to rocket past every enemy and just make it to the exit, other times I play around and kill every monster in an area. (The ones that can be killed at least) But just remember that when you loot a dead enemy, they respawn later on.The levels don't seem very hard to navigate though, at least as long as you have a compass. And so far it seems that as long as you head downwards, you are going the right way. The shops have good items, especially a pair of boots that silence your footsteps. It's pretty cool.  That's basically how I rate this game. Pretty cool.			"

												I absolutely love this game. It has a sort of minecrafty asthetic to it even though block placement isn't really a part of the game. To be totally far, however, there are a few items that actually will allow you to place/destroy blocks. This game is set in the Cuthulu mythos, but it doesn't really have much to do with any actual lovecraft story. Lovecraftian monsters and archetecture just fill out the level design. If I had to pick a game to compare this to, I'd have to go with spelunky. This game really does feel like a 3D spelunky. You start on the top floor of the level and have to progress through traps and enemies in order to reach the bottom.			"

												A neat little timesink that's shockingly enjoyable and atmospheric considering its texture quality.In the first 3 minutes the game had me transported to a labyrinthian maze, launching and swinging from grappling wires, and getting eaten by Shoggoth.  Eldritch is a sweet little Lovecraftian loveletter in the guise of an FPS puzzler.  The overall structure of the world is hub-based, with a library serving as your home base where you may teleport to various realms in search of supplies, powerups, and monsters to battle.  The levels are sprawling monoliths with varying (and sometimes destructable) terrain; and the soundtrack and effects are genuinely creepy, creating a surprising amount of immersion in a game whose texturing would make Wolfenstein 3D proud.

												I don't really mean to give this a bad review, I just find the game really... meh. We have a Call of Cthulhu themed stealthish RNG rouge-like where you have to pass 12 levels to win the game. First off, I'm a big lovecraft fan and a Call of Cthulhu writer, so I really appreciated the journals left around and I was very interested in the asylum portion of the game, just from a creative standpoint. However, the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired and a lot of that comes from the format of the levels. You go through 3 maps to get souls of various gods. The problem is that every map is basically the same. Sure,  there's an underwater theme, a desert theme, and a davy jones/nautical theme, but in every map, you have one goal, find your way to the exit at the bottom. You have to race to the bottom 3 times per themed area, which means you have to successfully pass 12 maze maps before you can even attempt the finale. With that, its no wonder that only 4.5% of all players who bought this game have actually finished it. Not to mention that to get the best ending, you need to find 3 sacred items that are hidden somewhere within the 12 levels before the finale. Because of the level design, I barely find myself sneaking and instead just race to the bottom as fast as possible it works 66% of the time. Additionally, I found the combat to be too easy 66% of the time, negating the purpose of sneaking all together. Why so specific? The Cthulhu and Dagon themed areas have really easy enemies. Deep Ones, Cultists, and Star-spawn will usually either kill themselves by accident or a knife is enough to kill all the enemies in a level without taking any damage. However, the Nytharlotep area is by far the hardest and can take hours just to get a single good run in. This is because the enemies are really non-standard. One enemy (of which there are many in a single level) is a mummy that can't be killed, only stunned. Another is a lizard statue that teleports to attack you if you stop looking at it. The problem then is that to finish the Nytharlotep area, you have to pass by a hall of lizard statues lined up like terra-cotta warriors. You can't look at them the whole time because the door they're guarding is locked most (if not all) the time and so your only hope is to find enough dynamite in the stage to get rid of them or have enough health points to take the hits. Its really frustrating to reach the bottom and then to die because of this one enemy type that will alwasy be at the end point. Last note: I wish they had put in a different god than Dagon, because we've already seen Deep Ones in a Call of Cthulhu game before. I wish they had done something like Yog-Sothoth or some-such. Anyway, again this isn't a bad review, its just... meh.			"

												Lots of thought put into this game, enemies and atmosphere are genuinely unsettling, and the randomly generated dungeons are great too. I'd recommend playing ths game, in the dark with headphones to get full effect.			"

												A fun little adventure game with a minecraft aesthetic and a Lovecraftian theme. I like what it's going for, the only problem is that it's far too easy. Enemies are easily killed or avoided - I sprinted through the last few areas just knifing everything to death - and weapons and ammo are plentiful. With a certain item/power combo, you can get anywhere you need to go in any of the areas. Nevertheless it's not a bad diversion. If you like the looks of it, I recommend grabbing it on sale.			"

												Eldritch is essentially Spelunky in first person that plays like Dishonored and looks like Minecraft. It's fun and engrossing, controls extremely well, and strikes a moody tone. I bought the game for a $1.50 but would have happily paid somewhere between $5 - $10.			"

												Lovecraftian game that I can't last five minutes in, but the goofiness of the baddies and the environments make me not mind getting killed over and over and over and over and over and over and over............Game seems to basically entail escaping one level after another once you teleport into it.  I have yet to escape any of them, but it must be possible right?  Enemies are interesting and silly so once again, I don't mind them killing me over and over again.  I got it on sale for a few bucks and it's worth it.  Had I paid full price, I'm not sure if I would have felt the same way.  If nothing else it's a good time waster type game if you have a fe minutes to kill or are bored.  Levels are never the same, so you always see something different.			"

												A very twisted and interesting little game. There are a lot of great nods to the Cthulhu mythos, and the game is simple enough to pick up and play and explore. The design does make the game seem Minecraftesque, but the atmosphere will quickly change your perception of this game.The only real short coming of the game is that while it is simple, it may be a bit too limited for gamers looking for current gen thrills. But if you're willing to squeeze out more from this game there is a lot to be had: speedruns, Asylum challenges, New Game+ mode, and the atmosphere means that you will find yourself coming back again and again. If you're into creepiness and Lovecraftian horror, you will play this game. Everyone else, this game is worth giving a try.			"

												This was a game I almost skimmed over due to its 'Minecraftian' graphics and the general lack of quality in most Lovecraft-themed adaptations. I'm glad I didn't.I was dumped into this game with no idea what was going on, which automatically put me on the defense. As I delved deeper, traversing the game's labyrinthian levels I felt an increasing sense of forboding and terror. The randomized level design really does so much more for this game than just replayability - it embodies the sense of total alienation from what we expect from reality. The bizzare and often functionless twists, turns and passages create an unrelatable setting that is slightly off-putting - even moreso with the knowledge that some unspeakable horror could be lurking just around the corner.The audio is spot on for the more cosmic-oriented arc of Lovecraft's work. Droning saw-wave synths with occasional atmospheric oddities, sounds of doors opening and footsteps, the screechings of some extraterrestial fiend - it all culminates to add to the immersive dread of this title.If you're after a terrifying alien Lovecraftian experience then this title might just scratch your itch.

												The game is fun, but I'm mostly going to be talking about issues for it.First, theres no way to reset the game! I even tried reinstalling it, but the random generation for the library was not reset, and neither were the messages the game shows you when you do certain things for the first time. I hope you read and memorized them, 'cause you're never seeing them again. Certain enemies are kinda bull, like the fire-frog, which you wont see, and which fires too fast and acuratly to melee. The statues suck too, if you wake one up you're basicly already dead.If the developer sees this, please add an option to reset the game. I'd love to see everything it has to offer!			"

												The graphics leave a lot to be desired, but the gameplay is definitely fun. This is the Lovecraftian shooter that I've been wanting for a while. You have very little HP and die quickly. Ressources are limitted and need to be stockpiled. Ammo is scarce and valuable. I wish the music was a bit better, it doesn't really fit with a lovecratian horror ambience, but I can always mute it and play my own music, so no real loss there. This is a game that I would like to see get an HD remake.			"

												Ill make it clear. Never Read an H.P Lovecraft book.. but from what I've managed to study about this game and the books theyre based off of The game nails it pretty good, So for fans of Mr Lovecrafts work this game is a must have!Personally this game makes me think of the first Legend of Zelda but in 3d with the ability to grab ledges and climb and change your weapons to even a gun which ammo has to be gathered most of the time.Not a terribly hard game to beat considering if your good you can just get a compass and a pickaxe and finish all three books in under ten minutes as well as the final level after.. I have yet to make a dent in the New game Plus mode though so the replayability is actually unreal for just a small game no ones ever heard about.. I keep coming back due to these factors and all around its actually fun to try to stealth or slay your way through the levels.. though limited to like 6 levels ive found they are procedurally generated and you never get the same game twice.. Well done highly reccomended to anyone not just fans of Lovecraft books =)			"

												This game is an absolute delight. The first time invokes terror, a terror that, like many games, you eventually dispel as you finally make your way to your first victory, only to return when you're low on health, and hear something around the corner. The moments of fear are gripping, the moments of action thrilling. There is a true lucidity of design here, it feels as though everything is in its place for a reason. I felt satisfaction and anguish in equal measure, stabbing many a cultist in the back only to duck into a narrow crevasse a moment later, waiting for the sounds of a Shoggoth to recede into the distance. My blood has chilled as a monster of stone has spotted me, and I have stalked through R'lyeh, fearful of waking its denizens. Immersive and well worth the price, this game comes highly recommended. Truly a study in maximising minimal resources, from a game designer's perspective. Here I thought I would never encounter pixel-induced terror, but Minor Key Games has proven me wrong.			"

												I'm not really one for 8-bits indie games to tell you the truth. The graphics at first didn't catch my attention. So, I wasn't planning to buy it. Later it was on sell for around $2 and this game was recommanded by some top curators; I thought, why not?I was thinking to myself that the game was only $2, so I had nothing to lose; bought the game.This game is amazing. I love the eeriness that overwhelms the game; well done developers.The game takes place in a huge library. You ""read"" a book and you get sucked in into the world/demension. Your task is to keep getting out into you find your way back to the library. Easier said than done.You're always conscience on what you're doing in the game; trying to hear the mosters talking to know how close they are. You can go to the shop, buy or steal and run as fast as you can. And you might even be able to kill the shop owner, go back, and steal everything else.This is by far one of my favorite indie games ever.9/10			"

												This game is an absolute delight. The first time invokes terror, a terror that, like many games, you eventually dispel as you finally make your way to your first victory, only to return when you're low on health, and hear something around the corner. The moments of fear are gripping, the moments of action thrilling. There is a true lucidity of design here, it feels as though everything is in its place for a reason. I felt satisfaction and anguish in equal measure, stabbing many a cultist in the back only to duck into a narrow crevasse a moment later, waiting for the sounds of a Shoggoth to recede into the distance. My blood has chilled as a monster of stone has spotted me, and I have stalked through R'lyeh, fearful of waking its denizens. Immersive and well worth the price, this game comes highly recommended. Truly a study in maximising minimal resources, from a game designer's perspective. Here I thought I would never encounter pixel-induced terror, but Minor Key Games has proven me wrong.			"

												If you buy this game (and you should), be prepared for the day you decide to throw TNT at a wall to see what's behind it, and find a group of Deep Ones, Cultists, and various other nasties, before they all decide to converge on you. As they get closer and start dealing damage, you start to jump around, punching like a madman because you just started and the only thing you had found so far was the TNT, avoiding hits and cultist fireballs like a gazelle on meth, until you pause and look at all the dead bodies of your enemies. After you loot them and walk away, feeling pretty good about yourself and all your new Artifacts, you jump a chasm too early and fall to your death. (Review was based on a true story)			"

												Quick review: Well worth the purchase, spend your money on this product. Longer review: Eldritch is the kind of game a lot of us roguelike fans look for. Each world you enter has 3 levels, each level having 3 layers, which at first doesn't sound like a lot. However each level is made by several randomly generated 'squares' holding random items, enemies and secrets to hunt out. Sometimes the generated parts don't seem to fit in with the squares next to it but considering the lovecraftian theme of the game this really only adds to the bizarre non-euclidean feel to the worlds with each world feeling increasingly dangerous and bizarre. Now a bad part of this game is that if you push through with a speed run it's not hard to finish, however the real charm to this game is taking your time to explore every nook and cranny of the levels you're in. Finding the little secrets and involving yourself in the survival aspect of the game is really what brings out the charm and tension the game has in spades. Lovecraft fans  will get a huge kick out of identifying the various monsters you can slay (or more likely run away from) and even get a laugh out of the shopkeepers that are unique to each world (The veiled lady Shoggoth was my personal favourite). Speaking of shopkeepers the game really has a great mechanic in the form of artifacts, which act as both your source of magic and currency. Do you spend the artifacts you have to get some vital upgrades in the shop, or save them for the unholy powers granted by the Cthulhu statues? Or even put them into your bank, to save in case you die later on? Bullets are also somewhat scarce to come by and sooner or later you WILL find yourself falling back on to stealth to sneak past enemies or risk going up behind them and taking them by surprise. Another great mechanic lies in if you want to loot the fallen foes for possible ammo, keys or artifacts but be warned, looted foes WILL rise again to continue hunting you through the levels. More than once you'll find yourself making the tough choices to risk another battle with a monster just to gamble on getting an extra key or much needed revolver ammo.You could maybe point out the blocky graphics count as a negative but for us born before the year 2000 the graphics only add an old school FPS look to everything, when games would punish you for making mistakes and, trust me, this game will PUNISH YOU for acting cocky or not thinking an action through. Think you're tough because you've got full health and a strong weapon? You'll be cursing blind when something leaps out at you from the shadows and mauls you to death because you weren't checking every corner for fishmen, star-spawn or cultists.If I was to think of anything truly negative I would say the repetitive enemies and the occasionally simplistic AI can take you out the game, especially when you find the block power or find yourself knifing a Elder Spawn to death by strafing around it. It can be very easy to MAKE the game easy if you know what you're doing and finding the high ground early on is a good way to make things easier (until the flying eyes come at you...).In all this game is a fantastic buy and very involving, especially from what I understand is a small two-man stuido. I hope they produce more content for Eldritch in the future. Absolutely recommended!			"

												Eldritch is one of those games I bought on impulse during a time when I was into roguelikes and permadeath type games. Based on the commercial it looks like a comical and whimsical take on the Lovecraftian mythos, but like most Lovecraftian games, this one evokes 8-bit horror with it's haunting soundtrack and SFX. The fact that it's primarily stealth based makes it even creepier, and even though you won't be creeped out by any of the monsters face to face, you'll often be surprised when you turn around and there's one staring right at you.      Overall, it's a good game to pick up for an hour or two, but it's definitely one of those games you have to be in the mood for.			"

Eldritch hits a lot of the right notes, with a solid stealth and movement system, along with plenty of secrets and features spread across randomly seeded levels. Best of all, the game has a series of deeper in-game systems, from shops to magic powers, varied enemy types and genuine tense survival horror gameplay. If you are at all interested in stealth, action, the works of Lovecraft, or horror, I would wholeheartedly recommend this for you.			"

												This is a solid game, but the content seems a bit lacking in quantity for what you pay. I'm having a lot of fun with it, but it does get frustrating at times. This game is like Minecraft (hold on, don't crucify me yet) in that there's little in the way of in-game instruction, and there's no shame in looking up a Wiki to fill in the gaps. Some of the enemies feel a bit cheap, especially the unkillable ones, especially the mummies, since there can be so many of them and they can block your path. Overall, if difficulty is not a problem for you, and you like the Lovecraftian, you could do much worse than Eldritch. I'm not sure if it warrants the 15 dollar asking price, but I bought it on sale and have no regrets.			"

												I'll keep this short and sweet:  This is a rouge-like shooter with Lovecraftian themes. If you enjoy either of those things then purchase this. Purchase it right now.It may look silly, graphically speaking, but this is NOT an easy game. It is harsh and unforgiving. And kind of terrifying when you get into it. So if you're looking for something casual then look elsewhere.Graphics:  10/10 - They fit it perfectly, so far as I'm concerned.Audio:  9/10 - There's the occasional audio glitch for me, but it's nothing too terrible.Gameplay:  9/10 - I am a coward who wishes there was more carry-over between deaths.Story:  8/10 - It's delivered in the old school survival horror way (i.e. you find journal entries of deceased explorers). There isn't too much there, but it isn't needed.Overall:  9/10.Purchase this game while it's still half-off!			"

												To think that I impulse-bought this in the last Steam sale... If I had only known I would enjoy it more than any of the big budget games I had been looking forward to I would have saved my money and bought a bunch of copies of Eldritch instead! If you're looking for a stealth-based, rogue-like with a heavy emphasis on 3D platforming and atmosphere, it doesn't get better than this. Most people look at a few screenshots, write it off as a Minecraft cash-in, and move on. The poor fools! They don't even know what they're missing!One thing is true: the graphics are nothing special. They capture the very minimum of their subject and the surroundings. There are some nice color palettes though, and the blocky nature light is cast makes it very obvious if you can be seen or not. And although the textures are unimpressive, the random level design is just as fun to look at as it is to traverse. Thankfully the audio is spectacular. Echoed moans, gurgles, gasps follow you wherever you go and always make you wonder what's just below your feet. The minimalist soundtrack is just as compelling. Obviously it's not a toe-tapping good time, but it certainly puts you on edge and makes you feel... Well, weird.'Weird' is really the name of the game here. This isn't meant to be made into a reaction compilation on your Let's Play channel. It focuses on the 'Weird Tales' aspect in favor of a more frightening experience. For those of you who have been waiting patiently for a Lovecraftian game to mean more than fishmen and tentacle monsters yelling ""Boo!"", this won't impress you. Also I'm really sorry and you must be REALLY used to disappointment by now.This kind of highlights the weakest part of Eldritch: Lovecraft's world is alien and incomprehensible, but rogue-likes are inherently games about monotony and understanding. To beat a rogue-like means minimizing risks, self-mastery, and knowledge, but Lovecraft is about inescapable, cosmic realities, where knowledge comes at a VERY high cost and these horrors can never be beat, only kept at bay.Eldritch's greatest strength, the genuinly alien nature of the random levels, the strange monsters that can't always be killed, and the crushing atmosphere instantly undo the game the moment you know how to avoid all the traps and deal with all the monsters. The first playthrough is magical: learning all of the powers, items, weapons, traps, monsters, seeing all of these non-sensical worlds realized... It's all so daunting in a very Lovecraftian way. But when you start farming world 1 for artifacts, or you start gearing up for the harder worlds, it's already too late.If you're someone who knows Lovecraft as that guy with the strange tenticle fetish, or you're someone who can put the Lovecraftian label aside and just take in the very dreary tone and solid rogue-like mechanics, then I'd pick this game up without hesitation. If you've been patiently waiting for the Mythos to finally be realized in a computer game, than you'll have to keep waiting.			"

The levels are themed and are gradually more challenging but, aside from the bonus level, it only has 4 stages.  The game is short, but it is also sweet.  Being first person adds a lot to the scary factor to the game.  While most times you'll only be worried about dying, the second stage has some very interesting features that make you nervous while you aren't watching your back.Try to get this game on sale.

They're attractive, in a crappy sorta way.3) The gameplay is fantastic. Sometimes it's easy, and sometimes it's hard, but it varies enough to keep things challenging and entertaining the entire time you play.4) It has a lot of elements that a lot of 3rd party developers could take a hint from. A simple and smart stealth system, a balanced currency/magic system, and a varied number of skills and weapons to allow several different approaches to the way you play.			"

												Eldritch is a neat little First Person Action game with procedurally generated levels and a heavily HP Lovecraft themed setting. The player must simply navigat from one end of each stage to the other, fighting off various tentacled, disgusting, gibbering flavors of ""Oh god, kill it, kill it, kill it!"". Along the way, you find weapons and equipment and meat to aid your trek. The game strikes a good balance of risk versus reward through the gameplay. You can't take many hits without dying and healing gets a bit sparse later on, so caution is a necessity at all times, but without a good amount of excess exploration, you'll quickly run out of supplies. Monsters also drop items and respawn indefinitely, but charging out to kill things is always a bit risky. It helps to set a nice atmosphere that, while you have a lot of power over the obstacles you'll face, it doesn't take many mistakes to see you fail. It's a game that greatly rewards patience and caution, while swiftly punishes recklessness. This balance is highly reminiscent of Spelunky in the best ways. While the difficulty starts out a bit insultingly easy, it quickly ramps up into a perfect sweet spot of hectic tension. The selection of items and spells, however, could use a little work. I never really found myself deviating from the set of items I was using and quickly equipping myself with them each new playthrough. For this type of game, always having access to one's preferred loadout, seems a bit off. As a suggestion, perhaps equipment should wear out over time, forcing the player to make do with what they can scrounge up, which seems more suited to this type of game. As for the spells, I think there just need to be more that can compete with the utility of Materialize. I mean, come on. The musis is good, and doesn't interfere with the profoundly important cocktails of squaks and hisses emanating from potential nearby threats. The graphics are, well, modest. It's not exactly going to push the limits of anyone's system , but you can tell right away what everything is supposed to be. Well, not the monsters, but that's  not really because of the graphics. One complaint I have to make is that the particle effects have an annoying linger about them, especially the one coming from the player's left hand at all times. I frequently found myself jumping, thinking I had seen something out of the corner of my eye, only to realize it was an errant particle from the trail I was leaving, which was a tad irritating. On the whole, there isn't really much content here, but what there is is very well made and fun to play. I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy Spelunky and other similar games.			"

												Geniales Game. Sieht zwar aus wie Minecraft, aber außer dem Grafikstil haben die beiden Spiele nichts gemeinsam.Man schleicht durch prozedural generierte Levels in denen alle mögliche Horror Figuren aus den Werken von H.P. Lovecraft lauern und muss sich Ebene um Ebene weiter nach unten kämpfen, mit zunehmend steigendem Schwierigkeitsgrad. Die Grafik ist zwar sehr minimal gehalten aber die Spannung wird hier (wie in vielen Horror-Games) hauptsächlich durch die Audioatmosphäre erzeugt, welche in Eldritch sehr gut gelungen ist.Um sich gegen die zahlreichen Gegner zur Wehr zu setzen gibt es verschiedene Waffen und Powerups, z.B Unsichtbarkeit, stärkere Angriffsstärke usw., die man im Level findet, hin und wieder in Shops kauft oder von getöteten Gegnern lootet, die dadurch aber wieder an einer anderen Stelle im Level spawnen, also sollte man sich öfters überlegen ob es das loot Wert ist, besonders mit niedrigen Leben.Fällt man allerdings doch einem der Gegner oder einer der Fallen zum Opfer, bedeutet das in guter Roguelike Manier Permadeath und man kann ein neu generiertes Level von vorne beginnen und sämtliche vor dem Tod gesammelten Gegenstände gehen dabei verloren.Eldritch ist kein hardcore schweres Spiel, was es für mehr Leute zugänglich macht, aber kann besonders in den fortgeschrittenen Levels doch anspruchsvoll werden. Das, ergänzt von dem sehr guten Sounddesign und prozedural generierte Levels, die theoretisch unendliches Wiederspielen ermöglichen, macht Eldritch zu einer klaren Kaufempfehlung.			"

												Ill make it clear. Never Read an H.P Lovecraft book.. but from what I've managed to study about this game and the books theyre based off of The game nails it pretty good, So for fans of Mr Lovecrafts work this game is a must have!Personally this game makes me think of the first Legend of Zelda but in 3d with the ability to grab ledges and climb and change your weapons to even a gun which ammo has to be gathered most of the time.Not a terribly hard game to beat considering if your good you can just get a compass and a pickaxe and finish all three books in under ten minutes as well as the final level after.. I have yet to make a dent in the New game Plus mode though so the replayability is actually unreal for just a small game no ones ever heard about.. I keep coming back due to these factors and all around its actually fun to try to stealth or slay your way through the levels.. though limited to like 6 levels ive found they are procedurally generated and you never get the same game twice.. Well done highly reccomended to anyone not just fans of Lovecraft books =)			"

												I love Eldritch but the funny thing about it is that I was at first disappointed (I initially thought there would be more backstory/adventuring involved, but I had little understanding of the type of game it was at the time, so that’s on me and in no way should it throw anyone off from enjoying it!).  It’s only after putting 12+ hours into it that I now realize how great it is as far as rogue-likes are concerned.  Sure, there’s perma-death but you’ll keep the cash-monies you had in your bank chest upon resurrecting/exiting then restarting.  Also, if you’re new to this game the Mountains of Madness, Asylum and Halloween/Pumpkin additions were added after its release, for free!  There’s a good bit of strategy involved if you wish to beat the 3 missions (MoM, Asylum and of course the library the game takes place in).  Pickaxes, dynamite and even a charm that gives the gun the ability to fire bullets that break the environment (all of which do it Minecraft-style) can be utilized to your advantage.  You can even pick up different kinds of packs,  like the med pack that can revive you upon death as long as you have 50 gem thingies (‘artifacts’ as the game puts it) to spend, and boots that can grant different abilities, like high jumping and speed. Be warned, though the enemies may look ‘cute-ish’, they can be, and often are, downright deadly!  And In keeping with the lore of Lovecraft and the retro/blocky graphics, the enemies look great in that classic, cheesy 50’s era way.   On a final note, though Eldritch is certainly humorous at times, it’s still a horror game at its core and it certainly does justice to the godfather of modern sci-fi/horror, the man and legend that started it all, H.P. Lovecraft --- R.I.P. good sir, you live on through us all!! "

												TL;DR - This game's definitely worth playing, but not necessarily beating, depending on how much time you can put into it. How-Rogue-like-you-like-it?For what it's worth, I'd say this is more of a horror game that uses elements like procedural generation, permadeath and the inability to save to enhance the experience rather than a true Rogue-like (or Rogue-lite) game. Elements such as the changes to the level layout and item locations each time you play it, as well as excellent sound design on the echoing cries of enemies and some nice touches in the art style (specifically how the subtle bulges on the walls warp the straight lines on them as the camera moves, making them seem to 'writhe') help build a sense of unease and dread as you creep around. As a Lovecraft fan I was delighted by recognizing the different creatures as enemies and appreciated the theming of the level around its elder being (the dry colours of Nyarlathotep, the 'wetness' of Dagon etc), though they're interesting enough that they wouldn't be lost on someone more casually aware of the mythos.This all makes the game worth playing (at least, I think so), but is it worth beating? I mentioned the permadeath, and that will be the big 'make or break' for many players. In order to beat this game you have to finish all three of the 'main' stages (more have been added in patches since release, but I don't believe they count) AND the final level, all on one life. You can save and quit to pick up on where you left off, and deposit money you find in certain places for later that carries over, but you start from the beginning with nothing upon death. For example the furthest I got was beating the Dagon stage and half of Nyarlathotep before I died, and upon respawning my having won Dagon was undone. For those unfamiliar with Rogue-likes this may be a table-flipping moment; for those who know the score, that's part of the thrill. This means however that in order to beat the game you'll have to keep playing over and over until the circumstances to achieve it are just right (or ""the stars are correctly alligned"", if you will) or to have played so much of the game that you've memorized all the enemy and boss behaviours and all the possible hazards AND don't get screwed by the RNG. This is further reinforced with the Steam Achievements the game offers - beat the game in under 10 minutes, beat it without taking any damage, collect 9,999 coins etc. One can hardly blame a developer for wanting players to play a lot of their game, but for some this may be more time than they can put in.For the Lovecraft fan who's less inclined towards this genre it's still worth giving a go if it's on sale for the ambience and tension of the first few attempts, but if you're seriously inclined towards Roguelikes, or are a Completionist, take a look at some of the other reviews on here to see what the game's long-term prospects are. I liked it, I'll keep playing it, but I doubt I'll beat the entire thing.			"

												Personally, I love this game. I do agree that originally, it was really short. I was SUPER excited when I found out that they included the mountains of madness... Which I haven't beaten, of course. What scares me about this most of all is the sounds. The constant sound of them and the feel that I don't really know what's going on is awful. There is nothing worst than the sound of a shoggoth somewhere in the level, and you've got no idea where or how many there are. Even worst is when its wife is the shop owne, and you decide to steal. *shudders*The game can be short, sweet, and to the point. This can mean that you've won by being one smart little sh**, or that you died. Repeatedly. It's definitely a roguelike in that when you die... You start all over. So don't die.I question myself whether it's worth its listed price. Right now, with the MOuntains of Madness, I think it is. I wouldn't mind more updates in the future, say, adding more notes and minor references to Lovecraft's works. This could be in secrets, too, and in maybe a couple new weaons. Doesn't have to be fancy; like, a special type of bladed weapon in the sandy level, and so on and so forth.That said, above all else, I do recommend this game- IF you like Lovecraft's works. Otherwise, you may not get it, and it may not be your taste. Lovecraft isn't nearly as dry as Poe was, but he can definitely be dry. This game corporates his type of fear- that you are vastly out-gunned, out-manned, and just out of your league.			"

												Let's start by getting this out of the way: yes, this looks like a Minecraft mod.  Is it?  Could be, I don't know.  But it doesn't play like one, and that's what's important to me.  Eldrich is a game about dying.  Explore 5 Lovecraftan levels full of horrifying creatures and less ammo than you need.  It does a pretty good job of balancing giving you the power to fight back, but still feeling terrified when you see certain enemies.My biggest criticism is that it's a bit Euclidian for  a Lovecraft game.  But it's a nice, simple survival game with some scary monsters, and technically a plot.  Multiple endings, even, if you can get that far.This isn't the greatest game ever, but if you can get it for a few bucks, or in a bundle, you can definitely have  a lot of fun with it.			"

												Don't let the graphics fool you- some of the monsters may look cute, but this game has a wonderful sense of eerie atmosphere that plays up suspense with each creak. The sound is expertly used in this game, where you can hear heavy breathing of a monster lurking nearby as you try to crouch just around the corner. Sends chills down my spine each time.For a rouge-like, this game is more about stealth and trying to get the most out of the few resources you can cobble together. It provides a fresh challenge while refraining from feeling too difficult to impede on your fun. While playing, the hours will melt away faster than the flesh off of your smiling face.A definite must-play for any lover of Lovecraft.			"

												A very cute and enjoyable little 3rd person roguelike with a minecraft-meets-lovecraft theme. you've got 3 major dungeons themed after a lovecraftian god (Dagon, Nyarlathotep, Cthulhu) with special enemy types in eachand then you've got a super extended dungeon based on The Mountains Of Madness with Elder Things and Shoggothsand finally, one uber asylum dungeon with everything and timed, in which Azathoth will eventually break loose to try and munch your tiddlybits. If you happen to be a lovecraft fan, a fan of roguelikes and enjoy that blocky minecraft aesthetic? Then this is a solid buy for you.			"

												It's a deceptively spooky, incredibly fun, and interestly unique experience. Mixing horror, Roguelike, FPS, and dungeon exploring in one game. It looks like the art style is a rip-off of minecraft, which is really the only fault I can find in it. But the gentle look of the art betrays the feelings you can get when you know a monster is nearby. overall, this is a fun game worth the humble price tag.			"

												TL;DR - This game's definitely worth playing, but not necessarily beating, depending on how much time you can put into it. How-Rogue-like-you-like-it?For what it's worth, I'd say this is more of a horror game that uses elements like procedural generation, permadeath and the inability to save to enhance the experience rather than a true Rogue-like (or Rogue-lite) game. Elements such as the changes to the level layout and item locations each time you play it, as well as excellent sound design on the echoing cries of enemies and some nice touches in the art style (specifically how the subtle bulges on the walls warp the straight lines on them as the camera moves, making them seem to 'writhe') help build a sense of unease and dread as you creep around. As a Lovecraft fan I was delighted by recognizing the different creatures as enemies and appreciated the theming of the level around its elder being (the dry colours of Nyarlathotep, the 'wetness' of Dagon etc), though they're interesting enough that they wouldn't be lost on someone more casually aware of the mythos.This all makes the game worth playing (at least, I think so), but is it worth beating? I mentioned the permadeath, and that will be the big 'make or break' for many players. In order to beat this game you have to finish all three of the 'main' stages (more have been added in patches since release, but I don't believe they count) AND the final level, all on one life. You can save and quit to pick up on where you left off, and deposit money you find in certain places for later that carries over, but you start from the beginning with nothing upon death. For example the furthest I got was beating the Dagon stage and half of Nyarlathotep before I died, and upon respawning my having won Dagon was undone. For those unfamiliar with Rogue-likes this may be a table-flipping moment; for those who know the score, that's part of the thrill. This means however that in order to beat the game you'll have to keep playing over and over until the circumstances to achieve it are just right (or ""the stars are correctly alligned"", if you will) or to have played so much of the game that you've memorized all the enemy and boss behaviours and all the possible hazards AND don't get screwed by the RNG. This is further reinforced with the Steam Achievements the game offers - beat the game in under 10 minutes, beat it without taking any damage, collect 9,999 coins etc. One can hardly blame a developer for wanting players to play a lot of their game, but for some this may be more time than they can put in.For the Lovecraft fan who's less inclined towards this genre it's still worth giving a go if it's on sale for the ambience and tension of the first few attempts, but if you're seriously inclined towards Roguelikes, or are a Completionist, take a look at some of the other reviews on here to see what the game's long-term prospects are. I liked it, I'll keep playing it, but I doubt I'll beat the entire thing.			"

I dont know how, but it has a great, extremely creepy atmosphere, and many horror themes that coencide to make it like a puzzle to get out of tough situations. The game could use some clarity, and it gives blocks of text as explaination, but the randomly generated style combined with the creepy enemies makes you hesitantly creep around every corner.			"

												This is potentially a great game; I had fun for a while, the set up and storyline are both simple and wonderful; but... there isn't a particularly huge amount of content here. You could realistically experience what the game has to offer within the first thirty minutes of playing. All enemies bar the stone statues are very simple, similar, and non-threatening; the item set is quite small, and the levels quite often look the same: This all adds up to a randomly generated game where it doesn't matter that it's randomly generated, because everything is so similar that there's no room for any kind of strategy or unique experiences. It's a missed opportunity.			"

												First, the positives: Eldritch is probably one of the best games that takes advantage of randomly generated maps, particularly 3D ones.  Even though the graphics were simple, the game seemed to ""intelligently"" position most things, except for wooden doors - some of those seemed very weirdly placed.  The game also does a great job at giving a creepy feel.  For anyone who likes roguelikes, this is a good game.  However, I find having to start from the beginning after making a few stupid mistakes to be annoying.  Thankfully, the game saves your progress to the hard drive, and I just copy+pasted my save so I could continue where I left off.  That being said, I completed the game probably a lot sooner than I should have, and what I did was technically cheating.Now for the negatives: Like I said, being unable to save is irritating, but not something I fault the developers for since it is intentional.  For a game that has well-written books in it, you don't have a strong idea of what you're doing and why you're doing it.  The game gives you very little incentive to explore.  Once you pick up a knife and a revolver, just keep finding health fountains and run straight for the exit.  I have found little to no use to any of the magical spells (though, I'd probably use the teleporter or cloak more often if I didn't ""cheat"" with saving).  The compass and silent boots are also far more useful than any other item you can pick up.  The items just aren't balanced at all.  I also don't like that once you beat the game, you can't continue where you left off at the library.There's also the obvious ""the graphics look bad"" complaint.  You get used to it pretty quickly, but I think what bothers me is there's no need for the style.  Aside from the blockiness, the game is actually very detailed in many ways.  The developers easily could have spent a little more time just polishing the appearance of the game - increase polygon count and just do a ""cartoony"" style instead of the stereotypical indie ""8-bit"" style.  I understand that using blocks for the floors and walls was needed in order to easily manage functional 3D randomness (and destructable walls), but they could have still kept the cubes and make everything else prettier.

												I'm going to give this game a thumbs up because I think it's interesting and original and I want to show some support for it. After putting several hours in to it, I have to say, it feels somehow incomplete. It's also fairly difficult. The combination of these two things make for diminishing returns. I read a review of this game that described it as a 3D roguelike based on cthulu mythos. It also resembles Minecraft visually but doesn't have the same level of depth or complexity. I like the art style and was thrilled to see lovecraft monsters in chunky 3D. Initially there were some moments where there was a lot of tension in trying to creep around and find items... after a while though, it feels like the possibilities are exhausted. What I like about rogulikes are the randomness and the variety. There are always surprises and you might die in horrible ways but there is also a sense of progression. You 'level up' or find something unusual or rare and it makes the difficulty a little more bearable... you want to jump in and try again. After clearing a couple of maps in eldritch it didn't feel like things were progressing in a way that was engaging for me. I like the idea that you're a lone person and you're scrambling for a few scarce rescources against cthulus minions in strange alien environments, I like the visual style and a lot of the gameplay... it just feels like there's something missing (maybe a few things), that would make me want to keep coming back to the game. I would really like to see some mod support.			"

												Wasn't really sure what to expect when I turned the game on for the first time; but this one was pretty interesting.  It definitely has some Minecraft vibes to it, but this game not at all as forgiving as that game - And if you go in thinking otherwise you'll quickly regret it.  The Cthulhu vibe is definitely here, and I only wish I had survived long enough to enjoy it a bit more.If I had a complaint, it would be the lack of music, but in all honestly the game is still very much worth a look!  Give it a try for yourself, or check out my video below!  OR BOTH!

												As a huge fan of H.P. Lovecraft and a moderate fan of videogames, I've been dissapointed to not be able to find any decent mythos-related games (aside from Quake, if you count that). ...until now.Eldritch is a wonderful game that combines the feel of Quake with the look of Minecraft and the Cthulhu mythos in a way that's much better than it sounds. It's got this great atmosphere, well-generated dungeons, cute graphics, and has everything a mythos fan like myself could ask for. My favorite part so far has been the echo of one of the bog men in another part of the cave. Despite the voicework making me grin (it's quite funny), it still gives you a feeling of dread, because you know that there's still an enemy somewhere out there...			"

												A tense-yet-gracious FPS Spelunky-like. Grace may seem hard to find at first. The Lovecraft-inspired world of Eldritch rarely relents in its palpable gloom, and the inherent nature of a roguelike reduces one to survivalist instincts. But by making the end attainable and by opening the game up to a diversity of approaches, Eldritch’s forgiving difficulty means that more than the hardcore elite can overcome the this roguelike’s inherent stress and difficulty, leaving the average player slightly more comfortable with dying to self in the name of progress.Read More: http://gamechurch.com/eldritch-a-gracious-descent/ "

												This game is one of the best rogue-like games that i have played in a long time, very well made and fun. Killing enemies in this game is so satisfying, in fact everything in this game is satisfying, the art style, the items, the weapons and even just sounds, if you like games like Spelunky or The Binding of Isaac then i would reccomend this game to you, i give it about an 8.5/10.

												I definately recommend this game...while it's on sale!Honestly I wouldn't have touched this game at it's original $15 dollar asking price. But while it's on sale, everyone should pick this game up.Eldritch really ain't half bad. A basic rogue-like but it is very fun to play. Though I learned quickly that the knife and gun are the best weapons and I basically ignore everything else unless I'm desperate or curious. Cloaking and Teleport is also good, but you're never guaranteed those powers.I only use the gun on enemies that can fire projectiles or are hard to kill with the knife (I learned the hard way that Shaggoth is unkillable). But anyway, there is just enough variety to let you experiment with your play style and how you want to go about traversing the levels. Sometimes I try to rocket past every enemy and just make it to the exit, other times I play around and kill every monster in an area. (The ones that can be killed at least) But just remember that when you loot a dead enemy, they respawn later on.The levels don't seem very hard to navigate though, at least as long as you have a compass. And so far it seems that as long as you head downwards, you are going the right way. The shops have good items, especially a pair of boots that silence your footsteps. It's pretty cool.  That's basically how I rate this game. Pretty cool.			"

												Eldritch is an FPS, stealth-horror, rogue-lite in which you delve into dungeons full of monsters and traps that you have to deal with using the tools and abilities the game gives you along the way. It features a strong atmosphere that keeps you on your toes; not knowing what might be waiting for you around the corner.This is how the game experience was for me, and I loved it. However, as time went on the game's horror-elements began to peel away as I better understood the mechanics and how easy it was to avoid the enemies in the first place. Find the right gear and know how to cheese the enemies' AI and the game loses that creepy edge it once had.Regardless; the game is still a lot of fun although it doesn't have the same replay-value as other rogue-likes of its kind. However I don't think it really needs to. It lasts just long enough and I don't think it would benefit from being as replayable as something like Spelunky or The Binding of Isaac.It's incredibly simple and incredibly effective, and that's what makes me want to recommend it.PROS:- Simple yet charming graphics.- Strongly atmospheric SFX and ambience.- Fun and interesting gameplay mechanics.- Great gameplay progression.- Lasts just long enough.CONS:- Very little replay value.- Loses its strong atmosphere as you learn the mechanics.SCORE: 9/10 "

												There are five six 'books' or stages, in this game. The first four (three + one) are for the normal game, the fifth is the 'Mountains of Madness' mentioned in the store page video, and the sixth is a place called the 'Asylum' [There is also a Halloween-themed bonus stage, wonder if you can find it. Great for farming artifacts]You have four things on the upper left: Hearts represents health, Blue oval-shapes represent 'artifacts,' or the in-game currency, Green Keys are for unlocking doors, and Yellow Bullets are ammo for your revolver (no reload system, simply M1 until you run out)There is a lot of holding 'shift' in this game (to run), especially for some of the achivements. Unfortunately, there is no toggle to run, unlike for crouching, but not really a big deal.It is not a terribly difficult game. Enemies' projectiles miss often, especially when you are running, and circle strafing enemies while punching/knifing them will dispatch them quickly. For first-time players I would suggest a more cautious approach; my first complete run took about 1 hour 30 minutes.After the inital novelty wears off, there is not much left except the same repeat of: evade/kill enemies, pick up items, move on to the next chapter. For that reason alone, I would not recommend at full price unless you enjoy this genre and/or the Lovecraftian theme. I am not familiar with the universe of H.P. Lovecraft, so I cannot comment on this game's accuracy to its source of inspirationThe redeeming factors that gives life and replayability to this game are the online leaderboards and steam achivements.

												At the time of writing this I have unlocked the third book.This game is...well...H.P. Lovecraft certainly rolls in his grave over it.The enemies are scary...at first. After playing about a minute on a floor you get so used to them you're willing to run around and stab everything without any kind of fear. The only real enemies I ran across that stayed a danger were 'unkillable'-The Shoggoth and the Statues. The Statues act like carbon-copy Weeping Angels (which is scary, sure, but they don't activate unless you walk in front of them) and the Shoggoth is...just...It's a giant slime thing that can't be killed. Trap it in a hole and boom, safe.TL;DR:Pros:  - Enemies start off scary and dangerous  - Minimal issues with gathering resources  - Stealth actually WORKS.Cons:  - Enemies quickly become repetitive and boring.  - Resources can be very scarce or be overabundant between floors.  - Stealth is really, REALLY pointless when enemies start gaining flight.  - Dagger too OP.

												The game doesn't have much to it, but it's easy to jump into and learn by exploring the interesting game world. Not a huge amount of content or depth, but not a huge amount out of your pocket either. Fun little game that's worth a play.			"

												Played this game for the time it says above and experianced a deep existential crises and ended up walking around the streets where I live to shake it off.For serious.Recommend not playing this game in a dimly lit basement, because eventually you will realize you are passing your time in a dark concreate box, staring into a black mirror at a character exploring deeper darking concreate boxes.

												Amazing and fun game!This game is a Minecraft-rouge-like thrill.The game runs you through three books, or worlds, each book more difficult than the last. The weapons are fun and the enemies are challenging. The power ups provide a fun twist and strategy to the game, as does the changing environment.This game is worth it's price. It's got wonderful replayability.			"

												Wasn't really sure what to expect when I turned the game on for the first time; but this one was pretty interesting.  It definitely has some Minecraft vibes to it, but this game not at all as forgiving as that game - And if you go in thinking otherwise you'll quickly regret it.  The Cthulhu vibe is definitely here, and I only wish I had survived long enough to enjoy it a bit more.If I had a complaint, it would be the lack of music, but in all honestly the game is still very much worth a look!  Give it a try for yourself, or check out my video below!  OR BOTH!

												Eldritch is charming, atmospheric and challenging. The rogue-like elements fit well with Loveraft's themes of the unknowable. The blocky representations and sounds of the monsters manage to instill uneasiness at best and panic at worst. There's not a huge variety of weapons, but using certain powerups/gear can offer lots of different strategies for reaching the end of each dungeon. The lack of carry-capacity (only 2 items and one piece of gear per slot) can be frustrating but it allows for experimentation. Once you've memorized the strategies and enemy types, you can fairly easily master the game, and it now comes with a number of expansions that can provide very good entertainment for the price. Highly recommend, especially for Lovecraft fans.			"

												This game is quite good, particluarly for the price.  Its a solid rouge-like faithful to the classic mechanics such as permadeath.  The biggest complain is that the balancing isnt the best.   StarSpawn are too weak, Lizzard Statues are too stong, and the first chapter is far too easy.  As a resault, the first area is boringly easy, but the second is a massive, intense difficulty spike.  Dispite this flaw, the game is great, and later on can get very tense and exciting.10/10 would get killed by lizard statue on final floor with all relecs again.Seriously though.  I hope all lizard statues die in a fire.			"

												There is just a whole bunch of little things that keep popping up that keep the game challenging. I've already put 3 hours into it and barely have unlocked the next level. Icicles keep ruining me, traps ruin me, imortal ghost dudes ruin me... but I found out that you can climb atop the stone statues, which was very handy in looting a room. It's difficult enough to be fun, and to make me rq sometimes. Great game on or off sale, but I mean, on sale is obvi better :>			"

												A fun first person rogue-lite stealth game.  The sound effects are actually really scary and that big tall thing that won't die freaks me out even though this game has N64 graphics.  This game gives you a chest to hold artifacts between stages so it's not a 100% loss of progress when you die.  This game's dope, get it.			"

												Extremely fun game, a rouge-like with simple, yet compelling gameplay. Runs fairly well on low-end machines too. The only real problem is that there will be an occassional dungeon which is impossible to complete without some ability to destroy blocks, which is not always possible, but this happens extremely rarely.Another problem is that the achievement statistics do not show up at all, although this is more of valve being dumb than the developer's fault.Otherwise, this game's controls are extremely smooth and responsive, making movement extremely fluid. The graphics are on the low end, but that only adds to the aesthetic in my opinion. I also love the lovecraftian theme, so I may be heavily biased towards this game, but I don't really care because I really enjoyed it. It's well worth the money.			"

												Eldritch is a lovely title. Seriously. If you melted your computer while running it, it would probably result in a pool of liquid gold... (actually, don't try that.) I love this game. I've played many roguelikes before, so this game was a bit simple to start with, but after your first playthrough, a feature titled New Game+ allows you to amp up the dificulty to where it should be (at least for a roguelike). The game is essentially Dishonored developed by Mojang, allowing you to slide, mantle, and sprint from a first person prospective, rendered in a cute, voxel-based engine. Buy this game if you like Dishonored. Buy this game if you like roguelikes. Screw it, just buy this game becuase it's quality.			"

												Eldritch is a great game that you're a woman that need to take three orbs in three different scenarios. You start in a library (that is the main map) and from here you will entering in the other areas. Eldritch is a roguelike 3d game, and it's much interesting because for me, I never saw a game roguelike in 3d that you have a objective.			"
