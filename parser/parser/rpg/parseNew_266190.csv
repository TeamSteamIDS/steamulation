Early Access Review
								As of May 22nd 2016, I would recommend on sale or bundle. Unless you are a true sandbox & survival fan that finds joy in all. As the store page says, it is alpha and if I had the chance to experience it before i owned it, I would probably wait at least 6 months. The developers are very active and always listening and pushing small updates with fixes and improvements. I think another 6 months would be a huge difference.At first...When I first saw this game, it reminded me very much of Landmark and when I created my first character and saw the Drow, I immediately went back to memories of EverQuest. After selecting my race I was sad there was not any other options, but I read that character customization is planned. Creating worldsNext was creating a world name and seed. No idea what to put in Seed but couldn't leave it blank. So went to the Steam Discussion and searched for 'seed' and used one of the suggestions. I wish there was some kind of info to tell you what you could use as a seed or maybe suggest seeds with biome descriptions like the thread had. But you can apparently enter any random number or words to generate a world. I created 3 with a random word, and 2 with a random 3 digit number, and then 1 with a ? and all worked except the last. That one got stuck at 90% and after 10 minutes I exited. Tried entering it and it did the same thing. ExperiencesIn two of the worlds I ran in one direction until my Hunger bar was empty and health drained causing  my death. In both of them I saw only 2 biomes; Desert to Jungle in one and Snow to Jungle in the other. In both cases eventually ran into such a high mountain that I got tired of trying to jump up the slope since there would be a delay while stuck in a crouching position sometimes. I built a few bridges to span over large canyons. I did not have the patience to get the controls right and allow spanning a single row of blocks that expended across multiple columns. Basically couldn't build one layer of blocks from one side to the other. Instead I was building entire cubes that filled the whole gap from the top where I was, to the bottom of the canyon. I also spent some time digging up a plant only to realize I dug myself into a hole when I shifted the camera angle cause I couldn't move. And then spent much time playing with the terraforming feature. I absolutely love the idea that I can quickly flatten space before building, as in other building games I have spent hours to do this one block at a time. I only wish it could be controlled smoother to create flat ground. I did also try to fall out the bottom of the world, but I can tell you there is a bedrock layer to prevent that. :rose:Positives for me:  Active developers who want to hear your input and seem to always be working behind the scene pushing many small updates from your feedback in a very quick fashion. Gorgeous world & many building blocks right at the start pleases me. Honestly I get bored of looking at endless bland trees seen in other survival games and trying to make something appealing. Not in Astral Terra! The landscape has a vibrant colorful feel with absolutely wonderful textures. And right at the start you have access to at least 38 different block textures with 13 shapes to choose from. Stone walls, textured glass, woods, metals, cement maybe with shiny metal like details. I can't wait to see how this improves by full release!  Terraforming is awesome! I know I basically mentioned it earlier in my experience, but I really can't stress the happiness in having an option to flatten an area to build on so quickly. Abilities in a survival game, WHAT! You can heal yourself! So even when hungry as your health ticks you can heal until you find/make food. Also to me its pretty fantastic you can summon a crafting station wherever you are. Mouseover tool tips show resources in the distance and scale in size to reflect how far away they are. +1 for no fall damage! Seems reasonable that will probably get changed later though.  Things I wasn’t fond of:Also for the developers to consider since they do use player input and improve features.  Currently no way to hide the UI for screenshots and that makes me sad. Loot system really pained me. I am not a fan of spending time to chop down a tree or demolish a rock only to have to manually pick up each of the bits that came from it. I also found my expectation was that if I clicked a log or piece of rock I wanted to automatically walk towards and loot it. Versus standing there being told its out of range. ESC key isn't utilized. I suppose it is more expectation from other games. When I press ESC I think its going to exit whatever current window I am in, and if none are open I expect the main menu that will take me back to a character or world select screen. None of those things happen right now. You have to click the Gear icon in the bottom right toolbar. Controls are frustrating to me when exploring. The A and D keys which I tap to move left/right instead cause me to turn and spin in a circle which is frustrating. But on the flip side,when terraforming being able to rotate to the left/right and keep the ground i was removing sort of straight/flat was helpful. Using mouse I can't get that kind of stability. Maybe an option to have the controls act different depending if in standard / Terraform / Build mode would help? Also the delay when I jump up a slope and sort of get stuck in a crouching position seemed to cause my patience to shoot out of the roof. I actually found I was yelling at my screen a couple times between looping in circles instead of running forward and getting stuck in a sloped mountain or while trying to terraform a path through a mountain. Mini-map is currently black space (as is the Map) but I suspect its just a placeholder that will be fixed at a later stage of alpha or beta. On a side note, if its not been suggested i would love the option to re-size and even move the mini-map. Big fan of having control over my UI elements to move as I need. Option slider for sound effect would be fantastic. There is one for Music versus Main volume so I suspect that will also get added later. When I first encountered water I thought I broke my eardrums. I moved the main slider to half way and then couldn't hear anything so I moved it back a fourth of the way or so to compromise for over all sound vs effects. Think the main volume might need some tweaking cause of this. Many have expressed high system requirements being needed and having to play the game on its lowest settings, not being able to play, or not being able to load the game at all. It was smooth for me on Ultra with a 66-90 FPS on average. A few times I noticed it was even at 100. I will include my hardware to help others compare and decide. Just FYI even in Medium (the lowest setting) the world still looks wonderful.  Date: May 22, 2016Rating: 8/10 at this stage of early access. I can see the promise and personally love the fantasy idea.

Review Written on Tuesday, May 17th, 2016 Review At the moment of writing this, Astral Terra is in Early Access and considered to be an Alpha build. I have taken this fact into account in my review. In its current state, Astral Terra is an exercise in frustration. First of all, the design choices for the game controls are very hard to get used to. Character movement have been relegated entirely to the keyboard while the mouse cursor is free floating at all time. You can however look around by pressing the right mouse button. The gathering of resources is tedious as it requires you to place the mouse cursor in the right spot (often needing you to move around) on the resource you're trying to gather, then picking up the elements you've extracted from the ground, also requiring awkward mouse cursor placements. The game is still in alpha stage so its expected to have loads of bugs, however when you can't even walk for a couple of minutes without falling through the ground and into oblivion, it's really difficult to get anything else done. I feel that, minimally, this should have been addressed before allowing the public to access the game.Even in its current buggy state, the game shows tons of potential. The graphics are gorgeous and the world is entirely editable with the terraforming / terrain editing tools. Building anything is awkward at the moment as placement of building blocks in the 3D wold is a bit sketchy, but one thing I really liked is the ability to do it in free mode, not requiring your character to climb and access the places where you want to build. The crafting system is simple enough and already has a good number of items. There's also all of the RPG elements which add an extra layer to the game, although I haven't been able to experience much in that area yet.In it's current state, I can only recommend purchasing this game if you want to help the developer out and are interested in being a part of hunting down bugs and shaping the game as it progresses. The developer is involved with the community so I'm confident that people who like those kind of sandbox/survival games will find an enjoyable product when it is closer to release. Unfortunately it's not quite there yet.Rating: 5.0/10 Pros:  Gorgeous graphics and visual effects Completely editable voxel world. Free movement when terraforming and building. No need to create scaffold for your character to be able to reach building spots. Decent number of craftable items for a game this early in development. Active developer who's in touch with the community.  Cons:  Questionable control design choices. Tedious harvesting of resources. Building structures in the 3D space is a bit unintuitive. Barren land with very little to do. Too many major bugs, especially in regard of regularly falling through the ground.  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC "

Early Access Review
								Game is lots of fun and is still in early access.  What makes this game fun for me? A few features::1) I really love the environments you can explore. You can start with creating a female character(or a male if you choose), which is a plus for me.  I like the 3 choices there are so far as most games have basic male models and having a custom character (+ being a female) makes me want to spend time and invest in my character. I found many different types of environments that are just beautiful and my fps is extremely smooth.  There are lots of fun environmental tasks to do if you wish(harvesting resources, killing createres, etc) & great unique places to build.2)I love the building and terraforming options.  I prefer to spend my time building my own housing and there are tons of choices in shapes and materials all acessible without lame grinding. I can do what i want when i want and I like it ;pLooking forward to seeing this game get some additional content and seeing it progress <3 <3			"

								Ther game is fun. The building system is different and interesting.  I have a good gaming system, but the framerate will never go higher than 8-10 pfs. this makes the gameplay choppy and irritating, even with the settings at the lowest they can be.  with 3.1 ghz quad core processor, 12 gigs of ram, and a new nvidia, i should not have a problem on the lowest setting.  Some work on the speed and this will be a really fun game. :-)			"

Early Access Review
Astral Terra is a procedurally generated sandbox RPG game. “Morrowind meets Minecraft” (as mentioned on the store page) describes this game perfectly well. You will find everything that you would expect from a sandbox game: crafting, building, gathering resources. RPG part offers character progression: you will earn XP, level up, learn new spells, etc. The main distinctive feature of Astral Terra is “terraforming”. You can change the shape and textures of the environment or build anything from giant cave systems or floating islands. Pros:   Nice graphics and visual effects (a step away from blocky Minecraft clones).  Beautiful unique environments (from snowy mountains to tropical islands).  Terraforming (change the shape and look of the environment to your liking).  Classic RPG elements: different races, character progression, leveling system. Farming (you gather seeds, plant them and eventually harvest crops). Active developer. Regular updates.  It ran perfectly fine on my pc (80-90 FPS on average on ultra). Cons:   Lack of tutorial. It may take a while to figure things out on your own. Thankfully you can find some helpful YouTube videos.   Since it’s an alpha build, early access game: not a lot of content and some bugs are to be expected. Rather annoying music and lack of sound effects. After playing Astral Terra for about 10 hours, I can recommend it based on the current state of development, amount of content and promises of what is yet to come. Just keep in mind that as of right now the game is far away from being completed.

Review Written on Sunday, May 15th, 2016 Review This game is currently Alpha but it feels almost like a pre-alpha. The terraforming is an awesome concept and I have played with it a lot. Also the crafting system works pretty well so far. The graphics engine and artwork is decent and well done in my opinion, so I hope they build on that and do some more work on the different character models and animation. I tried the multiplayer and it didnt work very well for some reason, I imagine the developer is still working out the kinks for it.There are a lot of bugs and issues I have seen so far when trying to do things within the game. I noticed sometimes my controls get stuck and I have to restart the game to get it to work again. Overall for a sandbox game, it seems to be more of a concept with not much content other than the terraforming and crafting. Still needs a lot of work in my opinion and I would be happy to revisit this review later after the game gets more updates.Rating: 6.1/10 Pros:  The graphics and the world environment are well done. The terraforming is a neat mechanic. I like that it has some fantasy RPG elements. It is constantly being updated and the developers seem to care about feedback. The game doesnt have any issues running on my PC with a Geforce GTX 770.  Cons:  It's an Alpha, so it has lots of bugs. Sometimes my controls get stuck for some reason, not sure if its a bug or if I am doing something wrong.The user interface and controls are not really well implemented currently. Its hard to get started, since there isn't much explanation of how things work exactly. Not much content yet, but this is an Alpha.  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC  "

Should You Buy This Game?Astral Terra is a survival crafting sandbox game that sets itself apart from others with its unique Terraforming mechanic. This great feature allows you to alter procedurally generated environments on a macro scale, allowing the generation of truly epic creations. Due to the game's current alpha state, I can only recommend this game (at this point in time) to fans of the crafting genre, especially those that want to take part in the developing process with continued feedback. For everyone else, I'd advise following this game until it reaches a point in development that you are comfortable with a purchase. In the following review, I will only be commenting on its first impressions and the current state of the game.First Impressions----05/12/2016----When you first make a character (choose your race), you will then create a new world for you to explore. With a few varied and expansive environments around you, Terraforming and building is immediately available. The initial start is rather slow due to an absence of any tutorial or questline, but once you learn the controls and the desire to Terraform mountains materializes, the game becomes rather fun. On a more critical note, the quality of the textures and optimization leaves a bit of desire for improvement. There are lots of pop-in textures and animals, and running around/building is not as fluid as I hoped it would be. Bugs are pretty abundant in the current release state, but I only found a couple that warranted a game restart (permanantly locked cursor while Terraforming & infinite harvest animation from fast-clicking).Current State of the GameAs of this review, the developers have fixed multitudes of minor bugs and a few major bugs reported by users through Steam reviews and from their website/forums. A large patch was just released last week, and since then, another minor patch was also implemented. The developers have not only shown continued interest in improving this game and utilizing community feedback, they have also been transparent with their future plans and current content. The biggest takeaway points are listed below:Pros:TerraformingDiverse environmentsRPG elementsActive developer teamCons:Alpha stateDirectx 11 GPU requirementNo progressive content atmEarly AccessFor those that are not aware of the Early Access concept, it is perfectly acceptable for bugs to be present and game mechanics to be missing (especially at the alpha stage of development). Be wary that users have reported difficulty in playing Astral Terra. It is possible that they do not meet hardware or GPU requirements, but in case it may help anyone, the hardware specifications used for this review is posted below. With that in mind, I can at least say that I have enjoyed what I've played so far, and hope to see more people get a jump on Astral Terra.Hardware InformationHardwareTypeMonitor720p 32 LED TVControllerDS3 (M&K used for this review)MotherboardASRock Z97M AnniversaryCPUi5-4590GPURadeon R9 290XRAM8 GBOSWindows 7DisclaimerA copy of this game was provided by the developer: Tethys Interactive LLC; however, this did not bias my review in any form.

Early Access Review
								This is very very, very early access...I only see myself playing this game in 2-3 years from now,if it's still alive by then, but I fear I just lost 12 bucks on this one.edit 3 march 2017 :Read the patch notes and thought hmmm maybe I should give it another try.Then I read the latest reviews and immediatly thought : maybe not...edit2 may 6 2016:couldn't be bothered to test further then couple mins after the big update...edit:I refrained from personal opinions like ""cash grab"" of a dying visually impressive voxel engine with twitchy controls and no gameplay, but after reinstalling the game one month later, nothing changed, 1 year from release according to their own disclaimer, the devs went on vacation because well we don't shoot software like we shoot horses, we milk it till the cow is empty. This edit is just a personal opinion, but if you are wondering if this project is worth some of your money... I'm sure it isn't by now./end edit and rantOnly buy if you really want to support the devs,to me the game is not playable, controls are very unintuitive at the moment(mostly the terraforming). Equipping a shovel you can only dig down, so making a cave requires terraforming.Sometimes I can't place a farm, not sure what the conditions are.Sometimes my char gets stuck in chopping corn animation, requiring quitting the game.The physics are very unrealistic. Trees fall down when you harvest them a couple times,would prefer a savage lands approach where you chop them, they fall,and then you chop them up. Same for animals, they die, corpse dissolves into resources.Would be nice if the corpse would remain a bit, and you could choose to skin / gut it.In my opinion, I don't know how big their team is,but I fear 1 year from now this game will only be early access,not a finished product, but (hopefully) I might be wrong.Still I don't recommend it at this stage,I'd wait at least for a full procedural world generation.My bad, after restarting my map terrain generation seems to have picked up a bit,it's still unresponsive at times though, letting you reach the end of the world.So I'll change my comment to : wait for better optimization,or a faster pc 2-3 years from now.

								This Game is What I call a Fantasy Setting, Sandbox, World Builder.You Build, Craft, Garther, Eat, Heal, Fight, Level up, New Spells, New Build items.Think about it.. you are playing both a creation god and an advanture in the world you created... Pros:1. Great graphics and visual .. infact it's the best of all the other Mine**** Clone that i have ever tried.That include Nice pergenerated World with all kinda of enviroments. 2. Terraforming ability is powerful.....Create water that you can swim and do other things with...3. RPG elements like Sex type, races, character spells with a leveling system.4. Survial elements that you hungary or lose hp that you need to gather seeds, plant them and eventually harvest crops to survive.My computer is a bit below the spec but it runs quite smooth low FPS with no sudden drop of FPS.Cons:1. Why there is not a training or tutor that shows you what to do? Utube helps but i am not a big sandbox fan that i need to learn what to do.2. Very Earlly stage of the game and there are many bugs/issue to be sorted out.(get close to tree to havest tree... God damn it.. i am right on the tree and why it's telling me it's too far?)3. Terrible Music and not much sound at all.I am not a big fan of this type of games and i get quite annoyed after trying 2 hours but for an Alpha Build earlly access.. it shown great future to be one of the open world sandbox builder game that we will ever play.. please continue the great workDisclaimer:A copy of the game was provided for reviewing purposes. However, this did not influence my review in any way. Source of consideration: Tethys Interactive7/10 would be my final rating.			"

Review Written on Thursday, May 12th, 2016 Review What do we know about sandbox games, they should all have a few key aspects that make them fun to play, and engaging, and I will admit even a few have become painfully tedious.  Early Access games are an interesting way to explore new sandbox games as developers continue to find new and exciting ways to take the tedium out of sandboxes.  This review is by no means an absolute true review, when people review games they give both positive and negative view points on games.  In this overview of Astral Terra we are going to dive into what makes this game different.When I first sat down and looked at Astral Terra it screamed survival sandbox, your always looking for that challenge in a game that breathes new life and new challenges into the genre.  In this case multiple character classes, an extremely intriguing terraforming which I believe its a huge defining piece of the game as it feels unlike any other.As with any game on the marketplace, deep understanding of the games mechanics as well as developers reactions to issues should always be taken into consideration.  And remember early access is expectant to have bugs so nothing in this overview will point at those bugs.Pros:  Expansive worlds all free to terraform your self silly, digging, building, even generating wanna make a land bridge do itSeveral character races to choose from each with their own starting magic skill, both come in male and femaleAdvanced terraforming proceedures can change and mutate the world in ways you see fitDevelopers listen to the feedback of the community Cons:  you need a half way decent rig to run this, on my GTX 750 TI im having to run this on lowNot really a con, but I do believe that the current release of this game puts it towards a pre-alpha launch, not your standard ""early access"" gameThe controls do take a little bit of getting used to, hopefully future updates bring adjustable key bindings  Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor xerox analog 16 inch DVI-D   Headphones Afterglow prismatic 51 wireless   Keyboard Patriot Viper   Controller Controller   Mouse Patriot Viper   Microphone Afterglow prismatic 5.1 wireless   Motherboard ASUS 970 pro gamingaura   CPU AMD 8320 3.5ghz 8core   GPU asus GTX750 Titan overclocked   RAM 3X4gb patriot 1600   OS windows 8.1   HDD 2 WDD 2TB HDD Hitatchi 1TB  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC "

Review Written on Tuesday, May 10th, 2016 Review Here we have astral terra, an early access game that is far from finished. The bad news is that there are bugs waiting around many a corner in its current state. The good news is that there is the foundation of an enjoyable game here. Things will only get better as the game is updated, but it is only fair to consider this when deciding whether to jump into the game today, as opposed to waiting for a few more updates.To start with, the worlds look very nice. when you begin a game, you choose a 'seed' by entering a number. each number will take you to a different world. They have everything covered from desert to snowy mountains. I haven't felt the need to adventure too far in an individual world, but they feel large in scale. My favorite part from this game is the terraforming. I can build myself woodland beach right in the middle of the snowy mountains if I want to do so(and I do). The ability to shape the world around you is limited only by your imagination. Do you want to be a moleman and live underground? Here is your chance! I feel like a superhero running around reshaping the environment to my liking. This is a new experience for me in a game, and I look forward to the opportunity to reshape a world on an epic scale. Sometimes I even have a hard time concentrating on other tasks, since I have so much fun with terraforming that I can't resist the urge to use it.Regarding the current state of the game: The crafting system is easy to learn and functional right now. Crafting is never my favorite thing to do in a game, but this time around is it a painless experience. I managed to get through the process of making myself a small farm without getting frustrated while hunting for items, which is a refreshing change from some other games I have played. The devs have done a good job here. I didn't have many issues in the way of building. I am not one to go and build myself some kind of beautiful dwelling that will impress everyone who sees it. I prefer to just build up some oddities and laugh at them. This building system works very well for me. It allows me to build on a large scale with ease. With just a few clicks, I can put together a structure that is large enough to dominate the landscape. I can't speak for how well it works with more intricate buildings, but I am pleased with the system.I had no luck at all with multiplayer working, so I can't recommend this game at the moment if that is what you are looking for. I wish that it was easier to get going on multiplayer, because I suspect it would be good fun. It does give me something to look forward to in the future, once it gets all sorted out. In the meantime, feel free to try to join WOODLAND""S HAPPYTIME PARTYZONE at seed 420, and lets see if we can get it working and have some good times.Overall, I feel like the good outweighs the bad at the moment, and it is only going to get better from here. It is still in a state where it is simply a sandbox, but it is an entertaing one. There should be plenty more to be added, so keep in mind that the potential is here for them to turn this into quite an epic game. I am certainly looking forward to it. Rating: 6.5/10 Pros:  active dev team nice enviroments terraforming  Cons:  still early in development bugs ahoy  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC  "

Early Access Review
								I really bad want to like this game, but everything is so ""fussy"" right now.  My first game was with the ""too far away"" bug and spent 20 minutes trying to figure that out.I'm finding it hard to hit rock or a tree and then have to hunt around for the dropped objects. It would be better if the objects simply went in your pack.  You need a lot of mats, but can't get many from each resource.  And stuff only seems to stack to 60.The same music over and over is slightly irritating. I think the music should have different flavors depending on what you're doing; fighting music vs. exploring music and there should be more of it.Moving is just funny.  The animations are very stiff.  Apparently only the WASD keys move you.  The mouse turns you so I wind up doing 3 stooges type circles before moving forward - every time I want to move forward.I killed 3 large angry people, 2 dogs, and 1 deer.  Lost all the loot on one of the angry people because he died on a steep slope.  One of the dog things exploded and I never found that loot. Fighting just needs it's own chapter of overhauls.  You CAN kill things with your one spell and I saw a little stone sword in the crafting but didn't bother making one.  The spell works.  Hit whatever it is while you're backing up and spamming the spell.I like the sound the water makes, but I can't see the water.  I really love the map too, even the glitchy stuff makes things more interesting.  I'm stuck on the blacksmithy because I can't find coal. Yet.  When we're digging, wouldn't we find coal?Digging is odd. Rather than taking out a chunk from the surface you're clicking on, it digs directly down beneath you.I got to the ""edge"" of the map and the new area won't appear. I'm hoping that coming out and  going back in will make it draw in the missing parts.I think this game has a lot of potential and I like it overal. It just needs a whole lot of tweaking.  Would I buy the game knowing what I know now?  I would, but if you're a person who needs everything to work right off the bat, you might want to check back in 6 months.			"

Review Written on Thursday, May 19th, 2016 Review The main thing that separate this game from the others of the same genre is that with the Terraforming feature each player will have a unique experience every time they play. For those who like building & crafting this game is a must. You can literally build anything you want. There's already so many things to choose from when building & crafting. At the moment the game is still in Alpha build so there are some bugs, but I still manage to build some pretty amazing things. What is also great about this game is the RPG elements. You choose your character at the start, he then evolve all through the game. I can't wait to see more quest. To me that alone will adds so much gameplay and make it a game I keep coming back too. On the down side, the game is mostly played using the keyboard. I would've like to have the option to use keyboard and mouse or even better a controller. Also there's no different ennemies, for a survival game, at the moment there's not much to survive too. Finally the sound effects are really lacking, it makes the experience less intense. Of course being an Alpha you can expect to come across several bugs, but the devs are pretty involved in fixing them, so I have high hope that it will play much smoother in the near future. In conclusion, I really think that this game has the potential to become a great game once the bugs are fix. The devs are really active which always bode well for the future of the game. They are actively working at fixing the bugs and improving on the existing features. I really like the concept already and I cant wait to see it develop further. I really think that there's a great future for this game. Rating: 6.5/10 Pros:  The in-depth terraforming mode lets you have a unique experience every time you create a new world. The RPG element, quest adds to the gameplay. Great graphics and beautiful big world to play in. With the terraforming and the characters ability to evolve, each playthrough is truly unique. Even though theres no tutorial per se, theres a help feature which lets you know which key do what.  Cons:  The music is rather bland and it lack some sound effect. The keyboard control makes it rather hard to play, would've like to be able to use the mouse to move. Several bugs and issues to be fix. Theres no tutorial, so you feel kind of lost at the start.

								Neat fantasy setting and the world editing tools are really cool. Exploring the 4 biomes of the endless procedural worlds is a nice time sink as well. Looking forward to being able to create a town once more content is in place. It has bugs but meh, what Alpha game doesn't.			"

								Astral Terra has an interesting blend of an open world fantasy RPG and traditional survival game elements. It might be a bit rough around the edges at the moment, but the core gameplay is there. Terraforming the environment is especially a great mechanic. Considering the game is still in Early Access, I think I've gotten my money's worth. The devs are pretty active with the community, which is always great to see. I expect we'll get a handful of updates before the end of the year :)			"

								I thoroughly enjoyed this the game. In particular sandbox is a lot of fun, and it even has a single player with NPC + you can create the world you want (or at least totally modify it after it generated). You can easily switch between singleplayer and multiplayer, that's very important. It has some bugs now, but for alpha it's ok.			"

								Unique game for the genre.  I like that there are different races and sexes to choose from when creating a character.  Lots of choices on what to do in game depending on your play style and objective. I like building the most.  Again, lots of choices of materials & shapes, Lots of ways to customize your home or create a town/city of custom built houses. Would like to see more furniture and decorating options in the future but a great start! Having fun so far!			"

								Astral Terra is a sandbox, survival game with crafting. Yes I know there are tons of these on Steam but the main attraction to  this game is the terraforming, persistent character between worlds and that it is voxel based. This gives the gameplay a more dynamic feel to it. The game is currently in alpha encountering a few glitches is expected but this has lots of potential upon its full release and beyond. The music is peaceful and relaxing and the worlds that are generated can be quite varied at times. The interface at first was daunting but after some time became second nature and it's then I realized just how many options are available to you. Heck, you can even build your home on a floating landmass so that in itself is pretty cool. The game definitely has tons of potential but to learn all that it has to offer will definitely take more time.I received this game in exchange for my honest review.			"

								 Astral Terra puts you right into the world equipped with the clothes on your back and some basic crafting tools. Trek through the dense forests, barren deserts, and expansive world that allows you to tear apart and rebuild it however you desire with it's voxel based Terraforming. I had this game prior to it's most recent update last week, and the difference between the two is drastic in terms of gameplay clarity and playability. You are now able to hot swap equipment on your quickbar, allowing you to mine, dig, and chop trees without keeping your inventory open. Getting attacked? Use your spells and sword without having to dig through your backpack wasting crucial moments, then go back to looting that shattered rock full of Chromium. While this game is still in Early Access, the changes I've seen and the work put in by the devs is promising. It's visual style is eye catching, with a hint towards the fantasy realism you'd expect from a Bethesda Elder Scrolls game. With time I see this game becoming more and more compelling and I look forward to seeing it fleshed out and improved.			"

								From Kickstarter to Greenlight and now to Steam. I have been supporting them for almost 2 years now and it's great to see them get to this stage. The hard work they have put in is amazing with the small team working to create this game.With just over 30 hours of playing this game Astral Terra is a beautiful  game with  worlds for you to explore, hunt, gather, build and shape the world to your imagination.You are able to Terraform create and shape the world as you see it With a great variety of materials like , Grass, stone , ice , wood, water and so much more.Build your house where you want or carve it out of the ground or the side of a mountain.The game is currently in Alpha state with some bugs what game doesn't have them when they are still being developed.Still a young game in it's Alpha stage being worked on tirelessy and with improvements and new features added frequently. Astral Terra is constantly getting better.It's a very fun game with a alot of potential. A great game, have enjoyed it since i started playing.			"

								Review Written on Monday, May 9th, 2016Review Astral Terra is a sandbox RPG, with a procedural generated world currently in Alpha. Its sorta what you'd expect from these types of games, where you build. survive, craft and fight. You have skill you can use in combat, and gain exp however I haven't seen much other then chickens to attack. To be honest the game is rough, which is to be expected from an alpha. The game has potential tho, once all the bugs and other issues get resolved. The dev's however do work on the game quite frequently, so lets hope they keep it up and make this game better. If you like early access games by all means buy it, if you don't I'd wait.Rating: 7/10Pros: Good GraphicsTerraformingRPG aspect and levelingEach race has different skillsNot trying to be a minecraft cloneMultiplayerCons:Animations are buggy, you cut a tree and it spins around and vanishes.Lack of sound effects or musicNo tutorial, to explain what to do.Lack of hostile mobsBugs, hopefully that get fixed "

								This game has allot of potential to be a unique blend of survival and RPG. The world has more fantasy elements then most survival games; for instance floating islands. There is magic as well as crafting. Much of the crafting aspects allow for players to build decorative items. Right now the player has the ability to terraform the world at their will but I’m not sure if this is just for early release or will be a separate creative mode later. With all these tools you can really make some unique areas to show off to your friends in multiplayer.			"

Review Astral Terra is a sandbox survival/crafting game. You start off by creating your character, in which you can choose between three races and whether it be a male or female and of course a name. After this you create your first world, and of course decide to enter it. You are spawned in a big, beautiful world in which you are free to gather materials, craft foundations and terraform the environment. You also have magical spells to your abilities, including a self-heal. The most fun I had was with its terraforming, adding or removing things to and from the environment. If you have always wanted an unlimited supply of gold, this game's definitely for you. Try not to drown yourself in your newly created pool of water though (wish someone had told me beforehand).The game is in its alpha state, and you can definitely tell this by the amount of bugs. I also hope the developer will work on the user interaction portion of the game. Dear dev, the a and d keys are a lot more suited to be used as strafing keys - NOT as turning the camera around. Also I couldn't find an easy way to exit to the main menu, besides exiting the entire game. I also didn't see any cancel buttons within some of the menus, having to click on the appropriate menu button to close it again. The character and abilities screen have it, so why cant settings have one for example? The game definitely has potential, but it still needs - a lot - of tweaking. In its current state, I would rather call it pre-alpha. As you can see I gave this game a (barely) positive score, but please bear in mind that this is me taking its alpha state into heavy consideration. I even feel that calling it alpha is stretching it. I would only recommend a purchase if you are starving for a new sandbox game, or if you like to support the developer. The developer is involved within the community, something I applaud them for. This leads me to believe that they will do their best to improve the game to the players liking. Rating: 5.5/10 Pros:  Developer seems dedicated, I have high hopes this will not become another EA abandoned project. The environment of the game looks great. Offers both single-player and multiplayer, can carry your worlds over. Terraforming is awesome! Abilities hotbar.  Cons:  Lacking a tutorial, making it a lot more difficult for newcomers to understand and simply a strain. Audio (or lack thereof). There isn't much sound, something I feel that is essential in survival games. User interaction needs working on. Price point. At its current state I find it hard to recommend it for €15. Poor optimization. I understand the game requires a higher-end rig, but for what it offers I think this is an unreasonable request.

								This review was written based off gameplay in patch 0.4.2Astral Terra is a game that is very much in its infancy. It's probably too early for it to be sold to the public at the minute. I understand that Early Access is for games that are still developing, but I don't feel that this game is ready to demand a price tag at the moment. There's potential here, but a lot of optimisation and work needs to be done.There's a complete lack of tutorial. The game throws you in and expects you to know what you're doing. There is no way to change the key bindings at the moment. Once you have figured things out, everything in the game is a little awkward and clunky. The cursor needs to be placed exactly where the game wants it to be for something to work. This is especially frustrating when it comes to gathering materials and trying to pick them up. Everything must be clicked on individually, and sometimes you need to click outside of the texture of an item to pick it up. It leads to a lot of frustration and makes everything feel very slow and laboured. Even when terraforming, it can be difficult to get the game to do what you want it to do. The world looks really good for a game in this genre. The environment is vibrant and huge. However, the character models are of considerably lower quality than the rest of the game, they don't fit in. Movement also looks a little unnatural. Right now the game is essentially a creative environment and nothing more. There's no challenging enemies, just an empty world to explore. It would be acceptable for this to be a creative game if it wasn't so frustrating to play. When it feels like you're fighting the game just to be able to play it, it gets exhausting quickly.Astral Terra is not a bad game, it's just a frustrating experience right now. As the game evolves and is updated, hopefully it will become more intuitive to play and create a better experience for the user. I'll re-visit the game across it's life, and hopefully the potential will be achieved and I can change this review and recommend it. Right now, I can't justify telling anyone they should spend their money on it though.			"

Review Written on Thursday, May 19th, 2016 Review Astral Terra is a Indie Sandbox game, where you can build your construction and the world is randomly generated like Minecraft. It has crafting and building while it also mixes this with an RPG aspect (combat and survival). The world of Astral Terra looks great. As you play, you explore the world, while also building and destroying everything. The game has single player and multiplayer, which you can use your own created world for mulitplayer. This Game shows a lot of promise, but it is still in Early Access / Alpha and the dev is giving the game some attention by giving timely updates. It looks very promising and I look forward to the game when it finally comes out of Early Access! Rating: 6.5/10 Pros:  The gameplay and environment looks great. It is easy to understand. The Dev is very proactive with fixing the bugs in the game. Excellent replay value.  Cons:  Crashes / Bugs. Lack of a tutorial. The controls could be better.

Review Written on Thursday, May 19th, 2016 Review Ok so Astral Terra is a sandbox survival game, so to start off i created my character which was pretty easy to use and then i created my world, Once loaded the game looks good and the detail as you look up at the sky and upper part of the tree is quite impressive compared to some of the other sandbox games that are similar to this, So i started to do some exploring and ended up doing alot of running around and basically terraforming EVERYTHING in sight which is pretty fun. I know this game is at the alpha stage but there has to be some objective or quest to keep me entertained or even wanting to keep playing as wandering around terraforming can only keep me going so long. The game has single player and multiplayer of which you can use your own created world for mulitplayer which is a great idea if you want to show friends something you have done in your own world and vice a versa. The game has a minimap which is awesome but not one thing was shown on it apart from direction. The game has a fully configured steam controller which made the game alot easier with the steam track pad. I have seen on some other reviews that you need a monster pc to run this but i disagree with that, my pc is or wasa  budget pc, paid about 550 GBP and i can run this on ultra and with no issuesOverall i feel this game has huge potential and i am honestly wishing the dev the best with it as it seems like he really cares about this game. It looks good and the the idea and concept of it all are great, but for me i need something to do more than just run aroundRating: 5/10 Pros:  Graphics are really good. Terraforming works really well. Steam controller works flawlessly, trackpad made it easier than using a keyboard and mouse Easy to move where you want, so if you need to get really high up, you can move yourself and no need to spend hours building or terraforming platforms. Active dev, has been 3 updates recently and they are very open to feedback and constructive criticism.  Cons:  No objective or quests No tutorial for the alsolute newbie on the game mechanics. There are still many bugs but the dev is sorting them out. The music in my own opinion started to get on my nerves abit, This should be varied with some other music. The game should not be early access just yet as i feel there is still a way to go before it should be sold as early access  Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor 32 TV   Headphones turtle beach px3   Keyboard logitech g15   Controller xbox wireless   Mouse logitech mx518   Microphone turtle beach px3   Motherboard gigabyte   CPU hex core 3.4 ghz   GPU radeon 7750 OC   RAM 16 gb   OS windows 10   HDD 1tb sata  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC "

Review Written on Sunday, May 15th, 2016 Review My review will take into account that this game is in ALPHA and therefore there are still lots of bugs to be dealt with and a lot of game features to be added. The good news is that if you are the sort of person that likes to make suggestions and see them implemented then this is a good game to choose. The developer is very approachable and adds regular updates of users suggestions to the game on a weekly basis. I wont lie to you. There are a lot of bugs and at the moment and there is not much to do apart from building objects, Terraforming and exploring the infinite world. The terraforming element to the game is interesting and has promise but I believe it is not yet stable in its current state and you will often find yourself stuck underground. The terraforming tool is a big colourful cube which appears in front of you and can be moved upwards and downwards and closer or farther away. It digs into the ground and you can form tunnels which go downwards as far as you like. When the tool is perfected I can see this being a great way of building tunnels and passageways underground. Currently I found the tool difficult to use accurately and that is something the devs will need to improve on to really make this game stand out. The building elements to the game are quite good as they stand and you can easily build structures to your heart's content. The game does include combat and magical spell elements but these are in early development and at the moment any creatures you encounter are easy targets. You can create your own worlds and name them and create passwords for your friends to join. I can see this game being a really good game in the future, it just depends whether you want to jump on board and ride the journey with them. Be warned that in this state you will be joining the fun right at the start and I imagine there's a long way to go so don't expect a finished game yet. In conclusion, I cant really recommend the game in its current form but it is in an ALPHA state so that is to be expected. Can I see promise in the game? Yes I can, and therefore I would recommend it to anyone who likes to get involved and make suggestions that if worthy will be implemented quickly. I guess this is why Steam releases games in ALPHA states so that users can mould the game and help develop it. I have seen first hand that my suggestions and my friends ideas were included in updates within the week so if this excites you then I would say go for it! Rating: 6.5/10 Pros:  Devs listen to your ideas and implement them quickly An infinite world for you to play around in and the terraforming tool could be very promising Multiplayer and single player modes included and you can create your own worlds which are password protected. Cons:  Lots and Lots of Bugs Not much to do at the moment  Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor LG IPS LED FLATRON IPS234   Headphones Turtle Beach Earforce X12   Keyboard Corsair Raptor K40   Controller Microsoft Xbox 360   Mouse Trust GXT 25   Microphone Turtle Beach Earforce X12   Motherboard ASRock Z97 Extreme 6   CPU QuadCore Intel Core i7-4790K 4400 MHz 44 x 100   GPU Gigabyte GeForce GTX 760   RAM 16MB   OS Windows 81   HDD Crucial M550 512GB SSD  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC "

Early Access Review
Please, keep in mind that this is only an opinion of mine and each of us has their own, unique, thoughts. The review describes my expression of the game and nothing more than that. This  particularly review holds more formal nature and form.May 20th, year 2016. The copy was obtained from Tethys Interactive LLC.To be honest, this is one of the most ambivalent reviews I am writing so far even though there aren't so many in general. If I were to describe the game in a catch-phrase it would probably sound like ""An all-round cake with superious taste ... which is yet to be cooked"". And that may somehow convey the first expression after you decide to give Astral Terra a try. Further saying, there are many things to be changed and some to be completely redone even before developers could move this project to ""road to release"". If you want to support AT and give it your own thoughts after playing, think twice. It is indeed mentioned that the game is currently being in Alpha (which I still can't really justify for an Early Access title as there should be some limit of ""done'ess"" to consider title be worthy of opening it to mass public). In my opinion, the present build would be much more welcomed as a closed Pre Alpha testing to a limited pool of enthusiasts.But enough with negatory grunt for now. As it was said earlier, Astral Terra has an immense potentional and headway (the main reason I decided to give it a thumbs up) and despite being quite a mess it slowly buy steadily progresses towards that kind of sandbox ""toy"" you wouldn't feel tedious to play with. There is already diverse arsenal of possibilities to try: for instance, you are able to terraform natural surroundings and create completely different biomes within others  (lets say a lovely oasis garden lying midst rough wilderness), give a try to building mass constructions of various form, nature or caliber in general. Also, you could rather devote yourself to grinding and combining elements to then act as blacksmith, carpenter or ""The Creator"" of some sort. There are three races in-game but naturally it doesn't matter which one you decide to choose as the changes in gameplay are non significant at all less said bring any influence. Techically, as you may have guessed yourself this title is far from anything certain. I first started playing Astral Terra when the team came up with a ""huge, epic update"" so I am hardly to imagine how it looked like before but even then I had to face several unpleasant issues distorting game experience quite significantly. Thus, I needed to relaunch it a few of times being unable to load the world/hero, I got stucked in the textures twice having to do the same RE thing. The most annoying thing though was constantly dissapearing cursor which was absolutely necessary to be on-screen for a building mode. Another point is a control scheme or just the character/interface controls in general: you can use the common A/D to turn the hero while Q/E only let you run obliquely in zig zags; meanwhile, right mouse button should be trapped to use as a regular camera view while just mouse is purposed for navigating through menus and building. This wholeness is rather peculiar in my opinion and could be replaced with easier and more user-friendly concept later. Not sure if it's worth of mentioning, but there is also an already dead multiplayer in the game too (couldn't load other player's online world, so can't speculate on that).What was enjoyable:   - Huge opportunities ... >Ability to terraform earth and add a plentiful amount of different elements (including water)Many materials and forms to create buildings with (still, they will likely have simplified form due to overall small scale and lack of complex structure)Presence of surprisingly advanced crafting system (weapons, misc and so on)Online mode (even so it's not working properly for me at least)A visible progress towards improving, seemingly active and mindful developers What proves lacking:   - > ... Within far crippling boundariesCountless small bugs in all aspects of the game to polish, overall feeling of colossal incompletess even for an ""Alpha"" version of the gameHunger system which proves absolutely out of the place at such early stage of development and seems hasslesome for playersThe patient RPG system is more likely dead than alive Poor animations while the surrondings seem staticHighly resourceful and ""system crushing"" in the current state, especially on GPU (for the sake of your mediocre PC's wellbeing, don't try to set everything on max and then create water)Cropped and lacking sounds effects_____________________________________________4 ""Oh stop rolling from me damn logs!"" out of 10 (which is still a positive mark, yes). Far from being far of finishing, fairly bum and incomplete in many ways sandbox voxel creation with a small hint of becoming worthy title to enjoy in the nearest future; 'le gachis de idees' if one can say.

DISCLAIMER: Tethys Interactive LLC has provided me a key to try out this game. My review, however, is not affected by this action and will rate this game accordingly.REVIEWThere are tons of survival games out there, and most of them offer the same content over and over again without any new features or changes at all. And given that statement, I believe Astral Terra has what it takes to stand out than the rest. Even though the game has been on development for quite some time, it still needs more polishing and probably more content. I could only suggest this game to those who are willing to help out the developers on finishing this one. They could really use some help from the community feedbacks. So if you’re not that type of person, I do suggest that you wishlist this game and maybe check it out again in a couple of months.PROSTerraforming – I think this is the selling point of this game, and one of the most uniquefeatures compared to the other survival games.Dedicated developers – I’ve checked the developer’s website and found out that this game was on Kickstarter and Steam Greenlight on 2013. And up until now, they try to update the game as constantly as possible. Not everyone has the patience to develop games that long.Gorgeous Graphics – With more than a decent rig and the highest quality settings possible, this game simply stands out than most of the survival games out there.RPG Elements – You can choose your race and your gender upon character creationand it all comes with different character spells and a levelling system.CONS Not User-Friendly – I had a hard time starting off to be honest, took me quite some time before I understand the mechanics of the game. I suggest you read some guides in-game or find a wiki on the internet. Lacks Customization – I’m aware that the gameplay does not revolve around the character customization. But the only options you get when creating a character is choosing a race and its gender. Low-end Rigs – If you can’t run this game and have a stable fps, I highly suggest that you look for different game instead. You’ll just be annoyed with the graphics and constant stutters. Not only that, but it also requires a DX 11 to run the game. "

DARKKi's Dark Star Reviews - Astral TerraAstral Terra is an fantasy themed RPG / Sandbox / Survival type game with procedurally generated worlds. One of the biggest selling points is fully terraformable land (via voxels). This game also looks good looking but requires more horsepower from your computer to run.Astral Terra has nice RPG and survival games like feel but the strongest point is the crafting and terraforming systems as you can literally shape the world around you.Rating and Should you buy this gameX.X/10First i have to say that this game is in pretty raw alpha state so it is not finished content wise and has many bugs so if you are looking for almost finished product it's not there yet. But this game seems to have great potential and updates have kept on coming in steady pace. That's why i did not give it an rating yet but I will be playing and adding to this review multiple times after this as the game matures and i can give and true and full review but if this sounds like the game that you would like and have good computer to run it i think you will like it. Pros:Good looking graphicsTerraforming, crafting, mining and crafting systems are really well donePromising features comingCons:Still at very rough alpha state so at this point game is not complete and has bugs (as for an early access title this is normal though)You need pretty fast computer for this one (optimizations will come in time of course)Hardware InformationHardwareTypeCPUAMD FX-8350 @ 4,7GHzGPUNvidia GeForce GTX 970 MSI Gaming 4GB Edition - OverclockedRAM16GB DDR3 1333MHz @ 1830HzControllerXbox One and Playstation 3 ContollersOSWindows 10 Pro 64bitVRNoneDisclaimer:Source of consideration: I got this game for review purposes but it does not influence my opinion "

								so this game has some potential. i dont think i can recommend it right now. my character kept getting stuck in harvesting mode, still no mouse view while roaming around without having to hold down right mouse button, you cant remap the keys, and you can terraform like a god when you should have to you earn that stuff. if you like the ""click on item to harvest or attack"" deal then you might like this game. the world is beautiful and the idea is great but still has a lot to get done.

								Groovey idea and solid base so far. Building and world editing is all fully functional, it could use some fine tuning though. Would like to see more character development options. Currently there are a handful of spells and weapons and attributes but they could certainly use a lot more and maybe a skill system for more diversity. I like the dwarves. =)			"

								This game is nothing like anything I've ever played before. It's gorgeous, and I could spend hours exploring the world and admiring just how aesthetically pleasing everything is. On top of that, being able to destroy or build the world in a way that fits your desires is both a lot of fun and meditative at the same time. Even though the game is in early access, it definitely has a lot of potential to go really far.			"

Review Written on Tuesday, May 17th, 2016ReviewSo first of, this is a Early Access game, in a Alpha state (in my opinion it can be considered to be in a Pre-Alpha for some more weeks, if the patches keep on coming) with the genre of Sandbox and Survival.When you start you get all the tools you need to gather resources, build a house, or a castle, or whatever you want, use your imagination. You can also use Terraforming to chape the world with your own hands, so, go build that underground city you always dreamed of.Yes, Early Access means some bugs, but every game has at least one, even the finished ones, so expect some on this one. But the Devs are pretty active, and many of the reported bugs are fixed in the following patch, so, the more feedback you give, better the game will turn out to be.P.S.: I have around more 15 hours of offline gameplay, mostly on singleplayer mode though.Rating:7.2/10Pros:Very active Devs, who listen for ideas/sugestions/bug reports, and more, and patch them, or implement them, as soon as possible.Terraforming, in other words, the ability to change the world around you, its a powerful tool at your disposalThe Map Seed, which means, each map has its own number, its Seed, and if you found a amazing world you can send the number to a friend for him to play in the same one (without your modifications to the same).Several classes to choose from, each one with his own backstory and lore.The art is amazing for a Early Access game, we can see that they gave much time in that area.Cons:The Tutorial. Or better yet, the lack of it, it may be a sandbox game, but we still need to learn how to play it.The controls either for construction and for movement, after a while you get a hang of them, but still hard to use them.This game requires a High-Spec computer, which means, a lot of people wont be able to enjoy it with maximum fps.Its a Alpha(Early Access) game, but in my opinion, its still on a pre-alpha level, but with the help and feedback from the community, soon enough will be a Alpha level game.In my opinion, the game is a bit overpriced, i see this as a 10/15 game max, so the 20+- pricetag i think its a big push.Hardware InformationHardwareTypeMonitor1366x768HeadphonesOzone Rage STKeyboard- LaptopController-MouseE-Blue AurozaMicrophoneOzone Rage ST MicrophoneMotherboardMotherboardCPUIntel Core i5-3210M 250GHzGPUNVIDIA GeForce GT 620MRAM6GbOSWindows 7HDD750GbDisclaimer:Source of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC "

Review Written on Monday, July 11th, 2016 Review Astral Terra is another entry into the openworld sandbox crafting/gathering game with some light rpg elements. It can be played solo or multiplayer. I only played solo. The worlds are procedurally generated and can contain some very interesting landscapes. The rocks, trees, plants and animals that populate the landscape are impressive graphically. Most of the cons listed below will hopefully be cleaned up yet in this Alpha stage. I would urge only people prepared to accept an alpha game for what it is to purchase it at this time. However it wouldnt take very long to get your $15 out of it if you enjoy exploring a new fantasy world. Rating: 6.0/10 Pros:  The procedurally generated biomes had the potential to make some very fantastic worlds that were fun and interesting to explore. The building is a little clunky right now but I like what I see and hope to see more options in the future. It looks like you can probably create some impressive builds. The one piece of music was very pleasing and I quite liked it the first 50 times I heard it, after that I was really wishing there were additional songs. Fun and unique spells and abilities for your character to play around with. The races you can play are very neat looking and I liked the lore on the character creation screen.  Cons:  Character control feels off. I found it extremely frustrating. The animations are hopefully just a work in progress as the running and turning animations made it feel like I was skating around the terrain. The movement speed seemed very slow and made exploration tedious. Gathering is a pain, after equipping the correct tool for the job holding down the mouse button just gathers 1 drops worth then you have to click and hold down again. That combined with needing to click every individual drop that flies off the rock or tree or whatever. Very tedious and unfun. Crafting interface was also a pain, its just a long list of what you can craft in no apparent order and no easy way to see what items I currently had the materials on me to craft. Inventory is very small, just wandering a bit hitting a rock or a tree here and there and being told my inventory was full all the time was not enjoyable. I can raise and lower the very earth but I cannot carry more than 18 items. I did eventually find a merchant and bought a chest that holds 21 items. But there didnt seem to be a backpack or anything to expand my personal inventory. I like to wander like a nomad when I play these kind of games but the inventory made it very limited. No character customization at this time. Hopefully this gets added.

								Wow, amazing, I can't wait to see what the developer will do next. ... Because they cannot possibly do worse than what they've already done. I never thought I'd be saying this but (and I do believe Jim Sterling would agree with me on this) ... I would actually rather play a game by Digital Homicide than to play this ♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Astral Terra makes Forsaken Uprising look like a limitless budget, AAA title by Hideo Kojima, starring Brad Pitt. WARNING: DO NOT ♥♥♥♥ING BUY THIS GAME! If you already made the terrible choice of buying this ""game,"" try to get a refund immediately. I thought the fluid simulation would be worth it, if you get the game, you will see that it is not (not that the fluid simulation itself doesn't function, it does even with minimum specs) ... if you can even get your ugly character to stop floating under the terrain to use its ridiculously clunky, non-standard controls in order to navigate to or create a water source, ... just before it crashes. Astral Terra could be thee single worst thing that mankind has ever produced, it had me looking for the ""HELL NO"" buttons under the question ""Do you recommend this game?"" but there wasn't one, there was only ""No."" with the closest available finger to what the game actually deserves being but a mere thumbs down instead of what I wanted to rate it.https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGame/?appid=266190 "

Review Written on Saturday, May 14th, 2016 Review This Game shows a lot of promise, definitely a traditional RPG, Smooth voxel world that is completely editable.Even though the game is in early access,it definitely has a lot of potential to go really far.Great concept, you are able to explore the game (world) and do as you please with it (Destory)/(Create) is great.The building system is different which is good.The dev's do work on the game quite frequently which is great espeically when it comes to early access games such as this one.Astral Terra is constantly getting better.Rating: 6/10 Pros:  Survival. i love survival games most are my favorites. Building. building has always been a huge deal to me when it comes to games.Terraforming.- Who doesn't want this option in every game out there? Active dev team.-every game needs this :[  RPG elements. Cons:  (Controls)-It took a little bit of time to figuring out the controls.

Terraforming and exploring an infinite world Alpha StageThis game is still in an early alpha stage, if you are not ready to face some bugs and crashes be careful, you are warned! A lot of features are still to be expected for the game and the developpers are really listening to the community, so if you have great suggestions they are likely to implement them into the game!About the gameAstral Terra is a procedurally generated sandbox RPG game, really similar to minecraft, but heavier on the RPG side. You will find all the elements that you love in those 2 genres: crafting and building while developping your character, earning new levels and spells. Why is this game unique? The terraforming! This game let's you shape the world in an organic way, you can create mountains, islands, caves, anything you can think of in a simple way. You don't have to spend hours gathering and dropping the blocks 1 by 1.Pros:  Beautiful Art Open world with terraforming, shape it the way you wantMultiple races to choose fromHuge replay valueRegular Updates and developers that listen to the community Cons:  A lot of bugs and crashesRequires a high-end computerControlsThe lack of tutorial The music Rating: Overall I would give this game an 7 out of 10 in it's current state. Astral Terra has a lot of potential, the art is beautiful and the terraforming mechanic truly makes this game unique.It really feels like Morrowind meets Minecraft. However, if you are not ready to face tons of bugs, wait until the release of the game to play it!Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC. "

Review Written on Monday, May 30th, 2016 Review Astral Terra is a RPG/sandbox hybrid, drawing from games such as Minecraft and including classic RPG elements such as leveling, character races and customisation, and spell learning/casting. Visually impressive, a move away from many other crafting/sandbox titles, Astral Terra features fantastic procedurally generated environments - which can be changed and morphed using one of the main gameplay mechanics - terraforming. This brings a unique gameplay style to the game, setting it apart from other sandbox and RPG titles. The game is still fairly early in development, but seemingly has a lot of potential. While the £11 price tag my be steep for the game in it's current state - the price tag would be about right for a fully fledged game. The development team seem to be actively listening to community feedback and implementing changes frequently. Definitly one to watch.Rating: 7.0/10 Pros:  Huge unique environments Fantastic visuals Active developers making changes based on community input Great potential for unique gameplay experience  Cons:  Difficult to start - controls and tricky, and no tutorial Quite a way to go to become a completed product (Early Access review) Resource collection can be a tiresome grind  Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor BenQ GW2760 1920x1080   Headphones Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930   Keyboard Gamdias HERMES Lite Mechanical Keyboard   Controller Xbox 360 Controller for Windows   Mouse Sharkoon Fireglider   Microphone Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930   Motherboard msi sli x99 plus   CPU Intel i7 5820k   GPU GeForce GTX 980   RAM 16GB   OS Windows 7   HDD 256GB SSD + 2 x 1TB HDD + 1 x 8TB NAS  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC "

Early Access Review
								This game starts out with some very fine graphics, though, that may be where all of the good things end. The controls for this game, especially in reguards to creation/editing are very much a pain to mess with. It seems more like the creator of this game decided to let the players have a go at the actual game engine/creation mechanics, instead of actually finishing the game and all of it's mechanics. The basic crafting seems to be difficult to get a handle on, to the point that there are no real tutorials in game or explination of how to do anything. It's basically trial and error. The combat system is juvinile at best, with the favor being in the enemies hands it seems. I can recall old 80's nes games which had a more advanced and balanced combat system over this one's pick something and hope it fires/works/or even selects during combat. Building buildings, I can't say much about this since I coudl only ever manage to get some corners made and even then it was increasingly difficult to place/stack them. The construction system of this game is. . .for lack of better words, crap. The creation menu, well, if I wanted to build a game world from scratch and were using a game editor interface then this would be fine. But, I doubt anyone enters into a game/game world and expects to have to actually make roads, cities, etc all on their own because the creators didn't take the time to set anything up. The conversation/store/npc system is. . .severely lacking. You can't tell friend from foe, and typically when trying to talk to an npc you simply just swing at them. As for money, well, no idea how you come across that. So, buying the over priced things at the one or two npc's I managed to find were impossible. They would sell you things but would buy nothing, so, you can get the idea out of your head that there is any real economy with in this game. Movement and navigation is choppy at best, controls aren't set up for any sort of easy navigation, and camera views are more of a pain to adjust than moving.			"

Review Written on Tuesday, May 10th, 2016 Review Note that this game is very early access. Astral Terra is another sandbox RPG ""build em up"" game based in a procedurally generated world. It has crafting, building, farming, combat and just a hint of survival elements wrapped up with some basic character progression. There are currently three races to choose from, though I think the differences are purely aesthetic. I would recommend this game to people that want to support the devs, or love a good sandbox.Rating: 5.0/10 Pros:  Survival - I cant help but enjoy it. Building - Many shapes and pieces to use, no doubt many more are coming. Terraforming - This one is an interesting addition. Don't like the look of the landscape around your house? Change it! Chickens - They explode when you punch them!   Cons:  Controls - They are seriously bad, I will not be surprised if they are redone. Music - Only one short track that repeats and is a little bit annoying. Animations - Some are a bit dodgy, but forgivable.

								I'm not gonna lie, the game is rough right now. But like a precious jewel, it will take time to cut out the things that don't work, smooth away the rough edges, and polish it until it shines and becomes the brilliant game it was meant to be.The Devs have been very active with the community and have been open to both the constructive positive and negative feedback given. The worlds are unique to the seed you use to make them, beautiful to look at, and fun to explore. If you're willing to be patent and  want to help shape the game, then now it the time to jump on board and help the devs and the community to make this game the gem it's meant to be. If you'd rather wait and see, then by all means do so and when it's finally finished you can enjoy it in all it's glory.Edit: Jan 29, 2016: Since I posted this review the Devs have been hard at work fixing issues and bugs that pop up in EA games. They have also added refinements to the controls as well as the world in general. The most current update on the way will be adding a new biome as well as increasing general look of the world. While the game is still rough, it's improved by leaps and bounds over the past few months and the Devs have shown great honestly and hard work in making this game.			"

								Completely unplayable!1st Game :My cursor was locked to a small area of the character creation screen. I couldn't click on  anything and had to kill the game in Task Manager.2nd Game:Got past the character creation, but game locked up on loading. Had to kill it in TM again.4th, 5th, 6th, 7th games:Spawned below the earth each time, couldn't move, couldn't do anything, but fall. Even though I was in window mode, cursor was locked to screen. Hit crtl-esc, tried to close the window, cursor got locked back to screen again. Had to kill it in TM.Also each time I went back into the game , I had to redo my settings, since nothing got saved.9th Game:Took atleast 5 minutes to create the world. Once again I spawned under the world and couldn't do anything. Also learned that once you pull up the help menu you can't close it, and then you can't do anything but exit out of the game.10th game:Same problem as 1st game.11th game:Was able to play, but no sound. Was unable to havest any resources what so ever.Gave up at this point and requested a refundThis game is way too EA to even be on Steam! It's just unplayable.Added Note:You're selling your game here on Steam. Therefore you get rated on how it currently is, not how you think it will be.Update: I was happy to get this game refunded. I had a lot of gammer mistakes, I was extremely annoyed at buying this game and finding it in this sorry state. Also removed my foul language.			"

Early Access Review
Astral Terra is a sandbox game with a hint of an RPG flavour, the game's environment is quite rich and beautiful, unfortunately that is contrasted by somewhat ugly characters and an incomplete game play experience. Astral Terra has a lot of potential as a sandbox game, at this stage it is incomplete, but already the construction choices in the game are numerous and varied. It takes a few moments to get used to the camera in the game, but once the player has a handle on it allows for easy access to all sides and angles of any construction, no matter the size.One of my favourite mechanics in the game, and possibly the one mechanic that allows it to stand out from most other survival/sandbox games is the terra forming mechanic. Terra forming allows the players to manipulate the environment around them to a degree most other games in this genre do not allow. They can create caves, lakes, beaches any geographic object they want, so the game in not limited to creating man-made structures.The combat that I've seen in the game so far has been responsive, but somewhat wonky. In fact some interactions in general are a little frustrating because hit boxes seem to not be exactly where we see them in the game. So very often I'd be trying to pick an item up, and I think I'm pointing at it, but the game does not recognize that I am. So it takes a couple of tries to find where I need to click; and while I'm on that subject, the player needs to be close enough to the item to pick up or the game will say ""Not close enough"" - forgive me for being simple, but why not just walk to an item I've clicked on if my character isn't close enough?The spacial rendering of the environment and the constructions in the game is really good as I've mentioned, so exploring mines and structures is rather enjoyable, and the details are quite nice. But it comes at a price; the game requires a G-card that can support DirectX 11 as a minimum requirement. Although the game will run on DirectX 9 it won't be running very smoothly and will need better hardware to show it's real potential. That limits the number of people who can run the game.Pros:Rich and beautiful environmentTerra Forming is a uniquely powerful mechanicFlexible camera and point of viewLarge choice of materials available for creativity Cons:Wonky combat, odd hitboxesAbove average hardware requirementsUgly characters and limited sound track that clash with the beautiful environmentThe game is incomplete and has a number of small bugs and glitches and missing content (the usual things that come with an alpha or a beta game)Utimately I think this game has a lot of potential, and I really hope it achieves it. At this point the game is incomplete and I cannot really recommend it. I am looking forward to where the developers will take it in the future. But for now my score for the game is 6/10 - incompleteSource of consideration: Tethys Interactive  "

								    Astral Terra is a refreshing take on your traditional RPG, with the ability to build structures and edit the world around you. Over the past few years I have watched Tethys Interactive and Astral Terra progress from nothing to a now greenlit and relatively smooth Early Access title. I am thrilled to finally participate in the alpha stages of the game and do my part to weed out bugs and give constructive criticism, and I can confidently say I expect tons of updates in the near future, they have come this far and are determined to make a quality game.    My personal favorite thing about this title so far is the ""terraform"" terrain editor; the controls can be slightly confusing at first, but with a few minutes of practice it is easy to get down. Terrain editing is fairly unique in Astral Terra, seeing as you can edit the world with your character in third person or if you choose, you can go free cam an float around to edit the terrain. This mechanic makes building and terrain editing quick and rewarding, in the first 30 minutes of gameplay I was able to dig myself a cave, add multiple rooms and changed the wall pattern, making a nice little shelter to call home.  Astral terra has come a long way since I first heard of its development, and I am looking forward to playing this title with friends, survivng the night and building towns, just like the old minecraft days.    As with any Eearly Access title, Astral Terra does have a fair ammount of bugs to be worked out (it is in Alpha, after all... cut them some slack) but do not let this detour you from getting a copy, Tethys is hard at work fixing bugs and patching errors that players are quickly discovering. For anyone who thinks they would enjoy this type of game, who understands the pros and cons of purchasing an early access title and wish to further help Tethys with their development of Astral Terra, I DEFFINITELY reccomend picking up a copy when possible.

Early Access Review
								Brand new Early Access Survival/Craft/Build/RPG style game. I find it rather refreshing the concept of Astral Terra, Being its brand new onto EA and I am only just starting to put time into the game. I will just say that the Dev Team are very vigiliant on the forums and take notice of posts and ideas, this is what makes a good Indie Team and a great game. So I will be following Astral Terra along its journey of EA to release in the future.As updates come and features are added will post new thoughts about the game. Currently, if you like supporting good Indie Dev Teams, I feel you can not go wrong with this Team and their game, its very promising and they seem to be a very dedicated to the game and community.

Review Written on Tuesday, May 17th, 2016 Review This is a decent sandbox game that resembles Minecraft and Elder Scrolls sort of. The game allows terraform which I think is cool at first, but this game feels kinda like a pre-alpha. The crafting system is cool and kinda feels like the game Grav with the farming for materials aspect. The graphics look decent considering that this game is an alpha. The artwork and animation look decent enough as well. Hopefully the finished product will produce more detail in the characters and background. The multiplayer didnt work for me. I guess its still being finalized for the complete version. There are several bugs that did require me to restart my game a few times. My controls got stuck and I was stuck in a ditch i dug on my own lol. Being that this is a sandbox game I hope the final product finishes the bugs along with the multiplayer to see how well this game runs with multiple people in one server. The possibilities can be endless. So only time will tell. The price range is a bit high in these early stages, but I do hope that the finish product does make it worth while. Rating: 6.0/10 Pros:  Decent graphics makes it easy on the eyes Crafting and farming for materials Added RPG elements to make it lasting More unique take on the minecraft aspect Please fill out all 5 pros.  Cons:  Clunky Controls made me restart the game Repetitive music makes me go crazy add some more lol Multiplayer doesnt work for now... Buggy game with hopefully patches to follow Please fill out all 5 cons.

								Just started playing Astral Terra and I can't stop! This is a perfect game for someone like me. Most of the fun, so far, has come from the discovery and exploration aspect of the game. With that said, I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface yet and that excites me! I can't wait to continue exploring and learning...I highly recommend this game!*Note - I found the ""Getting Started"" post under the ""Guide Tab"" to be a huge help. It has been a life saver for me as I'm exploring!			"

								It's not like I don't see what you're going for, but... this just isn't ready for Prime Time, if you get my meaning. I'm all for indie developers putting their stuff out into the world, but you guys may have bitten off a bit more than you can chew.The controls are just... bad. Slow, confusing, and poorly designed - they need optimization, as does the rest of the game. I mean, you have to go back into your inventory to reassign a tool to a hotkey after you use it? Are you... are you serious with that? The visuals are early 2000s, which is fine, you know, whatever... Minecraft and Shovel Knight have primitive looking visuals, and are both fun and charming. This is... neither. The cahracters look straight out of Asheron's Call, and that's not a compliment. Visual design needs either a proper cohesive theme, or it needs a complete redesign - either way, I'm on board.That's the thing with Astral Terra - I can see what the devs are shooting for, and the view is pretty neat... but there's just not enough here yet.And, yeah - I know I only have a few minutes in game. It doesn't take very long to get turned off by poorly done controls and stale visuals. I'm still reccomending this one, though, because I think it might be really neat... someday. Just not today.

Early Access Review
Review Written on Sunday, May 15th, 2016 Review Astral Terra is yet another open sandbox game that has been released on steam, however it differs from the standard Minecraft clone by offering advanced graphics for a powerful PC and RPG elements such as classes, skills, and combat mechanics. Due to the game being in early access at the time of this review, the content available is minimal and only stands as a representative sample of the final product. Before talking about the game, I would like to say that the developers have managed to patch all bugs that I have encountered before writing this review and that the Early Access tag does not imply that the game is broken, but rather underdeveloped in content. The current version of the game (0.4.2) offers the player a building/terraforming tool, an inventory, a crafting system, map, and class-specific character skills. I found the building tool to be overwhelming, and as a result I never used it aside from testing the feature and getting frustrated with its highly sensitive reading of the mouse. Maybe if the game had a tutorial or allowed the player to gain for building structures I would have found myself more inclined to use it, instead I just found myself thinking of Minecraft or even Fortress craft which feels much easier to use. The RPG elements of the game such as skills and combat are the defining features of this game among the other sandbox games offered on steam, but unfortunately these elements are absolutely useless in single player. Maybe PVP or aggressive mobs such as bosses will be available in future patches, but if so, your better off playing an MMO where you can take advantage of these elements in their proper environment. I should also mention that the game looks fantastic and it might be the strongest factor that this game has over its competitors. Unfortunately, better graphics results in a smaller amount of people able to play the game, and due to the game crashing after my graphics card updated, I dont see Astral Terra becoming nearly as populated as other sandbox games in the future. Overall, I think that Astral Terra is going through an identity crisis. While I acknowledge that the game is in early access and is not a finished product, I fail to see the target audience for this type of game. Those who want to build will simply go to games that provide established building mechanics, while fans of the combat and RPG elements will be better off playing MMOs where raids are plentiful, and classes + skills are more elaborated. For those who might fall into the middle of these two worlds, then maybe Astral Terra will be for you, but only if the other sandbox games such as RUST, DayZ, and H1N1 fail you entertain you. Rating: 5.8/10 Pros:  Has enhanced graphics when compared to other sandbox games, looking very nice. Has crafting, building, and unique character classes and skills.  Cons:  Higher required specs which limits the amount of people that can run this game compared to other sandbox games. Currently in Early Access, meaning that content is limited  Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor PhilipsTrueColor3000TV   Headphones GradoSi80   Keyboard MicrosoftBasicKeyboard10A   Controller SteamController   Mouse RazerNaga2014   Microphone cheapbrandNA   Motherboard Motherboard   CPU AMDFX4170Quad-CoreProcessor420GHz   GPU GeForceGTX560SE   RAM 4GBx2CorsairVengence   OS Windows7SP1   HDD SeagateBarracudaST1000DM0031TB7200RPM   "

Review Written on Tuesday, May 10th, 2016 Review Maybe it is my fault for expecting a different kind of game (with more survival elements), but I couldnt enjoy Astral Terra. The game feels very rough and unpolished. As of right now, I couldnt find much to do. I tried building a home, a cave, etc. but I found the controls and layout rather hard to follow, which made these tasks feel more like a chore than a way of having fun. Im afraid I cant recommend this game as of May 2016. It is true, however, that there are some positive and promising things about the game, like being able to select different characters, playing online, the music (or song, because everytime I started playing I could only hear the same one) and specially the way the devs are updating their game regularly, being true to their supporters. Because of this attitude, I will make sure to come back and check the game regularly, hopefully changing my recommendation to positive in the near future. Rating: 3.0/10 Pros:  Interesting concept Devs update the game regularly Being able to choose between different characters  Cons:  Very early state and already on steam for 20€* Not really much to do as of right nowThe UI is hard to use Feels more like a level editor than a game I also included ""Having to sign up for a new account using our email address"" as a negative aspect, but it was changed recently in the last update. That is great and it shows how the developers are truly listening and updating their creation. I encourage others to try the game for themselves. They might actually like it and decide to invest in this project of a game, but I would be lying if I said I could recommend it to anyone as of right now.*Early Access is fine as long as the game is somewhat fun. Otherwise, it's like having to pay (instead of being paid) just to work as a tester. Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC "

								Jan 12 2016Very, very early state of game. It has potential to be interesting. Don't expect a ""Professional"" product, it is very much 'I made this'. But that may change as the game evolves.Although it has 'single player' mode, you do have to create an account, then login to their online server & then you can create your own personal 'room' with a passwordStill needs a lot of work, but it is playable (as in you can do stuff)The only reason I stopped exploring the game after about 30 minutes was due to motion sickness caused by the game. Not quite sure what it is causing it, but I can't play with the game in the state it is in.I like supporting Dev teams as they create their dream, it's something not everyone can do.Can I recommend it? Not really unless you wan to support development. Maybe Wait and see how it develops in the future.			"

								No - Not In it's current State; still has potential.Pros: +It's a survival-type game with a few twists on the usual idea of ""survival"" +You can relocate land fairly easily in this game. +It's Early Access - So Everything is subject to change.Cons: -Although it's easy to relocate landmass - controlling that relocation is very difficult. -The Control Scheme Feels weird - with menu's in places you wouldn't expect. (This is mostly personal opinion but I'm stating it anyway) -Alot of the skills were placeholders at the time I last played the game (a few months i think) -Was very incomplete (non-existant) from a storyline perspective. -The Building System is very difficult to control - imo, this could be improved upon by standardizing the build controls to industry standard (ie pgup/pgdwn/home/ins/del to rotate +/- to change level etc)			"

								Garbage. Dont fall for it. This games development has been at a crawl for a really long time (way longer than its been on steam), and the ""game"" itself is little more than proof of concept or a tech demo. Considering that the game is never going to get done is it REALLY worth more than 2-3$? NO (look at my library.. i know more than a thing or two about early access). As for the experience itself, expect 2 min. of confusion followed by about 5 min. of exploration and then the rest of your life to be bored.Also the devs are censorship gung-ho, which is always fun to deal with.. and they send emails like this to you:""Greetings Founders! We have released today on Steam Early Access and could use your reviews if you have had a positive experience you would be willing to share.  Because of your support over the past year, we are able to release on Steam today.  Thank you sooo very much for being a part of the Astral Terra community and supporting us along the way! We have made countless improvements based on your feedback!"" The glaring part is ""could use your reviews IF you have had a positive experience you would be willing to share"", so essentially ""if its not positive just stfu"".

								Jury is still out. Hard to place blocks in its current state but you can build right away.  Doesnt seem to be any requirement for ingredients yet.  The blocks all look really nice.One bad thing is that you can't take a screenshot by pushing F12 and post it to your steam account.  Makes it kinda hard to show off what you built to your friends.Otherwise it seems to still be in alpha stage.  It crashes frequently.I built a pond with the terra forming tools, it was pretty cool.

								It's pretty darn rough around the edges right now, but with a lot of work and polish, I'm sure it'll gather an impressively large fanbase. Granted, it's an alpha right now, so there's going to be some things about the game that needs to change.My suggestions would be... Fullscreen Windowed option. Most games have it, and it'd be an utter shame if this game didn't. Trust me, your players will love you for the option! (It's always the first thing I look for to make sure it's on.) Cancel button on Settings Configuration, just in case we screwed something up and don't want to face the ultimatum of ""Quit Game"" or ""Apply"". Camera speed option, and perhaps an option to keep it regulated so that it doesn't start off as a slow crawl to a sudden lurching, motion-sickness inducing whizzing across the screen, haha. Hotkey reconfiguration. This is important in that it allows for players to fall into hotkeys and habits they're familiar and comfortable with. Most importantly, it allows for players who are brand new to the game to peruse the hotkeys and see what the default hotkeys are in game. (For example, I never would have guessed that Q, normally a Strafe Left movement button would be the Descend function.) Allow for players to zoom out of first person if they so wish in Build Mode. Being forced to first person is very disorienting and doesn't allow for the player to gage scaling. Allow players to adjust volume of various things, not just master volume. I must shamefully admit I'm not a fan of the music, but I'd still want to hear the environmental sounds; there's no option for this, however. It's all or nothing right now. Similarly, breaking down the settings to multiple categories would be advised for organizational purposes. Speed up the scrolling speed of Build Mode's texture selection. I'm not sure if the developers have tested this particular function, but it's ridiculously slow, borderline frustrating. Have the movement keys (WASD) move the camera as well. Having to hold down the right mouse button to figure out we're unintentionally running our character's off a cliff isn't a good thing! Character customization! Is there any at the character creation screen? I'm not too certain, but I believe not. It's a little disheartening, but I assume this will become a later feature. If there is indeed character customization in this build, it's very well hidden. Have Stamina be a bit more reasonable. Within four minutes of standing around figuring out controls and settings, my Stamina was entirely depleted. Seems rather silly having it go away so soon, perhaps extend it to over the course of an hour? I'm not certain what purpose it holds, but if its anything important, this game would be unplayable. Warning before deleting/throwing away objects by dragging off the window. Hooo boy.That's all I can think of off the top of my head. Looking back on it, wow I piled 'em up. Keep up the fantastic work. I might update this later with more suggestions, but these are the most prominent that surface to mind. Unfortunately, as of this review's current state (November 2016) I would not recommend this game until all of these factors have been improved upon.			"
